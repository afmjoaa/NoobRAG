Title: Left-Brain/Right-Brain Functions
Preview: We have two eyes, two ears, two hands, and two minds. Our left brain thinks in terms of words and symbols while our right brain thinks in terms of images. The left side is the side used more by writiers, mathematicians, and scientists; the right side by artists, craftspeople, and musicians. Remembering a persons name is a function of the left-brain memory while rembering their face is a function .......

It sounds like a really bad horror movie, doesn’t it? While this creature has an ordinary brain inside its skull, it also has a second much smaller, but still fully functioning brain squishing around inside its belly. While the skull-brain thinks, and controls the body, and goes about its brainy business, the gut-brain also thinks, and processes information, and exerts control over the body too. It would probably make a pretty cheesy horror movie, but the thing is, it’s true. In fact, that creature with the extra brain is you.
We’re talking about what scientists call the enteric nervous system, and all vertebrates have one, including humans. This is a collection of about a hundred million nerve cells that are wrapped around your stomach, esophagus, and intestines. While this second brain is not nearly as complex as the brain in your head, it does have its own motor and sensory neurons, and it uses many of the same brain chemicals and neurotransmitters. It even grows from the same part of the embryo that your other brain grows from.
What does this second brain do? Mostly, it coordinates the chemical and muscular activity of digestion, a process that’s actually quite complicated. It also responds to messages from your other brain, especially messages about fear or danger. If you get a stomach ache or diarrhea because of stress or fear, it’s this second brain that coordinates that.
So, the next time you put on your thinking cap, remember to put on a thinking sweater as well!

I consider my Second Brain to be my Second Brain it’s for me it’s not for other people and so to the extent that you’ll be sharing with people outside of you that’s probably not where I’m going to go, if I choose to share from my Second Brain it’s going to be the in the context of what I plan to share so it might be a blog post it’s made out of something that I kept in my Second Brain or a tweet or an article or a book that I’m writing, it might be a collection of links that I choose to share but it won’t be giving someone access necessarily but let’s hold that thought because I can think of some things using Notion that I might want to do something like that in. But I’m not going to share individual pieces of my Second Brain with other people. Now the sharing between parts of yourself and that’s kind of more of an internal sharing is what you’re talking about, I have a different way of thinking about that and we can talk about that more in just a little bit but I’m curious because it feels to me like the reason why you’re approaching it the way that you are with so many different contexts in which you might share it’s because you’re defining your Second Brain to include literally everything you have or ever had, every document article anything possible that’s out there and my Second Brain isn’t going to be built that way because it’s going to be more like the people who talk about building a Second Brain are, it’s things that resonate with you that you are going to keep for a specific reason that you have down the road not just the “you never know when I might need this” type thing.
