{"question":"How did JAM handle voice recording in different languages, and what are the key challenges in localizing voiceovers across languages?","answer":"JAM handled foreign language recordings through different approaches - for French recordings, they flew to Montreal and worked with native French-Canadian session singers, though this took much longer than English sessions (12 hours vs 3 hours for similar content). They also managed to record in Spanish and other languages through phonetic coaching. As for localization challenges, a key issue is that many languages are significantly longer than English - German is about 30% longer and Russian about 40% longer. This requires leaving adequate space in the original voiceover to accommodate longer translations. Additionally, the timing and pacing need to be carefully managed to allow translated speech to fit naturally within the allotted time without rushing. Working with native translators is considered optimal for achieving natural-sounding localized voiceovers.","context":["This page is for JAM fans. The ones who have heard all of the demos, and\nhave enjoyed jingles for years. Since we began, JAM has kept a\ncopy of every one of the well over 21,000 jingle projects we've done. Our vault\ncontains shelf after shelf of tapes, DATs and CDs, spanning the last 35+ years of\nbroadcasting and advertising history.\nAmong the thousands of hours of audio that this collection represents, there are many\ninteresting items that are not on any of our demos or CDs. They might be unusual\nversions of syndicated cuts, cool custom projects, or just moments of JAM history that we\nenjoy hearing now and then. As we run across these goodies we will share them, and\nthe stories behind them, here. This collection is for fun. We hope you enjoy it.\nIn 1979 we were asked to do a custom jingle package for WYNY New York. The station wanted to appeal\nto young adults with a blend of information and contemporary music. They knew that their jingles should reflect\nthe fast pace and exciting feel of life in New York. Before we started, we created two audition cuts.\nAfter hearing them, the station decided to back away from the disco beat a little and go with a more\nmainstream contemporary sound. The result was the \"New York 97\" package. But here are the auditions.\nThe first track has only been used for one other client (BBC Radio 1 in the UK). The second track became part\nof our WLS package \"Dance To The Music\". But you can hear how the lyric content sparked the\nidea for the 3-minute long \"New York 97 Song\" that we later produced.\nThe \"I'd Rather Be In Denver\" package, originally created for Loren Owens at KIMN, was used in\nover 60 markets large and small. The lyrics would be customized for each station, to help tap into each city's\nlocal pride. In May 1979 we produced the package for Jim Taber at KKOL El Paso, Texas. (They dropped the\nfirst K and called the station KOL or Kool.) We always enjoy creative lyrics, and these are certainly\nunusual. Add to that an uncommon logo melody and a slightly different mix of singers, and you have a\ncollector's item. Here are excerpts from the package and parts of the promo songs. All you have to know\nabout El Paso to appreciate this is that it can get very hot, and very windy!\nBetween the years 1978 and 1987, JAM created hundreds of radio commercials for the United States Air Force.\nThese public service announcements and paid spots were heard across the nation, and included recruiting\ninformation as well as general image support messages. Working directly with the Air Force, JAM wrote the copy,\ncast the voice-over talent, and did all the recording and production. Not every spot required music, but when it\ndid we would create a custom jingle. One of the earliest was this one recorded in March 1979, when we wrote\nthe line \"Get Your Future Off The Ground\" to supplement the Air Force's then-current slogan \"A\nGreat Way of Life\". (This was recorded in the same session as the WNDE \"Windy Songs\".)\n1979 IBA award winner in the \"Radio Public Service\" category.\n1980 Clio Awards finalist in the \"Recruitment\" category.\nWords and music by J. Wolfert.\nIn 1979, forty years after it was first written, the song \"Off We Go Into The Wild Blue Yonder\" was\nadopted as the official song of the U.S. Air Force. (You can read the interesting history of this\nsong here.) As a result, JAM was asked to\nproduce arrangments of this song in every possible musical style. For those not familiar with the song, start\nby listening to this traditional orchestral treatment produced by JAM in October 1981. It uses the original\nlyrics (except for the next-to-last line which was intentionally omitted). You may begin to appreciate the\ncreative challenge involved in making more contemporary versions, examples of which appear below.\nMost of the Air Force spots we created did not need a bombastic musical arrangement. For example, spots about\ncareers in nursing, or messages expressing thanks to veterans and those in the service, often needed a gentler\ntouch. This unlikely bossa nova version of \"Wild Blue Yonder\" is one of our favorites. It was produced\nby JAM in October 1980.\n1981 Clio Awards finalist in the \"New Arrangements of Commercial Themes\" category.\nArr. by C. Kershaw.\nAir Force recruiting spots were targeted to high school and college students, their parents, and even\ngrandparents. As a result, JAM created nearly 100 arrangements of \"Wild Blue Yonder\" in every style you\ncan imagine. On a few occasions we even wrote new lyrics for the song, incorporating the Air Force's slogan\n\"Aim High\". Of course, most of these jingles were used with voice-over copy. But to demonstrate a\nlittle of what we had accomplished musically, we assembled this brief montage in 1988.\nIt's a reminder that a strong signature logo melody can be adapted to whatever style is required, whether\nyou're working with a commercial or a station ID.\nFor many years the major TV networks in the U.S. would each create a \"fall campaign\" to build their\npromotion efforts around. The campaigns included custom graphics and a song, which could be either an\nestablished hit or an original composition. A full length version of the song would be produced with special\nlyrics, and become the sound track for\na lengthy video designed to introduce the new fall programming line-up at the annual affiliates\nconvention. In 1979, ABC-TV secured the rights to use the song \"Still the One\",\nwhich was an appropriate campaign theme because they were the #1 rated network again that year. Influenced\nby the most popular music of the day, they went for a disco arrangement. Here is the\nend of the 1979 affiliates video, which includes a rundown of all the network's stars announced by Ernie\nAnderson, the iconic voice of ABC primetime from that era. JAM sang several versions of this track, as\nwell as customized shorter versions for all the ABC affiliates.\nAlthough some are familiar with the full-length \"Still the One\" track as sung for the network,\nit is not generally known that JAM re-sang the song several times with other specialized lyrics. For example,\nlocal stations owned by ABC, such as WLS-TV Chicago, received their own personalized versions.\nAnd even a few non-broadcast divisions of ABC wanted to tie-in with the campaign. ABC Publishing provided some\nclever lyrics for their internal version which included possibly the worst pun ever, \"still the Schwann\",\na reference to the Schwann music catalog.\nNetwork version 30th anniversary stereo remix!(2:56)\nWLS-TV Chicago version (2:56)\nABC Publishing version (2:56)\nAlthough the full-length version might air on the network one time, it was the package of :30, :20 and :10 versions\nthat were used throughout the season. JAM customized the package for each affiliate. Here is a short montage\nto demonstrate how some stations adapted the lyrics to make the campaign their own. In order, these\ncuts are from WAKR, KBAK, KTEN, KLTV, WTAE, WGHP and WJZ. (2:25)\nThe ABC network graphics and other promo elements were designed and created by Harry Marks, and his wonderful\ncompany Marks & Marks in Los Angeles. Since they\nwere responsible for delivering customized graphics and music for each affiliate, we developed a great working relationship\nto coordinate production of the audio and video elements. When the entire project was over we recorded a special\n\"closed-circuit thank you\" jingle just for them. The following year Marks worked with us again\nto customize the \"You and Me\" campaign for ABC. (1:04)\nOver the years there have been several JAM jingle packages that were sung using the great vocal group\nin Los Angeles. But there was only one time we asked them to sing an entire package in Spanish. It\nwas for David Gleason at WQII in Puerto Rico. The station was known as \"Once-Q\" (11-Q), and\nthey used cuts from \"The Authority\", which was originally created for KOA Denver. Here are a\nfew excerpts from the package, which was recorded in December 1979.\nHere's a collection of four :30 image songs promoting \"that good time feeling\" on Z-93\n(KQIZ) in the panhandle region of Texas. The first cut was originally made for 95PEN Philadelphia,\nthe last cut is from the WAKY \"Tri-Star\" package, and the other two are customs done for Z-93.\nThese were produced in Feburary 1980.\nIowa City is the home of The University of Iowa. To tie in with Hawkeyes football, KRNA asked us to create\na pop version of the school's traditional fight song. The song was written in 1951 by Iowa native\nMeredith Wilson, whose many credits include \"The Music Man\". This arrangement, which incorporates\nthe 4-note KRNA logo at the beginning and end, was produced by JAM in July 1980. The station distributed\nthousands of copies on 45 rpm records as part of the promotion.\nIt's always a bit unusual when we're asked to sing jingles in a language other than English. Through good\nears and phonetic coaching we've managed to successfully record in many different languages over the years. But when\nCFLS in Levis, Quebec asked us to produce cuts from \"I'd Rather Be 2\", \"Meltdown\" and\n\"The Rock\" with authentic French vocals, we decided to go to the source. We flew to Montreal, rented a\nstudio, and booked French-Canadian session singers. Although they all had experience singing on records and\ncommercials, it took a long time to achieve the vocal precision required by these station IDs (no one ever said\nthis job is easy). The end product was fine, but it took over 12 hours to record what would have been a 3 hour\nsession in Dallas. We were singing these jingles way past midnight, but Dan Plouffe (our Canadian rep at the\ntime) made sure we all had a good time. Here are some of the results, recorded in Montreal in February 1981.\nOver the years JAM has created several full custom image packages for WMAL, including \"Focal Point\",\n\"The #1 Voice\" and \"Capitol Idea\". But here's a random collection of unusual WMAL items\nfrom the 80s which you may have missed.\nIn February 1982 JAM created the theme music for \"Report to Murphy\", a sitcom about the adventures of a parole officer played\nby Michael Keaton. The show aired on CBS-TV in April and May of 1982, but only 6 episodes were made. Our on-screen credit flashes\nby quickly at 1:21.\nFor much of the 1960s and '70s, WABC New York was the #1 music station in North America. But changing\ntimes and technology caused the station to drop its Musicradio format in May 1982 and switch to news-talk. Almost one year\nearlier, ABC had decided to create a 24 hour satellite-delivered format that would essentially make the classic WABC sound available to\naffiliates across the US. It was a project of the newly-created ABC Radio Enterprises division, which named former WABC\nprogram director Rick Sklar as the VP of Programming. Rick signed up some of the top DJs from WABC (who would become\navailabe because of the upcoming format change), and many other major market personalities. The service was called Superadio,\nand it was scheduled to begin in July 1982.\nBecause JAM had worked closely with Rick for many years doing WABC jingles, he came to us to develop a huge custom package that would\nbe used on Superadio. He wanted to capture exciting elements from past WABC jingles, and bring them into the '80s. In addition\nto traditional jingles designed to air on the network or in local windows, the package explored the never-before-tried idea of the\n\"network two-punch.\" The opening part of a jingle would play on the net, and an electronic cue would trigger a customized\nending tag to play at the local station. This required that all tags be in the same key, and that they be a standard length. In order to\ndemonstrate the concept, we initially sang the tags using fictitious call letters like WSPR (for \"Superadio\") or WJCP\n(for \"JAM Creative Productions\").\nSadly, Superadio never got on the air. The concept was ahead of its time, since satellite-delivered formats had not yet\nbecome commonplace, as they are today. In addition, the sales and marketing efforts were not handled well due to internal\nproblems within ABC. Despite building brand new studios in New York and having everything ready to go, ABC decided to\nabandon the project just a few short weeks before it was scheduled to launch because not enough affiliates had been signed up.\nWe eventually re-sang many, but not all, of the jingles for WGBB on Long Island and turned them into a syndicated package called\n\"Good Time Radio\". But here is a montage featuring some of the original Superadio versions, for the network of the future\nthat almost was.\nThis is a collection of image promos which aired from 1982 to 1986 on WJZ-TV Channel 13 in Baltimore. The custom music is\nfrom the \"It's A Good Feeling To Know\" package. This highly successful campaign created a warm image for the station, which carried over into\npromos for the station's newscasts and other programming. Local news anchors Jerry Turner, Al Sanders, and even a young Oprah Winfrey are seen in some\nof the spots.\nWelcome aboard, ladies and gentlemen. We will be cruising at 31,000 feet this evening. For your in-flight\nentertainment, please put on the headphones and listen to \"Along The Coast\" from JAM. This is\nfrom August 1990.\nIn November 1990 JAM created a series of custom jingles for the VH-1 cable network. The idea was to create a new\nand very different look for their station IDs. Yes, the dancers did actually lip-sync to the jingles! The\nvideo elements were produced by Fred/Alan Inc., working with two different video houses in the New York area.\nThe American Forces Network is designed to bring news, information and familiar entertainment to military\npersonnel and their families who may be serving far from home. During Operation Desert Shield, in what has\ncome to be known as the \"first\" Gulf war, a network of stations was quickly set up for the troops\ndeployed to Kuwait and Iraq. Of all the work we've done for AFN through the years, perhaps the most surreal was\nthis version of \"Turbo Z\" which was recorded in January 1991. The package was originally created for Z-100\nNew York, but who would have predicted it would end up here?\nIn 1991, as troops were returning home from Desert Storm, JAM created this :60 jingle as a gift for the American Forces Network (AFN). It was not a political statement, just an expression of gratitude to military families through the years for their service. Here are two of the \"welcome home\" promos which AFN produced to accompany our music. The same song, with customized lyrics, was also used by several TV stations in the U.S.for similar support promos.\nKool 105 Denver signed on with JAM jingles in 1987, and used custom JAM packages for 20 years. In 2007 we\nproduced a :60 custom jingle to celebrate Kool's 20th anniversary as an oldies (\"classic hits\" in\ntoday's jargon) station. The cut is about the \"Kool Koncert\", which is an annual all-day event. Each year's\nconcert would feature 4-6 different musical groups from the 50s, 60s and 70s. In 2007, it was a 2-day event\nwith 8 different bands including The Turtles, The Four Tops and Steppenwolf.\nThe idea behind the jingle, created in May 2007 for Keith Abrams at Kool,\nwas to mention all of the artists who have played at the event in the last 20 years...\nand do it in 60 seconds. This was played at the top of every hour for days leading up to the concert. (It was\nthe cue to call in and win tickets). Take a deep breath and sing along.","Localising content is of great importance when targeting online products and services to remote geographic locations. While not difficult per se, the process entails more than simply translating copy word for word. All parts of a website should be localised in order to support a well-rounded business. Concerning audiovisual presentations, even the subtitles and voiceovers should be localised by native translators, to numerous logistical and cultural benefits. Here are the things to know when localising subtitles and voiceovers.\nLEAVE ROOM FOR SUBTITLE TEXT EXPANSION\nA predominant issue faced by translators of AV projects is fitting localised subtitles onto the screen. Since English is frequently utilized as the “original” language for audiovisual presentations, the resulting translation often expands much longer in characters and syllables. Indeed, many languages are significantly longer on the page than others. For instance, the German language is roughly 30% longer than English; Russian staggers around 40%! This is the basis for creating space in the original voiceover, so it can be localised more naturally by translators.\nMATCHING SUBTITLES TO VOICEOVER\nText which has been translated into a new language is often difficult to syncopate with the original. Once again, this is why it’s helpful to localise – some translators are uniquely skilled at taking source text and applying it to the relevant language. By using apt words and phrases, native translators can add or remove space in their speech depending on the confines of the original voiceover.\nColloquial terms can help to cut back on unnecessary swaths of text. Furthermore, localising subtitles creates a more credible product for the target consumers in mind.\nIn terms of readability, long-winded and verbatim translations detract from the professional appearance of the products or services being sold. What’s more, they distract from the information being conveyed. Having too many words on the screen is visually unappealing and ultimately derails the intent of communicating information – it can also be pretty hard to keep up with!\nALLOW TIME DURING VOICEOVER\nAnother issue facing translators of audiovisual projects is allowing time for the local voiceover artist to fit the translated speech into the space allotted. The best way to limit artists from having to work double time is to create space in the original voiceover. This allows for the translator to localise the speech and fit it in as closely as possible to the timing of the speech in the original language. Original voiceovers that are spoken with conversational cadence will be hard to localise without the translator rushing their piece and consequently throwing the presentation off pace.\nLOCALISE EVERYTHING ELSE!\nA roadblock many online businesses run into is partially localising the content. Not only should subtitles and voiceovers be localised, the font, music, images, and all supporting marketing materials should be optimized for the target group as well.\nOnly localising a portion of a presentation will diminish its credibility with local consumers. Especially in markets experiencing low levels of unemployment and high rates of online sales (such as the German market), it is important to localise with precision. By winning over a local consumer base, it allows businesses to successfully tap into new, exciting opportunities around the world.\nMEDIA AND TYPEFACE\nWhile it may seem inconsequential, something as simple as an ill-conceived song choice can unintentionally offend a local audience with obscure or irrelevant references. The same rule can be applied to any and all visual imagery.\nTypeface and other design elements can be localised as well. Believe it or not, font is a variable that changes in popularity from one region to the next. Just because Helvetica might be used a lot in one European country doesn’t mean it is in the next country over.\nWORK WITH EXPERIENCED TRANSLATORS\nAlthough translators who are fluent in a second language can be of some assistance in localising content, native first-language speakers enjoy the most wholesome understanding of the complex structure of their specific dialect. In a perfect setting, the voiceovers recorded in the original language would be timed with localised translation in mind. Since some translations are not pre-planned, this can be hard to achieve with limited resources. Therefore, native translators are the ones to work with to achieve succinct, localised AV translations."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c24740b9-6253-4d2a-8ddd-ef29f5b1105b>","<urn:uuid:3619efe0-3977-4573-a2df-d4f629bc3975>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm curious about the fundamental causes of diabetes from a medical perspective. What are the primary reasons this condition develops?","answer":"There are 2 main reasons for diabetes: inadequate production of insulin, or cells not responding to the function of insulin in the proper manner. Some patients may experience both issues, which makes treating diabetes more challenging.","context":["What is diabetes?\nDiabetes is one of the most common health issues people face. There has been an increase in the number of patients who deal with diabetes as a result of the lack of exercise and unbalanced dietary practices. Diabetes is a condition where the body has an inability to control the sugar level of the blood. This inability to control sugar levels is very dangerous. Therefore, it is wise to take precautions and see a doctor if you are experiencing any symptoms of diabetes.\nSymptoms of Diabetes Include:\n- Increased urination (this is one of the main symptoms of diabetes)\n- Unquenchable thirst or increased amount of liquid intake.\n- Sudden Increase of appetite\n- The weakness and feeling of fatigue throughout the day\n- Unexplainable weight loss\n- Certain unusual changes in vision.\nThe doctors classify diabetes as a metabolic disease. The sugar level of the blood is controlled by an enzyme, which is called as insulin. This insulin is very important and needs to function properly in the body. When it doesn’t function properly, people get diabetes.\nThere are 2 main reasons for diabetes:\n- Inadequate production of insulin\n- Cells do not respond to the function of insulin in the proper manner.\nSome patient deal with both issues, so treating diabetes has become a difficult task.\nThere are 3 types of diabetes\nThe body does not produce its requirement of insulin. This situation is commonly identified as insulin-dependant diabetes. This can be seen in people, who are younger than 30. Even teenagers can have diabetes. These patients are advised to obtain regular blood tests and see a doctor about taking insulin to supplement their body throughout life. The percentage of this type is about 10%.\nThe production of insulin is not enough or there is a problem in the function of insulin with the body’s cells. Obesity has become a major issue for this type. This can be very common among people, who are overweight and have excess fat. The extra body weight and bad dietary practices increase the number of patients who deal with this condition. Getting older also increases the risk of Type 2 Diabetes. The percentage of the total patient is about 90%.\nThis can be an issue among pregnant females. Females have a high amount of sugar in their blood during pregnancy, so the normal level of insulin may not be enough to control the sugar level. It is not a severe problem, as the majority of the pregnant mothers can reduce the risk by controlling food with a suitable diet.\nHow is Diabetes Controlled\nThe patients of the first type can control the issue by maintaining healthy diets, and taking a regular amount of insulin. The most frequent type or the second type can be controlled by proper food and the regular exercises. A blood sugar support supplement can also help you maintain proper blood sugar levels. People should pay extreme attention to the maintenance of the body, especially to balance weight. The intake of sugar should be reduced as well. So no pizza buffets or fast food. It is advisable to your blood checked periodically and see a doctor immediately if you notice a symptom that we have mentioned."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:93d2c4d2-1482-40b1-b1de-ba3c87725328>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the blade materials used in custom table tennis paddles compare to the string materials used in professional tennis rackets in terms of customization options and performance impact?","answer":"Table tennis paddle blades must be at least 85% natural wood, typically made of 3-7 layers of plywood, with thinner blades favoring control and thicker ones providing more power. In contrast, tennis racket customization focuses heavily on string materials, with top players using either full polyester strings for spin and control, or hybrid combinations of polyester with softer strings like natural gut for a mix of spin, power, and feel. While table tennis blade customization is limited by ITTF regulations, tennis string customization offers more variety, with tensions ranging from 44/46 lbs (Raonic) to 62 lbs (Zverev & Murray), and different string combinations significantly affecting playing characteristics.","context":["Creating your own custom table tennis paddle can seem like a difficult task, especially if you've never done it before. What equipment do you need? What blade should you select? How do you actually assemble a custom table tennis paddle? These are questions I asked myself and honestly, finding the answers was a little challenging. So, I watched a ton of videos, read loads of articles and decided I'd compile my notes and create this helpful guide for anyone looking to create and assemble their first custom table tennis racket.\nWhat To Know About Custom Table Tennis Paddles\nSo, you’ve decided to abandon the standard premade ping pong paddle mold and play with a paddle all your own. Whether you just want to change it for different looks or change the way you play, custom ping paddles are fairly easy to create, customize and best of all - use.\nIn this section, we’re going to cover the basic information you should keep in mind. Making a custom paddle requires you to make a new blade and new rubbers.\nThese are two main parts of paddles. The blade is the skeleton of the paddle, and the rubbers located on blade determines how the ball travels. The good news is, its not overly complicated. With this helpful walkthrough, you can do it!\nWhat Is A Custom Ping Pong Paddle?\nStandard ping pong paddles like the Killerspin Jet 800 come with the blade and rubbers as a single assembly. They are designed for a specific style of play and grip. A custom ping pong paddle is made to each player’s personal specifications and preferences.\nIf you have a custom paddle, you can have a thin blade paired with thick rubbers or vice versa. You can also have the handle shaped to accommodate either of the two types of grips: pen or handshake.\nBefore we go too far, I should point out that there are a few negatives to custom table tennis paddles. First, depending on the materials used, it can be expensive to make one compared to buying it premade paddle. Secondly, you have to ensure that your materials fall within the rules of the International Table Tennis Federation.\nMy take: If you're not willing to truly make your paddle an investment, then I suggest you find the best possible premade paddle for your style of play and stick with it. If that describes you, then I highly recommend looking through my premade ping pong paddle guide...I've compiled the most complete list of premade paddles for literally any skill level across all budgets. If you've played with many premade paddles are eager to go \"custom\", then let's continue.\nGetting back to ITTF approved materials - you've got to do your research. For example, your blade must be at least 85% natural wood, and your rubbers can be no more than 2 millimeters thick including sponge and adhesive. The ITTF requires strict paddle specifications and rightfully so, their job is to make sure there is no serious competitive advantage when it comes to a paddle.\nNow let’s take a look at each of the parts of the paddle and discuss how you can customize them to suit your style of play. We’ll start with the blade.\nCustom Ping Pong Paddles - The Blade\nBlades are made of several layers of ply, usually three to seven. Unless you’ve got some pretty advanced equipment, you're not going to be able to make your own plywood, so you’ll have to stick with prefab. Trust me, leave that part up to the experts. The different thicknesses of ply will influence how force is transferred from the paddle to the ball.\nThin plywood works best for paddles dedicated to controlling the ball and executing trick shots. This is because they’re flexible and have plenty of give to them. These properties of the wood lend themselves well to slower-paced games. If you’re just batting a ball back and forth across a table casually, keep a lighter blade on hand.\nThick blades, on the other hand, work best for power players. If you use a thicker paddle, odds are you prefer to send the ball blistering across the court at your opponent....So fast, you don’t want your opponent to see it. It’s similar to the differences between power hitters and place hitters in baseball. For speed, you need something that’s between three-quarters and a full inch thick.\nCustom Ping Pong Paddles - The Rubbers\nNext, let’s consider the rubbers. The rubbers are actually two separate pieces that glue onto the blade. Its purpose is to transmit the energy from your swing to the ball; if you didn’t have good rubber, your paddle will not last very long due to the thinness of plywood and the constant stress it would be under.\nNow, here's the cool part. You’re going to have two different rubbers, one on each side of the paddle. The official tournament rules were updated in 1986 to require the two rubbers to be of different colors: red and black. In theory, the red side imparts more speed and the black side produces spin. Whether this is true is up for debate. However, if you’re good enough and have proper technique (which you probably are because you're interested in making a custom table tennis racket), then you should notice little difference. Even so, the rules are that you need red and black rubbers.\nWhat are Pips?\nThe pips are the small protrusions that give the rubber its textured surface. Some are long and some are short depending on your style of play. They're also sometimes called \"pimples\". The next thing to think about is how you want the rubbers installed. Do you want the pips facing inward or outward?\nEach rubber has a pimpled side and a smooth side. It's up to you which one you want to play with. Attach the smooth side to the sponge and you'll be playing with the pimpled side. Attach the side with the pips, and you'll be playing with the smooth side (good for spin). It's up to you and how you play. Some players have have the smooth rubber one on side and a pimpled side on the other. So, there are many different combinations to try.\nIf you're playing with one or two sides with pimples out, then you'll want to choose between long pips or short pips. Long pips are used for a more defensive game where you are countering top spin and back spin shots from an aggressive opponent. Short pips are the opposite and tend to play in a more offensive minded way - creating fast rebounds and power.\nHow To Make A Custom Ping Pong Paddle\nIt’s definitely possible to make a custom ping pong paddle from scratch. Here’s a great guide on how to do so.\nHowever, we’re going to assume you have your blade and rubbers already picked out and ordered, now it’s just a matter of putting them together. You will need table tennis glue; it is specially formulated to work with your rubbers. If you try to use other types of glue it will not hold properly. I do NOT recommend this!\nUse a small sponge to spread a thin layer of glue on your rubber and allow it to dry. Not waiting for it to dry can impact how well everything holds together, so don't get impatient - wait for EVERYTHING to dry properly.\nNew rubbers are going to be more absorbent than you’d expect so it’s going to take two layers of glue. So, allow the first layer of glue to dry. It should still be a little sticky to the touch. Next, apply a second layer. Remember that you can always add more glue if needed.\nWhile you’re waiting, sweep any packaging debris or dust off your blade, put a thin layer of glue on it, and let that dry. This shouldn’t take more than fifteen to twenty minutes as long as you don’t overdo it. Then apply the glued rubber to the blade, ensuring that it adheres to it correctly. Now, take a sharp pair of scissors and cut around the blade so the rubber matches the blade shape.\nRepeat the entire process for the other rubber. If you try to attach both of them at once, it will be tricky to cut them properly. This is not ideal. Trust me, do one side of your paddle at a time. After both sides of the blade are covered and the glue has set, place it on a flat surface and put a heavy object on top to compress it further.\nVideo Source: Ben Larcombe\nMy Recommended Products for Assembling Your First Custom Table Tennis Paddle\nOk, let's get into what products to select. There are many, many different mix and match combinations from loads of manufacturers, so choosing where to begin can be overwhelming. When in doubt, start simple and choose quality materials. That's what I did. I could have spent three to four hundred dollars putting together a custom ping pong paddle but I wasn't ready to create my version of a tournament ready excalibur...at least not yet.\nSo, if you've never done his before, I recommend starting somewhere in the middle. The sweet spot (no pun intended) for your first custom ping pong racket is somewhere ahead of a really good premade ping pong paddle, and below an elite custom racket. In my opinion, that's a good place to start. And these are the products that will get you there.\nBest Ping Pong Blade Under $150\nFor the best Ping Pong Blade under $150, in my opinion you’ll want the Butterfly Viscaria paddle. This paddle features a carbon-poly fiber and plywood construction, giving it loads of extra power! If you’re a player that likes to put speed and power into your shot, the Butterfly Viscara is right for you.\nIt is heavy and relatively inflexible, so it sends balls in a flatter arc - provided you have good table tennis fundamentals. Novice players will struggle controlling this paddle. However, if you have solid attack technique, this paddle gives you ample speed and power that will overwhelm an unprepared opponent, and is well worth the price.\nBest Ping Pong Blade Under $100\nNeed something with a lower price point or different play style? Look for the Joola Rossi Emotion. The main draw of this blade is that it has a penhold handle, making it best suited to players with a penhold grip.\nThe penhold grip places the index finger and thumb on one side of the paddle so that only one side is used. It’s harder, and more unpredictable because most players use a handshake grip.\nThe blade is made of five layers of plywood coupled with two layers of veneer. The relative thickness leads to more power without sacrificing control. Its main disadvantage is that it’s not suited for defense. It's purely an offensive geared racket.\nThe layers of carbon increase the optimal striking surface of the blade, so it is a little more forgiving to newer players who haven’t gained most precision yet. he penhold grip will take some getting used - so be patient if your trying that style for the first time.\nBest Ping Pong Blade Under $50\nIf you’re really on a budget, check out the Petr Korbel. This blade, unlike the others on this list, does not have any augmentation to the material. It is pure plywood, which makes it a little stiff, powerful and appealing to people who prefer simpler aesthetics.\nThe flared handle lends itself well to penhold and shakehold grips, so no matter which style you learned you’ll be able to use this blade. Like the other blades we’ve seen, this one isn’t ideal for defensive minded players.\nThe Best Table Tennis Rubbers to Consider\nThe Tenergy 05 rubber sheet can compensate for many weaknesses of a stiff blade. It has proprietary sponge technology that is able to compress and keep the ball on the paddle for longer periods of time - perfect for spin!\nThis imparts an unpredictable spin on the ball and can throw opponents off their rhythm! However, the extra springiness can make the ball move too fast for players to control until they get used to it.\nBest Affordable Ping Pong Rubber\nIf you’re someone who’s just starting out or who’s on a budget, the Mark V Yasaka might be a great choice. It uses speed glue technology, which, while outdated by later models can still hold up. This rubber has a good all-around performance profile.\nIt works well for power, spin, and control, so using this on a blade allows new players to become acquainted with their playing style. Serious players who are looking for characteristics that stand out might want to try another rubber.\nIf you've never assembled you're own custom table tennis paddle, you're not alone. Many ping pong fans like myself were unsure where to start, how to do it, and what products to choose. I hope the walk-through has given you confidence, direction and some buyer knowledge to get you off to the right start.\nIf you're unsure which blade and rubber combo to go with, I'd recommend starting more on the basic side and NOT get a blade and rubber that will be too fast and too difficult to control. That'll make the whole experience for you a negative one and you'll wonder why you even ventured away from your classic premade paddle. So, start simple, assemble a custom ping pong paddle that's tailored more towards your current skill level versus one that you're hoping to get to. Good luck!\nFor another great in-depth article, I recommend reading this one.","The key point is that you (the player ) should decide and not the stringer or coach. By all means, be guided in the right direction but if finances permit try a few variations of string types & tensions to see what you like best.\nIn a nutshell:\n1/ Full polyester for more spin and control but harder on the arm.\n2/ Full soft strings for more feel and less loss of tension. Natural gut is the best but very expensive - only if you play in dry conditions and don't use too much spin as the strings won't last!\n3/ A hybrid of polyester and a softer string which provides a mix of good spin, power, and feel\nWhat do the top male players in the world use in terms of strings/tensions:\nNovak Djokovic | Babolat VS Team Natural Gut / Luxilon ALU Power Rough 59/56lbs\nRoger Federer | Wilson Natural Gut/Luxilon Big Banger Alu Power Rough 48.5/45lbs\nAndy Murray | Luxilon Big Banger Alu Power/Babolat VS Touch 62lbs\nNick Kygrios |Yonex Poly Tour Pro 125 51lbs\nRafael Nadal | Babolat RPM Blast 130 55lbs\nGael Monfils | Luxilon Big Banger Alu Power 57/55lbs\nMilos Raonic |Luxilon M2 44/46lb\nAlexander Zverev | Babolat VS Touch/Head Hawk Touch 62lb\nRoberto Bautista Agut | Luxilon Big Banger Original 57lb\nDiego Schwartzman | Luxilon Big Banger Alu Power 50lbs\nOut of this group of 10 players we have 6 using only polyester and the other 4 with a hybrid of polyester and a softer string. Tensions vary from 44/46lbs - Raonic to 62lbs - Zverev & Murray. Therefore, quite a variation in string types and combinations plus different ideas on tensions.\nIn general lower tensions provide more power and higher tensions more control. Polyester strings can be strung looser and still have decent control which is probably why all the players using polyester only are no higher than 55lbs - Nadal. (Rafa is one of the few players on tour who never changes his string tension no matter whatever the conditions are)\nFor young players and lower-level club players, a hybrid restring is generally better to help protect the arm and provide a bit more feel. If a mid-level or slightly older junior likes polyester I would advise no more than 50lbs again to protect the arm and provide easier power for slower racquet head speeds.\nIf you want a restring that doesn't lose tension quite so much then VS Gut would be the best but as I said previously it's very expensive and breaks easily.\nHigher-level club players are probably the ones who will experiment a bit more to find out what suits them best and a huge consideration for aspiring young pros is the cost as they will break strings regularly no matter what the type of string they use!\nTo sum up... try not to get too fanatical about strings as a good stringer should be able to guide you towards the most appropriate tension and string type for your level of play. The higher the level of player the more they will feel subtle differences. You will sometimes see pro players complaining to their team about string tensions in practice or during matches which can be genuine but can also be players looking for excuses.\nFind a string and tension that you like and stick to it - just like Rafa!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b91ce39f-e51d-4371-b526-3332d783e240>","<urn:uuid:cd03fe54-1691-46cd-80b8-9f9c226ab499>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I need to know about insect dispersal patterns. How do the dispersal behaviors of modern stored food insects compare to the ancient cross-Arctic dispersal of Titanomyrma ants?","answer":"Modern stored food insects disperse locally, moving between food products within homes and stores, often crawling through small openings or flying short distances between infested areas. In contrast, Titanomyrma ants demonstrated continental-scale dispersal across the Arctic between Europe and North America during the early Eocene, but only during brief hyperthermal events when temperatures increased by 5-10°C. This trans-Arctic dispersal was only possible during these warm periods because Titanomyrma required mean annual temperatures above 20°C, while the normal Arctic temperatures of 12-16°C were too cool for them to survive.","context":["Insect pests of stored foods\nInsects infesting stored foods are one of the most common household insect problems. The many different kinds of insects that infest stored dried foods are often referred to as \"pantry pests.\"\nPantry pests contaminate more food than they consume, and most people find the contaminated products unfit for consumption. Pantry pests are often discovered when they leave infested foods to crawl or fly about the house. They often accumulate in pots, pans or dishes or on window sills. Fortunately, they do not bite or sting people or pets nor do they feed on or damage the house structure or contents.\nWhat do they eat?\nNearly all dried food products are susceptible to insect infestation, including cereal products (flour, cake mix, cornmeal, rice, spaghetti, crackers, and cookies); seeds such as dried beans and popcorn; nuts; chocolate; raisins and other dried fruits; spices; powdered milk; tea; and cured meats. Non-food items that may be infested include birdseed, dry pet food, ornamental seed and dried plant displays, ornamental corn, dried flowers, garden seeds, potpourri, and rodent baits.\nStored food insects are most likely to infest products that have been opened but are also capable of penetrating unopened paper, thin cardboard, and plastic, foil, or cellophane-wrapped packages. They may chew their way into packages or crawl in through folds and seams. Insects within an infested package begin multiplying and can spread to other stored foods not only in the same area but in other rooms in a home. All stages (egg, larva, pupa, and adult) may be present simultaneously in infested products.\nWhere do they come from?\nA stored food product can become infested anywhere during the process from production until it arrives in your home. However, stored food is most likely to become infested in stores or in homes. Most of the stored food insects also are pests of stored grain or other commodities and may be relatively abundant outdoors. Food products that are left undisturbed on the shelves for long periods are particularly susceptible to infestation. However, foods of any age can become infested.\nIdentification and biology of common stored product insects\nIndianmeal moths (Plodia interpunctella) are the most common moths infesting food in homes. These moths have a wingspan of 1/2 to 5/8 inch. When at rest, they fold their wings behind themselves, over their bodies. The base of the front wing is pale gray or tan and the outer two-thirds is reddish-brown with a coppery luster. The wing markings are distinctive, but may be less clear if the scales have been rubbed from the wings. Indianmeal moths may be found inside infested products or flying around homes.\nThe larvae are whitish worms with shades of yellow, pink, green, or brown and grow to 1/2 inch long.\nOnly the larvae feed in stored products, which can be any dry stored food or whole grain. Foods infested with these insects will have silk webbing present on the surface of the product. Larvae often leave the food when mature and may move long distances before stopping to spin a cocoon. It is common to find caterpillars and cocoons on ceilings and walls. Adult moths may be seen up to several weeks after the food source has been removed.\nMeal moths (Pyralis farinalis) have a wingspan of about 3/4 - 1 inch. Their forewings have a dark reddish brown band across the top and bottom of the wings with an olive or yellowish green band, outlined by wavy white lines in the center. Their abdomen is typically curved up at a 90° angle when at rest. The larvae have a black head and a whitish body with some orange at the end of the body. They often form feeding tubes made of silk and tiny pieces of food. Meal moths are found feeding on a wide variety of flour and grain products and seeds, especially when they are damp. These moths are not common in homes.\nSawtoothed grain beetles (Oryzaephilus surinamensis) are about 1/10 inch long, slender, flattened, and brownish-red to almost black in color. They are easily identified by the saw-like teeth on each side of the thorax. Larvae are cream-colored, slender, and about 1/8 inch long, although they are rarely noticed by residents. Sawtoothed grain beetles are found in many different food items, including dried fruit, cereals, nuts, dried meat, macaroni, and seeds.\nDrugstore beetles and cigarette beetles (Lasioderma serricorne and Stegobium panicum) are about 1/8 inch long, oval, and brown. The head is bent downward giving the insect a humped appearance. Both species fly and can be found around windows. Larvae are 1/8 inch long when mature, and yellowish-white with a light brown head (the larvae are not usually noticed by residents). They have a curved body covered with fine hair. Cigarette and drugstore beetles feed on a wide variety of dried plant products such as spices, macaroni and other grain based foods, dried flowers, tobacco products, and even paper products, including books.\nFlour beetles (Tribolium confusum and T. castaneum) are 3/16 inch long, reddish-brown, and elongate oval in shape. Larvae are cylindrical, whitish, or cream-colored and up to 1/4 inch long and have two small pointed spines on the tail end (the larvae are not usually noticed by residents). Two species of flour beetles may be found: red flour beetles are common in homes and the confused flour beetle is a frequent pest in flour mills. Flour beetles infest many types of dried food products, such as flour, bran, cereal products, dried fruits, nuts, and chocolate.\nWarehouse and cabinet beetles (Trogoderma spp.) are elongate oval and 1/8 to 3/16 inch long. They may be solid black or mottled with yellowish-brown markings. Larvae are long and narrow, yellowish to dark brown, hairy and generally grow to about 1/4 inch (although they may not be noticed by residents). Warehouse and cabinet beetles feed in a wide variety of food products, such as grain products, seeds, dried fruits, animal by-products skins, fur, hair, and pet food. They are also known to feed on dead insects and animal carcasses.\nGranary, rice, and maize weevils (Sitophilus spp.) are slender insects with a conspicuous snout projecting forward from the head. They are dark brown, sometimes with four orangish spots on the wing covers. They are less than 3/16 inch long. Larvae are white, legless, and looked wrinkled and are only found inside whole kernels or seeds. These weevils attack only whole grains or seeds, leaving small round exit holes in infested kernels. They rarely are found in nuts, dried fruits, macaroni, and caked or crusted milled products such as flour. (A different, larger species of weevil can be found in homes during the fall due to emergence from acorns or hickory nuts collected and stored inside).\nSpider beetles (family Ptinidae) are reddish brown, 3/16 inch beetles with long legs and a somewhat, spider-like appearance. The larvae are C-shaped and whitish; they remain in infested material and aren't normally seen. Spider beetles infest a variety of dried plant products.\nBean weevils (Acanthoscelides obtectus) are a type of seed beetle. They are a mottled light and dark brown, broadly oval, and about 1/8 inch long. They have short wing covers which exposes part of the abdomen. Unlike other weevils, bean weevils lack a conspicuous snout. The larvae are small, whitish, legless, and C-shaped. They feed inside dried beans and peas.\nPurchase dried foods in quantities small enough to be used up in a relatively short period of time. Use oldest products before newer ones, and opened packages before unopened ones.\nInspect packages or bulk products before buying. Packages should be sealed and unbroken. Also check the freshness packaging date. Look for evidence of insects, including holes in the packaging or wrapping.\nStore insect-free foods in tightly closed glass, metal, or heavy plastic containers especially if you do not use up the food very quickly (this is less important for food that is used up more quickly). You can also store susceptible foods in the refrigerator or freezer.\nKeep food storage areas clean. Do not allow crumbs or spilled food to accumulate. Remove and discard old, unused products and inspect the remainder. Thoroughly clean cracks and corners with a vacuum cleaner. Also check and clean areas where pet food and birdseed are stored as these are particularly common sources of infestations.\nWashing areas with detergents, ammonia, or bleach will not prevent insect infestation. There is no evidence that proves that placing bay leaves or sticks of spearmint gum in a cupboard will prevent or deter stored food insect pests.\nThere are several ways you may become aware of a stored product infestation. If you find small beetles in susceptible food products, that is a sure sign of a problem. It is also common to find stored product beetles on counters and in cupboards. In some cases, the beetles are attracted to light and may be found around windows.\nYou may find Indianmeal moths flying around kitchens and other rooms. As caterpillars move away from infested food to pupate, they can be found on walls and ceilings in rooms adjacent to infestations. When examining food packages, you may not only find caterpillars but silk webbing inside infested packages.\nBe careful, as not all small beetles or moths found indoors are necessarily a panty pest. If there is not a direct association with food, be sure the insects are identified correctly by an expert to determine whether they are a stored product food insect.\nWhen you know a stored product problem is present, be sure to examine all susceptible food as there could be more than one infested source. When inspecting them, look at the top surface of products with a flashlight or pour the package contents onto a cookie sheet.\nWhen you find food that is infested, just throw it away.\nUse a vacuum cleaner to thoroughly clean cabinets and shelves, especially in cracks and corners. This will pick up crawling insects and spilled or infested material that is present. Empty the vacuum cleaner or discard the vacuum cleaner bag after use to prevent reinfestation. Washing shelves with detergent, bleach, ammonia, or disinfectants will not have any effect on insect pests.\nAs a precaution against re-infestation, store susceptible foods in sealable glass, metal, or heavy plastic containers or in the freezer or refrigerator until you are convinced the infestation is gone. It is not unusual to see an occasional Indianmeal moth flying for as long as 3 weeks after the infested sources have been eliminated. However, if you continue to see Indianmeal moths after three weeks, that indicates there is an infested food source that has not been discovered yet.\nIf you have older food products and you are not sure if they are infested, you can place these products in the freezer at 0 degrees for at least 4 days or in shallow cookie sheets or pans in an oven at 130 degrees for at least 30 minutes. These temperatures will kill any eggs or insects that may be present. If insects are infesting ornaments or decorations made with plant products or seeds, place the items in a freezer for at least four days.\nInsecticide sprays are not recommended for controlling insects in stored food cupboards. Household insecticides have no effect on insects within food packages and any control of insects outside of them is temporary unless the source of the infestation is found and eliminated.\nAlso, the amount of extra work that is necessary when treating cupboards or other areas usually is prohibitive. It is necessary to first remove dishes, glasses, and food packages so they are not contaminated by pesticides. Time is then needed to allow the spray to dry before items can be returned.","Early Eocene land bridges allowed numerous plant and animal species to cross between Europe and North America via the Arctic. While many species suited to prevailing cool Arctic climates would have been able to cross throughout much of this period, others would have found dispersal opportunities only during limited intervals when their requirements for higher temperatures were met. Here, we present Titanomyrma lubei gen. et sp. nov. from Wyoming, USA, a new giant (greater than 5 cm long) formiciine ant from the early Eocene (approx. 49.5 Ma) Green River Formation. We show that the extinct ant subfamily Formiciinae is only known from localities with an estimated mean annual temperature of about 20°C or greater, consistent with the tropical ranges of almost all of the largest living ant species. This is, to our knowledge, the first known formiciine of gigantic size in the Western Hemisphere and the first reported cross-Arctic dispersal by a thermophilic insect group. This implies intercontinental migration during one or more brief high-temperature episodes (hyperthermals) sometime between the latest Palaeocene establishment of intercontinental land connections and the presence of giant formiciines in Europe and North America by the early middle Eocene.\nHolarctic interchanges of plants and animals during the Eocene have long been known [1–13]; however, details of their nature and timing remain little understood. Eocene North America and Europe were only a short distance apart (figure 1), which, combined with eustatic sea-level drop, resulted in land connections between them. Dispersal was possible across a forested, unglaciated Arctic via Greenland by a northern ‘De Geer’ route through Fennoscandia and a southern ‘Thulean’ route through Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Great Britain [2–7,10,12]. An epicontinental seaway (figure 1) probably restricted dispersal between Europe and Asia at least some of this time.\nThe mammal fossil record shows discrete waves of intercontinental migrations during this interval, most notably at the Palaeocene/Eocene boundary ‘mammalian dispersal event’, when major groups simultaneously appeared across the Holarctic [4,10]. Early Eocene Europe and North America shared the highest number of mammal genera in the Cenozoic ; they also had pronounced floral similarities, indicating numerous intercontinental range extensions of plant taxa [3,5,7]. While it has long been recognized that the distributions of modern insect taxa implies Eocene cross-North Atlantic migrations , direct fossil evidence has only been reported recently [8,9,11,13].\nIncreasingly, fine-scale variations in early Eocene Arctic climate are becoming known, with mostly cool, but seasonally equable temperatures prevailing, but with episodic hyperthermal intervals of increased temperatures, some brief and intense [14–18]. Insect taxa previously shown to have co-occurred in Europe and North America in the early Eocene all had ranges including localities where mean annual temperature (MAT) is estimated as cool (far-western North America) or is not known (Fur Formation, Denmark). The new, giant formiciine ant from the Eocene of Wyoming described here, however, was a thermophilic insect, providing evidence of the role played by early Eocene hyperthermal events in facilitating selective trans-Arctic intercontinental dispersals [3–7,12]. Variations in climate would have then acted as a filter gate across high latitudes, mediating differential access between continents for species populations according to their individual physiological requirements.\n2. Material and methods\nWe follow the morphological terminology used by Lutz [19,20] and Wappler , except in referring to abdominal, not gaster, segment identifying numbers (abdominal segments A3–7 = gaster segments I–V). Palaeoclimatic analysis of MAT of the fossil ant localities (table 1) used either published proxies for MAT [18,22–24], or new analyses based on previously published data on the proportion of dicot leaf morphotypes with non-toothed margins using the leaf margin analysis equation of Miller et al. , and the leaf area analysis equation for estimating mean annual precipitation (MAP) from Wilf et al. . Occurrence data for modern large ants were gathered from published records and personal communications (electronic supplementary material). The latitude and longitudes of these records were entered into the WorldClim software , which provided estimates of MAT, coldest yearly quarter mean temperature and MAP to a square kilometre level of spatial resolution.\n3. Systematic palaeontology\nFormicidae Latreille 1802;\nFormiciinae Lutz ;\nTitanomyrma lubei gen. et sp. nov.\nGenus name derived from the Greek Titan, often used to indicate large size, and myrmex (Greek: ant), gender feminine.

Formicium brodiei Westwood, Formicium mirabile Cockerell [30–32] (both Bournemouth, UK; middle Eocene) and Formicium berryi Carpenter  (middle Eocene Claiborne Formation, Puryear, TN, USA; incorrectly called Wilcox Formation by Carpenter [33,34]) are only known from forewings, and were grouped with the German species by the similarity of their venations.\nThe distinctive gaster shape of T. lubei is confidently not an artefact of preservation; the tergites are clearly shaped differently than are those of the German species, where A5 is wider than A4 (gaster segments III and II)  (figure 3b,c). In T. lubei, however, these are of similar lengths and maximum widths (figures 2 and 3a). Its legs are notably more gracile than those of T. giganteum and somewhat more so than those of T. simillimum. The mandibles are poorly preserved, but appear smaller than those of the German species (figures 2 and 3a–c). Wing length basad the pterostigma in T. lubei is about 24 mm, similar to that of the T. giganteum holotype queen , indicating a forewing length within the range of T. giganteum, larger than in T. simillimum . However, the body of T. lubei is closer in length to the T. simillimum holotype, 53 mm .\nWe propose the genus Titanomyrma for the new species and transfer the two German species to it, as grouping them within Formicium would compound an existing problem that can no longer be avoided.\nLutz  recognized the difficulty of defining the genus based on the limited information provided by a single forewing specimen of the type species, F. brodiei. He, therefore, used the characters of the new species ‘F.’ giganteum and ‘F.’ simillimum to form his genus diagnosis and description, effectively employing them as sort of ‘functional type species’ (‘Since Westwood only illustrated the wing, but did not describe it formally, the following new finds from Messel will provide a more detailed diagnosis and description’. p. 182, our translation from the German).\nFurther, in ant taxonomy generally, because of the variability of wing characters and the small amount of their study compared with those of other insect groups, and by the traditional availability of more commonly collected wingless worker caste specimens, wings are usually ignored or de-emphasized in defining modern species; they are invariably defined by workers.\nThere appears to be considerable plasticity of wing characters in Formiciinae in particular. Venational morphology of the holotype wings of F. brodiei (, fig. 1c) and F. berryi (, fig. 2c) falls within variability between the left and right wings of a specimen of ‘F.’ aff. giganteum (, fig. 95). Further, note the differences between the forewings of this specimen of ‘F.’ aff. giganteum and the ‘F.’ giganteum holotype (, fig. 3b) and paratype 6 (, fig. 5). Also, size differences between males and females of the German species indicate the possibility that smaller and larger wing species could be conspecific . Such examples indicate deep problems in the usefulness of formiciine wings for defining species.\nBy these reasons, we propose to clarify formiciine taxonomy by considering Formicium as a collective genus containing the wing species, which we consider tentative, and erecting the nominal genus Titanomyrma to include the new species and the two German species. As a collective group, Formicium would have neither a diagnosis nor a description, but would be defined as including all species of Formiciinae that cannot be placed in a nominal genus owing to lack of sufficient preserved characters. Formicium brodiei ceases to be Formicium's type species (a collective genus has none: ICZN Article 67.14 ). Formicium, however, remains the type genus of Formiciinae, and the subfamily name is not affected.\nA team of palaeoentomologists is currently undertaking a major examination of the Formiciinae (T. Wappler 2011, personal communication), with large numbers of new specimens available with which to confidently establish intra- and interspecific variability. We expect that this work will greatly clarify the positions of the wing species. Here, we provide what we recognize is a brief, interim diagnosis and description of Titanomyrma, with the understanding that these will soon be established with greater detail by the Wappler team.\n(b) Thermophily, size and the Formiciinae\nTo assess the climatic constraints of Formiciinae, we reconstructed the MAT, coldest quarter mean temperature (CQMT) and the MAP of the sites where they have been recovered. Further, we calculated the climate space occupied by the largest living ants to ascertain whether there are common climatic trends associated with great size that are general to ants. Based on analysis of their habitats, the Formiciinae were clearly thermophilic; they are only known from hot climates, with MAT > 20°C (table 1 and figure 4a). This is also supported by their great size, as almost all of the largest modern ant species are restricted to the megathermal climates of the tropics.\nThe great size of T. lubei was only exceeded by that of the largest known ants, T. giganteum and T. simillimum, the reproductives of which are estimated to have had the mass of a small bird ; indeed, the body of T. lubei is larger than that of a rufous hummingbird (figure 3d).\nAlthough the average size of workers within modern ant communities tends to increase with latitude [36,37], almost all of the largest individual living ant species (any caste ≥3 cm long) inhabit tropical regions with MAT over 20°C (figure 4a,b). They are scattered among subfamilies, have differing castes as the largest achieve great size by different morphologies and are widely separated on different continents.\n— Dinoponera spp. (subfamily Ponerinae): tropical Brazil, Bolivia and Peru. Dinoponera species (Dinoponera gigantea, Dinoponera lucida, Dinoponera longipes, Dinoponera mutica and Dinoponera quadriceps) reach and may exceed 30 mm in length , except Dinoponera australis (25 mm or less), whose range extends outside the tropics. They lack morphologically distinct worker and queen castes [39,40].\n— Dorylus wilverthi (subfamily Dorylinae): equatorial Africa [41–45]. The largest living ant, with queens reaching 52 mm long , similar in size to T. lubei. Great size is achieved here, however, in a much different manner: the gaster is approximately 80 per cent of body length (cf. fig. 16–13a of Hölldobler & Wilson ), compared with approximately 60 per cent in T. lubei. Queens show a suite of characteristics restricted to legionary ants, including physogastry, where the gaster becomes swollen, distended with sclerites widely separated by a membrane, containing expanded ovaries that allow rapid production of large numbers of eggs and so extremely large colonies [42,47,48].\n— Myrmecia brevinoda (subfamily Myrmeciinae): eastern Australia . Major workers reach 36 mm and queens 31 mm in length . Only a subset of those ant groups synonymized as M. brevinoda reach lengths over 3 cm [52,53].\nSeven of these eight species inhabit distinctly megathermal environments (figure 4a,b): the five large Dinoponera species have a distribution with a median MAT of 25.7°C, with a CQMT of 23.9°C; D. wilverthi median MAT is 24.7°C, CQMT 23.4°C; and C. gigas median MAT is 25.3°C, CQMT 24.2°C. Only M. brevinoda breaks this pattern, with a range extending through eastern Australia from the hot tropics of northern Queensland (approx. 16° S) south to warm-temperate Victoria (approx. 39° S). This is, then, the only modern ant species of this great size that includes part of its range outside of the tropics. The species, as it is currently defined, however, includes those that Clark  discussed to be over 3 cm in length as a subset, as well as various groups whose largest individuals (any caste) are recorded only reaching about 24 mm in length. The records of great size appear to be only from Queensland and adjoining northern New South Wales, i.e. the northern part of this range . The range of M. brevinoda as a whole has a median MAT of 17.0°C and a CQMT of 11.6°C. The range of Clark's  larger form, however, has a nearly megathermal MAT of 19.4°C and a CQMT of 14.3°C.\nAll of these modern ants inhabit mesic to wet climates, in agreement with MAP estimates for Messel, Puryear (new analyses here) and Green River  (see the electronic supplementary material, table S1). The Eocene Arctic was probably a rainforest [15,16], so moisture availability would not have been a barrier.\nHigh temperatures extended well out of the modern tropical belt in the Eocene [15–18,22,23,54–56]. Formiciines are exclusively known from climates with an estimated MAT of about 20°C or greater; MAT of Messel, Puryear and Bournemouth were all megathermal. The climate of the Farson Fish Beds within which T. lubei was recovered has not been characterized, but estimates for comparable Green River Formation localities indicate similarly hot conditions (table 1 and figure 4a).\nThe cooler, microthermal to lower mesothermal [54,55] early Eocene Okanagan Highlands localities of far-western North America bear a number of ant species over 1.5 cm in length—in one case greater than 2.5 cm—but none are known to reach 3 cm [9,57]. A species from the early Eocene Danish Fur Formation is also about 2.5 cm long [9,58]. Ants from the late Eocene cool upland at Florissant, Colorado and from Palaeocene and Eocene ambers (Sakhalin, Baltic, Ukranian, etc.; indeed, any amber) are not known to reach such sizes (e.g. [59–63]).\n(c) Eocene Arctic climate, hyperthermal events and intercontinental dispersal\nThermophilic organisms face physiological barriers to dispersal outside of the high MAT climate spaces to which they are adapted [12,23,64]. Eocene Arctic fossil floras indicate that temperate (i.e. upper microthermal to lower mesothermal) conditions predominated across intercontinental connections, with early to middle Eocene floras from Greenland and Axel Heiberg Island (50–40 Myr ago) giving MAT estimates of 12–16°C, probably too cool to support dispersal of Formiciinae throughout much of the time when this must have occurred [12–16]. Brief, cyclic warming events of approximately 2–4°C possibly driven by ventilation of oceanic carbonates were unlikely to have been of sufficient intensity to facilitate formiciine dispersal . However, during larger global hyperthermal events linked to injection of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere from sedimentary reservoirs, Arctic MAT increased by 5–10°C to perhaps approximately 23°C, with the coldest month mean temperature greater than 8°C at approximately 85° N palaeolatitude , which would have been suitable for formiciine dispersal across high latitudes. These include the brief (approx. 170 kyr) Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum at the Palaeocene–Eocene boundary (about 55.5 Ma); the Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (about 53.5 Ma); and the longer Early Eocene Climatic Optimum, about 2 Myr of the latest early Eocene [14,17,18]. That is, the early Eocene physical bridge between Europe and North America that was normally climatically impassable for Formiciinae must have had episodic openings of a physiological gate allowing the dispersal of these giant ants and other thermophilic organisms across the Arctic.\nWe thank L.

{"question":"How do warbler species' physical characteristics compare between spectacled and magnolia warblers, and what are their respective habitat preferences?","answer":"Spectacled warblers are brownish-grey birds measuring around 13 centimeters, primarily feeding on small insects and found across the Mediterranean region and Macaronesia. Magnolia warblers are slightly smaller, measuring 11-13 cm, with distinctive breeding males showing white, gray, and black backs, yellow sides, and black-striped stomachs. They have white wing bars and black tails with white stripes underneath. While spectacled warblers inhabit Mediterranean regions, magnolia warblers breed in dense coniferous forests in northern Canada and parts of the US, migrating to Mexico and Central America during winter.","context":["Male spectacled warblers are innovative singersJanuary 14th, 2014 in Biology / Plants & Animals\nCredit: Ana Plamero\nThe several variables in the song of every male spectacled warbler could play a crucial role in the mating, defending territory and recognition between individuals of this species. Studying their acoustic signals will help to understand how this bird, with a small brain and limited social needs, can use a complex system of communication.\nEach male specimen of spectacled warbler, Sylvia conspicillata, has a complex, diverse song, in which new syllables are added and the order is changed as they go along, with a level of skill that relies on their capacity for innovation. Spanish scientists have characterised the acoustic signal of this species, its virtuosity and variability, to try to understand the role that this signal plays in mating, defending territory and recognising individual birds.\nThe data collected in the study, published in the 'Bioacoustics' journal, will help to understand how a species with a small brain and limited social requirements could show such a complex system of communication.\n\"The fact that the spectacled warbler does not have a fixed, characteristic song but rather has variable elements makes it an attractive object of study,\" Ana María Palmero, one of the authors of the study, a researcher in the Island Ecology and Evolution Research Group (IPNA-CSIC) and the Department of Ecology and Genetics at the University of La Laguna, explains to SINC.\nThe Sylvia conspicillata is a brownish-grey small bird of around 13 centimetres, which feeds primarily on small insects. Populations of the species can be found across the whole Mediterranean region and the Macaronesia, including the Canary Islands, Madeira and Cape Verde.\nIts call, which has a wide repertoire, has been described by experts as a high-pitched chirp organised in song phrases of a variable number of syllables which determines the length of the song bout. The spectacled warbler can also emit a warning call similar to a metallic sound, defined by the researchers as a trill.\nA wide repertoire\n\"The reasons why these birds vary their calls are purely speculative, since in this aspect of the research we are only able to observe repertoire changes and the appearance of new syllables. The next thing will be to try to understand the causes of such complexity, whether it is due to biotic or abiotic factors,\" the researcher asserts.\nIt is common among birds for each male of the species to have his own song. \"However, it is more usual for each individual's phrases to be repeated and be practically identical, quite opposite to what is observed in the spectacled warbler, where we find great variation both within and between individuals,\" Palmero elaborates.\nThe researchers studied the population of this species on the island of Fuerteventura, as it has a higher density of individuals, and they evaluated the repertoire and variation of the spectrum of notes of each individual and as a group.\nThe scientists revealed that each bird's acoustic signal is organised in a variable number of song phrases composed of various syllables, from four to 69, and they characterised them into short, average and long song bouts. To study each one's song, they also measured 11 spectrotemporal variations of the phrases.\nOf the variables measured, those that could be more important when it comes to differentiating individuals are the duration of the first syllable and the duration and dominant frequency of the trill syllable.\n\"Song can be influential in a female's choice of mate, as females are more attracted to male birds with larger repertoires,\" Palmero informs us. The researcher also speculates that, \"trill variation could help identify the singer quickly, although this hypothesis would have to be analysed using playback studies and field experiments.\"\nMore information: Ana María Palmero, Juan Carlos Illera, Paola Laiolo, \"Song characterization in the spectacled warbler (Sylvia conspicillata): a circum-Mediterranean species with a complex song structure\" Published in Bioacoustics.\nProvided by Plataforma SINC\n\"Male spectacled warblers are innovative singers.\" January 14th, 2014. http://phys.org/news/2014-01-male-spectacled-warblers-singers.html","Nombre en español: Reinita Magnolia\nNombre en inglés: Magnolia Warbler\nNombre científico: Setophaga magnolia\nLa reinita de magnolia (Setophaga magnolia), también denominada, chipe de magnolia, bijirita magnolia, cigüita magnolia y reinita manchada, es una especie de ave migratoria del orden Passeriformes y la familia Parulidae. Anida en Canadá y Estados Unidos y pasa el invierno en México, América Central y las Antillas.\nLa Reinita Magnolia cría en el norte de América e inverna desde México hasta el centro de Panamá y es errante en Colombia con muy pocos registros. Su nombre se debe a que el ornitólogo Alexander Wilson obtuvo el primer especímen de un arbol del género magnolia y utizó este nombre en Latin pero con el tiempo se convirtío en su nombre común.\nLos adultos en primavera y verano son de cara negra con una línea supraocular blanca y la corona gris. Las partes ventrales y la rabadilla son amarillos. En el pecho y los costados hay rayas negras. Las partes dorsales —a excepción de la rabadilla— son negruzcas. En las alas hay un parche blanco muy evidente, y en la cola una banda blanca que la cruza a la mitad.\nEn otoño e invierno los adultos son oliváceos de las partes dorsales y amarillos en las ventrales. se conserva el amarillo de la rabadilla, los parches blancos en alas y cola y un tenue rayado en los costados del pecho.\nTamaño y Forma\nMide 11 cm y pesa alrededor de 8 gr. Por encima es oliva opaco con la cabeza grisácea y área periocular blanca. sucola es de color negro en la punta con grandes manchas blancas que forman una banda en ambos lados de la cola. La rabadilla y la mayoría de sus partes inferiores son de color amarillo con estrias negruzcas a los lados. Los machos en estado reproductivo tienen máscara negra, corta superciliar blanca, espalda negruzaca, parche blanco en cobertoras alares y debajo es amarillo brillante con fuerte estriado negro. Las hembras son similares, excepto que tienen más blanco en sus alas, sus colores suelen ser un poco más apagados, y sus patrones menos claros que el de los machos.\nSuele ser muy facil de distinguir debido a la combinacion de rabadilla amarilla y bandas blancas caudales.\nSe considera una especie monotípica.\nLa Reinita Magnolia suele ser errante en Colombia y es muy poco común con registros en el norte del país, el departamento de Antioquia y el Parque Nacional Katios. Cría en Norteamérica e inverna desde México hasta el centro de Panamá.\nHabita en bosques húmedos de coníferas generalmente en la parte baja de los árboles. Durante el invierno ha sido reportada en áreas abiertas con árboles dispersos, matorrales y bosques de galería.\nThe magnolia warbler (Setophaga magnolia) is a member of the wood warbler family Parulidae.\nThe genus name Setophaga is from Ancient Greek ses, «moth», and phagos, «eating», and the specific magnolia refers to the type locality. American ornithologist Alexander Wilson found this species in magnolias near Fort Adams, Mississippi.\nThis species is a moderately small New World warbler. It measures 11 to 13 cm (4.3 to 5.1 in) in length and spans 16 to 20 cm (6.3 to 7.9 in) across the wings. Body mass in adult birds can range from 6.6 to 12.6 g (0.23 to 0.44 oz), though weights have reportedly ranged up to 15 g (0.53 oz) prior to migration. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 5.4 to 6.4 cm (2.1 to 2.5 in), the tail is 4.6 to 5.2 cm (1.8 to 2.0 in), the bill is 0.8 to 1 cm (0.31 to 0.39 in) and the tarsus is 1.7 to 1.85 cm (0.67 to 0.73 in). The magnolia warbler can be distinguished by its coloration. The breeding males often have white, gray, and black backs with yellow on the sides; yellow and black-striped stomachs; white, gray, and black foreheads and beaks; distinct black tails with white stripes on the underside; and defined white patches on their wings, called wing bars. Breeding females usually have the same type of coloration as the males, except that their colors are much duller. Immature warblers also resemble the same dull coloration of the females. The yellow and black-striped stomachs help one to distinguish the males from other similar birds, like the prairie warbler and Kirtland’s warbler (which, however, have a breeding range to the south and east of the magnolia warbler’s).\nThe magnolia warbler is found in the northern parts of some Midwestern states and the very northeastern parts of the US, with states such as Minnesota and Wisconsin comprising its southernmost boundaries. However, it is mostly found across the northern parts of Canada, such as in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. During the winter, the warbler migrates through the eastern half of the United States to southern Mexico and Central America. The warbler breeds in dense forests, where it will most likely be found among the branches of young, densely packed, coniferous trees. The magnolia warbler migrates to the warmer south in the winter, wintering in southeastern Mexico, Panama, and parts of the Caribbean. In migration it passes through the eastern part of the United States as far west as Oklahoma and Kansas. During migration season, the magnolia warbler can be found in various types of woodlands.\nThe magnolia warbler undergoes multiple molts during its lifetime. The first molts begin while the young offspring are still living in the nest, while the rest take place on or near their breeding grounds. The warblers molt, breed, care for their offspring, and then migrate. Chicks hatch after a two-week incubation period, and can fledge from the nest after close to another two weeks when their feathers are more developed. After about a month, the chicks can leave the nest to begin living (and later breeding) on their own since they are solitary birds. Magnolia warblers typically live up to seven years.\nDiet and feeding\nThis warbler usually eats any type of arthropod, but their main delicacies are caterpillars. The warbler also feeds on different types of beetles, butterflies, spiders, and fruit during their breeding season, while they increase their intake of both fruit and nectar during the winter. These birds also tend to eat parts of the branches of mid-height coniferous trees, such as spruce firs, in their usual breeding habitat.\nResearchers have observed two different types of songs in male magnolia warblers. Their songs have been referred to as the First Category song and the Second Category song. Females have not been observed to have a distinct song yet as the males have; while they do sing, they don’t have separate songs for different situations. In general, the male warblers use their songs during the spring migration season and during the breeding season: one is used for courtship and the other is used to mark their territory each day. Both males and females have call notes that they use for various alerts: the females have short call notes to signal when a human observer is watching them, and the males have short call notes to signal when any sort of threatening predators are close to their offspring.\nMale magnolia warblers go to their breeding grounds about two weeks before the females arrive. After the females come to the breeding grounds, both the males and females cooperate to build the nest for a week. Because of the difficulty of locating their nests among the forest’s dense undergrowth, it is hard to know whether the warblers re-use their original nests each breeding season, or whether they abandon them for new ones. The nests are built in their tree of choice – different types of fir trees, such as Abies balsamea (balsam fir) and Picea glauca (spruce fir). The nest is made up of grass, twigs, and horsehair fungus, and they are relatively small, shallow, circular-shaped nests, barely exceeding 10 cm on all sides. The nests are usually found close to the ground, commonly in the lowest three meters of the firs.\nFemale magnolia warblers usually lay three to five eggs during each breeding season. The female will not incubate her eggs until all of them are laid. The female sits on the eggs for about two weeks before the eggs hatch. The female is also the one that warms the newborn chicks by brooding, or sitting, on the nest; she is also the one who feeds the newborn chicks most frequently, though the males also engage in feeding the offspring at times. Because the males are technically as equally responsible for feeding the newborns as the females are, this means that the males are monogamous because they expend a large amount of energy looking for food for their young. In order to keep the nest clean, females eat the fecal sacs of their newborns; as the chicks grow older, both parents simply remove the sacs from the nest. The baby warblers are ready to fly out of the nest by the time they are ten days old.\nThe magnolia warbler is assessed on the IUCN Red List as least concern for conservation because it is fairly widespread and common within its habitat and not at risk of extinction. Research has shown that a good percentage of warblers die from flying into television towers in their migratory path. Also, parts of their habitat have been degraded as coniferous forests are cleared which causes the number of warblers living in a habitat to decrease, but they certainly are not greatly affected by the deforestation. While the deforestation does decrease the warbler population in the specific area that it occurs in, the species is not significantly impacted overall due to the general abundance of the species throughout the region.\nJohn James Audubon illustrated the magnolia warbler in The Birds of America, Second Edition (published, London 1827–38) as Plate 123 under the title, «Black & Yellow Warbler – Sylvia maculosa» where a pair of birds (male and female) are shown searching flowering raspberry for insects. The image was engraved and colored by Robert Havell’s London workshops. The original watercolor by Audubon was purchased by the New York History Society."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:104a6654-498c-4d5b-9d74-c9eec05a33b7>","<urn:uuid:aafd749e-c923-498c-b7a3-93d99c7655cb>"],"error":null}

The building has always doubled as a venue to showcase public art and that role has grown with the reconstruction, which includes new pieces commissioned through the Regional Arts & Culture Council (RACC). RACC’s Public Art Program acquires and cares for publicly owned art.\nA local panel of artists, curators, community members and city staff worked for several years to commission and purchase these artworks for the Portland Building as part of the City’s 2% for Art requirement. The current installations, located on the first and second floors of the building, are part of the first phase of art selected and created specifically for the building.\nPlease note, to protect public health, the Portland Building is currently closed to the public.the City of Portland is postponing the grand reopening of the Portland Building scheduled for Thursday, March 19. All Design Week Portland events are rescheduled for August 2020.\nNew commissioned artworks installed to date in the Portland Building\nRefik Anadol Studio, Data Crystal: Portland\nOne of the most impactful aspects of the building renovation is the addition of a large window wall and gathering space on the east side facing Chapman Square. Today, people passing by on Fourth Avenue can gaze into the building through the double-height wall of glass and see Refik Anadol Studio’s large-scale, 3-D printed, A.I. data sculpture, Data Crystal: Portland, which was designed specifically for the Portland Building.\nThe artwork is visible to building visitors from both the first and second floor. It represents the material connections that emerge from invisible interactions between fellow city dwellers by combining art, technology, and the interconnected communities of Portland. Anadol was inspired by the last line of Ronald Talney’s poem, inscribed on the plaque that accompanies Raymond Kaskey’s sculpture Portlandia, “This is how the world knows where we are.”\nThe visuals projected on to the sculpture were conceived by Anadol in partnership with the mind of a machine, utilizing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms trained on a data set of nine million publicly available photographs and digitized archival documents of Portland. The shape of the 3-D printed structure on which the visuals are projected was also informed by the same data set, but created by using advanced robotic 3D printing and A.I. technologies.\nFor this artwork, Anadol theorized that with today’s technology, it’s nearly impossible to get lost in this world – both geographically and historically. With every photograph taken, a digital memory is captured, and a virtual record of a specific time and place is recorded. These memories are “crystalized” when shared publicly. When aggregated, the repeated acts of sharing digital memories eventually solidifies the collective memory of a specific place.\nPortlandia, Raymond Kaskey\nGet up close and personal with the iconic Portlandia statue from a new publicly-accessible balcony, or with a smaller, 3-D print located at the top of the second floor stairs, made with the partnership of local Portland business, Form 3D Foundry. Originally installed in 1985, Portlandia by Raymond Kaskey, is the second-largest hammered-copper (or repoussé) sculpture in the United States, and was rededicated in 2019 as part of the building reconstruction. Tag your photos of either version of this Portland icon to #weareportlandia.\nNeither Here Nor There, Shelby Davis and Crystal Schenk\nLocated on the first floor adjacent to the building’s front entrance, is Neither Here Nor There by husband and wife artist team Shelby Davis and Crystal Schenk. Together the two transformed a huge, 100-year-old silver maple removed from the Laurelhurst neighborhood in 2015. Extracting the tree itself was a labor of love, involving large cranes and slabbing the trunk with a rare ten-foot chainsaw. But the stunning material lives on, reborn, in the renovated building. The installation includes several hand-carved and meticulously crafted wooden benches where visitors can sit, as well as hanging shelves and floating sculptural pieces suspended from the ceiling.\nTopography from around the state was computer modeled and fit to some of the biggest boards from the tree’s trunk and then cut to relief on a computer-controlled (CNC) router. Afterward, each piece was carefully glued together, hand carved, and sanded. Glass castings implanted in the floating panoramas, with their shift of scale, create new perspectives on the familiar. Their subtle and grander shapes recall actual time spent in those landscape folds – creating memories and inspiring visitors with a sense of connection and curiosity.

Does art education correlate with achievement in other academic areas? What are the social outcomes of art programs in public schools? Is there research to support evidence-based practice in art instruction? Arts education in public schools is an area rich in policy questions, and because it affects public funding distribution, it is an ideal subject for a by-the-numbers assessment.\nLearning through the arts reinforces critical academic skills in reading, language arts and math and provides students with the skills to creatively solve problems.\nA simple way to assess the importance and impact of arts education programs on students is to look at the academic, psychological and social effects of arts education on urban schools. It is important to note that urban public schools often serve greater numbers of students of low socioeconomic standing (SES) and English Language Learners (ELL), in addition to special needs students1. The Institute of Education Sciences Condition of Education Report found that in 2012-2013, higher concentrations of students from low SES backgrounds (those who qualified for free lunch programs) and minority students were enrolled in urban public schools than in suburban or rural schools.2\nUrban Schools Have Unequal Access to Arts Education\nUnfortunately, in many districts arts education has borne the brunt of funding cuts as school districts made changes to accommodate No Child Left Behind policies, and then in the wake of cutbacks during the Great Recession of the late 2000s. The difficulty in maintaining arts education continues in an environment of severe teacher shortages. Cuts to the arts come at a time when the creativity and mode of thinking that arts education fosters is perhaps most needed by students. They must navigate a competitive higher education landscape and job market that place value on individuals savvy in art applications, especially digital art.\nArts education aids students in skills needed in the workplace: flexibility, the ability to solve problems and communicate, the ability to learn new skills, to be creative and innovative, and to strive for excellence.\nUrban schools especially have struggled to maintain arts programming. A new analysis, “Equity, the Arts, and Urban Education: A Review” published by The Urban Review, found that student access to arts education declined from 65 percent in 1982 to a low of 50 percent in 2008, and that access fell more sharply for black and Hispanic students than for their white counterparts.3 Urban schools, the schools that most often fail to meet state standards across multiple years, also tend to have a much higher population of disadvantaged students. Under No Child Left Behind legislation, underperforming schools were forced to reduce their arts programming in order to devote more time to math and language arts teaching and test preparation, according to The Urban Review report. However, research demonstrates that this policy lacks effectiveness and creates a dearth of arts education in urban schools.\nA 2012 study, “The Effects of High-Stakes Testing Policy on Arts Education,” noted that withholding arts education in order to designate more time for standardized testing subjects did not improve test scores.4 It actually correlated with lower scores at some schools. As explained below, access to arts education improves students’ psychological, social and academic outcomes.\nKey Takeaway: Arts education is often among the first areas to receive cuts due to funding or state standardized test score requirements. However, studies show that cutting arts education may in fact lead to lower student test scores.\nMore Art Equals More Achievement\nMore than two decades of research is available on the academic outcomes of arts education programming. A pivotal 2000 study, “SAT Scores of Students Who Study the Arts,” demonstrates that strong support for arts education has a positive effect on academic outcomes. The study found that the more years of art classes a student engaged in, the higher his or her SAT score was, especially when four or more years of art classes had been taken.5\nThose findings were strengthened by a 2009 study, “Doing Well and Doing Good by Doing Art,” by James Catterall. The study followed 12,000 students, tracking their academic development from age 18 to 26. Catterall found that SES students who engaged in the arts showed significantly higher rates of college attendance, favorable college grades, and better job opportunities. Additionally, this study noted that ELL students showed improved academic performance in schools that offered more arts education.6\nA 2014 study, “Positive Impact of Arts Integration on Student Academic Achievement in English Language Arts,” likewise noted that arts education has a broad impact, improving academic outcomes in other subjects.7 With a focus on the importance of standardized test scores, this study found that schools that introduced art concepts into lessons on other topics saw an 11 percent increase in the number of students that scored proficient on ELA standardized testing.\nThe arts significantly boost student achievement, reduce discipline problems, and increase the odds students will go on to graduate from college.\nArts education research is also available on subject-specific achievement:\n- Strengthening Verbal Skills Through the Use of Classroom Drama: A Clear Link,” by Ann Podlozny: This study found a statistically significant relationship between drama integration and story recall, reading achievement on standardized tests, language development, and writing ability.8\n- “Music and Mathematics: Modest Support for the Oft-Claimed Relationship,” by Kathryn Vaughn: This meta-analysis found a significant relationship between music instruction and math achievement.9\n- “Arts Integration and the Success of Disadvantaged Students: A Research Evaluation,” by A. Helene Robinson: This study found that drama integration might be regarded as an evidence-based practice for increasing disadvantaged students’ grades in reading and math, social skills, expressive and receptive language, and creative thinking.10\nBut why does art education boost student’s achievement in other subjects? Some researchers point to social cognitive theory as an explanation. The theory proposes that we learn through association, through forming connections between things. The more mediums involved in learning, the more opportunities there are for connections to be made and strengthened. For example, if you could choose between watching an all-text presentation on a topic or a presentation that included diagrams and pictures, you’d probably chose the latter — not only is it more engaging, the material would be easier to understand.\nArts Education Leads to Pro-Social Outcomes\nResearch has demonstrated that students who receive arts education are more likely to participate in pro-social activities. In “No Child Left With Crayons,” Sharon Verner Chappell and Melisa Cahnmann-Taylor explain, “When students engage in arts processes, they develop distinct and complementary social practices: developing craft, engaging and persisting, envisioning, expressing, observing, reflecting, stretching and exploring, and understanding art worlds.” This study suggests that arts education is an outlet for students to recognize how the world views them and how they wish to be seen. It proposes that arts programming in schools and in the community that draws inspiration from the language and culture of disadvantaged populations promotes positive social critique and advocacy for justice.11\nAdditionally, the study by Robinson found that arts education promoted schools environments that were “collaborative, caring, and inclusive of students with special needs.”12 Arts education was also seen as fostering greater volunteerism and political participation.13\nArts Education Fosters Positive Psychological Development\nA recent study found that students who received 15 weeks of dance or music instruction showed decreases in their depression scores on the Children’s Depression Inventory. Additionally, the students who received music instruction showed an increase in their self-esteem scores after the 15 weeks, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Additionally, both dance and music groups showed an increase in executive functioning skills, including time-management, focus, decision-making, and planning.\nThe arts are not a frill. The arts are a response to our individuality and our nature, and help to shape our identity. What is there that can transcend deep difference and stubborn divisions? The arts. They have a wonderful universality. Art has the potential to unify. It can speak in many languages without a translator. The arts do not discriminate. The arts can lift us up.\nAccess to arts education has many benefits both inside and outside of the classroom. Research suggests that arts programming may lead to greater academic achievement in terms of test scores, may enhance prosocial skills such as community involvement and volunteerism, and likewise may play a role in the development of important cognitive skills including planning and decision-making. Thus, arts education could serve as an important tool for disadvantaged and urban schools in meeting both academic and social goals.\n1 Barnett, B. G., & Stevenson, H.

{"question":"What role did eucalyptus trees play in both military strategy and memorials during and after the Six Day War, and how are they connected to Holocaust remembrance in Cleveland?","answer":"Eucalyptus trees played a dual role in military strategy and memorialization. During his spy mission in Syria, Eli Cohen convinced the Syrian military to plant eucalyptus trees at each of their bunkers, allowing Israeli forces to identify Syrian army bases. Today, these same eucalyptus trees provide shade for benches at Mitzpe Gadot, a memorial site at a former Syrian base. In Cleveland, while not involving eucalyptus trees specifically, Holocaust remembrance is marked by a different type of memorial - a 17-foot tall monument at Zion Memorial Cemetery, which features panels depicting Holocaust victims and hosts annual memorial services between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.","context":["BY VARDA LITTMANN, PHOTOS BY RIMONAH TRAUB\nThe 19 years from the time of the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 until the Six Day War were a\nliving nightmare for members of the kibbutzim in the Hula Valley. Trigger-happy Syrian troops, stationed above in the Golan Heights, fired incessantly on the residents below, and more than 400 shooting incidents occurred. Over a thousand shells were fired at Kibbutz Gadot alone on one terrible day. Children played, studied and slept inside underground shelters as farmers tilled their fields, constantly accompanied by tanks. In fact, the children of the area very called “yaldei hamiklatim — children of the shelters.”\nAt the beginning of the Six Day War General Moshe Dayan had no intention of capturing the Golan, but\nbecause many high army officials were members of the Hula kibbutzim, they pressured him to retaliate on the Heights. With the help of Hashem, the area was captured.\nMitzpe Gadot is located where there was once a Syrian bunker. Captured in the Six Day War, this area has been turned into a tourist site, as well as a memorial spot. At Mitzpe Gadot there is a tall, triangular concrete monument to commemorate fallen Israeli soldiers of the 33rd Battalion of the Golani Brigade, located at one of the former Syrian bases. This was the site of very harsh battles during the 1967 war. Also memorialized here are boys from the same battalion who were killed during the Yom Kippur War in 1973 and in the Lebanon campaign in 1982.\nAt this site are benches shaded by eucalyptus trees, from which the beautiful eastern Hula Valley can be seen. The eucalyptuses were planted by the Syrians at the behest of Eli Cohen, a famous Israeli spy to Syria (see below.) In fact, the capture of this area is widely attributed to the intelligence provided by Cohen. An audio guide at the spot gives information and history of the area. Songs of the era of the Six Day War and the 19 terror-filled years before are inter-spaced in the facts given. As you sit there, try to imagine the fear and insecurity of spending night after night in underground shelters or plowing your fields from behind tanks due to the Syrian’s strategic advantage.\nThe outlook has been made wheelchair and strollerfriendly.\nCaution: The site of Mitzpe Gadot is safe, but don’t explore beyond any marked paths, because there may\nbe undetonated Syrian minefields.\nDirections: Off Highway 91 and 1.5 kilometers northeast of the Bnot Yaakov Bridge.\nEli Cohen (December 26, 1924 — May 18, 1965) was an Israeli spy, best known for his work in Syria. Using the alias Kamel Amin Thaabet, (commonly pronounced Saabet), he developed close relationships\nwith the political and military hierarchy and became chief adviser to the Minister of Defense. He was eventually exposed by hired Soviet experts and was executed in Syria in 1965.\nIt is told that he convinced the Syrian military to plant eucalyptus trees at the site of each of their bunkers. Eli Cohen then informed Israeli military intelligence that a eucalyptus meant a Syrian army base. He also told them an important secret plan by Syria to create three successive lines of bunkers and mortars; the Israeli military would have otherwise expected to encounter only a single line. The intelligence he gathered was an important factor in Israel’s success in the Six Day War.\nTill today, requests that his remains be returned to Israel have been denied by the Syrian government. The late Syrian leader Hafez al-Assad, said that Eli Cohen’s burial site is unknown, claiming that the Syrians buried Eli Cohen three times, to stop the remains from being brought back to Israel via a special operation.\nA memorial stone has been erected to honor Eli Cohen in the Garden of the Missing Soldiers, at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem.\nPublished in Hamodia","At the young age of fourteen in the predominantly Jewish town of Pryztyk, near Radom, Morry Malcmacher witnessed first-hand a violent pogrom fueled by his Polish neighbors. Three years later when the Germans invaded in 1939, Malcmacher found himself fighting for survival in a series of slave labor, concentration, and death camps. Upon liberation in 1945, he spent four years in a displaced persons camp in Feldafing, Germany before immigrating to the United States, ultimately settling down in University Heights. The roughly 96,000 Jewish survivors of the Holocaust that came to the US had to adjust to a new country, a new culture, and learn to live again while coming to terms with the murder of immediate family members, distant relatives, and friends. In 1959 Malcmacher and a small group of forward-thinking survivors in Cleveland laid the groundwork for a new organization that could help survivor émigrés make that transition.\nInspired by Voice of Israel, the clandestine radio station of the underground paramilitary force (Haganah) in Mandatory Palestine, the group opted for the phonetically identical, if orthographically different, name (in Hebrew) Kol Israel, or “All of Israel.” The Foundation elected its first officers in February 1960 and was chartered by the State of Ohio the following year. In 1963 the Sisterhood of Kol Israel, a division, was created to raise funds for the Foundation’s many initiatives. A third division, called Second Generation (2G), was formed in 1978 by the children of survivors with a commitment to continuing the legacy of their elders. All three divisions merged in 2013 as membership numbers dwindled. Three years later witnessed the birth of 3G (mainly the grandchildren of survivors) which has refocused Kol Israel on Holocaust education as well as efforts to curb all forms of hate and bigotry. Noteworthy is its Share Our Stories program which brings the children or grandchildren of survivors into local junior- and high-school classrooms who show and discuss recorded survivor accounts of their loved ones. And Kol Israel’s 2019 acquisition of Shaarey Tikvah’s Face to Face Holocaust education initiative reaffirms the organization’s commitment to “Never Forget.”\nIf not so clearly articulated in the formalistic language of its first charter, from the very beginning the Kol Israel Foundation has had three distinct, but related goals. For those who found themselves in Cleveland with no support network, Kol Israel privately offered financial assistance, smoothed access to vocational and housing services, and provided much needed emotional and psychological support via social gatherings and organized events. Secondly, the foundation was committed to supporting the State of Israel. From planting forests there through the Jewish National Fund, to donating ambulances to Magen David Adom (national emergency services), to buying State bonds, and giving monies to the Israeli Defense Forces, Kol Israel has been steadfast in its advocacy. The third aim from the outset has been Holocaust memorialization, in the form of holding annual Yom Hashoah events (Holocaust Remembrance Day), participating in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising Memorial Services, and most notably building one of the first Holocaust monuments of its kind in the United States. In 2009 the Jewish Federation bestowed its highest honor, the Charles Eisenman Award, on the Foundation for its exceptional civic engagement.\nThe brainchild of Kol Israel’s first treasurer, Morry Malcmacher, the matzavah (grave marker) to the memory of six million murdered Jews was originally planned for Mount Olive Cemetery, but because of space constraints, was built in Zion Memorial Cemetery in Bedford Heights. It was unveiled at a public ceremony in 1961 attended by some 600 people, including Cleveland Mayor Anthony Celebrezze, who, during a speech averred “the lesson we must learn from it [the Holocaust]…is that it must not happen again.” Israeli writer Zvi Kolitz, perhaps best known for his Yosl Rakover Talks to God, gave the keynote address.\nDesigned and installed by Kotecki Family Memorials of Cleveland, the hulking monument of French Creek granite consists of a Star of David-capped obelisk which stands 17 ft. tall sandwiched between two 14 ft. panels. Haunting engravings on those panels depict a mother with two children and a man clutching a Torah scroll, all preparing to be engulfed by flames. Inscriptions in Hebrew and English front and rear call attention to the Nazi genocide and offer solace. At the foot of the memorial lies a crypt which holds the remains of Jewish martyrs secured from Poland.\nOn that sunny spring day in 1961 Kol Israel President William Miller announced that the memorial service was to become an annual event, and the Foundation has more than made good on that promise. The non-profit’s Memorial Committee, along with its co-sponsor the Jewish Federation of Cleveland, continues to hold the memorial service at the site between the Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. The family and friends of victims attend this solemn event which features a candle-lighting ceremony and the Kaddish, or Mourner’s Prayer. Each spring, the co-sponsors also hold a Holocaust Remembrance Day Event, wherein local dignitaries, religious leaders, survivors, liberators, and the public gather to commemorate the Shoah (Destruction). A granite knee wall, which has surrounded the monument since 1996, lists the names of some 1,300 victims and survivors who have since died, a jarring reminder of not only the duty to bear witness, but also just how much the legacy of the Holocaust has impacted Cleveland and the community. The Ohio History Connection of Columbus recognized that impact in 2017 by installing an Ohio Historical Marker.\nSeveral hundred Holocaust survivors still live in the Cleveland area and the Kol Israel Foundation continues to support this vulnerable, yet dwindling population. Even when the last survivor has passed on, their mission to keep memory alive and combat intolerance via educational initiatives means the Foundation is well-positioned to carry on that most important of Jewish values, tikuun olaam (mending the world) in the 21st century."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:28e0c6d7-245a-48e2-8175-ce56df0dc02c>","<urn:uuid:8be0bdcb-d138-4aad-851c-69534ad6337d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm considering recycling aluminum vs steel - which of these metals requires more energy savings when recycled compared to using raw materials? 🤔","answer":"Aluminum shows significantly greater energy savings compared to steel when recycled. According to the EPA data, producing aluminum from ore requires 250 Million BTU, while using recycled aluminum scrap only needs 12.5 Million BTU - a 95% energy reduction. This is also evidenced by the fact that producing new aluminum cans from recycled ones uses 95% less energy than producing from virgin aluminum ore. For steel, while specific BTU comparisons aren't given, we know that recycling one ton of steel conserves 2,500 pounds of iron ore, 1,400 pounds of coal and 120 pounds of limestone, representing significant but comparatively smaller energy savings.","context":["If you are an environmentally conscious consumer, you probably work hard to recycle many items that you use every day, such as paper, cans, plastic, glass bottles, etc. But did you know that you can also recycle many metal objects such as metal lamps, equipment, home appliances, metal tools, metal hangers, foil, aluminum cans and even your old car? In fact, car recycling is a quickly growing segment of the recycling industry, and you can even get paid for recycling your old car, rather than having it take up space in your back yard, or waste away at a junk yard.\nBy recycling metal you are actively helping to lower energy waste, to reduce green house gas emissions, and to conserve precious natural resources needed to produce new metal products. Today, in the US alone, according to the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) there are “150 million metric tons of scrap materials recycled annually including: 81.6 million tons of iron and steel, 5 million tons of aluminum, 1.8 million tons of copper and 2 million tons of stainless steel”, and you can help these statistics grow by choosing to recycle your own old metal products.\nHow does scrap metal recycling work?\nDepending on what metal product is being recycled, there are a number of ways the recycling process can take place. If you are purchasing new home appliances or large metal equipment, you can ask the company that you purchase from to take away the old appliances, and they will take care of recycling it for you. You can also take smaller metal items that you have to a nearby metal recycling center and they will be happy to take them and will even pay you for bringing them in. The same goes for old cars. Once the cost of repairing your old car exceeds its value, it has reached the end of its life and a metal recycling company will pay you and take it away to be recycled. Interestingly, when it comes to old metal hangers, they are typically not accepted at the recycling facilities, but you can still recycle them by donating them to your local dry cleaners, who will happily take them in.\nAt recycling facilities, metal products are dismantled, compressed into flat shapes for ease of processing, and separated into 3 categories: iron and steel, nonferrous metal, and non-metallic scrap. The metals are then shredded into smaller pieces, while the non-metallic scrap is dumped into a landfill. Finally the shredded metal is shipped off to other facilities where it gets reused in new products.\nFacts on Recycling Aluminum Products (Cans)\n-Aluminum is a highly durable, long lasting metal: 2/3 of aluminum ever produced are still in use today.\n-Over 50% of aluminum cans produced are recycled in as little as 60 days.\n– According the ISRI, recycling aluminum conserves up to 8 tons bauxite ore and 14 megawatt hours of electricity.\n– It takes 95% less energy to produce a new can from a recycled one. This means than 20 recycled cans are produced using the energy to produce one can from virgin aluminum ore.\n-When you throw away an aluminum can, you actually waste as much energy as pouring out half of that can’s volume of gasoline.\nFacts on Recycling Steel Products (ELVs)\n– Cars are the most recycled consumer product. In fact, in EU car manufactures are responsible by law for the disposal of the vehicles they manufacture through the mandatory recycling and take-back programs.\n-Every year the steel industry in the US recycles more than 14 million tons of steel from old cars (ELVs), which is equivalent to about 13 million vehicles.\n-Steel can be recycled repeatedly without loss of quality or strength, which makes it the most recycled material in the world.\n-Steel used to make car bodies is typically 25% recycled.\n-The Motor and Equipment Manufactures Association reports that over 76% of each scrap vehicle is recycled.\n– According to the ISRI, recycling one ton of steel conserves 2,500 pounds of iron ore, 1,400 pounds of coal and 120 pounds of limestone.","Reducing waste, reusing materials and products, and recycling are some of the most powerful ways individuals, households, and businesses can protect the environment.\nHere's why you should get involved:\n- Saving natural resources: Reusing discarded products and using recycled materials to make new products reduces the use of virgin materials, which often involves harvesting trees and mining the earth. Even better, “source reducing” waste — or avoiding the generation of discards in the first place — saves the most resources of all.\n- Preventing environmental problems that come from landfills: Few people want a landfill in their neighborhood. Unfortunately, we will need landfills as long as we choose to dispose of waste. Although landfills today are much safer than 20 years ago, they are still a poor use of land and a potential source of groundwater contamination and releases of methane and other gases.\n- Saving energy: Enormous amounts of energy are required to make products and materials worldwide. Energy is saved by not using products and materials when at all possible, or by reusing products in their current form. Tremendous energy savings come from using recycled instead of virgin materials in manufacturing.\n- Preventing pollution: Almost all manufacturing processes use water and release wastewater and air emissions into the environment. Reducing and reusing products cuts down on manufacturing pollution, just as the use of recycled instead of virgin materials prevents pollution in industrial processes.\n- Saving money: Households can save money by reusing materials and products and by practicing smart shopping habits that reduce waste.\nReducing the amount of waste you generate is a great step to take towards helping the environment. There are several things that you\n- Use tote bags or bins when shopping, say no to the plastic shopping bag.\n- Select packaging that does not have a lot of excess waste.\n- Use dinnerware that can be washed instead of paper plates and plastic ware.\n- Only buy things that you will use in the immediate future.\nMany commonly discarded items — from single-sided paper to clothing to televisions — are readily reusable in their current form.\nInstead of tossing an item in the trash can or recycling bin, consider ways it might still be usable to you or someone else, or whether it can be repaired if needed.\nGive your discards a chance at a second life by holding a yard sale or donating items to Goodwill, the Salvation Army, Habitat for Humanity, or other charitable outlets.

Many materials can be recycled. Some of the most common are:\nNewspaper Aluminum Cans\nCardboard Steel Cans\nWriting/Copy Paper Plastic Bottles\nMixed Household Paper Glass Bottles and Jars\nMagazines End of Life Electronics\n- Americans represent only five percent of the world's population, but generate 30 percent of the world's garbage.\n- Recycling one ton of old paper saves 17 trees; 2 barrels of oil (enough to run an average car for 1,260 miles); 4,100 kilowatts of energy (enough power for the average home for 6 months); 3.2 cubic yards of landfill space; 7,000 gallons of wate; and 60 pounds of air pollution.\n- Every day, U.S. paper makers recycle enough paper to fill a train of boxcars 15 miles long.\n- If we recycled all of the newspapers printed in the U.S. on a typical Sunday, we would save about 550,000 trees.\n- Recycling the steel from six cars can provide enough steel framing for a 2000 square foot building.\n- The energy saved each year by steel recycling is equal to the electrical power used by 18 million homes each year -- or enough energy to last Irondequoit residents eight hundred years!\n- The steel industry recycles almost 19 billion steel cans into new products each year – about 600 cans recycled every second.\n- Recycling one aluminum can saves enough energy to power a television for three hours.\n- Americans throw away enough aluminum to rebuild our entire commercial fleet of airplanes every 3 months.\n- Aluminum cans produced in the United States can contain at least 50 percent recycled content.\n- Recycling one glass bottle saves enough electricity to light a 60-watt bulb for four hours.\n- If not recycled, one quart of used motor oil could pollute 250,000 gallons of drinking water.\n- Half of all polyester carpet made in the United States is made from recycled plastic (PT).\n- Energy saved from recycling helps the environment by reducing energy-related air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\nRemember - Recycle Today for Tomorrow !\n- Buy recycled products. If we want recycling to work, we must support manufacturers who use recycled materials in their products (post-consumer recycled content) -- whether in the products themselves or the packages they come in. Favor products with a high recycled content, even if they cost a little more. Look to buy more durable, less toxic and products with less packaging. Also, buy only what you need and use what you buy.\n- Consider packaging. Buy products that use less unnecessary packaging or packaging that can be recycled. If you really like or need a certain product with excess packaging contact the manufacturer and suggest that they use less packaging or recyclable packaging.\n- Use Common Services: for example, using the library instead of buying books, or renting tools instead of buying them.\nBuy to reduce waste. Buy in bulk, buy items in recyclable packaging, and avoid disposable items. Use your own reusable canvas bag when you shop.\nMake recycling an everyday activity. Encourage everyone you know to recycle. Share with others. Before throwing away unwanted, but still good, items, check with charitable organizations.

{"question":"How do the baking temperatures differ between buttermilk pie crust and graham cracker crust?","answer":"The buttermilk pie crust requires a higher baking temperature of 400°F for the initial baking, while the graham cracker crust is baked at a lower temperature of 325°F.","context":["From classic comfort foods to regional standouts and desserts, we'll be sharing a new recipe with you each week. Find other dishes of the week here.\nThis week, we're sharing a sweet Southern classic: buttermilk pie.\nButtermilk pie is a custard pie made with, you guessed it buttermilk. Though it's known as a dessert popular in the Southern United States, its origins are likely from the U.K.\nThe dessert is often confused with chess pie; though chess pie contains cornmeal and occasionally corn syrup, where buttermilk pie does not. Instead, buttermilk pie is made simply with buttermilk, sugar, butter, eggs and flour. Variations include the addition of vanilla extract, lemon zest, fruit, or even chocolate.\nThe mixture is poured into a traditional pie crust; then baked until it sets and gets a crisp, caramelized top. The result is a rich, slightly tangy, and ultra creamy pie that is melts in your mouth with each bite.\nThis recipe, from Southern Living, will taste just like the old-fashioned pies your granny used to make. Feel free to use a store-bought pie crust or make your own.\nIngredients For the pastry crust: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon table salt 6 tablespoons cold butter, cubed 3 tablespoons cold shortening, cubed 4 to 5 tbsp. ice water\nFor the pie filling: 1 1/2 cups sugar 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 3 large eggs 1 cup buttermilk 1/2 cup butter, melted 1 tablespoon loosely packed lemon zest 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Optional: fresh whipped cream, fresh berries, fresh mint\nFor the pastry crust: Pulse the flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor 3 or 4 times or until combined. Add butter and shortening, and pulse 8 to 10 times or until mixture resembles coarse meal. Drizzle 4 tbsp. ice water over mixture; pulse 4 or 5 times or until dough clumps together, adding up to 1 tbsp. ice water, 1 tsp. at a time, if necessary. Gently shape dough into a flat disk. Wrap in plastic wrap, and chill 30 minutes.\nIf you like this story, consider signing up for our email newsletters.\nSHOW ME HOW\nPreheat oven to 400°. Roll dough into a 12-inch circle (about 1/8 inch thick) on a floured surface. Fit into a 9-inch pie plate; crimp edges. Prick bottom and sides with a fork. Line pastry with parchment paper, and fill with pie weights or dried beans.\nBake for 10 minutes. Remove weights and parchment paper, and bake 8 to 10 more minutes or until lightly browned. Transfer to a wire rack, and cool completely (about 30 minutes).\nFor the pie filling: Preheat oven to 350°. Whisk together first the flour and sugar in a large bowl. Whisk in eggs, buttermilk, melted butter, lemon zest and juice, and vanilla extract, stirring until well combined. Pour into prepared pie crust.\nBake for 35 to 45 minutes or until almost set, shielding edges with aluminum foil after 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and allow to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature. Top with fresh whipped cream, berries, and/or mint if desired.","Make your own Graham Cracker Pie Crust for your next cheesecake or cream pie. Made with four simple ingredients you can make a tasty and buttery made from scratch pie crust in minutes. No need to get a store-bought crust anymore.\nThis page may contain affiliate links, please see my full disclosure for policy details.\nWith just four ingredients you can make a buttery homemade graham cracker pie crust just to your liking. Making your own crust just tastes fresher than a store-bought crust and you can adjust the sugar content and flavoring.\nI firmly believe in making life simple and of course tasty so making a homemade crust is always my first option, but I am here to tell you, store-bought will work just the same for your cream pies.\nYou can even use different flavors of graham cracker crusts to go with the flavor of your pie. Chocolate graham crackers with a chocolate cream pie or honey graham crackers with a vanilla cheesecake; both sound delicious.\nFour simple ingredients\n- Graham crackers\n- Brown Sugar\n- White Sugar\nThere are so many uses for a graham cracker crust and you can have either a baked crust or an unbaked crust. Once mixed, the cracker crumbs can be pressed into a pie plate, a springform pan, a sheet pan, or any baking pan for cream pies, cheesecakes, and other dreamy and creamy desserts. Make sure to save extra crumbs to sprinkle on top.\nThere is nothing easier than making a graham cracker crust\nStep 1. If using the graham cracker sheets, break up 10 of the sheets and in place in a food processor and pulse until you have super fine crumbs. You can also place the sheets in a zip-lock bag and crush them with a rolling pin. Either way, you need 1 ½ cups. You may have to add some extra graham sheets for the right amount.\nStep 2. Pour the crumbs into a bowl and add the melted butter and the sugars. Mix well with a fork until the crumbs are coated with butter and the mixture looks sandy and crumbly.\nStep 3. Pour the graham mixture into a 9″ – 10″ pie plate and using your hands or the bottom of a cup press the crumbs on the bottom and sides of the pie plate. For a baking dish or springform pan just press the crumbs in the bottom.\nTake your time pressing down the crumbs. Try using a measuring cup for the bottom and I like using a spoon to go around the sides of the pie pan and pushing down the top to form a nice edge at the top of the pie crust.\nStep 4. For an unbaked pie crust, place the pie pan in the refrigerator for 1 hour to set the butter.\nFor a baked pie crust, baked in a 325 degree F. oven for 8 minutes.\nFill the pie crust as directed for your pie recipe\nAdd some spices to your crust\nEverybody likes different flavors\n- Cinnamon – for a Banana Cream Pie\n- Vanilla beans – perfect for any cream pie or cheesecake\n- Nutmeg – with an Eggnog Cheesecake\n- Cardamom – I love this flavor with a citrus cream pie\n- Red pepper – for a bold flavor in a Mexican Chocolate Cream Pie\n- so many variations\nGraham cracker pie crust questions & tips\nWhy is my crust crumbling\nYour crust might crumble if there isn’t enough butter in crumbs, or it wasn’t pressed down enough\nThe crust is rock hard and I can’t cut it, this is common and maybe because of\nOverbaking the crust\nCompacting the crumbs too much, they need to be pressed hard but don’t go crazy\nAdding too much butter which will harden for both the baked and unbaked crusts.\nBefore serving your pie, wet a dish towel in hot water and wring it dry then set the pie plate on the hot, wet towel. This will soften the butter in the crust and help it release easily.\nDo I have to bake the crust\nThis is up to you. Baking the crust adds a depth of flavor from the melted sugar in the graham cracker crumbs, and the melted sugar is what will hold the crumbs together. I prefer the baked crusts because they don’t crumble as much and have a nice toasty flavor.\nFor the unbaked crust, the butter in the crumbs will harden when placed in the refrigerator.\nMake sure the crumbs are chopped or crushed very fine\nHaving finely chopped crumbs help the crust hold together better. If large chunks of graham crackers are in the crust it doesn’t look as pretty and will also be harder to cut a clean slice.\nCut with a warm knife\nIf your crust is very hard, try this technique, hold you knife under hot water to heat up the blade, dry it off then cut your pie or dessert.\nOther One Hot Oven Pie Crust Recipes\nDon’t forget to Pin to your favorite board\nEasy Graham Cracker Pie Crust\n- If using graham cracker sheets, break them up and grind in a small food processor.

{"question":"How do LEGO Mindstorms and Tamiya Battle System approach distance and spatial interaction in their robotics platforms?","answer":"The Tamiya Battle System operates within a maximum shooting range of 30 meters, with specific hit detection rules: within 5 meters, hits from any angle cause damage, while beyond 5 meters, only hits at right angles (front, sides, or rear) are effective, simulating realistic tank armor deflection physics. The LEGO Mindstorms EV3, meanwhile, uses various sensors for spatial awareness, including a color sensor that recognizes seven different colors and light intensity, a touch sensor for physical interactions, and a remote infrared beacon that enables distance control and tracking of the robot's movements.","context":["TAM53447 - Tamiya 1/16 LED Battle System - For Full Option Tamiya RC Tanks. Set up mock battles with 2 or more tanks and have your own tank battles in the comfort of your backyard.\nTamiya is proud to release Battle System, a revolution in tank-to-tank fighting. This system incorporates infrared light and realistic sound, eliminating the difficulty in judging, often found with other tank-to-tank games. Furthermore, infrared light is totally harmless and prevents damage to details of the tank body. The system is comprised of the GFS (Gun Fire Simulator) Unit and the Infrared LED Unit, for the respective detection and emission of infrared beams. A wide range of sound effects and actions are reproduced with Battle System including: damage blast, engine trouble sound, loss of speed, blast reaction, limited operation state, and finally inoperative state. Battle System provides a maximum shooting range of 30m and can be easily installed to your tank even after assembly and painting. Battle System lets you bring out the true roar of your 1/16 RC Tank!\nPersonalize your Tank Combat! The Battle System lets you choose among three tank classes: light, medium, and heavy at the flick of a switch. Also, the number of blasts your tank can endure, the length of time between each firing-Battle System lets you set the conditions exactly as you wish. (See diagram above for more details.)\nTaking a Hit: You have just been hit by the enemy tank! You will hear the booming \"damage blast\" sound and feel your tank shake with the \"blast reaction\" effect. The GFS Unit will also flash to indicate the hit, and the sound and speed of your engine will slow. Also, directly after taking a hit, your tank gets \"shaken up\" and temporarily loses the ability to fire-you're down...but not out.\nBlown Away! Your tank can only absorb so much punishment. After a certain number of blasts (this too can be adjusted), you will hear an \"explosion\" and the GFS Unit will flash intensely. Your tank will make two final lurches forward before the engine shuts down and all tank control is lost. NOW you're out...but...\nBack from the Dead: The good news is that after a short period of \"down-time\" (about 15sec), your tank will come back to life with the \"battery engine start-up\" sound. For a short time, your tank remains invulnerable to enemy fire, allowing for some evasive maneuvering before striking back at your foe.\nLong 30m Shooting Distance!\n- Battle System provides a maximum shooting distance of 30m, allowing for spacious tank-to-tank battling in a variety of settings.\n- When enemy is within 5m of your tank, blasting him at any angle will cause damage.\n- When the enemy is outside the 5m radius, only hits made at right angles to the tank (front, sides, or rear) will be effective. Battle System stays true to laws of real tank combat, where hits received diagonally harmlessly defect off the thick armor plating. Tamiya brings you the heart-pounding thrill of real tank combat with Battle System.","For years, LEGO has been at the forefront of innovative building kits for young makers and creators. Always looking for new ways to keep kids building and experimenting, LEGO has gone far beyond the static blocks we are all familiar with.\nFrom the best LEGO Star Wars sets to the best LEGO Technic kits, there really is something LEGO for every age, skill level, and interest. Heck, there are even Lego games. But the jewel in the ever-growing crown of the LEGO universe just may be the addition of LEGO robotics, and the maker sensation that is the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 building kit and programming platform.\nWhat is LEGO Robotics?\nLEGO Robotics is an all-encompassing robotics building and programming platform. With the single Mindstorms EV3 kit, makers can create, build, and program a nearly endless array of cool robots, vehicles, and machines. The kit itself includes detailed instructions for building five individual robots. There are plenty of projects out there created by other users. In addition, the LEGO website has building plans from LEGO and submissions from fans.\nWhy should you choose LEGO Robotics over other robotics platforms? LEGO has years of experience creating building kits for every age, interest, and skill level, and all that experience has gone into creating LEGO Mindstorms. The building instructions are excellent, detailed, and complete, a hallmark of the LEGO building system. For more creative makers, there is plenty of room for building your own designs and expanding the robots and machines. Finally, the programming platform is easily accessible and user-friendly and slowly introduces kids to its unique programming language. The programming software is available for a huge variety of devices, from Mac and PC to tablets.\nWhat’s In The Box: LEGO Robotics Mindstorms\nOpening up the LEGO Mindstorms box can be a little daunting. First of all, there are a lot of pieces and many that you may not recognize. If you’re new to LEGO robotics, there will be quite a few pieces that aren’t included in any other LEGO building kit. So, it helps to go through the pieces and identify and separate the various components. First and foremost is the EV3 brick. This is the programmable brick that is the control center and power for your robots. It contains a powerful processor, four input ports for connecting sensors, four output ports to connect and control motors. There is also a mini-USB port for connecting to a computer, a USB host port, and a micro-SD port to expand memory.\nSensors, Motors, And More\nNext, identify the sensors that connect to the input ports. The sensors will collect information and relay it to EV3 brick. The brick will then process that information, relay it to the motors, and your robot will react. There’s a color sensor that recognizes seven different colors as well as light intensity. There is also a touch sensor that recognizes ‘touched’, ‘bumped’, and ‘released’. Also, look for the remote infrared beacon which controls your robot from a distance and allows for tracking.\nFinally, identify the motors. There are two large motors for powerful robotic action and a medium motor that allows for faster movements. The medium motor also cuts down on overall size and weight.\nThese are the primary robotics components. There are also plenty of LEGO bricks, pieces, and accessories for creating an endless array of awesome robots.\nChoose A LEGO Robotics Robot And Start Building\nNow it’s time to choose which robot to build. Most makers recommend starting with the TRACK3R. Instructions for building this robot are included in the LEGO robotics Mindstorms kit. Also, the programming is already included on the EV3 programmable brick. This simple robot should take around an hour to build. Building it will familiarize makers with the kit and components, and introduce them to the basic controls.\nNext, choose a different robot to build. Select one of the robots with instructions in the kit. Choices include SPIK3R, a scorpion-like robot, and R3PTAR, who looks like a snake. There’s also GRIPP3R and EV3RSTORM, the more humanoid robots. Build the robot and then…\nStart Programming With LEGO Robotics\nThe basics are mastered and a new cool robot is built. It’s time to begin programming. Fortunately, LEGO has a fun, simple programming app called LEGO Commander. Downloads for Mac, PC, and tablets are available at the LEGO website.\nInstallation is simple and even young makers will be able to program their new robots in no time at all. The app includes a simple drag and drop interface. The basic robots have programs already included in the app. Simply connect the robot to a device and install the programming into the robot. This is also a good time to start exploring the Mindstorms LabView programming language. Open up the existing programs, and note how the language functions. It uses a simple and intuitive system of colored tiles and icons to create mechanical functions for your the creations.\nNow that the basic are mastered, the possibilities are endless, especially for young imaginative makers. They create and build their own cool robots and then use LEGO’s simple programming language to control their robot. LEGO robotics offers children the opportunity the exercise their imaginations and learn basic programming in a single, yet sophisticated robotics kit.\nWe love to hear from you!

{"question":"How does a Hardware Security Module (HSM) protect encrypted software during programming?","answer":"A Hardware Security Module (HSM) protects encrypted software by acting as a trusted computer that performs cryptographic operations like key management, key exchange, and encryption/decryption. The HSM is integrated into the programmer and mounted to prevent unauthorized access to the interface between the HSM and programming head. Only the specific HSM can decrypt the software using its private key, while the public key from its certificate is used to securely transport necessary keys like the symmetric key, customer public key, and software update keys.","context":["Incase you missed Part I - What is Secure Provisioning?, Part II - Encryption: Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys, or Part III - Building a Hardware Root of Trust, or Part IV Identity: Digital Signatures and Certificates, you can catch up here.\nOnce we have encrypted our software to ensure it is protected from intrusion, how is it decrypted and programmed into the target device? Do we simply send it to a programming house with instructions on how to decrypt the file and load it onto the programmer? Obviously, not.\nThis is where one of the most important components of a secure provisioning system comes into play and that is a Hardware Security Module or HSM as they are more commonly referred to. A HSM is a special 'trusted' computer performing a variety of cryptographic operations such as key management, key exchange, encryption/decryption etc. A HSM is trusted because:\nIn our secure provisioning system, we must ensure that it is only the HSM that is capable of decrypting our software. To do this, we use the HSM's certificate which gives us access to its public cryptographic key. With this key we can create a process whereby only the target HSM can access the secret data using its private key (see Figure 4).\nAn important aspect in the design of the secure provisioning system is that the HSM should be integrated into the programmer and mounted in such a way that it is difficult for a bad actor to access the interface between the HSM and programming head. Most microcontrollers today do not have a mechanism to pass programming data to the bare-metal over an encrypted interface (JTAG for example). This presents a small weakness in the system as the communication between the HSM and the programming head is not encrypted, i.e. the software we are trying to protect is in the clear. Newer secure microcontrollers from Renesas solved this weakness by introducing boot mechanisms that can accept encrypted data which is decrypted by the bare-metal CPU and flashed into internal memory, well away from prying eyes.\nTo manage the secure provisioning process, we generate an asymmetric key pair and a symmetric key. Generation of cryptographic keys is possible using tools such as OpenSSL. It is important to reiterate that both the private part of the asymmetric key pair and the symmetric key used for secure provisioning must be kept secret by the customer (see Figure 1). It is also important, for added security, that the development tool-chain allows customer generated keys to be used in the system. Additional keys may be required by the software development tool for product life-cycle management. Providing a mechanism to allow software updates to a product that has been deployed in the field is an important aspect of maintaining security. The key usage mechanism for software updates differs between software development tools. Details of the software update mechanism will be provided by the software development tool vendor.\nWe use the symmetric key to encrypt the binary file and the RoT configuration file. We use the symmetric key as the data to be encrypted can be large (see Figure 2).\nUsing the process shown in Figure 3, we use the customer private key to create a signature. This enables the HSM receiving the encrypted data to check the integrity of the binary file and its authenticity i.e. signed using the customer's private key. The HSM will use the customers public key to check authenticity.\nIn order to securely transport all the necessary keys to the HSM (symmetric key, customer public key and any additional software update keys), we use the HSM's public key that we extract from its certificate, delivered via the service provider (see Figure 4). Only the HSM's private key can extract the keys once delivered.\nIn the meantime, if you have any questions or require secure provisioning services get in touch, we have local engineering and sales teams ready to help. You can find a full list of our locations here.\nAlternatively if you have any questions or would like us to focus on additional topics around IOT security and provisioning in future blogs, don’t hesitate to let us know: email@example.com.\nTil next time…"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:beaf2b01-f79b-4641-aab2-eda7c8164557>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the approach to soil coverage differ between traditional lawn care and sustainable garden practices?","answer":"Traditional lawn care often leaves soil exposed and requires frequent watering, which can be wasteful in drought conditions. In contrast, sustainable garden practices emphasize keeping soil constantly covered using various materials like living plants, mulch, leaf litter, or even cardboard. This coverage helps protect and nurture life belowground, retains soil moisture, moderates soil temperature, and suppresses weeds. The sustainable approach recommends replacing water-hungry lawns with drought-tolerant ground cover or mulch.","context":["The dirty truth is quick and simple.

Check out our blog to read more about these little secrets. In the meantime, let this dirty little list simplify what you do, and more importantly, what you don’t do, in the garden or on the farm.\nGuiding Whole Soil Principles\nThe Quick and Dirty\n1. Use it if you’ve got it\nSave time and work by using what’s close to home, instead of hauling it in from the outside. Shake those leaves from the trees and spread them on the ground. Capture water from the roof and recycle plant roots. Inventory your resources and look to your own garden first to meet its living needs.\n2. Manage the whole, not the parts\nA whole soil is part of a whole garden is part of a whole community is part of a whole planet. Zoom out and think of your garden as part of this whole picture. How can all the parts of your garden contribute to the health of the whole.\n3. Give more than you take\nIt’s a good rule for life, and for soils too. If you take food from the soil by harvesting garden bounty or pulling weeds, give it back as compost, garden refuse, manure, or cover crops.\n4. As above, so below\nMost of soil life is belowground. But if you want to know how it’s doing, look aboveground. If plants are healthy and vigorous, then your soil probably is too. Don’t forget to feed your plant roots and soil bugs to grow a beautiful and bountiful garden.\n5. Make your life simple by making your garden complex\nSoils are simple because they are complex. A healthy garden ecosystem is teeming with lifeforms to numerous to count. To nurture this complexity, be interesting. Grow plants of different sizes, colors, and smells. Be creative and diverse in the amendments you add. Create crazy garden sculptures and shapes to fill the garden ecosystem with microbes, bugs, birds, and bees.\n6. Follow the Goldilock’s principle\nToo much is not always a good thing. Not enough is death. Don’t overfeed or overwater – starve or parch your living soil. Just like you, your garden bugs like it just right.\n7. Disturb less\nSoil bugs work hard to build a happy home. A little bit of upheaval can be good. It puts microbes to work and gets them moving. But massive disturbance, like repeated, deep tillage, leaves soil neighborhoods decimated and destitute.\n8. Keep the soil covered\nA bare soil is a lifeless soil. Soil needs shelter and protection like any other living thing. Living plants, mulch, leaf litter, even cardboard nurture life belowground.\n9. Never till a wet soil\nIf your soil is wet, leave it alone until it dries out. With a few exceptions, the damage you do by walking on, digging in, or pulling machines through wet soil far outweighs the benefits and can damage the living soil for years to come.\n10. Go with the flow\nWork with, rather than against nature. This is the central theme of permaculture and of growing living soils, too. Watch and observe your whole garden ecosystem – where does water, wind, and sunlight naturally go. Work less by working with these natural flows.","Organic matter is the most important part of the soil because it is fodder for the many organisms that keep soil alive and elastic. And because it is consumed by these organisms, soil organic matter needs to be replenished. The makings of soil organic matter are a constant part of all of our lives, from banana peels and apple cores to tree bark and fallen leaves. By collecting and recycling these materials back into the ground, each of us can care for the soils around us, regardless of where we live or what our livelihoods may be. The following soil-friendly practices are just an introduction to the many ways that we can have a positive impact on the land around us.\nThere are many techniques for making compost. All of them involve combining compost’s four main ingredients: Browns, Greens, Air, and Water.\nBrowns are dry, woody materials that are high in carbon, such as fallen leaves, dry grass, branch trimmings, and sawdust. Greens are moist materials high in nitrogen: food waste (such as fruit and vegetable trimmings), new grass clippings, and fresh weeds. To make compost:\n- Chop materials to help them break down more quickly.\n- Mix Browns and Greens in equal amounts.\n- Maintain Air and Water balance by keeping compost as moist as a wrung-out sponge.\n- Air can be the forgotten element of compost; to make sure yours has enough, turn or poke your pile about once a week.\n- Fallen and trimmed leaves\n- Chopped, woody prunings\n- Pine needles\n- Most sawdust\n- Grass clippings\n- Plant trimmings\n- Weeds without seed heads\n- Fruit and vegetable trimmings\n- Coffee grounds and filters\n- Tea bags\n- Herbivore manures\n- Grains, beans, or breads\n- Sawdust from plywood/treated wood\n- Meat, bones, or fish\n- Dog, cat, or bird feces\n- Diseased plants\n- Dairy products or grease\nAn easy, low-maintenance way to build soil over time is to mulch with organic materials. Any material laid on top of the soil is a mulch; inorganic materials such as gravel and crushed rock can be used, but plant materials are better because they break down and enrich the soil. In addition to building soil, mulch offers other benefits, such as retaining soil moisture, moderating soil temperature, suppressing weeds, preventing erosion and soil compaction, and conserving landfill space. The best plant materials to use for mulch are those you can obtain locally. This doesn’t mean commercial wood or bark chips from nurseries—they may have originated far, far away—but organics such as wood chips from a local tree service or leaves from your neighbor’s trees. Such materials are called green waste mulches, and they include chipped or shredded wood from trees or even used pallets; pine needles; leaves; other plant trimmings; grass clippings; and compost.\nThe very best mulch of all is one you’ve made yourself. Soft clippings can be cut into smaller pieces by hand; if you have a rotary mower, run it over dry leaves to chop them up. Brush cutters and weed whackers can also be used to cut materials to mulch size.\nAs for how much mulch to use once you’ve made it, a two- to four-inch layer will work in most circumstances. For weed control, use a coarse mulch such as wood chips and spread a four- to six-inch layer. For moisture retention, use a finer mulch such as compost or shredded leaves, applying a layer no more than two inches thick.\nAn often overlooked but very simple way to support the soil is by leaving grass clippings on the lawn. Grasscycling quickly and easily returns nutrients to grass and soil.\nTo start grasscycling, take these few steps.\n- Mow often. Mow often enough that no more than a third of the grass blade is cut. The shorter the clipping, the faster it decomposes.\n- Mow dry. Mowing when the grass is dry prevents clippings from clumping.\n- Leave the clippings on the lawn! You don’t need special equipment for grasscycling. Simply remove the bag from your mower as you mow, or, better yet, use a push reel mower.\nAnother way to care for soil (and the larger environment) is to reduce or eliminate the lawn altogether. The tradition of landscaping with great swaths of grass orginated in climes much different from our own, where rainfall is frequent and occurs year-round. Here, where we experience six months or more of drought each year, watering the lawn can be a costly and wasteful proposition.\nIn addition, most lawns are nitrogen-greedy; over the course of time, they can deplete this important soil nutrient. What’s more, in feeding the lawn (that is, in adding nitrogen) gardeners inadvertently pollute both land and water. Grasscycling can help return nitrogen to the soil, but a better solution is to replace the lawn with a drought-tolerant ground cover or mulch.\nLike this article?\nThere’s lots more where this came from…\nSubscribe to Bay Nature magazine\nMost recent in Recreation\nIn the \"middle space\" between protected and unprotected, a reporter finds a perfect place to camp.\nWhale Watching: The Oceanic Society has offered naturalist-led whale-watching excursions in the San Francisco Bay Area since 1972.

{"question":"How does heat stress affect milk fat production in dairy cows, and what visible signs indicate heat stress in cattle?","answer":"Heat stress affects milk fat production through two main mechanisms: altered fatty acid biohydrogenation and increased rumen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production. These changes inhibit milk fat synthesis in the mammary gland and can lead to milk fat depression. As for visible signs of heat stress in cattle, they include open mouth breathing and panting, decreased activity with more lying down, decreased feed intake with increased water intake, and agitation and restlessness. These signs indicate that production losses have already begun.","context":["Heat stressed dairy cows often suffer milk fat depression, which can be costly to producers in the current challenging dairy market. However, ongoing research suggests that optimising rumen function can help sustain milk fat concentrations in cows under heat stress.\nMilk fat synthesis depends on fatty acids from 2 sources:\n- Long-chain fatty acids (greater than 16 carbon atoms per molecule) – derive from the uptake of circulating preformed fatty acids, dietary fat absorbed from the digestive tract, and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) from the mobilisation of body fat reserves.\n- Short-chain (4 to 8 carbons) and medium-chain (10 to 14 carbons) fatty acids – originate in the mammary gland from de novo synthesis (fatty acids created ‘anew’ in the mammary from smaller molecules).\nThe 16-carbon fatty acids can originate from both sources. For a well-fed cow, an estimated 4% to 8% of milk fatty acids originate from the breakdown of body fat (such as NEFA). However, the proportion of fatty acids from this source could increase progressively as the cow’s net energy balance decreases (Bauman and Griinari, 2001). Under heat stress, there are two potential mechanisms for milk fat depression (MFD). The first one is rumen fatty acid biohydrogenation – inhibiting de novo milk fat synthesis. The second one is rumen lipopolysaccharide – limiting substrate supply and de novo milk fat synthesis.\nOptimising rumen function could help maintain milk fat content and production efficiency of dairy cows under heat stress. Photo: Henk Riswick\nAltered fatty acid biohydrogenation\nAccording to the well-accepted ‘biohydrogenation theory’ (Bauman and Griinari, 2001), MFD results from changes in rumen biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids and the passage of specific intermediates of biohydrogenation out of the rumen (such as trans-10, cis-12 CLA). These biohydrogenation intermediates subsequently interfere with the expression of genes involved in fat synthesis thereby reducing milk fat synthesis in the mammary gland. Furthermore, the increased rate of feedstuffs outflow from the rumen may increase the likelihood of biohydrogenation intermediates passing through the rumen. So the theory identifies how certain feedstuffs can represent risk factors for MFD (Figure 1). Dairy nutritionists sometimes suggest feeding supplemental fat to maintain the cow’s energy intake during heat stress. However, it is important that the source of fat is rumen inert. Otherwise, low rumen pH, which occurs in heat stressed cows, could generate more intermediates of biohydrogenation and increase the risk of MFD.\nFigure 1 – Dietary components can impact the risk of milk fat depression in 3 ways through the rumen biohydrogenation (BH) pathway.\nAdapted from Lock and Bauman (2007).\nAltered rumen LPS production\nThe other potential mechanism for MFD during heat stress involves the concentration of rumen lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which comes from Gram-negative bacteria when they die. Research shows that when rumen pH decreases, the rumen concentration of LPS increases. Also, as rumen LPS concentration increases, milk fat concentration decreases. Zebeli and Ametaj (2009) showed greater concentrations of rumen LPS as the proportion of grain in the diet increased. As rumen LPS increased, milk fat content decreased (Figure 2). This correlation could be due to the ability of LPS to induce insulin production in the pancreas (Waldron et al., 2006). Increased circulating insulin and increased insulin sensitivity of heat stressed cows could reduce body fat mobilisation. This condition could occur even though heat stressed cows are under negative energy balance due to reduced feed intake and increased maintenance demands (Baumgard and Rhoads, 2013). Also, the lack of plasma NEFA, potentially an important precursor for milk fat synthesis under heat stress (Bauman and Griinari, 2001), may contribute to MFD. Other reported negative LPS effects on fatty acid production include: Decrease in activity of lipoprotein lipase (Lopez-Soriano and Williamson, 1994), decrease in expression of lipoprotein lipase and fatty acid transport protein 1 (Feingold et al., 2009) and suppression of enzymes related to de novo fatty acid synthesis in the mammary tissue (Dong et al., 2011).\nFigure 2 – Correlation between rumen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and milk fat content.\nAdapted from Zebeli and Ametaj (2009).\nOptimising rumen function during heat stress\nResearch to date helps explain how MFD during heat stress relates to depressed rumen health. Given this relationship, optimising rumen function could help maintain milk fat content and production efficiency of dairy cows under heat stress. Heat stress causes physiological and behavioural changes in dairy cows. These changes can lead to suboptimal rumen conditions, resulting in production of fatty acid biohydrogenation intermediates and LPS that inhibit milk fat synthesis in the mammary gland. Today, natural digestive health technologies are available to help optimise rumen conditions through the diet, thereby helping to reduce the negative impact of heat stress on milk fat and maintain the production efficiency of high-producing dairy cows.\nReferences are available on request.","High temperatures and humidity are tough on cattle and productivity. In addition, stress starts to compound in animals, as pink eye, summer pneumonia and flies can also threaten cattle performance.\nAccording to Iowa State University, once temperatures reach above 80 degrees Fahrenheit, beef cattle endure physiological stress dealing with their heat load.\nHeat abatement, or the reduction of heat stress, along with managing other summer stressors, is critical for beef producers to minimize production losses and keep cattle healthy all summer long.\nPreparing for Heat Stress in Cattle\nCattle sweat very little - about 10% of the human rate. To cool themselves, cattle will dissipate heat through respiration or panting, radiating heat from their bodies with vasodilation (pushing blood to the body's surface for heat removal) and reducing feed and forage intake.\nCattle generate heat in their rumen during fermentation, which causes core temperatures to rise even more. They also typically congregate at water troughs or under trees during the summer months, making it hard for heat to escape, escalating the impact of heat stress.\nCattle’s ability to dissipate heat depends on:\nAir temperature and relative humidity\nEnergy level in the feed ration\nAccording to the Journal of Dairy Science, economic losses from heat stress to the United States cattle industry are estimated at more than $370 million a year. The dairy industry experiences more than double that loss at $897 million.\nWhat Are the Signs of Heat Stress in Cattle?\nCattle experience visible and internal signs of heat stress as they attempt to dissipate heat.\nVisible Signs of Heat Stress\nInternal Signs of Heat Stress\nOpen mouth breathing and panting\nProductivity stops as energy is diverting to returning the body to homeostasis, decreasing performance\nInflammation and immune activation\nDecreased feed intake and increased water intake\nLower reproduction rates\nDecreased activity, lying down\nReduced average daily gain (ADG)\nIncreased insulin levels\nAgitation and restlessness\nThe USDA states that production losses have already begun once cattle start experiencing visible signs of heat stress.\nHow to Manage Heat Stress in Cattle\nCattle producers can prepare for and combat heat events with a combination of management practices and tools such as:\nEnsuring cattle have access to plenty of fresh water. Add more tanks before a heat event to help alleviate congregation around main water tanks.\nUsing droplets, not mist. Make sure the droplets of misters are large, not small. If the droplets are too small, they can create added humidity, worsening heat stress.\nProviding shade. Shade structures should be open and 8 to 14-feet tall to allow for proper ventilation. They should provide between 20 and 40 square feet per animal, depending on animal size.\nFresh feed. Heat also impacts feed quality and increases the growth of bacteria, mold and yeast, making feed less appetizing to cattle. Ensure cattle have fresh feed in a feedyard setting.\nSupporting their immune system. Heat stress equals gut stress. More than 70% of the immune system is contained in the gut. As heat stress erodes immunity and gut health of cattle, which can lead to disease challenges and performance losses, it is essential to support their immunity. Research shows that feed additives using essential oils and capsicum can help boost immunity, provide antioxidant support and help cattle reduce the impact of heat stress.\nRelated: Why Heat Stress Equals Gut Stress in Cattle\nControlling Summer Pink Eye\nBeef producers know the threat of pink eye is more prevalent in the summer.\nAlso known as infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK), pink eye is a highly contagious disease that severely impacts productivity and is incredibly painful to cattle.\nAccording to the University of Wisconsin, pink eye is primarily caused by the bacteria Moraxella bovis, which produces a toxin that attacks the eye. It is commonly understood that Moraxella bovis is the cause of traditional IBK or summer pink eye.\nWhat Causes Pink Eye in Cattle?\nSeveral things can predispose cattle to pink eye. The eyes have natural defense mechanisms to thwart infection and damage. However, eye irritants or trauma allow pathogens to pass through the eyes’ defenses and get to the cornea.\nPredisposing factors associated with pink eye include:\nDust and sand\nWeeds, tall grass and stalks\nOther animals, overcrowding from heat stress and tails swishing from flies\nPhysical hazards like barbed wire or trauma during handling and transport\nPink eye occurs in stages as the eye tries to repair itself. Stage two occurs when blood vessels spread throughout the cornea to help with healing. The eye becomes bright pink, explaining how the term ‘pink eye’ was derived.\nWhat’s the Impact of Pink Eye?\nThe University of Illinois estimates the cost of pink eye to the U.S. cattle industry at more than $150 million per year due to decreased weight gain, milk production, treatment costs and permanent scarring to the eye that reduces sale price. Recent studies show a 17 – 65 lb. weight loss from pink eye, with treatment costs exceeding $100 per incident.\nHow to Manage Pink Eye in Cattle\nMany beef producers use pink eye vaccines with varying levels of success\nin the summer months. Yet, the best way to reduce the incidences of pink eye is to manage the associated predisposing factors. Face flies can carry pink eye from animal to animal, so fly control methods are critical. Additionally, ensuring animals are not overcrowded or near hazards, reducing heat stress and handling them as little as possible can help. If pink eye cases are discovered, immediately isolate cattle away from the herd and treat until the infection is gone.\nRelated: How Garlic Can Help Minimize Pink Eye in Cattle\nPreventing Summer Pneumonia in Calves\nSummer pneumonia in nursing calves is another challenge for beef producers to watch out for. This problem can come on quickly and be unpredictable, with the first sign often being sick or dead calves.\nThe University of Nebraska identifies summer pneumonia as a respiratory disease in pre-weaned calves on pasture. While the direct cause of summer pneumonia is unknown, researchers and veterinarians have found a few direct correlations between outbreaks and these varying factors:\nPoor colostrum quality from cows lacking in nutrition"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a8b911e7-d0e7-4893-9a21-bf2091df18be>","<urn:uuid:be8dc216-779b-4023-9d3f-d6d8d37d6787>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the correct timing for applying barbecue sauce when grilling chicken?","answer":"Barbecue sauce should not be applied at the beginning of the grilling process. Adding sauce from the start can lead to burnt chicken since the sugar in the sauce can burn and ruin the flavor. It also might give a false indication that the chicken is ready when it's not. Instead, wait until after a few minutes of cooking before applying the barbecue sauce.","context":["You just found an incredible chicken grilling recipe, and you can’t wait to make a meal off it. You get all the tools and ingredients needed to make the grilling session successful, and you also fire up the grill. Even if you followed the recipe to the letter, your chicken doesn’t taste as sweet as you imagined it would. So, what went wrong? It is possible that you made a mistake, which is okay because everyone does that. Here’s how to avoid chicken grilling mistakes/blunders next time.\nNeglecting the prep step\nChicken protein is sensitive and should be treated as such. That is why you shouldn’t skip the preparation step. Before placing the pieces on the grill gates, make sure they are at room temperature. To do this, you must allow the chicken to defrost slowly and safely in the fridge. If you are in a hurry, the last-minute tip would be to fill the sink with cold water and submerge your frozen chicken. Change the water every 30 minutes to expedite the defrosting.\nForgetting to dry the chicken\nWhether you are cooking skin-on or seasoned chicken, you shouldn’t forget to dry it. After defrosting the meat, the next step should be patting it with a dry paper towel before seasoning and brining. Repeat the drying procedure before throwing your delicacy into the grill. Wet skin promotes the formation of steam, which isn’t something you would like. With the water out of the way, the spices easily seep into the meat. You will also get a beautiful color and crust on the chicken.\nNot brining the bird\nIf you fail to brine the bird, you are likely to miss out on the goodies that well-salted chicken offers. Although it requires planning, the rewards are worthwhile. You can use one of the two types of brine: wet and dry. Your choice should depend on how much time you have. Dry brine usually requires less time to sink in compared to wet brine. However, the latter has juicy results.\nBeing stingy with the marinades\nDon’t shy away from seasoning your chicken with the fear of overdoing it. The moment the protein fibers hit the grills, the chances are that they will lose some of the flavors as they cook. Also, remember that seasoning can be anything. Besides the regular salt and pepper, feel free to experiment with dry peaches and apples, especially when you want to increase sweetness and char taste.\nSelecting the wrong grill method\nThere are many ways of searing foods on a grill, which makes it challenging to choose the right one. Gas and charcoal are the commonest. Pellet grills and electric are also pretty standard. None is the best, and your choice should be guided by the result you desire. The rule of thumb is that charcoal is more hands-on, but gas is consistent.\nApplying sauce from the onset\nSlathering sauce is a good thing; just not in the beginning. Put down the mop before you mess up your bird delicacy. When you cover your chicken with barbecue sauce from the minute it hits the grill; you are setting yourself up for a burnt frustration. Filling the meat with sugar ruins the flavor and gives you a false sense of ready chicken even when that isn’t the case. If you have a no leftovers policy, hold off the sauce and use it after a few minutes of cooking\nOpening the lid too often\nMany cooks don’t know that leaving the lid open compromises the quality of the chicken. Although it is human nature to keep checking on the meat, remember that the grill is like an oven. Every time you open the lid, heat escapes and the temperature drops drastically. It will not only take forever to prepare the meal, but the result will be dry, overcooked chicken.\nTreating all meat the same way\nEvery kind of chicken is different and should be grilled with this consideration. A skin-on, bone-in, thigh and breast have different protein fibers that take varying periods to cook. For instance, a skin-on piece should last for longer over the fire than a boneless one. The art gets better with time, but if you are starting, consider giving some parts a longer time to cook than others depending on the type.\nCooking vegetables and meat together\nWe love kebabs, but we aren’t doing that now. Mixing chicken with vegetables when grilling is another way of getting food poisoning. Cross-contamination is more real that you would imagine, and raw veggies can easily make you unwell. Another disadvantage is that the two ingredients don’t cook at the same rate. You might find that the onions are crispy while the meat is red at the center. For best results, grill your chicken and vegetables on separate grills."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4a04cd72-83b2-4f0f-b038-58e4d7054389>"],"error":null}

If your work is not currently checked out by a library patron, we will set up a time for you to pick-up your work or arrange for return shipping. If your work is currently checked out, you will have to wait until the end of the specified lending period to collect your work.\n+ What do I get out of this?\nWhile we have no monetary compensation for participating, artists may sell their artwork to patrons and we take no commission of any resulting sale. We will facilitate contact, but any sales details are up to you. So far, two patrons have bought the artwork that they were borrowing from artists. A non-monetary benefit is that this project grants exposure to artists, especially emerging artists who may not yet have an exhibition\nhistory. More broadly, we are aiming to create an attitude change in the Twin Cities in terms of art ownership. The hope is that, once patrons experience living with art in their homes, they will be more likely to purchase art in the future.\nWe will gladly answer any additional questions that you have. Please contact us at firstname.lastname@example.org.","What is Litehouse Gallery?\nLighthouse Gallery is a platform to engage in new ideas, perspectives and new audiences bridging British and Syrian cultures through collaborative educational programs and workshops between the international Syrian art community and British artists and audiences.

{"question":"What measures does Shanghai take to improve underperforming schools?","answer":"Shanghai employs two main strategies to improve underperforming schools: 1) The city government reserves a portion of education tax and redistributes it with emphasis on poor and low-performing districts. 2) They use an 'entrusted school' management model where high-performing schools or private education agencies provide management and professional support to low-performing schools. This arrangement is supported by substantial performance-based financial transfers from the city government.","context":["By Xiaoyan Liang, World Bank.\nThe World Bank’s recent publication “How Shanghai Does It: Insights and Lessons from the Highest-Ranking Education System in the World” has created much media buzz. The book launch was also accompanied with a three-day Global Conference on Equity and Excellence in Basic Education in Shanghai China May 17-19, 2016, attended by education policymakers from around the world.\nThis is the first time the World Bank has systematically studied a Chinese education system. Many have asked why education and why Shanghai? Few would dispute the value of education nowadays but since the 1970s economists in academia and World Bank have taken it one step further saying that investment in education also pays. As Harry Patrinos writes in his recent blog on education and development, “overall another year of schooling raises earnings by 10% a year. This is typically more than any other investment an individual could make.” The World Bank’s goals are to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030 and to promote shared prosperity. Education is considered an important instrument in realizing this vision.\nFifteen-year-olds in Shanghai shocked the world twice in 2009 and 2012 when as a group their performance in math, science, and reading topped the world. This was no ordinary win. An average Shanghai student outperforms his or her OECD counterpart by about 119 points in mathematics: equivalent to three more years of schooling! Further, compared to other systems, Shanghai has the highest proportion of socioeconomically disadvantaged students performing in the top 25% and thus is considered the world’s most equitable system as well.\nShanghai and for that matter China do not talk much about PISA. During the Conference, the Shanghai Mayor Ms. Tiehui Weng, Deputy Education Commissioner Mr. Wei Jia and others explained the core objectives, policies and practices and the current focus to develop the Shanghai Education Strategy 2030. To them, PISA is one of the confirmations of the results of a three-decade long pursuit of education reform. They are not complacent about it and are fully aware of the challenges that continue to plague the 24-million-population-megacity, as it strives to “educate every child, develop every teacher, and manage every school well”.\nBut the World Bank and the international develop community do care about PISA. Countries struggling to bring more children into school and to improve learning outcomes should care too. Worldwide, there are still 57 million children who are out of school and another 250 million who are functionally illiterate despite having had some schooling. These numbers represent not only lost economic productivity, but also a violation of basic human rights and dignity. Will Shanghai’s experience be relevant to others? How we can we distill and curate Shanghai’s good policies and practices? That was the primary motivation for the study.\nTo be a bit more provocative, there is widespread misconception about the East Asian education success. Many tend to attribute this to culture or to rote memory and test-driven practices in schools and at homes. The OECD will not agree, however, as it claims that “PISA is unique because it develops tests that are not directly linked to school curriculum. The tests are designed to assess to what extent students at the end of compulsory education can apply their knowledge to real life situations and be equipped for full participation in society”.\nThat was also my personal motivation. I was born, raised, educated in China (partly in Shanghai) until I finished college in 1990. Over the last two decades, I have been fortunate to work on education systems and programs on behalf of the World Bank in more than a dozen countries in Africa, Latin America, South Asia, the Middle East, and East Asia. In addition, raising two children in the American education system also provided me with an opportunity to observe and reflect on eastern and western practices and compare their respective merits.\nIt is not easy to compare policies and judge their merits across systems. Many of us working on education systems have had the experience of reviewing a large number of country case studies and finding it difficult to summarize key messages as cases studies tend to use different terminology, definition, and criteria.\nIn this study, we used the World Bank’s education policy benchmarking framework and tool, SABER, to measure the key policies in Shanghai’s basic education system. SABER uses a standard methodology and a pre-defined list of indicators to measure the “soundness” of education policies. We applied the SABER instruments and assessed the Shanghai system in a total of 24 policy areas including in teachers, school finance, school management, and student assessment. Shanghai scored high in almost every SABER assessment, and is considered international best practice in 6 policy areas.\nSo we conclude that the City is indeed pursuing the “right” policies. We went beyond to assess the extent to which these policies have been implemented at the school level through school surveys. And the results are even more convincing, that Shanghai not only carefully plans but also implements what it preaches! In some areas, implementation exceeds policies. We know for many countries, there are gaps between policies and actually practices.\nOne of the most impressive aspects of Shanghai’s education system is the way it grooms, supports, and manages teachers and principals. The reason the teaching profession is regarded with a lot of respect in Shanghai is not just because teachers earn reasonable, stable salaries—it is also because of how well they have been trained and how well they teach. They are true professionals. Teachers in the city go through rigorous pre-service training and are well supported with ongoing professional development once they begin work. Much of this takes place in schools in a collegial and supportive manner.\nA pillar of Chinese teacher professional development is the teaching research group. Teaching and research are considered two sides of the same coin. Many visiting Shanghai did not understand this at first. Teachers are practitioners so why research and what kind of research? The ability to reflect and conduct action research on a daily basis on education content and pedagogy and how they affect student learning is considered a must for teachers.\nOn average, teachers in Shanghai spend about a third of their time teaching in class and the rest preparing lessons, grading homework, observing and mentoring other teachers, and engaging in other forms of professional development and action research. They are also evaluated systematically, required to go through a year of probation, rewarded for good performance, have opportunities to move up the ladder based on merit, and are led by principals who are themselves instructional leaders.\nThe way Shanghai pulls up the performance of weaker schools is also interesting, according to the report. While education financing is decentralized to the district level, the city government reserves a portion of the education tax and redistributes it with emphasis towards poor and low performing districts. The “entrusted school” management model frequently used in Shanghai involves high-performing schools or private education agencies providing management and professional support to low-performing schools. The city government backs up this arrangement with substantial financial transfers based on performance.\nThe delegates at the Shanghai conference visited Shanghai primary and secondary schools and observed about 20 minutes each in a math and English class. Some teachers face as many as 30 to 40 students and yet they are highly skilled and were able to actively engage every one of them by using a diverse range of teaching methods complemented with various ICT tools. Many delegates came away from Shanghai classrooms convinced that indeed teachers are highly skilled and dedicated and that it is not true that teaching is mostly teacher-centered and that students only learn by rote memory.\nThe results of PISA 2015 will be made public later this year. And more provinces and students in China have participated in the upcoming round. I am confident that again most students will score above average and that few will be left behind.\nXiaoyan Liang is a Senior Education Specialist, East Asia and Pacific, at the World Bank.

{"question":"Can you explain how the western bumble bee's decline has affected both its conservation status and plant reproduction patterns?","answer":"The western bumble bee's decline has led to two significant impacts. First, from a conservation perspective, its severe population reduction has resulted in its eligibility for protection under the California Endangered Species Act, as confirmed by the California Supreme Court in September 2022. The species now primarily persists in the Sierra Nevada, with an 84% decline in relative abundance. Second, from an ecological perspective, its population decline has dramatically altered plant-pollinator interactions. For example, in studies of Aquilegia caerulea (Colorado columbine), the bee's decreased presence has led to significant changes in the floral visitor community compared to the 1970s, when it was commonly present as both a pollinator and nectar robber. The loss of B. occidentalis has resulted in increased visits by muscid flies, which have been found to significantly reduce fruit set below the self-pollination rate.","context":["For immediate release September 22, 2022.\nSarina Jepsen, Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, (971) 244-3727, [email protected]\nPORTLAND, Ore.; September 22, 2022---On September 21, 2022, in a major victory for California’s native bees, California’s Supreme Court denied review of a petition filed by a consortium of agricultural and pesticide interests that sought to appeal a lower court decision that determined that four species of imperiled native bumble bees are eligible for protection under the California Endangered Species Act (CESA). These four species – the western, Franklin’s, Suckley cuckoo, and Crotch’s bumble bee – have declined extensively from their historic ranges and urgently need the protection that CESA can provide in order to stave off extinction.\nThis case follows a petition that the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, Defenders of Wildlife, and Center for Food Safety submitted in 2018 to protect these four bumble bee species. As a result of the groups' petition, the California Fish and Game Commission voted to begin the listing process in 2019, but was sued by a consortium of California's agricultural and pesticide interests shortly after its decision.\nThe consortium argued that insects, such as the four bumble bee species, may not be listed for protection under CESA. In November 2020, a trial court sided with the consortium. Then, in February 2021, the conservation groups, represented by the Stanford Environmental Law Clinic, as well as the Commission and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife appealed. In May 2022, the Third District Court of Appeal ruled unanimously in favor of the State of California and conservation groups, holding that bees and other insects can be protected under CESA. The California Supreme Court’s September 21, 2022 decision not to review the petition for appeal allows the Third District Court of Appeal’s ruling to stand.\n“We are elated with the California Supreme Court’s decision,” said Sarina Jepsen, endangered species director with the Xerces Society. “Now, some of California’s most endangered pollinators may be saved from extinction.”\nNative bumble bees are essential to the resilience of both agriculture and native ecosystems, and the loss of these and other native pollinators can have far ranging ecological consequences. Other terrestrial invertebrates facing extinction are also now eligible for protection under the California Endangered Species Act, such as the monarch butterfly.\nCalifornia cannot maintain its exceptional biodiversity or sustain its agricultural system without protecting its native pollinators. Most plants rely upon insects – often bees – for pollination, producing the fruits and seeds that feed songbirds and many small mammals. Insects are also food for many fish and 96% of birds eat insects or feed them to their young. Protecting the diversity of insect species in California will help to ensure that insects can continue to provide these vital ecosystem services.\nBumble Bee Profiles\nCrotch's bumble bee (Bombus crotchii), a bee with yellow, black, and often orange on its abdomen, is considered Endangered by the International Union of the Conservation of Nature (IUCN); it only persists in 20% of its historical range, and has declined by 98% in relative abundance (its abundance relative to other species of bumble bees). This bee historically occurred from the northern Central Valley to Baja Mexico, but currently persists primarily in southern coastal habitats and some areas to the north and southwest of Sacramento.\nThe western bumble bee (Bombus occidentalis) has a range that extends across the western U.S. and southern Canada. In California, it was historically known from the northern part of the state, the coastal region, and the mountains. It currently persists primarily in the Sierra Nevada; its relative abundance has declined by 84%.\nThe Suckley cuckoo bumble bee (Bombus suckleyi) was historically found throughout the western U.S. As an obligate social parasite, it is found only where its host species of bumble bees, including the western bumble bee, remain. It is considered Critically Endangered by the IUCN and its range has declined by 58%.\nFranklin's bumble bee (Bombus franklini), which historically occurred in an area about 60 miles wide in the Siskiyou Mountains of northern California and southern Oregon may already be extinct. Despite extensive annual surveys by the late Dr. Robbin Thorp, professor emeritus at the University of California–Davis, Franklin's bumble bee has not been seen since 2006.\n# # #\nThe Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation is a science-based, international nonprofit organization that protects the natural world through the conservation of invertebrates and their habitats. By utilizing applied research, engaging in advocacy, providing educational resources, addressing policy implications and building community, we endeavor to make meaningful long-term conservation a reality.

Given the negative effects that antagonisitc visitors, including nectar robbers, can sometimes inflict, might declines in their populations instead confer benefits? During the 1970s, reproductive biology of the Colorado columbine, Aquilegia caerulea (Ranunculaceae), was documented near Gothic, Colorado. At that time, Bombus occidentalis, the Western Bumble bee, was one of its many pollinators, but more commonly acted as its only known nectar robber. Bombus occidentalis abundance has declined precipitously throughout the Western USA since the 1970s. In 2016, we documented floral visitors at sites near those used in the original survey. We then experimentally quantified the effects of nectar robbing, allowing us to estimate the reproductive consequences of losing B. occidentalis. We also quantified the potential pollination services of muscid flies (Muscidae, Diptera). The floral visitor community was dramatically different in 2016 compared to the 1970s. Bombus occidentalis was infrequently observed, and nectar robbing was negligible. Our experiments suggested that a high level of nectar robbing would lead to significantly reduced fruit set, although not seeds per fruit. Fly visits to flowers were dramatically higher in 2016 compared to the 1970s. In the absence of bumble bees, muscid flies significantly reduced fruit set below the self-pollination rate. The negative effect of the increase in these flies likely outweighed any positive effects A. caerulea experienced from the absence of its nectar robber. Although the field observations were conducted in a single year, when interpreted in combination with our manipulative experiments, they suggest how A. caerulea may fare in a changing visitation landscape.\nHow to Cite\nCopyright (c) 2022 Trevor A.

{"question":"What are the safety implications of power failures in water treatment plants, and how do distributed energy management systems address these risks?","answer":"Power failures in water treatment plants can have severe safety implications, including the release of untreated sewage into waterways, contamination of drinking water supplies, impact on firefighting capabilities, and forced closure of healthcare facilities and businesses. To address these risks, facilities can implement distributed energy resources (DER) managed through DERMS (Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems), which provide capabilities for balancing power supply and demand while delivering grid-based services. DERMS enables safe and reliable integration of power sources, helping prevent outages through sophisticated DER integration and monitoring capabilities, thereby protecting public health and safety.","context":["Does A Condition Based Maintenance Program Have A Role at Water and Waste Water Treatment Plants?\nWhat would life be like if your local Water Company or Waste Water Treatment Plant lost power due to a major failure of their power distribution equipment? Water supports life and an uninterrupted water supply requires reliable electrical equipment that supplies power to pumps and filters. A power loss at a waste water treatment plan could result in untreated water being released into the environment causing algae blooms that are toxic to aquatic animals and even the spread of disease in the community. We cannot forget the government fines that could be levied should this type of event occur. Can the plant’s reliability team predict when a critical electrical system is deteriorating and fix it before it fails? The answer is YES!\nAn extended power loss can have devastating impacts on drinking water and wastewater utilities and the communities they serve. Inoperable pumps at a water utility plant can impact firefighting capabilities or force businesses like health care facilities or restaurants to close. A loss in pressure can result in contaminants, from soil and groundwater, to enter the drinking water supply. For wastewater utilities, losing power to pumps may lead to direct discharge of untreated sewage into rivers and streams and even cause sewage to backup into homes and businesses.\nWater and wastewater treatment companies should conduct a power distribution asset condition assessment to understand the relative health of their essential infrastructure. Some companies will have backup generators to keep the power flowing. However, those backup generators need to be inspected and maintained to insure proper functionality should the need arise and may not protect from all types of equipment failure. An interesting fact: During Superstorm Sandy, many generators failed after 24 to 48 hours because they were not properly maintained!* Other companies may install on-site power generation systems known as Distributed Energy Resources (DER); however, these systems will require routine maintenance as well.\nThese industries recognize the criticality of establishing and performing condition based maintenance programs on their electrical assets. Routine inspections enable personnel to monitor the health status of critical electrical components and systems. Innovative products and services, called Electrical Maintenance Safety Devices (EMSDs), enable personnel to perform routine electrical inspections of energized assets safely and efficiently. Common types of EMSDs include Maintenance Inspection Windows with Infrared or Infrared and Ultrasound capabilities, Ultrasound Ports and handheld measuring devices, Wireless Temperature Monitoring Systems and Intelligent Asset Tagging Systems. Utilizing these tools within a condition based maintenance program allows the reliability team to routinely and safely perform inspections, collect data, monitor data over time and determine if an electrical asset is starting to deteriorate. These programs allow companies to schedule downtime to fix the asset versus experiencing an unplanned outage and disrupting the lives and safety of thousands of people.\nWater and waste water treatment plants cannot tolerate an internal electrical failure that impacts the safety and comfort of their personnel or their end-user customer base. Improved operational reliability and productivity can be achieved by implementing a condition based maintenance program using EMSDs to monitor, maintain and anticipate problems on their generators or on-site power distribution and power generation systems before an actual electrical component fails.\n*Source: Power Resilience, EPA.gov/waterresiliency; EPA 800-R-15-004, December 2015","What are Distributed Energy Resources?\nDistributed energy resources (DER) is the term used to describe the many types of energy generation and storage technologies that provide electric capacity or energy where it is needed. With smaller outputs than traditional generating resources like centralized power plants, DER systems are often sized to meet the requirements of a particular site. They may be connected to the local electric power grid or distribution system or isolated from it for dedicated use.\nDER systems like rooftop solar panels, battery energy storage systems, distribution-connected commercial wind farms, and solar plants account for an increasing amount of the power fed into the electrical grid, helping to reduce society’s dependence on fossil fuels and reduce emissions. However, their growing numbers, variable and unpredictable output, and remote, independent operation are making it more difficult to operate the grid safely, efficiently, and reliably.\nIf distributed energy sources could be more efficiently aggregated, managed, and dispatched in large groups rather than individually, the critical balance between energy supply and demand could be better managed. Also, new grid services could be offered, such as the ability to market excess power profitably on a wholesale basis.\nWhat are Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems?\nDistributed energy resource management systems (DERMS) provide these capabilities. A DERMS is a software-based platform used to manage various distributed energy resource (DER) assets to balance power supply and demand and to deliver grid-based services. Until now, however, there hasn’t been a general understanding of appropriate guiding principles, core functions, and the required functional specifications for DERMS systems, but the need is urgent.\nGuiding the Integration of Distributed and Renewable Energy\nIn late 2020 the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued Order 2222, enabling DER aggregators to compete in all regional organized wholesale electric markets for the first time, encouraging widespread adoption of more electricity generation from DERs.\nNot only does IEEE 2030.11™-2021, Guide for Distributed Energy Resources Management Systems (DERMS) Functional Specification address these needs, but the consensus-based standards development process at IEEE Standards Association (IEEE SA) and the diverse membership of the IEEE 2030.11 Working Group was instrumental in helping to shape the policy and regulatory framework FERC Order 2222 relies upon. The work was initiated with administrative, logistical, and other support from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Electricity (OE), which has referred to IEEE SA as a key source for the standards and guidelines needed to drive integration of distributed, renewable energy sources.\nAs the latest standard in a body of DER management standards development work including the IEEE 1547™ series and IEEE 2030.7™, IEEE 2030.11 is regarded by DOE-OE as a significant contribution that will help to drive the increased use of distributed, renewable energy resources, and their associated environmental benefits for decades.\nBasic Principles and Core Functions for Distributed Energy Resources Aggregation\nIEEE 2030.11 provides overall guidance for the application and deployment of DERMS and DERMS control systems. It proposes a set of core functions, including DER discovery/visualization; monitoring of real and reactive power loads and voltage at specific nodes; and related functional requirements. It also provides guidance on DER production estimation and scheduling; dispatch of real and reactive power; and provision of DER ancillary services such as voltage and frequency control/support.\nThis guide also gives direction on how to integrate two existing and increasingly popular ways to aggregate distributed energy resources into DERMS; namely, virtual power plants (VPPs) and microgrids. VPPs and microgrids are often thought to be different names for the same thing, but they are entirely different entities.\nVPPs have no fixed boundaries and are formed for the sole purpose of aggregating DER to enable bulk power sales. They can be problematic for the grid because the VPP operators don’t take transmission reliability constraints into account, and they also don’t always necessarily understand the process of power dispatch, which is fundamental to grid management.\nBy contrast, microgrids have fixed boundaries and their output feeds a utility’s local distribution system. Unlike VPPs, they can “island,” or disconnect from the grid if necessary, to ensure that they can deliver critical loads within their boundaries when needed.\nIn addition, a growing number of small to mid-sized DER facilities are being connected to the transmission and sub-transmission systems. This requires their coordinated management by the transmission system operators to enable their safe and reliable integration in the grid. IEEE 2030.11 also addresses the management of those DER facilities.\nBenefits to Multiple Stakeholders\nIEEE 2030.11 is intended to set forth guiding principles, provide a common language and define core functionalities for a DERMS to a wide range of stakeholders, including vendors, utilities, energy service providers, developers, standards organizations, and governing bodies.\nFor utilities, the guide shows how to develop a more sophisticated DER integration capability than currently exists, offering a more detailed view of the grid structure and enabling utilities to develop the specific solutions needed to operate their systems safely and reliably in the presence of high penetration of DER.\nFor aggregators, IEEE 2030.11 describes everything needed to interact with the power grid safely and reliably in order to conduct business, while strongly emphasizing the need and responsibility for strong cybersecurity processes and practices.\nFor businesses, campuses, and individuals, IEEE 2030.11 enables them to more easily maximize the value of their rooftop or other generation resources, by selling their excess power to an aggregator, rather than simply giving it away to the local utility.\nThe growing number of large-scale solar and wind power installations pose meaningful challenges for grid operation. A case in point was the sudden, unexpected loss of about 1,200 MW of solar power generation capability in California in 2016 – enough power for more than 10,000 homes – as a result of the Blue Cut wildfire.\nAs the penetration grows and technology of inverter-based resources evolves, specifications and standards are needed to address performance requirements. The IEEE P2800™ Wind and Solar Plant Interconnection Performance Working Group was established to build a consensus on the requirements for inverter-based resources interconnected with transmission and sub-transmission systems.\nAnother key task is to look at ways to incorporate DERMS into the coming electrification of transportation. To that end, the IEEE P2030.13 Working Group has a goal to provide a guide for the development of a functional specification for fast-charging station management and control systems for electric transportation, including energy management and grid-interaction functions.\n– Geza Joos, IEEE 2030.11 Working Group Chair\n– Anthony Johnson, IEEE 2030.11 Working Group Vice Chair\n– Robert Cummings, IEEE 2030.11 Working Group Vice Chair\n– James Reilly, IEEE 2030.11 Working Group Secretary\n– Jon Grooters, IEEE 2030.11 Working Group Participant"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:009e244b-c2fe-4137-a2ff-36f2926ef057>","<urn:uuid:97e4d8d4-725d-4016-8792-b8ff8b25e16e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What protection methods exist for aviation cameras from environmental hazards, and how does this compare to controlled environment benefits in vertical agriculture?","answer":"For aviation cameras, protective glass domes are crucial against environmental hazards, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions where airborne particulates, sand, dirt, and bugs can damage optical performance within days or weeks. Proper mounting systems are essential for reducing vibration and ensuring reliability. In contrast, vertical agriculture provides protection through enclosed, controlled environments that prevent pests and diseases through high hygiene levels, continuous monitoring, and non-chemical disinfection. These systems allow precise control over growth factors including light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, water, and nutrients, enabling year-round crop production independent of external conditions.","context":["AEROSPACE & AVIATION OPTICAL GLASS DOME\nDrone with PTZ Camera Dome\nIn addition to stringent optical requirements (see Optical Camera Domes), optical glass domes for UAV and RPV aviation applications fall into a unique category of mechanical demands. In particular, the faster the aircraft, the more challenging the demands on the mechanical integrity and optical performance of an aviation camera dome due to impacts. For aerospace applications, including missiles and UAVs, the biggest challenge comes from low altitude flight operations. Although the more infamous bird impacts are a concern and must be considered, the biggest problem comes from abradants such as sand, dirt and even bugs!\nThis is especially prevalent in arid and semi-arid areas of the world, which contain high concentrations of airborne particulates and bugs. Be it aviation border patrols on the U.S/Mexican border, or low altitude UAV / RPV flight operations in the Middle East, airborne particulates must be considered when designing an aviation optical glass dome. Ignoring this critical environmental hazard will result in loss of optical performance of aerospace camera domes, sometimes in a matter of only days or weeks. Rayotek specializes in engineering and manufacturing glass domes specifically for aerospace applications.\nUAV with High Impact Camera Dome\nWHAT IS THE BEST OPTICAL DOME MATERIAL FOR AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS?\nChoosing the right material is critical in engineering an optical glass dome for UAV, RPV and Missile applications. Highly durable materials such as sapphire and ALON are the most robust and abrasion resistant, but material costs are considerably higher than glass, plus sapphire and ALON cannot be molded. Sapphire and ALON must be grown, ground and polished; all very time consuming processes. In many applications Rayotek recommends borosilicate glass, or, for small optical domes, chemically-strengthened specialty glasses such as Gorilla® Glass*. These high quality optical glasses are more than adequate and can be molded, making manufacturing times literally thousands of times faster than processing sapphire type materials.\nFor more information about the optical quality of Rayotek Engineered Glass Domes, see Optical Camera Domes or contact us for engineering assistance.\nWingtip Nav Lens Dome\nPROPERLY MOUNTED GLASS DOMES PERFORM BETTER, LAST LONGER:\nAerospace glass domes are highly dependent on proper mounting systems for the best strength and reliability.

With a growing population and resource needs, the availability of arable land is shrinking rapidly.\nSince the agricultural revolution, conventional agriculture has focused on practices requiring considerable quantities of space, water, fertilizer, and pesticides. The past 50 years have seen an accelerating rate of increase in these requirements as modern food production aims to increase productivity in the hopes of addressing growing food insecurity.\nLooking into the future, yield production is forecasted to decrease due to widespread environmental and socioeconomic changes that will generate unpredictable consequences on food systems.\nIn response, many strategies have been developed as alternatives to conventional agricultural practices. These strategies have focused on key principles and their combination to be effective: require less space, less water, and increase yield per unit of area. Moreover, due to the negative effects of agrichemicals, modern practices have also aimed to use significantly less to avoid potentially adverse effects for humans and animals.\nOne such alternative is the development of vertical agriculture, also referred to as vertical farming. As the name implies, vertical agriculture relies on expanding production vertically and not horizontally. Vertical agriculture is a multilayer indoor plant production system that allows for precise control of growth factors, such as light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, water, and nutrients.\nThis allows for the growing and production of crops year-round, completely independent of solar light and other external conditions. Indeed, vertical agriculture makes use of key concepts within ecology and physiology to optimize growing and fertilization within controlled conditions. For instance, elements of photobiology, thermomorphogenesis, hydroponics, and genetic breeding, are all used commonly across systems of vertical agriculture.\nBenefits, challenges, and disadvantages moving from horizontal to vertical farming\nAs a result of tight control over crop breeding, growing, and harvesting, vertical farming provides several benefits relative to conventional methods of ‘horizontal’ food production. This was the topic of a literature review by Kalantari et al. published in 2016 in the Journal of Landscape Ecology.\nFrom a systems perspective, the enclosed design prevents pests and diseases from entering by the adoption of a high level of hygiene, continuous monitoring, and non-chemical disinfection, providing security from crops. Moreover, recent technology has also allowed for automated control over environmental conditions by using sensors and imaging techniques in combination with crop simulation models and artificial intelligence, limiting the need for physical labor.\nVertical farming also allows for flexible organization, with designs ranging from large vertical walls covered with crops to large hangars or re-used shipping containers that can be transported. Consequently, vertical agricultural systems, can comprise many varying sizes and be located within many different areas from the middle of highly urbanized cities to more suburban or rural areas.\nMoreover, the verticality element of this system also provides nutrient and water flow, helping to reuse costly resources. The reduction in space also means there is a significant increase in yield per area, holding extensive potential for a future world of urbanization.\nFrom an economic perspective, vertical farming also provides for more jobs in localized areas and is community-focused by addressing the needs of immediate areas, which in turn can provide food at a lower price. Finally, the optionality of location for vertical systems also allows producers to reduce transport costs, as consumers may access them within urban areas, or transport can be minimized to nearby areas.\nHowever, despite the design, environmental, and economic advantages, vertical farming also incorporates several issues that remain a challenge to its broader implementation as a system.\nVertical farming has a high energy requirement and needs extensive investment costs to implement and develop successfully. Moreover, indoor issues relating to excessive UV, heat, and ozone-induced plant damage may have unpredictable repercussions for plant growth.\nAdditionally, vertical systems are difficult to adapt to a larger scale. They are costly to build and maintain and have yet to demonstrate the ability to provide food for larger areas than community-scale populations. This would make it difficult to implement in areas at higher risk of food insecurity, such as developing agricultural nations.\nThe lack of empirical research on a broader scale has meant that vertical farming has yet to develop past the concept stage on community levels, as persistent issues make it difficult to break through to a larger scale.\nImage Credit: YEINISM/Shutterstock.com\nGrowing skywards - the implications of vertical farming in a rapidly populating and changing world\nAmong the development of alternative agricultural practices, vertical agriculture provides a promising solution for many of the challenges facing current agricultural policies. However, for vertical systems to be integrated on a larger scale requires further technological progress and economic investment.\nNevertheless, gradually implementing more verticality, or combining it with other practices aiming for more sustainable practices may be promising. For instance, the combination of verticality with other practices such as intercropping may be particularly beneficial for developing more sustainable food systems.\nIncorporating technological progress into vertical systems also holds promise, with automated sensors and machinery able to operate near-independently. Progress in gene editing and plant genome modifications will also allow for faster, bigger, and healthier crops, allowing vertical agriculture to produce more over time.\nThroughout agricultural history, farming systems have typically spread over large spans of land, yet the reduction in arable land, as well as the increase in demand to house growing populations, means that such strategies need to be reconsidered, and vertical agriculture may play a role looking into the future.\nContinue Reading: Benefits of Vertical Agriculture and Hydroponics\n- Beacham, A.

{"question":"What were the key defensive challenges faced by bomber crews over Berlin compared to the resistance encountered by Allied forces during the North African landings?","answer":"The defensive challenges in both operations were significant but distinct in nature. Over Berlin, bomber crews faced sophisticated German defenses including 'Wilde Sau' fighters that acquired bombers visually over targets, radar-equipped 'Sahme Sau' nightfighters, and the deadly 'Schrage Musik' upward-firing cannon mounted in fighter fuselages that could attack from below while searchlights blinded bomber gunners. In North Africa, the Allied forces faced unexpected resistance from Vichy French forces, including coastal artillery batteries that fired on landing troops, naval engagement from French cruisers, destroyers, and submarines at Casablanca, and the battleship Jean Bart which engaged US forces until disabled. However, the French resistance was generally lighter and less coordinated than Berlin's defenses, with some French commanders even welcoming American forces ashore.","context":["A typical Lancaster bomb load during the Berlin attacks comprised high-explosive bombs, including a 4,000lb `cookie' and incendiaries.\nNicknamed the `Big City' by the crews of Bomber Command, the German capital was one of the most feared of targets. Berlin was a formidable prospect: it meant the heaviest of defences and a long flight over enemy-occupied territory.\nAlmost 600 miles from London, early in the war Berlin was close to the maximum range of the then available bomber aircraft types. Nonetheless, the first RAF raid was mounted at the height of the Battle of Britain on the night of August 25, 1940, when 95 aircraft were dispatched. Five more `ops' were flown over the next two weeks and others followed over the next year. But difficulties in navigating accurately led to the small loads dropped being widely dispersed and after November 1941 Berlin was not attacked again until January 16/17, 1943.\nThe arrival of Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris as C-in-C in 1942 reinvigorated Bomber Command as it steadily increased in size and effectiveness. New tactics evolved, such as the `bomber stream', and new navigation and targeting aids meant that by early 1943 Harris was ready for what he described as his main offensive.\nThis campaign was to last a year and feature a series of `battles'; the concept being to repeatedly concentrate the `Main Force' against a particular objective until it was deemed to have been destroyed. The principal, and most effective, weapon for the campaign was the superb Avro Lancaster.\nThroughout the spring of 1943, the industrial heartland of the Ruhr valley was the target for the first of the epic set-piece, followed by a brief assault on Hamburg that destroyed much of the port city.\nFrom the outset it was established that for cogent tactical reasons, as well as those imposed by the weather, none of these battles would exclusively focus on the capital. A resolute campaign against Berlin would have allowed the enemy to concentrate defences, so route variations, tactical feints and new devices were introduced to outwit the Germans.\nBut the defenders were very adaptable. The RAF's introduction of `Window', which disrupted radar pictures, led to the development of new and highly effective tactics: single-engined Wilde Sau (Wild Boar) fighters flew over the target to acquire bombers visually - followed later by long-range radar-equipped Sahne Sau (Tame Boar) nightfighters. Both were to reap a grim harvest through the coming winter. Before the campaign began there were several precursory attacks in the late summer of 1943. The first was on the night of August 23/24 when 710 bombers were launched on the heaviest Berlin raid to date.\nOn the night of November 18/19, Harris opened the Battle of Berlin proper, with the first of a series of 16 attacks. So as to disguise the primary purpose, smaller raids on other targets were mounted to split the enemy defences, often flown by the more vulnerable Stirlings and Merlin-engined Halifaxes.\nAs expected, Berlin's highly co-ordinated defences inflicted heavy losses on the bombers. To keep the Germans guessing, at times dummy raids were staged on Berlin when other cities were the main target. Leipzig was twice the centre of Bomber Command's attention, requiring very long transits and exposing the Lancasters to unremitting high risk.\nApproach and egress routes to the `Big City' became more complex as the campaign evolved. Streaming via Denmark, with lots of course changes en route to the target was adopted as a tactic. Longer legs via the Baltic, providing a route to Berlin from the north, also added an element of surprise. The flight path home was also changed on a sortie-to-sortie basis.\nThe Battle of Berlin witnessed the advent of Schrage Musik, deadly upward-firing cannon mounted in the upper fuselage of night-fighters. This enabled the defending fighter force to approach bombers from below, with fires on the ground and searchlights illuminating their quarry. On the bombers, front and rear gunners scanning the skies for fighters would have their vision blurred by looking down on the light sources.\nThe final raid of the Battle of Berlin came on March 30/31, a `maximum effort' against Nuremberg, a diversionary strike to keep the Luftwaffe guessing. A total of 96 aircraft fell, Bomber Command's worst night of the war. Despite immense courage and unimaginable hardship and sacrifice by the men of Bomber Command, the assault on the `Big City' ended in operational failure that some historians have described as being not just a defeat, but a disaster.","Both Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt knew that they had to make some tangible moves against the Germans in 1942. And despite Josef Stalin’s insistence that western allies open a second front, Churchill knew that would end in disaster.\nSo the powers decided that they’d first pacify North Africa, where the British Eighth Army and the German Afrika Korps had been fighting back and forth since 1940. After much disagreement, it was decided to invade Morocco and Algeria and establish a base where the supply lines for the Germans in the Mediterranean could be cut. This would open as Mr. Churchill called it the “soft underbelly of Europe.” But this first foray for the Americans into the war against Nazi Germany was a victory, not so much militarily but politically as the allies were treading on a slippery slope dealing with the Free French as well as Vichy and the inexperienced Americans.\nPresident Roosevelt had wanted to execute “Operation Sledgehammer”, the joint Allied invasion of Western Europe into France, but Field Marshal Rommel’s attack in Egypt had come with 120 miles of Alexandria. General Marshall and Admiral King of the US had argued that the British didn’t want to invade France or Belgium in either 1942 or 1943. But they were ordered by the President to go along, one of only two times during the war years that he so invoked that privilege.\nThe Plan: The Allies decided on the operation to be done with three separate task forces. The overall commander was General Eisenhower with his deputy of General Mark Clark. Clark would come ashore by submarine early and in a bit of cloak and dagger, try to convince the French not to fight.\nThe Western Task Force under General George Patton consisted of the 2nd Armored Division, and the 3rd and 9th Infantry Divisions. Patton’s forces would land in Spanish Morocco at Fedala outside of Casablanca, Safi, and Mehdia outside of Port Lyautey. He’d have 35,000 troops and 100 ships under his command.\nThe Central Task Force was commanded by General Lloyd Fredendall and consisted of the 1st Armored Division and the 1st Infantry Division as well as the 509th Parachute Infantry. The would land in Western Algeria at Oran and at two landing sites on either side of it. They totaled 18,500 total troops.\nThe Eastern Task Force was commanded by Lieutenant General Kenneth Anderson but once the troops hit the ground, they’d be led by General Charles Ryder commander of the 34 Infantry Division. They would also have a brigade from the British 78th Division and two British Commando Units (1 and 6 Commando). They totaled 20,000 troops and would land around Algiers.\nThe Allies organized the three amphibious task forces to simultaneously seize the key ports and airports in Morocco and Algeria, targeting Casablanca, Oran, and Algiers. Successful completion of these operations was to be followed by an eastwards advance into Tunisia. This would cut off the German retreat as they were being pushed westward by the British Eighth Army.\nThe Battle: Patton, never one to mince words told the Naval commanders, that their plans on landing the troops would “break down in the first five minutes,” and then in typical Patton fashion told the navy this: “Never in the history of warfare has a navy landed an army at the planned time and place. But if you land us within fifty miles of Fedala and within one week of D-Day, I’ll go ahead and win.”\nHis Western task force landed without naval bombardment because it was hoped that the French wouldn’t resist. This decision would prove costly to the Americans. The green American troops were pinned down by a surprisingly light amount of French troops.At Safi, the plan was to land about 50 Sherman tanks there and to block any reinforcements from the strong French garrison at Marrakech. The coastal batteries opened up and the American naval bombardment silenced them. But by the afternoon of November 8th, D-Day, they had control of Safi. Unloading the tanks was a slow process, the American 2nd Armored didn’t finish unloading until the 10th, these were the learning curves that would pay dividends in 1944.\nAt Port-Lyautey, the landing troops were delayed. This gave the French defenders time to organize resistance, and the remaining landings were conducted under artillery bombardment. However, with the assistance of air support from the carriers, the troops pushed ahead, and the objectives were captured.\nAfter the landings at Fedala, the port of Casablanca was surrounded. It was the principal French Atlantic naval base. The naval engagement resulted from a sortie of French cruisers, destroyers, and submarines opposing the landings. A cruiser, six destroyers, and six submarines were destroyed by American gunfire and aircraft. The incomplete French battleship Jean Bart—which was docked and immobile—fired on the landing force and the battleship USS Massachusetts with her one working gun turret until she was knocked out of action by the Massachusetts’ 16-inch guns, the first such heavy-caliber shells fired by the U.S. Navy anywhere in World War II. Two U.S. destroyers were damaged.\nAt Oran in the Central Task Force, the opposition was much tougher but was quickly brought under control due to superior planning on the part of the British Navy and Terry Allen, Commander of the US 1st Infantry Division. Allen’s troops landed on target and on time and they swept aside any resistance and captured the port and city in a double envelopment.\nThe U.S. 1st Ranger Battalion landed east of Oran and quickly captured the shore battery at Arzew. A bold attempt was made to land U.S. infantry at the harbor directly, in order to quickly prevent the destruction of the port facilities and scuttling of ships. The operation failed, as two sloops were destroyed by crossfire from the French vessels there. The Vichy naval force tried to break out from the harbor and attack the Allied invasion fleet but its ships were all sunk or driven ashore.\nOperation Torch was the first major airborne assault carried out by the United States. The 2nd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment flew all the way from Britain, over Spain, intending to drop near Oran and capture airfields at Tafraoui and La Sénia, respectively 15 miles (24 km) and 5 miles (8 km) south of Oran.The operation was hampered by weather, navigational and communication problems. Poor weather caused the formation to scatter and forced thirty of the 37 aircraft to land in the dry salt lake to the west of the objective.The few drops that did occur were wildly scattered. However, the 509th captured both airfields.\nOne interesting footnote of the airborne operation concerned Pvt John Thomas (Tommy) Mackall. Mackall was assigned to Company E, 2nd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment. During the airborne segment of Operation Torch, he was mortally wounded in an attack by French Vichy aircraft on his aircraft as the aircraft landed near Oran. Seven paratroopers died on the C-47 and several were wounded, including Mackall. He was evacuated by air to a British hospital at Gibraltar where he died on November 12, 1942.\nThe Special Forces Training Facility in North Carolina now sports Mackall’s name. During WWII Camp Mackall was a huge airborne training base preparing paratroopers for combat duty.\nAt Algiers, there was a coup staged by nearly 400 members of the Jewish Resistance Fighters kicked off. They seized key targets, including the telephone exchange, radio station, governor’s house and the headquarters of 19th Corps.\nThe landings took place on three beaches, two west of Algiers and one east. Although some landings of the 34th Infantry Division took place on the wrong beaches, they quickly pushed inland due to the paucity of the French resistance. The coastal artillery batteries had been put out of action by the Jewish Resistance Fighters. On another beach, there was no resistance as the French commander welcomed the Americans as they landed on shore. Two British destroyers boldly raced into the harbor to unload 250 American Rangers who were tasked with seizing the facilities before they could be scuttled. One destroyer unloaded the Rangers, the other was forced back by heavy gunfire. General Juin, Commander of the Vichy French troops, surrendered the city at 1800 hrs on November 8.\nThe Germans Respond: Due to the lack of Vichy French resistance to the Allies landing in North Africa, the Germans didn’t trust the French any longer. As a result, the Germans overran the remainder of Southern France which had been left under Vichy control after the French surrender of 1940.\nThe German raced to the port of Toulon where the French had a sizable fleet there, to take control of those ships. But the French scuttled the fleet in the harbor, denying the Germans the use of those, which turned out to be a significant loss.\nThe Americans and British drive on Tunisia but the Germans, retreating from Montgomery’s Eighth Army, reached there first. Later in the spring of 1943, Rommel would decisively rout the American II Corps under Fredendall at the Kasserine Pass. That would move Eisenhower to replace him with Patton. It wasn’t until mid-May 1943 that the last of the Germans surrendered in Tunisia. The Allies would invade Sicily in mid-July, Churchill’s so-called “soft underbelly” of Europe.\nThe amphibious landings didn’t go well, but the green Americans would learn the hard lessons that would serve them well before they finally invaded the French coast on June 6, 1944. That experience and the enhanced cooperation with the naval forces would make the largest invasion force in history less than two years later.\nPhotos Courtesy: Wikipedia"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6602e62d-93f6-49b5-94a9-639516a710a9>","<urn:uuid:41c04db3-990f-4342-94a0-0c0e12df64ae>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does immediate versus long-term noise exposure affect hearing, and what are the underlying physical mechanisms?","answer":"Immediate hearing loss occurs from extremely loud bursts of sound, which can rupture the eardrum or damage middle ear bones, causing permanent hearing damage instantly. These intense sounds create large pressure variations in the air, with the pressure amplitude being proportional to the oscillation amplitude. Long-term exposure to lower but still harmful noise levels causes gradual hearing loss through damage to inner ear structures. This occurs because sound waves create oscillating elements of air with kinetic energy proportional to the amplitude squared. The damage accumulates over time, similar to sun damage to skin, and may initially manifest as distorted or muffled sounds and difficulty understanding speech. Additionally, both types of exposure can cause tinnitus - a ringing, buzzing, or roaring sensation in the ears that may be temporary or permanent.","context":["By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n- Define intensity, sound intensity, and sound pressure level.\n- Calculate sound intensity levels in decibels (dB).\nThe information presented in this section supports the following AP® learning objectives and science practices:\n- 6.A.4.1 The student is able to explain and/or predict qualitatively how the energy carried by a sound wave relates to the amplitude of the wave, and/or apply this concept to a real-world example. (S.P. 6.4)\nIn a quiet forest, you can sometimes hear a single leaf fall to the ground. After settling into bed, you may hear your blood pulsing through your ears. But when a passing motorist has his stereo turned up, you cannot even hear what the person next to you in your car is saying. We are all very familiar with the loudness of sounds and aware that they are related to how energetically the source is vibrating. In cartoons depicting a screaming person (or an animal making a loud noise), the cartoonist often shows an open mouth with a vibrating uvula, the hanging tissue at the back of the mouth, to suggest a loud sound coming from the throat Figure 17.14. High noise exposure is hazardous to hearing, and it is common for musicians to have hearing losses that are sufficiently severe that they interfere with the musicians’ abilities to perform. The relevant physical quantity is sound intensity, a concept that is valid for all sounds whether or not they are in the audible range.\nIntensity is defined to be the power per unit area carried by a wave. Power is the rate at which energy is transferred by the wave. In equation form, intensity is\nwhere is the power through an area . The SI unit for is . The intensity of a sound wave is related to its amplitude squared by the following relationship:\nHere is the pressure variation or pressure amplitude (half the difference between the maximum and minimum pressure in the sound wave) in units of pascals (Pa) or .

In this equation, is the density of the material in which the sound wave travels, in units of , and is the speed of sound in the medium, in units of m/s. The pressure variation is proportional to the amplitude of the oscillation, and so varies as (Figure 17.14). This relationship is consistent with the fact that the sound wave is produced by some vibration; the greater its pressure amplitude, the more the air is compressed in the sound it creates.\nSound intensity levels are quoted in decibels (dB) much more often than sound intensities in watts per meter squared. Decibels are the unit of choice in the scientific literature as well as in the popular media. The reasons for this choice of units are related to how we perceive sounds. How our ears perceive sound can be more accurately described by the logarithm of the intensity rather than directly to the intensity. The sound intensity level in decibels of a sound having an intensity in watts per meter squared is defined to be\nwhere is a reference intensity. In particular, is the lowest or threshold intensity of sound a person with normal hearing can perceive at a frequency of 1000 Hz. Sound intensity level is not the same as intensity. Because is defined in terms of a ratio, it is a unitless quantity telling you the level of the sound relative to a fixed standard (, in this case). The units of decibels (dB) are used to indicate this ratio is multiplied by 10 in its definition. The bel, upon which the decibel is based, is named for Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone.\n|Sound intensity level β (dB)||Intensity I(W/m2)||Example/effect|\n|Threshold of hearing at 1000 Hz|\n|Rustle of leaves|\n|Whisper at 1 m distance|\n|Average office, soft music|\n|Noisy office, busy traffic|\n|Loud radio, classroom lecture|\n|Inside a heavy truck; damage from prolonged exposure1|\n|Noisy factory, siren at 30 m; damage from 8 h per day exposure|\n|Damage from 30 min per day exposure|\n|Loud rock concert, pneumatic chipper at 2 m; threshold of pain|\n|Jet airplane at 30 m; severe pain, damage in seconds|\n|Bursting of eardrums|\nThe decibel level of a sound having the threshold intensity of is , because . That is, the threshold of hearing is 0 decibels. Table 17.5 gives levels in decibels and intensities in watts per meter squared for some familiar sounds.\nOne of the more striking things about the intensities in Table 17.5 is that the intensity in watts per meter squared is quite small for most sounds. The ear is sensitive to as little as a trillionth of a watt per meter squared—even more impressive when you realize that the area of the eardrum is only about , so that only W falls on it at the threshold of hearing! Air molecules in a sound wave of this intensity vibrate over a distance of less than one molecular diameter, and the gauge pressures involved are less than atm.\nAnother impressive feature of the sounds in Table 17.5 is their numerical range. Sound intensity varies by a factor of from threshold to a sound that causes damage in seconds. You are unaware of this tremendous range in sound intensity because how your ears respond can be described approximately as the logarithm of intensity. Thus, sound intensity levels in decibels fit your experience better than intensities in watts per meter squared. The decibel scale is also easier to relate to because most people are more accustomed to dealing with numbers such as 0, 53, or 120 than numbers such as .\nOne more observation readily verified by examining Table 17.5 or using is that each factor of 10 in intensity corresponds to 10 dB. For example, a 90 dB sound compared with a 60 dB sound is 30 dB greater, or three factors of 10 (that is, times) as intense. Another example is that if one sound is as intense as another, it is 70 dB higher. See Table 17.6.\nCalculating Sound Intensity Levels: Sound Waves\nCalculate the sound intensity level in decibels for a sound wave traveling in air at and having a pressure amplitude of 0.656 Pa.\nWe are given , so we can calculate using the equation . Using , we can calculate straight from its definition in .\n(1) Identify knowns:\nSound travels at 331 m/s in air at .\nAir has a density of at atmospheric pressure and .\n(2) Enter these values and the pressure amplitude into :\n(3) Enter the value for and the known value for into . Calculate to find the sound intensity level in decibels:\nThis 87 dB sound has an intensity five times as great as an 80 dB sound. So a factor of five in intensity corresponds to a difference of 7 dB in sound intensity level. This value is true for any intensities differing by a factor of five.\nChange Intensity Levels of a Sound: What Happens to the Decibel Level?\nShow that if one sound is twice as intense as another, it has a sound level about 3 dB higher.\nYou are given that the ratio of two intensities is 2 to 1, and are then asked to find the difference in their sound levels in decibels. You can solve this problem using of the properties of logarithms.\n(1) Identify knowns:\nThe ratio of the two intensities is 2 to 1, or:\nWe wish to show that the difference in sound levels is about 3 dB. That is, we want to show:\n(2) Use the definition of to get:\nThis means that the two sound intensity levels differ by 3.01 dB, or about 3 dB, as advertised. Note that because only the ratio is given (and not the actual intensities), this result is true for any intensities that differ by a factor of two. For example, a 56.0 dB sound is twice as intense as a 53.0 dB sound, a 97.0 dB sound is half as intense as a 100 dB sound, and so on.\nIt should be noted at this point that there is another decibel scale in use, called the sound pressure level, based on the ratio of the pressure amplitude to a reference pressure. This scale is used particularly in applications where sound travels in water. It is beyond the scope of most introductory texts to treat this scale because it is not commonly used for sounds in air, but it is important to note that very different decibel levels may be encountered when sound pressure levels are quoted. For example, ocean noise pollution produced by ships may be as great as 200 dB expressed in the sound pressure level, where the more familiar sound intensity level we use here would be something under 140 dB for the same sound.\nFind a CD player and a CD that has rock music.

Normally, these sounds are at safe levels that don’t damage our hearing. However, when we’re exposed to harmful noise - sounds that are too loud or loud sounds that last a long time - sensitive structures in our inner ear can be damaged, causing noise injury.\nFind out more in this section about:\nWe've also listed some useful websites and resources for more information.\nNoise injury can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense sound, such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time, such as noise generated in a woodworking shop.\nLoud sound does not have to be physically painful to cause hearing damage. If you are in a situation in which you need to raise your voice to be understood, then the noise is probably too loud. Damage to hearing from noise accumulates, just as the sun can gradually damage our skin. The higher the level of sound and the longer the exposure, the more damage likely to occur.\nSound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds of less than 75 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, repeated or lengthy exposure to sounds at or above 85 decibels (approximately the level of a vacuum cleaner) can cause hearing loss.\nThe table below gives examples of various everyday sounds, the sound level or loudness (given as decibels), and the length of time we can safely be exposed to these sounds before permanent damage is likely to occur.\n|Noise Source||Decibel Level||How long can you listen without protection?|\n|Jet take off||130||0 minutes|\n|Ambulance siren||109||Less than 2 minutes|\n|Personal music player at maximum volume||106||3.75 minutes|\n|Pop/Rock Concert||103||7.5 minutes|\n|Riding a Motorcycle||97||30 minutes|\n|Using an Electric drill||94||1 hour|\n> Want to know more about other loud sounds and how loud is too loud? Check out this interactive noise meter.\n> For a more in-depth look at loud sounds, visit the NOISE database which brings together hundreds of noise measurements from around the world.\nLong-term hearing loss\nWhen we’re exposed to loud noise over a long period of time, we gradually start to lose our hearing. Over time, the sounds we hear may become distorted or muffled, and it may be difficult to understand other people when they talk. If you have noise injury you might not even be aware of it, but it can be detected with a hearing test.\nImmediate hearing loss\nNoise injury can also be caused by extremely loud bursts of sound, such as gunshots or explosions, which can rupture the eardrum or damage the bones in the middle ear. This kind of noise injury could result in immediate hearing loss that may be permanent.\nLoud noise exposure can also cause tinnitus - a ringing, buzzing, or roaring in the ears or head. Tinnitus may subside over time, but can sometimes be permanent, continuing constantly or occasionally throughout a person’s life. Hearing loss and tinnitus can occur in one or both ears. Watch our HEARsmart video to find out more.\nTemporary hearing loss\nSometimes exposure to impulse and continuous loud noise causes a temporary hearing loss, which disappears 16 to 48 hours later. Recent research suggests, however, that although the loss of hearing seems to disappear, there may be residual long-term damage to your hearing.\nNoise injury is the only type of hearing loss that is completely preventable. If you understand the hazards of noise and how to practice good hearing health, you can protect your hearing for life. Here's how:\n- Avoid loud sounds and noise if you can.\n- Sudden, very intense sounds (e.g. gunshots) are particularly dangerous and can cause immediate, permanent hearing loss.\n- If you attend loud music events (clubs, gigs, rock concerts), put some distance between yourself and the speakers and use hearing protection. There is a wide range of earplugs designed to protect hearing while preserving the sound quality of the music, many of which are included in the HEARsmart review of earplugs: What Plug?\n- Limit the time you spend in noisy places, and take regular breaks in quieter areas.\n- If you use a personal music player, set the volume at a moderate level. Avoid turning up the level to try and drown out other background noise.\n- Be aware that your risk increases if you are occupationally exposed to solvents or toxins or if you are taking certain drugs.\n- Talk to your occupational health and safety officer about making your workplace quieter. Remember, it is an employer's responsibility to provide a safe work environment.\n- If you cannot avoid loud sound, then you should protect your ears with earplugs or ear muffs. Balls of cottonwool or paper tissue offer little protection.\n- You should give your ears frequent rest from noise."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:decf0a38-c6fd-49bd-98bb-b33b48fb148f>","<urn:uuid:71f207aa-6ca3-45ed-82f1-22c9a0e4207a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the connection between early medical collections and the Habsburg art collections in terms of their organizational systems?","answer":"Early medical collections and the Habsburg art collections developed different but systematic approaches to organization. Medical collections, which began with pharmacists and doctors, initially relied on traditional beliefs about healing properties and used long descriptive labels for organization. By the 19th century, natural history museums had adopted a standardized classification system (Kingdom-Phylum-Class-Order-Family-Genus-Species). The Habsburg Picture Gallery, while initially displayed decoratively in the Baroque style, later adopted an innovative systematic presentation at the Belvedere Palace in 1781, reflecting Enlightenment principles of educational and systematic display. Both types of collections eventually moved from somewhat arbitrary organizational systems to more structured, scientific approaches to classification and display.","context":["Why do museums collect?\nBefore there were printed books – even before there were written languages – human beings collected “things”. Collecting was, perhaps, the first way people had to capture a thought or hold on to an experience.\nWhat do museums collect?\nThe earliest collections seem to have been made up mainly of personal possessions or items used in special ceremonies. But as people’s lives and activities began to include different parts of the world, different cultures, and much more of Nature, objects were collected that went beyond any single person’s knowledge. When an object seemed unlike anything in a person’s experience, odd or strange, it came to be called a “curiosity”.\nAs collections of curiosities grew in Britain and Europe, their owners stored and displayed them in varying ways, showing them to larger and larger groups of people. In time, these “cabinets of curiosities” developed into the first public museums.\nWhat should museums collect?\nOver the past 400 years, it seems that many museums have always collected the same types of items. All the objects in this exhibit were found in the collections of this museum, yet many of the same kinds of things could also have been found in famous “cabinets” of the 17th century.\nThe Director of the British Museum recently wrote that this type of exhibit can both “reflect on the Museum’s past” and “help us contemplate our future”. Tell us what you think.\nDuring the 17th century, scientists in Britain and Europe proved, through experiment, that solutions of alcohol – called “distilled spirits” or “spirits of wine” – could preserve the soft tissues of living things almost indefinitely. This allowed the remains of many new types of animals and plants to be added to cabinets, along with dissected preparations of animal and human anatomy. However, because these solutions could, if not properly maintained, evaporate from the storage vessels, very few of the early spirit collections have survived to the present day.\nA Cabinet of Curiosities\nThis display imitates a style known from many of the earliest museums. As trade and voyages of discovery criss-crossed the world, collections grew faster than the supply of reference books needed to describe and organize them. Objects would be displayed in whatever order seemed right, or looked interesting. Viewing such a cabinet was like a “voyage of discovery” in miniature. Please look through the contents of this cabinet, and let us know what you discover!\nFor thousands of years, the cultures of the Mediterranean region and Europe placed great importance on organizing knowledge and, especially, naming natural things. Yet each system of “naming names” was challenged by expanding knowledge of the natural world.\nAs collections in cabinets of curiosities grew to tremendous sizes, demand increased for a simple and efficient way to name and organize all of the new discoveries. Early cabinets depended on long, descriptive labels attached to each object, or illustrated catalogs, but by the 19th century modern natural history museums had adopted a uniform scale of classification that could be used to create a unique designation for each form of plant or animal life:\nKingdom – Phylum – Class – Order – Family – Genus - Species\nPharmacists and doctors created some of the earliest of the great European and British collections. According to ancient traditions, many of the objects in these collections were believed to have healing or purifying properties, or relate in some way to the structure and function of the human body. Nothing was known about how medicines acted to cure illness or relieve symptoms, so it was thought that simply possessing a variety of these medical curiosities – materia medica – could give access to their healing “virtues”.","History of the collection\nThe Picture Gallery had its origins in the 16th and 17th centuries and by the end of the 18th century already existed for the most part in its present form.\nGreat collectors of the House of Habsburg, such as Archduke Ferdinand II (1529–1595), Emperor Rudolf II (1552–1612) and Archduke Leopold Wilhelm (1614–1662), determined in a decisive and lasting manner the character of the collection. But it was not until the 18th century that the various holdings were brought together and displayed in Vienna’s Stallburg. In 1781 the paintings were moved to the Belvedere Palace. The innovative, systematic presentation there is considered an important moment in the history of the modern art museum. Ever since that time the Picture Gallery has been open to the public. In 1891 the Picture Gallery along with the other imperial collections were finally moved into the recently completed Kunsthistorisches Museum on Vienna’s Ringstrasse.\nThe Collection of Rudolf II.\nEven though most of the paintings from the collection of Emperor Rudolf II were scattered to the four winds after Swedish forces plundered Prague in 1648, his collection remained a point of departure for later Habsburg art patronage. Among the fragments of Rudolf’s gallery found in Vienna today are the following masterpieces: the Bruegel collection, which had come from Rudolf’s brother Ernest, the Dürer holdings and works by Rudolf’s court painters in Prague. These and a number of masterpieces of Italian Mannerism (Correggio, Parmigianino) must have been particularly in keeping with Rudolf’s preference for sensual subjects.\nThe Picture Gallery of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm\nA decisive figure in the founding of the Vienna Picture Gallery is Archduke Leopold Wilhelm (1614-1662), the brother of Emperor Ferdinand III. The archduke was regent of the Netherlands (1647-1656) and was able to take advantage of the political situation towards the end of the Thirty Years’ War, including the revolution in England, to acquire wonderful paintings. In addition to the collections of Buckingham and Hamilton, both of whom had collected outstanding works of (northern) Italian art, the archduke was also able to purchase masterpieces of Early Netherlandish and contemporary Flemish painting in the commercial centres of Antwerp and Brussels. He did so not only in his own interest but also for his brother, Emperor Ferdinand III, in Prague. These paintings were intended to replace those looted by the Swedes. In this manner, Leopold Wilhelm assembled a collection of around 1400 pictures. In 1656 they were brought to Vienna, put on display in the Stallburg, and catalogued in an exemplary manner. In 1662 they came into the possession of Emperor Leopold I.\nThe Habsburg collector Leopold Wilhelm, accompanied by his gallery director, David Teniers, and several other people, is depicted against a decorative background of paintings. The view is of the archduke’s gallery in Brussels, where he assembled one of the most important painting collections of the 17th century during his tenure as regent from 1647–56, providing an important basis for the Vienna Picture Gallery today.\nThrough the purchase of several large art collections that came onto the market following the revolution in England (1648), Leopold Wilhelm saw his gallery grow enormously within a short period. By the time he returned to Vienna in 1656, it contained around 1400 pictures. Most of the 51 Italian paintings depicted here are today in the Kunsthistorisches Museum.\nReorganisation under Emperor Charles VI\nIn the early 18th century Charles VI decided to bring together in Vienna the Habsburg dynasty’s paintings from the various residences. His own artwork, which in part he had brought with him from Spain, was redisplayed together with the holdings of Ferdinand II from Prague Castle and the collection of Leopold Wilhelm in Vienna’s Stallburg, which had been extensively renovated for that purpose. The display was planned along Baroque principles, which called for a decorative total concept.\nIn 1728, in the course of this undertaking, Charles VI commissioned the Neapolitan painter Francesco Solimena to paint a large dedicatory painting that would be a lasting monument to the emperor and his appreciation of art: with a solemn gesture the imperial architect Gundaker, Count Althann hands the emperor the inventory of his newly displayed collection. Charles VI also had Ferdinand Storffer make a painted inventory, which today conveys to us an idea of the appearance and the holdings of the imperial gallery in his day.\nRedisplay in the Upper Belvedere\nFifty years later, the late Baroque style in which the paintings were hung in the Stallburg must have seemed stiff, inflexible and anachronistic. In addition, many large-format Flemish and Italian altarpieces from disbanded cloisters and churches had been added under Maria Theresa and Joseph II in the late 1770s and 1780s.\nIn 1776 Maria Theresa decided to open to the public the imperial Picture Gallery in the Upper Belvedere, the former garden palace of Prince Eugene of Savoy. By 1781 this redisplay according to a historical perspective was complete; the spirit of the Enlightenment with its demands for educational and systematic display were palpable. To accompany the opening of the gallery, a catalogue of the paintings was published in German and French. This was one of the first public catalogues to be compiled according to scholarly criteria. The layout included in the catalogue reveals the principles according to which the pictures in the Upper Belvedere were arranged. The innovative, systematic presentation in the Belvedere Palace is considered an important moment in the history of the modern art museum.\nThe New Institution in the 19th century\nThe occupation of Vienna by Napoleon’s troops in 1809 resulted in a considerable loss of pictures, and in the\n19th century collecting activity for the imperial collections came to an almost complete halt. In the last quarter of the century, attention turned to the internal and external reorganisation of the entire Habsburg art holdings. Between 1871 and 1891 Gottfried Semper and Karl Hasenauer constructed a new building, the Kunsthistorisches Museum, on the Ring, and the Picture Gallery is still housed on its main floor today.\n20th and 21st Centuries\nFollowing the end of the First World War and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, the imperial collections became the property of the new Republic of Austria. After 1945 the collection was again restructured, and parts of it were moved. The Austrian Gallery received all of the Austrian paintings.\nLike all the great royal collections of paintings in Europe, the Kunsthistorisches Museum’s Picture Gallery is practically complete; new acquisitions are made only to round off and put the final touches to the existing collection, not to change it in any fundamental manner. Nevertheless, the collection is not “dead”; its life is constantly being renewed by its visitors, who are always bringing new insight to bear, even on works they may have often seen before, giving them new life.\n- Egyptian and Near Eastern Collection\n- Collection of Greek and Roman Antiquities\n- Picture Gallery\n- Kunstkammer Wien\n- Coin Collection\n- Collection of Historic Musical Instruments\n- Imperial Armoury\n- Ephesos Museum"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:78233cd0-ed91-4cac-a76a-13f0bcac618b>","<urn:uuid:9884e048-541a-4a96-b6cd-7ba6b20daa3f>"],"error":null}

They are thoroughly tested on thousands of children and monitored by the federal government. For emergencies, any infant under 2 months with a fever of 100.4 degrees or higher (measured rectally) needs immediate laboratory evaluation in a pediatric emergency department. It's crucial to maintain regular vaccinations as their delay can lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough, which can cause serious complications or death, particularly in young infants.","context":["Your Child is Having a Medical Emergency, Now What?\nTo stay home or take your sick child to the emergency department? Here's advice for parents facing that decision.\nAs career emergency medical physicians, we know an unexpected trip to the emergency department can be overwhelming and anxiety-inducing for you and your child. There are several things you can do to either avoid a visit to the emergency department or make your experience less stressful.\nWhile you may feel scared and out of control, your child needs you to be brave. You are your child’s greatest comfort and biggest advocate. It’s amazing to see how a parent with a calm and assuring presence can help a child during emergency evaluation and treatment.\nOne of the best ways to minimize your fears is to be prepared before disaster strikes. Have a first-aid kit in the home, take a CPR class and learn the Heimlich maneuver. Keep the number to your pediatrician, local urgent care and poison control center nearby. The mental calmness that comes from knowing you’ve done the prep work if your child ever experiences a medical emergency is invaluable.\nAny infant under 2 months with a fever of 100.4 degrees or greater (measured rectally), needs a laboratory evaluation and is best served in a dedicated pediatric emergency department. Most pediatric offices have a nurse triage line designed to help you determine where your child would best be served by talking through their symptoms. If the nurse triage line is not available to you, your local healthcare system’s advice line offers this same evaluation.\nCall Poison Control\nIf you suspect your child may have ingested something but is acting normal and seems okay, we advise calling poison control first. The poison control center is very knowledgeable and may save you a time consuming and expensive visit to the emergency department. Some household ingestions can be managed at home, but if you do take a trip to the emergency department, bring what you suspect was ingested (medicines, cleaning supplies, etc.) with you, along with any medications your child takes on a regular basis. That will help us determine what we need to do for your child.\nIf you do need to go to the emergency department, explain the process to your child beforehand to help minimize fear. Care is prioritized based on how sick your child is and is not determined on a first-come, first-served basis. This can be hard for some children to understand. The waiting can be long and feel frustrating. If possible, leave siblings at home. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins are great, but will not benefit in the evaluation and treatment of the child. One or both parents is really all that is needed.\nBring a pen and paper so you can take notes and write down the names of those caring for your child. If you are having trouble understanding a condition or diagnosis, ask your providers to draw or diagram. And yes, you can ask a million questions. We don’t mind.\nKnow that as pediatric emergency physicians, we have dedicated our professional careers to caring for sick and injured children. We love what we do.

This guide is a great resource for parents to know when and how they can safely come into the office for scheduled appointments and exams.\nQ: IS IT SAFE TO SEE MY PEDIATRICIAN DURING THE PANDEMIC?\nThe answer is yes. Your pediatrician’s office is open and taking extra precautions to make sure that you and your children are safe when you come in. That includes separate entrances and dedicated rooms for sick and well children. There is no waiting room: instead, patients are escorted directly into an examining room. Masks are required for all staff, children over 2 years of age, and their parents/guardians. There are specific hours when sick children are seen. Nurses and providers who are seeing sick patients do not see well children that same day. In addition to these precautions, rigorous sanitation and cleaning practices are being followed. Telehealth visits are available and even some drive-through testing is being offered.\nQ: WHY SHOULD I BRING MY CHILD TO THE PEDIATRICIAN DURING THE PANDEMIC?\nNewborn babies need to be assessed for feeding problems, weight, jaundice, and other issues that can be present. New parents often have many questions that need to be answered about their new baby.\nInfants, children, and teens should have their growth, blood pressure, developmental milestones, speech/language, hearing and vision checked. They need to be checked for anemia and lead toxicity.\nEmotional and behavioral issues are important to address at all ages. These issues may be exacerbations of ongoing problems, or they be new due to pandemic induced social isolation, lack of structure, and/or boredom.\nIllnesses and injuries should be evaluated and treated.\nPerhaps most importantly, infants and children need to be kept up to date on their immunizations.\nQ: WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO GET VACCINES DURING THE PANDEMIC?\nChildhood vaccine rates have fallen dramatically during the Covid-19 crisis. With immunization rates decreasing, and with the reopening and loosening of pandemic restrictions, we fear that there could be outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough, presenting us with a second health crisis. Both the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics have recommended that well child visits and immunizations continue during the pandemic.\nQ: ARE VACCINES SAFE?\nAbsolutely yes! Today’s vaccines are much more refined and are safer than any in history. Vaccines contain antigens, which are either live but very weakened (“attenuated”) viruses, killed (“inactivated”) viruses, or small parts of bacteria or viruses. These antigens prompt the body’s immune system to produce the protective antibodies that we are now hearing so much about during the present Covid-19 pandemic. With the improvements that have been made over the past few decades, the total number of antigens in all vaccines combined is less than what used to be in a single vaccine. A child’s immune system has no problem handling this small number of antigens. In fact, the number of antigens in all vaccines combined is but a raindrop in the ocean compared to the number of antigens that children’s immune systems encounter in their daily activities like eating, breathing and playing. We now have vaccines to protect children and teens from 16 different viruses and bacteria that otherwise would threaten their health.\nBefore a vaccine is licensed, it is tested in thousands of children. After licensing, the federal government continues to monitor the safety and efficacy of all vaccines.\nQ: WHAT ABOUT TOXINS IN VACCINES?\nIn addition to antigens, vaccines contain preservatives and adjuvants that prevent contamination and improve effectiveness. These ingredients are present in minute quantities that have been proven to be extremely safe. In fact, we are all exposed to much higher levels of these ingredients in our everyday life.\nQ: WHAT ABOUT VACCINES AND AUTISM?\nIn 1998 Andrew Wakefield published an article in a British medical journal (TheLancet) allegedly linking the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine to autism in only 8 children. Ten of Wakefield’s coauthors later withdrew their names from the article and dozens of studies since then have disproven his theory. The Lancet has long since retracted the article.\nThimerosol, a mercury-containing preservative that was previously used in many vaccines, became the next target of of some families with autistic children. Thimerosol was removed from all routine vaccines in 2001, yet the incidence of autism did not decrease.\nIt is natural and understandable to want to blame someone or something for causing autism in children. What we know is that vaccines save lives. They DO NOT cause autism.\nQ: ISN’T NATURAL INFECTION BETTER?\nIndeed, in most cases natural infection does impart better immunity. That is why most vaccines require several doses to be effective. However, the price one pays for natural infection is the risk of the complications of that disease. Measles can cause encephalitis.\nHemophilus influenza, meningococcus, and pneumococcus can all cause meningitis, etc. Vaccines are much safer than the diseases that they prevent We know that Covid-19 has many serious complications. Hopefully we will have a safe and effective vaccine for coronavirus in the near future.\nQ: WHY NOT DELAY OR SKIP VACCINES?\nThere is no proven benefit whatsoever and there is significant risk in not giving vaccines on time. Vaccines are started early to ensure that the youngest and most fragile are protected as soon as possible. Any parent who refuses to immunize their children is shirking their social responsibility. They are not only putting their own children at risk for serious complications of preventable infectious diseases, but they are also allowing the spread of those diseases to those too young or too ill to be vaccinated. The result can be serious complication and even death for those who are the most vulnerable.\nQ: ARE VACCINES REALLY NECESSARY?\nThe vaccine program in our country is truly a victim of its own success. Most parents have never seen a child with diseases such as measles, meningitis, whooping cough, or chicken pox. They have not seen seizures, blindness, brain damage and death from such illnesses. As a practicing pediatrician for over 40 years, many of those years before we had all of the vaccines that we have today, I have personally had patients hospitalized, permanently damaged, and die from vaccine preventable diseases. I have never seen a life threatening or life changing complication from a vaccine. Vaccine preventable diseases still exist throughout the world, and if immunization rates continue to fall in the United States, they will reemerge here.\nVaccines have saved hundreds of millions of lives worldwide, more than any public health intervention in the history of medicine. Ever!!! My colleagues and I firmly believe that vaccinating children, teens and young adults may be the single most important health promoting intervention that we perform as health care providers, and that you perform as parents and caregivers.\nEven during this most difficult crisis, it is important to bring your infants, children and teens to their physician, so that they continue to receive the ongoing quality health care that they need and deserve.\nQ: WHAT ARE SOME RELIABLE RESOURCES FOR HEALTH AND COVID-19 INFORMATION?\nHere are some reliable websites for parents regarding Covid-19, vaccines, children’s health, and parenting:\nwww.healthychildren.org (American Academy of Pediatrics)\nwww.cdc.gov (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\nJeffrey Boxer, MD, FAAP, is a pediatric physician with Beacon Pediatrics, affiliate and is a member of Beebe Medical Staff.

From: Coleman and Huh, 2004.\nThe Parana River is formed by the junction of the Paranaiba and Rio Grande Rivers [30-i03, 30-i09]. It is the second larges drainage basin in South America and covers an area of 2,966,900 sq km. The river some 1,168 km in length and most of the basin drains Cretaceous sediments with minor amounts of Mesozoic volcanics. The average basin elevation is 1,475 m and displays high relief, the average being 1,110 m. Most of the drainage basin lies in the Parana tectonic basin. The drainage density is quite high, the average being 0.30 km stream length per 500 sq km (Figure 74). Note that the tributary drainage pattern is closely controlled by tectonic structure. The annual average rainfall is quite high, some 1,207 mm with a maximum of 1,984 mm and a minimum of 197 mm. The rainy months occur in October through March and during the dry months, average monthly rainfall rarely exceeds 50 mm.\nThe alluvial valley is not very well defined and numerous small tributaries enter the main channel all along its course [30-i01]. Most of the channel displays a braided course throughout its length. Annual average river discharge is 17,280 cu m/sec with a maximum of 20,841 (February) and minimum of 14,301 cu m/sec (August). The delta discharges into a structural embayment, the Rio de la Plata [30-i02]. The elongated delta [30-i06]. covers some 5,440 sq km of densely cultivated delta plain sediments. Because it is filling an estuary, they exists a relatively large subaqueous delta plain; the subaerial delta plain being only 1.51 time larger that the subaqueous plain [30-i05]. The lower Paraná is hampered by shifting channels, sandbars, and fluctuating river flow, and is subject to flooding. The distributary channel pattern displays an anastomosing pattern [30-i04] and bifurcations are present only near the river mouths. Sandy river mouth bars are present seaward of the river mouths. Tides are relatively low, the average spring tide being 0.64 m. Wave energy is extremely low because of its sheltered position and the root mean square wave height if 1.89 m.\nImage 30-i07, JSC.\nRiver Plate estuary, Buenos Aires and Montevideo: 16 March 2003, 50 mm.

On the path of plumes of the Río De La Plata Estuary main tributaries and their mixing scales. Geoacta [online]. 2009, vol.34, n.2, pp. 87-116. ISSN 1852-7744.\nWith a length of 300 km and a width that narrows from 220 km at its mouth to 40 km at its upper end, the Río de la Plata is one of the largest estuaries of the world. Its three main tributaries -contributing to a total mean runoff of 22,000 m3 s-1- have different properties and are object of diverse environmental impact due to dissimilar development conditions on their shores. The knowledge of the paths of the plumes of those tributaries along the estuary and their mixing scales is necessary for management purposes. In this paper, advection-diffusion equations for passive tracers are coupled to the three-dimensional Hamburg Shelf Ocean Model and validated by means of a case study. Then, simulations in which each tributary is characterized by a different dye tracer are done for scenarios resulting of the combination of diverse characteristic atmospheric forcing and runoff conditions. The impact of bathymetry and Earth's rotation on plumes paths and mixing is also evaluated. Results indicate that, for mean to low discharge conditions, the path of the waters of the tributaries is in the form of two main plumes. The different water speeds of both tributaries, the presence of a bend immediately after their confluence and the varying geometry and bathymetry of the estuary favor a rapid mixing between the Uruguay and Paraná Guazú-Bravo waters, which then flow along the northern portion of the upper estuary channel. The Paraná de las Palmas waters, instead, occupy the southern shallow region of Playa Honda in the upper estuary and then flow following the southern coast. Downstream Colonia, at the intermediate estuary, the occurrence of another large bend and a change in bathymetric features force the flow to concentrate in the central part of the estuary and favor further mixing between the plumes. For high discharge conditions the northern part of the upper estuary is divided into two regions, one with a larger concentration of Uruguay waters between Oyarvide and Martín García islands and the coast and another with a larger concentration of Paraná Guazú-Bravo waters south of the islands. In this case there is a much larger concentration of Uruguay waters along the northern coast, which might be enhanced if a peak runoff occurs for the Uruguay but not for the Paraná River. These conclusions are consistent with what can be inferred from the conductivity field observed at the intermediate estuary, the bottom sediments distribution and satellite images. Results indicate that even though strong winds can favor the mixing of the plumes, especially along Argentinean coast, they preserve their pattern and the effect of the storms only persists for a few days. For mean runoff, the elapsed time to the arrival of the leading edge of the Paraná de las Palmas, Paraná Guazú-Bravo and Uruguay tracer clouds at Buenos Aires is of around 3, 5 and 7 days, respectively. The elapsed time to the peak concentration of the tracer cloud for a typical mean runoff scenario is of around 20 days at Buenos Aires. For that condition, the flushing times of the upper and upper intermediate estuary are of around 10 and 60 days, respectively. Nevertheless, mixing scales can be half (twice) those values for high (low) runoff conditions.\nPalabras llave : Upper and Intermediate Río de la Plata; Plumes; Tributaries; Mixing scales."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:84770e14-79ac-420a-bd1c-7ef4fd3d1fbc>","<urn:uuid:1d3df20e-b5ff-48f7-bc84-f9061dbf0276>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hey, in terms of protecting both parties' interests, what's better - a convertible note or a standard business agreement letter?","answer":"Both instruments protect parties' interests in different ways. A convertible note provides flexibility by allowing valuation to be determined later and aligns both parties toward maximizing investment - if the company does well, investors get a smaller but valuable stake, and if it struggles, they get more equity. A business agreement letter provides protection through clear documentation of terms, rights, and responsibilities that both parties can reference later, along with legal enforceability through notarization. The agreement letter is more straightforward but less adaptable to changing circumstances compared to a convertible note.","context":["This is a critical juncture in every startups evolution as the provisions you agree on here will be carried with you for the life of the deal.\nBe Cautiously Optimistic\nAt this stage, many entrepreneurs get so excited that they forget to dot the i's and cross the t's on their deal. Make sure you thoroughly review any term sheet with a lawyer to make sure you completely understand the deal structure and terms. The best way to do this is by proposing deal structures that you have already come up with.\nThe Two Most Common Deal Types\nThere are two primary types of seed stage angel investments – an Equity Stake and a Convertible Note. Yes, there are more fancy types of structures but chances are you’re going to be talking about one of these instruments.\nIn either case you’re deciding how much equity the investor will get for their investment. The difference between the two is when you make the decision on how much equity will be decided upon. The Equity Stake (which isn’t really an instrument, it’s just what we’re calling it) is simply you making the determination now. The Convertible Note (ok, that’s a real term) suggests that you’ll both agree that the valuation will be determined at some later date based on a few criteria.\nAn equity stake is exactly what it sounds like. This is when an investor exchanges their money for ownership interest in your company. The amount of equity the investor receives will depend upon the valuation that you agreed up on with the investor. So if you valued the company at $1,000,000 and the investor put in $150,000 of cash, they would get 15% of your company.\nFrom there it can get really complicated if you want it to. You can start to issue different classes of stock, some which have voting rights or some that get paid back more quickly than others. Suffice to say if you make it far enough to start having conversations with those details, it pays to get a lawyer involved because the variations on those provision can be significant and you can’t afford to not understand what’s being proposed.\nMost deals will be setup as an equity stake in exchange for cash.\nSometimes the investor and the entrepreneur cannot agree on exactly what valuation the company has today. In that case, they may opt to issue a Convertible Note that basically lets both parties set the value of the company at a later date, usually when more outside money comes in and values the company then.\nA convertible note is setup as a loan to the company. So if the investor put in $150,000 as a convertible note, it would mature (come due) at a specific date in the future, let’s say a year from now. During that time it will likely accrue interest. At the maturity date in the future, the investor can choose to either ask to be repaid back in cash (like a loan) or convert that money back into the company as equity based on a valuation determined at that time.\nConvertible notes have become more popular with angel investors as well as entrepreneurs over the years because it aligns both parties with the goal of maximizing the investment. If a year from now the company does extraordinarily well and raises a professional round of venture capital at a high valuation, the capital invested turns into a relatively small equity stake. That’s not all bad for an investor either since it at least means the deal has value.\nOn the other hand if the company stalls, the valuation in the market could be much lower than the investor would have gotten at the time they made the deal, in which case they would get more equity for their same capital investment. This also isn’t necessarily a great deal for either party because it means the company is worth less.\nThe Term Sheet\nOnce you have agreed on the amount and structure of an investment, you will receive a term sheet from or provide one to the investor. A term sheet is simply a non-binding document that outlines the terms and conditions in which an investment is to be made. Through all of this pitching, what you’re looking for is a term sheet. It doesn’t mean you’ve got money in the bank, but it at least signals that the investor is serious about getting a deal done.\nIt Ain’t Done til it’s Done\nThe most common mistake first time entrepreneurs make is thinking that a done deal is a done deal. It’s not.\nEven getting a term sheet isn’t the same as finalizing the closing legal documents that the term sheet outlines. This involves a great deal of back and forth between the attorneys from both sides and can easily take 30 – 60 days to complete if it gets done right. If it goes over 90 days that’s not too unusual but if it starts dragging over 120 days it runs the risk of blowing up.\nDo not get cozy when you see a term sheet. Realize that it only means there is serious interest. You can’t rest until the check is in the bank. And even then, the work just begins!","Are you writing a business agreement letter? While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, there are essential steps to consider when crafting an effective agreement letter. This blog post will cover the basics of how to write a business agreement letter. It serves both parties involved and sets the stage for successful cooperation.\nWhat to Know About a Business Agreement Letter\nA business agreement letter is an official document between two parties outlining the terms of an express business agreement or contract.\nAgreement letters are usually kept on record by both parties to help protect each party’s interests in the future. It’s vital that the language used in the letter be clear and concise. This way, all involved can refer back to it for details later if needed.\nSteps on How to Write a Business Agreement Letter\nStep 1: Establish an Agreement on the Key Items\nThe first step in writing any business agreement letter is establishing an understanding. This is between the two parties on what items must be agreed upon.\nThink about each party’s needs and goals, and come up with concrete details for each item. Make sure all parties involved are in Agreement before moving forward.\nStep 2: Ensure the Legality\nBefore writing the business agreement letter, verify that the contract is legally binding. Please consult with a lawyer to ensure that all parties in the Agreement understand their rights and obligations as outlined by law.\nStep 3: Write a Clear and Concise Letter\nOnce you’ve established an agreement on critical items and ensured its legality, it’s time to write the letter. Make sure your business agreement letter is clear and concise. Use plain language and avoid technical terms or jargon unless necessary.\nStep 4: Include Necessary Information\nMake sure to include all relevant information within your business agreement letters. Such as dates, names of each party involved, contact information, and payment information. Additionally, include an effective date, deadlines, or other relevant milestones.\nStep 5: Sign and Notarize\nOnce your business agreement letter is written, both parties should sign and notarize the document before it becomes legally binding. This ensures that all parties involved have agreed to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.\nBusiness Agreement Letter Template\nOnce you have followed the above steps, it’s time to write your business agreement letter. To help make the process easier, here is a template you can use as a sample for writing your agreement letter:\nName of Company/Individual 1: ____________________________\nName of Company/Individual 2: ____________________________\nThis Agreement is made between Name of Company/Individual 1 (hereafter referred to as “Party 1”). And Name of Company/Individual 2 (hereafter referred to as “Party 2”) on this date (the “Effective Date”) concerning the terms and conditions listed below.\n1. Details of the Agreement\n2. Rights and responsibilities of each party\n3. Payment terms\n4. Confidentiality agreements\n5. Governing law and dispute resolution\n6. Termination clause\n7. Other relevant clauses (if applicable)\nEach party has read this Agreement, understands its content, and agrees to be bound by the provisions herein:\nSignature Party 1:____________________\nSignature Party 2:____________________\nNotarized on this date:_________________\nWriting a business agreement letter can be time-consuming, but following these simple steps will help create an effective contract for both parties involved. Remember to keep it clear, concise, and legally binding – and you’ll have no problem establishing a successful agreement!

{"question":"As trainer interested in holistic approach - what connection between physical+mental training exists? How memory champions combine mental exercise with physical wellness, and what science say about mental-physical performance link?","answer":"Memory champions integrate both mental and physical wellness approaches - for instance, they combine memory training with regular physical exercise, like gym workouts and swimming, plus practices like intermittent fasting and cold showers to maintain mental alertness. Scientific research, particularly from Queensland researchers studying athletes, confirms this mind-body connection. Their findings show that while physical fatigue has minimal impact on performance, mental fatigue significantly affects physical performance, motivation, and even dietary choices. The research emphasizes that brain function plays a much stronger role in athletic performance than previously believed, suggesting the importance of training both mental and physical aspects for optimal performance.","context":["This article was originally printed in Issue 442 of the Australian Mensa magazine, TableAus.\nTansel Ali is a four-time Australian Memory Champion, Managing Director of the Tansel Institute and organiser/licensee of TEDxDocklands\nDaniel Kilov: This isn’t our first interview. Memorious readers may recall our 2015 interview wherein we covered how you memorised the Sydney Yellow Pages in only 24 days, your attempts to bring memory techniques into the classroom and the School Mind Games event, and your use of memory techniques as meditation. However, I didn’t ask you about how you initially discovered memory techniques, or why you wanted to compete. So, what’s the story there?\nTansel Ali: I discovered memory techniques through curiosity really. A friend of mine back at uni had told me he could memorise a list of forty random items and I didn’t believe him. I naturally had to test him and surely enough he memorised every word I gave him in random order perfectly. I thought he was playing a trick on me, however he advised me he used memory techniques and to read up on it.\nSo, I went and did my reading and discovered a whole new world of self-development that actually worked. I always thought I had a pretty bad memory until I learned these memory skills myself. I wanted to learn more as I was excited about the benefits of having a better memory gave me, like learning and reading faster, and I stumbled across the Australian Memory Championships one day Googling memory training. I asked my friend to join me to enter the competition since we knew a few techniques. To our surprise we both did really well, broke Australian memory records and ended up on national television showcasing our memory skills. The rest as they say is history.\nDaniel Kilov: It feels to me that the whole memory scene has changed since we last spoke, with the advent of new organizations and events and even new techniques like Lance Tschirhart’s ‘shadow system’. Would you agree? If so, what do you see as the most exciting recent developments in the memory world?\nTansel Ali: The memory scene has definitely grown, especially in the past few years. This is particularly exciting for me personally as I am not only a memory athlete but someone who is an advocate of the skills, as it has not only helped me but changed my life for the better. If more people can get a hold of and exposure to these memory techniques then they can only benefit from them.\nThe most exciting development I believe is the creation of Memory League. It makes a seemingly boring non-spectator sport now exciting to watch. Not only that, but much simpler for new individuals to quickly learn memory techniques and get into the sport without having to sit through an hour of memorising numbers and cards. I also have my coaching clients train on Memory League as the short one-minute memorisation bursts don’t overwhelm and provide great feedback for improvement.\nDaniel Kilov: Of course, not all change equals progress. Do you think there is anything competitors have lost sight of? Anything we should rethink or revisit?\nTansel Ali: To be honest, I don’t necessarily think competitors have to have a vision. It’s more the organisers and leaders that will have to think how the sport moves forward and what the vision is. I think we will eventually get there, and do believe we can make memory competitions a spectator sport and gain huge exposure to further increase growth.\nDaniel Kilov: People are sometimes suspicious of the idea that memory techniques have a real place in education. They doubt they can be used to memorise complex information. I think this stems from the fact that most of the examples used in books are simple lists, mostly. Can you give a detailed example of how you’ve used memory techniques to memorise more complex information?\nTansel Ali: I can understand how people can think that. From my experience even those that have a basic understanding of memory techniques doubt their use in education. I think it’s more than just knowing the techniques. Anyone can learn memory techniques. However, the real skill lies in the strategy. Knowing how to use memory techniques is much more difficult and requires a greater depth of knowledge than just remembering a list. This is where my work as a coach is centred around for people to utilise these skills so they can learn how to learn and implement systems that will help them achieve the things they want with the use of memory strategies.\nA great example to give is studying. I’ve worked with many students over the years and it’s not as easy as showing them a memory palace or how to Mind Map. Students need to know how to best use the memory techniques so they actually learn and become efficient at it.\nIf you advised a student to just use a memory palace and link information then they would essentially be drowned in the amount of connections they would have to make and potentially double up on their study and learning time. This is counter-productive. A memory strategy in this case will allow the student to understand which technique to use and even not use, so that their time is maximised and their efforts are concentrated on the learning of information.\nDaniel Kilov: Do you still do much formal memory training? If so, what does that look like? Do you do anything special that you feel has given you an edge over competitors in the past?\nTansel Ali: Yes, I use Memory League as well as my own resources to train regularly. Training clients assists me as well. I usually train different systems, new techniques I’ve developed as well as old systems I’ve revived. My training usually consists of making lots of recall mistakes by memorising faster than usual. This is so I can go back and analyse what I’ve done wrong, how I can improve and get better. I also train with speed-reading books as the visualisation from that helps greatly as well. I enjoy working out at the gym and swimming regularly. I think if you’re going to train your mind you should do the same with the body as well. I also do intermittent fasting and cold showers which generally keeps me alert. Aside from that, I don’t think I do anything special to give me an edge over other competitors. My only competitor is me.\nDaniel Kilov: Mindfulness and meditation are all the rage right now, but, of course, medieval mnemonists would use memory techniques to meditate in various ways. Can you say more about how you use your memory techniques as a form of meditation?\nTansel Ali: Since visualisation is a big part of memory, every time I train, I make an effort to relax and use that as a form of meditation. Going through my memory palace and also being in the moment I think adds to that. Otherwise I don’t practise meditation as much anymore as I’ve embedded it mostly in my daily life instead of having a meditation session.","Feeling mentally drained or stressed can seriously impact physical performance and motivation levels in sport and exercise, Queensland researchers have found.\n- The brain plays a much stronger role in athletic performance than previously suspected\n- Queensland Firebirds players were closely monitored for 16 weeks\n- Mental fatigue impacts physical motivation and dietary choices, researchers found\nThe findings are the result of months of work with the Queensland Firebirds netball squad and reveal how mental fatigue can have profound effects on athletic performance.\nUniversity of Queensland researcher Suzy Russell, who headed up the study, said while much emphasis was placed on physical fatigue and recovery in sport, more needed to be done on the cognitive side.\n“We need to think more about the brain in athletes and how it’s influencing their sporting performance,” she said.\n“[This research] gives us a bit more of an idea that it’s something we need to be looking at in terms of our application to sport.”\nBefore training sessions, 10 contracted Firebirds players were given questionnaires.\nTheir saliva was also tested for the stress markers cortisol and alpha-amylase.\n“They basically are hormonal or stress responses to your external environment and how you’re reacting internally,” Ms Russell said.\nOver the 16-week test period, the players who felt physically tired saw little effect on their training.\nBut those who reported feeling mentally drained felt their performance on the court suffered.\nThe average mental fatigue rating — 44 on a scale from zero to 100 — also varied significantly from player to player.\nFirebirds head coach Roselee Jencke said the information had proved very helpful in managing fatigue and maximising player impact for the upcoming season.\n“Managing fatigue is really important, being able to give them enough time to recover and then come back to training and work at intensity,” she said.\nMs Russell said the research showed it was important for everyone partaking in physical activity to consider how mental fatigue could influence exercise motivation levels.\n“For our everyday gym-goer, we might run our 3 kilometres a bit slower than we did two days ago when we’re feeling mentally fatigued, after a really long day of activity at work or some emotional stress that’s occurring.”\nTraining for mental resilience\nQueensland University of Technology sport scientist Vince Kelly said mental or emotional exhaustion also had proven impacts on lifestyle choices.\n“You might be more inclined to snack a bit more, you’re more inclined to drink alcohol, and you might be less inclined to do exercise when you’re mentally fatigued,” Dr Kelly said.\nMs Russell said fatigue could also impact dietary choices as well as motivation.\n“Potentially when we’re feeling really mentally fatigued we might choose to eat the chocolate rather than the apple, and it might influence our decision even to get out of bed and go to the gym,” she said.\nMr Kelly said research was now needed to demonstrate how to best train athletes to be mentally resilient.\nEarly studies suggest brain endurance training could be beneficial.\n“The research is in its really early stages at this point. There is evidence from one study that you can actually do what’s called brain endurance training, which actually increases your resilience to mental fatigue,” he said."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0d62dabd-5379-4083-a670-f96ba5ae197d>","<urn:uuid:b76efa67-8343-4974-9f39-c3a81f622551>"],"error":null}

Exposures to radiation cannot be prevented, however they can be controlled. A proper Radiation Safety Program will control both internal and external radiation exposures. Radiation Protection Programs or safe work practices are required by regulations.\nIn the Oil and Gas Industry we have seen levels as high as 450 µSv/hr on contact of waste and 50 µSv/hr at 1 meter. An incidentally exposed worker could not spend more than 20 hours within 1 meter of the waste without exceeding the regulatory limit for an external exposure. We have also seen waste with activity levels up to 28,600 Bq/g. Inhalation or ingestion (Internal Exposure) of a volume less than the size of the tip of a pencil would exceed regulatory limits.\nImplementation of a Radiation Safety Program will ensure workers maintain exposures to levels that are well below regulatory limits and maintained under the principle of ALARA (As Low As Reasonable Achievable). This principle is recognized by all levels of governments and a requirement under the Radiation Protection Regulations. This principle means the following:\n“All radiation exposures are considered potentially hazardous to health regardless of any regulatory limit. A regulatory limit is an exposure that should not be exceeded. It is simply not acceptable to just maintain worker exposures to values below regulatory limits. Organizations must maintain exposures as low as reasonable achievable social and economic factors taken into consideration.”\nMany organizations have NORM policies and procedures that outline the appropriate PPE to be worn when working with NORM impacted materials or waste. These types of policies only prevent inhalation or ingestion exposures. A detailed Radiation Safety Program will include:\n- Identification of who is in charge of overall radiation safety for the organization. This is not necessarily the person on a NORM site but rather the person workers can call to address radiation safety concerns. This person is typically called the corporate Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) and must have extensive knowledge and experience in radiation protection.\n- Outlines the corporations requirements on surveys to identify NORM impacted waste and materials as well as monitoring requirements and will include the following:\n- Gamma radiation surveys requirements for detection of NORM impacted materials and waste.\n- Contamination surveys to identify objects that require cleaning or need to be controlled. These types of surveys prevent NORM accumulations from being spread around a worksite giving potential for workers to ingest.\n- Air monitoring requirements to detect levels of radon gas in the work area or low level radioactive dusts (LLRD’s). Health Canada has established maximum concentration limits of radon in air that a workplace cannot exceed. Monitoring for LLRD’s determines the need for respiratory protection and dust control measures. If LLRD’s cannot be eliminated, air monitoring is required to verify the internal exposures of workers in the event of respiratory malfunction.\n- Radiation Survey requirements. Radiation surveys are required to verify if external exposures in a work area need to be controlled. Control of these work areas are typically completed by controlling the amount of time workers may spend in that area.\n- Identifies how internal exposures will be controlled within the organization. This may include engineered controls at specific sites or administrative controls such as NORM policies, procedures or codes of practice. These policies outline how contamination will be controlled to prevent ingestion such as setting up control area’s and how inhalation will be prevented by dust control measures and appropriate PPE. A control area is an area where exposure to radiation may occur and is identified by signage. Special policy and procedures are required within this area to control radiation exposures.\n- Identifies how external Exposures will be controlled within the organization. External exposures cannot be eliminated only controlled as we live in a world where radiation is all around us (i.e. Gamma rays from the sun). External exposures can be controlled from NORM impacted materials or waste through the following means:\n- By controlling the amount of time we spend around the NORM impacted materials or waste.\n- By keeping our distance from the NORMN impacted material or waste such as putting up fencing and restricting access to NORM impacted areas.\n- Shielding the NORM impacted materials or waste to prevent the gamma rays from reaching workers. This method typically is not practical in the oil and gas industry for NORM impacted materials or waste. It is however common with man-made sources where the size of the source is small and can be housed in materials such as a lead lined enclosure.\n- Defines record keeping requirements. Exposures to workers are based off yearly exposures. As such records must be maintained from exposures do to daily work activities in order to compile these yearly assessments. A radiation safety program outlines how these records will be maintained to verify worker exposures.\n- Defines training requirements for workers.\n- Defines transport requirements and procedures. NORM impacted materials or waste with activities greater than 70 Bq/g fall under the requirements of the packaging and transport of nuclear substances regulations (PTNSR). NORM Waste or materials with activities less than 70 Bq/g fall under provincial authority and only require a manifest. This activity of 70 Bq/g assumes a single radionuclide. NORM waste can have radionuclides from both the U238 and Th232 decay series and as such are considered a mixture of radionuclides. The PTNSR outlines the method for determining the activities of mixtures to verify if the PTNSR apply for the mixture.\nNote: Prior to shipment you must determine the activity of the waste to verify appropriate regulations applicable to the shipment. Laboratory analysis can verify the activity of a NORM impacted shipment or estimates, by a qualified radiation expert, can be utilized.\nNormtek has a mobile laboratory for completing sample analysis prior to transport. The CNSC requires transporters of NORM impacted materials or waste have a written Radiation Safety Program if activities fall under their regulatory control (Radiation Protection Program Design for the Transport of Nuclear Substances GD-314)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a66d2208-112d-463b-b10e-ab9870ca1710>","<urn:uuid:45207f5c-c811-48b7-a0af-2769444e4bd7>"],"error":null}

{"question":"Please tell me step by step how researchers made stainless steel surface suitable for attaching carbohydrate molecules? I need to understand process.","answer":"The researchers first coated the stainless steel surface with a very thin layer of glass silica (60 atoms deep) using Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). This silica coating provided a 'chemical handle' that allowed the carbohydrate molecules to be attached to the otherwise non-reactive stainless steel surface.","context":["Implanted biomedical devices, such as cardiac stents, are implanted in over 2 million people every year, with the majority made from stainless steel. Stainless steel has many benefits - strength, generally stability, and the ability to maintain the required shape long after it has been implanted. But, it can also cause severe problems, including blood clotting if implanted in an artery, or an allergenic response due to release of metal ions such as nickel ions.\nThe University of Alberta campus is home to a highly multidisciplinary group of researchers, the CIHR Team in for Glyconanotechnology in Transplantation, that is looking to develop new synthetic nanomaterials that modify the body's immune response before an organ transplant. The ultimate goal is to allow cross-blood type organ transplants, meaning that blood types would not necessarily need to be matched between donor and recipient when an organ becomes available for transplantation. Developing new nanomaterials that engage and interact with the body's immune system are an important step in the process. In order to overcome the complex range of requirements and issues, the project team drew on expertise from three major areas: surface science chemistry and engineering, carbohydrate chemistry, and immunology and medicine.\nFor the transplantation goals of the project, sophisticated carbohydrate (sugar) molecules needed to be attached to the stainless steel surface to bring about the necessary interaction with the body's immune system. Its inherent stainless characteristic makes stainless steel a difficult material to augment with new functions, particularly with the controlled and close-to-perfect coverage needed for biomedical implants. The Edmonton-based team found that by first coating the surface of the stainless steel with a very thin layer (60 atoms deep) of glass silica using a technique available at the National Institute for Nanotechnology, called Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD), they could overcome the inherent non-reactivity of the stainless steel. The silica provide a well-defined \"chemical handle\" through which the carbohydrate molecules, prepared in the Alberta Ingenuity Centre for Carbohydrate Science, could be attached. Once the stainless steel had been controlled, the researchers demonstrated that the carbohydrate molecules covered the stainless steel in a highly controlled way, and in the correct orientation to interact with the immune system.\n\"We are immensely pleased with this progress. We have every expectation that this set of steps creating novel tools for immune system engagement will lead us closer to clinical application aimed at preparing patients for successful organ transplants.\" stated Dr. Lori West, Professor of Pediatrics, Surgery and Immunology, and Director of Heart Transplant Research at Univ. of Alberta.\nDr. Jillian Buriak | EurekAlert!\nMove over, Superman!

{"question":"¿Cuál es más rápido de secar, el recubrimiento polyaspartic o el parylene?","answer":"Polyaspartic coating dries much faster than parylene. Polyaspartic coating dries to the touch in 2-3 hours and can be recoated in 4 hours, while parylene requires a specialized chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process that involves converting solid powder to gas and depositing it molecule-by-molecule, which is a more time-consuming process.","context":["Hydrophobic Basics and Hydrophilicity\nIn the science of surfaces and thin film protection, the term hydrophobicity is used to designate the capacity of both a substrate surface and its protective coating to repel water. In contrast, their hydrophilicity represents their affinity for water absorption.\nOne of the primary purposes of conformal coatings is safeguarding electronics from the impact of water/moisture incursion, which can negatively impact their operation. The hydrophilicity of items such as printed circuit boards (PCBs) and medical implants relies on conformal coating hydrophobicity to ensure water does not violate the interior of electrical components, disrupting their intended performance. Assured surface hydrophobicity is also essential to improved energy applications for automotive, military and tribological applications, environmental protection and solar energy harvesting.\nWith respect to conformal films, coated surfaces are considered\n- hydrophobic when their static water contact angle θ is >90°, and\n- hydrophilic when angle θ = <90°.\nAlthough some question remains why a differentiation of a slight 2° -- from 89° to 91° -- is sufficient to render transition from a hydrophobic surface to one hydrophilic, this definition maintains until one more accurate is supported by technical data.\nHydrophobic Properties of Parylene and Liquid Coatings\nThe wetting behavior of conformal coating materials is very relevant to their use. Parylene (XY) offers generally superior hydrophobicity in comparison to liquid coatings acrylic, epoxy, silicone, and urethane. Liquid coatings are pre-synthesized and applied to substrates by:\n- brushing the wet coating onto the designated surface,\n- immersing the component in a bath of liquid material (dipping), and\n- spraying the coating substance through either manual or automated methods.\nIn contrast, parylene uses a specialized chemical vapor deposition (CVD) application methodology, which synthesizes in-process. Solid, powdered parylene dimer is converted to a gas, depositing on targeted surfaces on a molecule-by-molecule basis. Permeating substrate surfaces, CVD generates uniform conformal film application to virtually any surface topography and material, penetrating even the smallest surface crevices. The process effectively generates an internal, as well as external protective layer, maximizing XY’s barrier protection.\nXY typically provides effective barrier protection at film thicknesses ranging from 0.013 – 0.051 mm. (0.0005 to 0.002 in.), controllable to less than a single micron (1 μm/1,000 nms). The exceptional uniformity of pinhole-free XY prevents leakage; vaporous coatings seep deep into substrate surfaces during application, providing additional moisture protection. XY water barrier properties also restrict water vapor transmission rate (WVTR), the passage of water vapor through barrier film, measured in terms of area and time. Resultant ultra-thin films demonstrate exceptional hydrophobicity and are recommended for MEMS/nano-tech uses.\nParylene’s distinctive properties -- biocompatibility, dielectric/insulative advantages, truly conformal pinhole free film deposition and protection – combine with low water absorption (swelling) to enhance their applicability to a wide range of purposes. Biomedically, applications include cardiac pacemakers, high-fidelity molecular micropatterning, intra-oral biomolecule magnets, neural electrodes and stents, These specialized biomedical applications have been developed in addition to parylene’s extensive use for PCB protection and use for aeronautic/defense, automotive, communication, consumer and industrial products. Enhanced hydrophobicity also extends XY’s use for product ruggedization.\nTable I provides a rendering of parylene’s hydrophobic capacities.\nTable I: Hydrophobic Properties of Selected Parylenes\nParylene-N Parylene-C Parylene-D\nWater absorption (% in 24h) <0.1 <0.1 <0.1\nWater vapor transmission rate\n(g.mm)/(m2.day) 0.59 0.08 0.09\nWater contact angle 79° 87° 91°\nPermeation barriers for electronic devices are essential to assure their ongoing performance through a wide range of operational environments. For this purpose, parylene’s versatility is largely based on its hydrophobicity – repelling water and moisture at the surface, with resistance to swelling in aqueous environments. Hydrophobicity is a fundamental quality that combines with XY’s many other advantages -- biocompatibility, chemical inertness, diminished cytotoxicity, pinhole-free conformality – to expand its application to an extensive range of uses.\nCompared to wet coatings, parylene offers superior moisture protection not only to water, but also liquid pollutants, high humidity, salt-air and persistent or acid rain. The same can be said for internal environments with high moisture/liquid content. For instance, XY’s ready adaptability for bio-implantable medical devices further demonstrates its moisture control capacities. Providing ongoing and reliable surface adhesion and moisture barrier protection, parylene conformal films withstand permeation by water, water vapor and other forms of moisture, as well as incursion by most substances under a wide range of operating circumstances. CVD-generated parylene coating provides a simple, versatile and dependable hydrophobic conformal coating.\nTo learn more about parylene's properties, download our whitepaper now:","Polyaspartic Garage Floor Coating\nWhat is Polyaspartic Floor Coating?\nAverage Cost Range: $4.00 to $9.00 per square foot\nPolyaspartic floor coating is a two-part coating, like epoxy, but made with aliphatic polyurea. It is sprayed or rolled onto concrete to form a tough and durable flooring. Pigment is added to the polyaspartic flooring to give you the color you prefer. Metallic or vinyl chip packs are often sprinkled onto the wet coating for aesthetics..\nFebruary 21, 2023, by: Rob Parsell\nThis polyaspartic coating report covers cost, pros and cons, a look at polyaspartic floor coating vs epoxy, and additional information that will assist you in deciding if this is the right flooring for your project.\nWe’ve given you a brief summary of polyaspartics and average costs, now we’re going to get into the details.\nMORE ABOUT POLYASPARTIC FLOOR COATING\nLike epoxy, Polyaspartic floor coating is a two-part flooring system. It consists of a polyurea component, similar to polyurethane, and a hardener. This class of floor coatings is termed polyaspartics or polyurea polyaspartic coating.\nThe components are mixed just prior to application. The pot life, or the time in which you can apply it before it thickens too much to use, is just 20-30 minutes. It dries to the touch in 2-3 hours and can be recoated in 4 hours. Give it two days before walking on it.\nThis basement and garage floor coating comes in low-gloss and high-gloss options. Keep in mind that a high gloss finish has the potential to be slippery. However, sand is often added to produce a non-slip flooring.\nDeveloped in the 1990s, polyaspartic garage floor coating is catching on with homeowners, and more contractors are offering it as a tougher alternative to epoxy coatings.\nFurther Reading: Garage Floor Ideas\nHOW MUCH DOES POLYASPARTIC FLOOR COATING COST?\nThe cost of polyaspartic floor coating is $4.00 to $9.00 per square foot. The major cost factor is whether you DIY or hire a contractor for the job. The cost of polyaspartic coating when installed by a contractor is $6.50 to $9.00. DIY application costs around $4.50 to $6.25 for the coating and tools needed.\nIs polyaspartic expensive? Yes, compared to garage floor paint ($) or epoxy ($$), this option is a little more expensive ($$-$$$).\nYou’ll save around $2.00 to $3.25 with DIY application. Here’s what the cost looks like:\n$4.00 – $6.25 for DIY\n$6.50 – $9.00 when you hire pro installers\nIf you’re considering DIY, this two-part floor coating is sold in kits from 2 gallons to 10 gallons. The kits consist of equal parts coating and hardener.\nCost is around $4 to $6 per gallon. A gallon covers 195 to 250 square feet depending on the porosity of the surface covered. If sealers are applied to the concrete first, coverage is greater. The sealer usually improves the bond of the material to the base concrete. And because sealers are much less expensive than polyaspartic flooring, it’s a cost-effective decision to seal the slab first.\nTwo layers, a base coat and a topcoat, are typically applied. The result is a finished coating of 5-6 mils.\nTo seal or not to seal? If your concrete is unsealed, check the label of the product you choose. Some manufacturers suggest applying it to unsealed concrete. This allows the coating to penetrate the concrete, which can improve the bond and prevent peel issues.\nHowever, sealers on concrete prevent the migration of moisture from beneath the floor to the surface of the concrete. If moisture is trapped between the slab and the applied material it might cause it to peel, a problem known as delamination.\nBottom line? You’ll be sure of getting the best results if you hire an experienced professional that will check the moisture content of your concrete and recommend the right products to give you the durable flooring you want.\nRelated Reading: Epoxy Basement Floor\nPROS AND CONS OF POLYASPARTIC FLOOR COATINGS\nIs a polyaspartic floor coating good? That’s a good question. The answer is yes, mostly, with a few potential drawbacks.\nDurable and tough: This is a high performance floor coating that resists stains and abrasions – it doesn’t scratch easily. It also has high chemical resistance, ideal if your garage or basement doubles as a workshop.\nWon’t fade: Apply it to a garage floor or concrete patio, and you won’t see fading or the material becoming yellow due to sun exposure.\nWaterproof: This coating resists moisture penetration.\nApply it in any season: Some polyurea polyaspartic coating can be applied in sub-freezing temperatures, so you don’t have to wait for warm weather to cover your garage floor and protect it from stains and winter salt deposits.\nDIY is doable: Kits come with clear, easy-to-follow directions. Application is pretty easy. Clean the floor to ensure a good bond. Sealing concrete first will allow you to use less mix to get the thickness you want because less will be absorbed. Then roll on the coating in one or two coats.\nHealthy air quality: Most products in this class are low VOC or no VOC material. Odor is minimal too, though you’ll probably want to vent the room or leave the garage door open until the coating cures.\nQuick cure time: Walk on it in 4-6 hours. Drive on it in 2-3 days.\nGood looks: Pigment is added to produce a color you’ll enjoy living with. And metal of vinyl chip sprinkles add visual appeal where desired.\nPrice: Costs more than epoxy coatings – about $1.25 to $3.00 per square foot more depending on DIY or pro application.\nQuality varies: Like any flooring material, there are basic, better and best options. If DIY, choose a product with a high solids count (usually listed on the label). If hiring a contractor, choose one that uses a quality product and has a good track record of customer satisfaction.\nShort pot life: The flip side of fast curing is that the material hardens quickly. You’ve got 20-30 minutes to apply the coating once the components are mixed with the hardener.\nDIY Tip – Only mix the amount you need for each of the two layers. For example, if the garage floor is 20’x24’, or 480 square feet, you’ll need 2 to 2.5 gallons of mix per layer.\nToo much moisture? If you’re considering polyurea polyaspartics for a garage or basement, it is important to do a moisture test first. If a lot of moisture is transmitting through the slab, then polyaspartic floor coating is not the right flooring for your application.\nIf you are building a home or garage, be sure to install vapor barrier beneath the concrete. That will mitigate moisture and allow you to use this product or epoxy floor coating.\nWHERE IS POLYASPARTIC FLOORING USED?\nFor our purposes, this coating is usually applied to garage floors.\nIn residential use, it is also used in basements, utility rooms, laundry rooms, pole buildings, workshops and other areas where a tough, waterproof and abrasion resistant flooring is desired.\nTo give you an idea of their high performance, you might be interested to know that polyaspartic coatings are used in a range of industrial settings. They provide corrosion protection to metal.\nAnd the polyaspartic aliphatic polyurea (technical description) are UV resistant, so it can be applied to rooftops where UV exposure is an issue.\nIS POLYASPARTIC BETTER THAN EPOXY?\nEpoxy coatings cost less than a polyaspartic coating and are quite durable. But polyaspartics provides next-level durability, stain resistance and chemical resistance. It is more UV resistant too.\nHOW LONG TO POLYASPARTIC FLOORS LAST?\nA polyaspartic floor coating lasts 20 to 50 years depending on how the space is used. In most residential settings, the floor will look good and perform well for 30+ years. In short, you will probably get tired of it and want something different before the floor needs replacing from a performance standpoint.\nTo ensure the best durability, sweep the floor regularly. Power washing it is OK too. The key is to remove sand and other gritty materials that wear away the surface of the floor, reducing its sheen.\nIS POLYASPARTIC FLOOR COATING SLIPPERY WHEN WET?\nA polyaspartic floor can be slippery unless the kit you choose contains a sand additive that makes it more slip-resistant. Adding sand is definitely recommended.\nIS POLYASPARTIC COATING A DIY PROJECT FOR HOMEOWNERS?\nInstalling a polyaspartic coating can be a DIY project. The difficulty level is easy to moderate – about the same as applying epoxy floor coatings, if you’ve done that.\nThe steps are:\n- Clean the floor thoroughly\n- Apply a chemical etching agent (optional)\n- Fill cracks in the concrete\n- Tape off wall edges, cabinets, posts, etc.\n- Mix just enough material to apply one layer\n- Roll on the first layer\n- Let the first layer cure for a minimum of 4 hours, longer if the temperature is below 75F (see the label for guidance)\nLayers: Two thin layers are better than one thick and goopy layer.\nAbout the Author:\nRob joined the Home Flooring Pros team in 2014 and is a freelance writer, specializing in flooring, remodeling and HVAC systems (read more).\n“I’m the son of an interior designer and picked up an eye for design as a result.

{"question":"I'm researching ethical codes in nonprofits - what are the key differences between how the Children's Board and IDEA Foundation address professional integrity and accountability?","answer":"The Children's Board emphasizes specific behavioral rules and accountability through detailed prohibitions, like banning no-bid contracts, accepting gifts, and requiring employees to sign compliance acknowledgments. IDEA Foundation takes a more principles-based approach, focusing on broader concepts like honesty, integrity, and professional behavior operating 'within the letter and spirit of applicable laws.' While both organizations value accountability, the Children's Board implements it through concrete rules and procedures, whereas IDEA Foundation embeds it in their core values and UN Global Compact principles, with ongoing monitoring by their board of directors.","context":["Nonprofits & Ethics Codes\nDo nonprofit organizations need there own code of ethics? Maybe, indeed it is not uncommon for nonprofits to develop a code tailored to their needs. Consider the Children’s Board of Hillsborough County (CBHC), Florida. The CBHC experienced an executive leadership crisis triggered by $500,000 in no-bid contracts that went to people with connections to the CBHC, accusations of low morale among employees that included a culture of retribution, and media charges of a bloated agency that was saddled by high administrative overhead costs. Enter the fix—former Tampa Mayor Pam Iorio was hired as the Interim CEO who quickly set about downsizing the workforce and drafting a code of ethics. The code was adopted on January 24, 2013.\nHere are selected features: (The full code is online at http://www.childrensboard.org/#!code-of-ethics/c172l)\nI.

{"question":"What role do oceans play in Earth's health, and how is coral bleaching affecting their ecosystem?","answer":"Oceans are fundamental to Earth's health, covering over 70% of the surface and producing around 70% of the world's oxygen. They drive weather patterns and regulate Earth's temperature by absorbing and circulating heat globally. However, their ecosystem is being severely impacted by coral bleaching. When corals bleach, they lose their symbiotic algae that normally give them their brown or khaki-green color, revealing either white skeletons or fluorescent polyps. This process severely compromises the coral's metabolism and reproduction, and if they die, they get covered with turf algae. This transformation affects the entire marine ecosystem, as fish and other species that depend on coral for food and shelter must either relocate or perish, fundamentally altering the reef's biodiversity.","context":["The Big Blue Unknown\nOceans cover over 70% of the Earth’s surface - stretching hundreds of kilometers between land masses and reaching depths of over 10km where even light cannot reach. It's not surprising then, that the vast majority of these salty spaces remain a mystery to scientists.\nDespite our shortcomings when it comes to exploring underwater - we have discovered many weird and wonderful creatures that have not only adapted to, but also taken advantage of some of the unique environments that the oceans provide.\nTake the Antarctic Icefish for example. Found in the icy waters of the Southern Ocean - these species of fish have adapted to the sub 0 °C temperatures by producing ‘antifreeze’ glycoproteins in their blood and other body fluids. These proteins prevent the formation of ice crystals inside their bodies by reducing their internal freezing temperature - pretty amazing huh?\nThis is just one of the many inventive ways in which sea creatures have adapted to survive in these unforgiving waters, and as it turns out, there's a few lessons to be learnt by studying these particular traits.\nA Stroke of Genius\nTony Hickey, a researcher and lecturer in biochemistry and comparative physiology at Auckland University - tells us how the humble triplefin - a coastal species of fish found all over the globe, may hold the key to understanding one of the world’s most prevalent and devastating medical conditions.\nA staggering 15 million people per year suffer a stroke, and of those, nearly 6 million die. Strokes are caused by and interruption of blood supply to the brain, depriving the tissues of oxygen and nutrients which can lead to lasting damage to the brain. It’s hard to understand how a fish can help.\nTony explains that a similar lack of oxygen, or hypoxia, is something the triple fin experiences every day. “As it warms at low tide, the water holds less dissolved oxygen so a rock pool becomes hypoxic quite quickly in a way that mimics the lack of oxygen during a stroke. And yet this species of triple fin comes out with no damage - no muscle damage, no brain damage. From them, we may be able to work out how to protect the brain when strokes occur.”\nImportantly, New Zealand also has more than the usual number of triple fin species, adapted to live in a broad range of coastal habitats. “If we have two fish that are very closely related, almost identical, and one lives in rock pools that can tolerate hypoxia and one in deeper ocean that can’t, then we have a really good chance of identifying the factors that allow the fish to protect itself from its environment.”\nCaring for our Oceans\nJune 8th is World Oceans day - but why should we care? Well, appart from providing a home to hundreds of thousands of different marine species - they also play an extremely important role in the lives of us land dwellers. Oceans are the driving force of our weather patterns, they help regulate the temperature of the earth by absorbing and circulating heat around the globe, and they are responsible for producing around 70% percent of the worlds oxygen. That precious molecule we need to breathe.\nCurrently, about 8 million metric tons of plastic watse is dumped into the ocean each year - that's one garbage truck EVERY MINUTE! This huge amount of waste is creating toxic environments that sea creatures aren't adapted to live in - so we as individuals need to take responsibility for our actions and look after these precious blue spaces.\nSo next time you're out at the beach, make a conscious effort to pick up any plastic or rubbish you find lying in the sand - as you never know you could be saving the life of an animal that could one day save yours!\nWanting to help but don't know where to start? Check out the World Oceans Day page to see how others are making a difference and how you can help! #TogetherWeCan","These images are a selection of photos taken recently near Lizard Island off the north Queensland coast. They document the ongoing bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef as ocean temperatures continue to be driven upward by climate change.\nThe bleaching process\nBefore corals bleach, they are often a deep brown or khaki-green colour. These colours come from the symbiotic algae (sometimes called zooxanthellae) that co-exist with the coral polyp.\nDuring bleaching, as the symbiotic algae depart, you can see the beautifully coloured polyps. Sometimes polyps are transparent and we see only the white skeleton beneath. Other polyps may be brightly coloured, as seen here.\nBut whether white or fluorescent, these corals are far from happy. Once the final stage of the bleaching process is reached, it is likely the coral has been stressed for days or weeks. From here on, it may recover slowly – by re-acquiring its symbiont friends – or it may die, having run out of energy in the absence of the symbiotic algae that provide it with carbohydrates.\nWhat often happens next is that the coral is covered with a film of turf algae, which takes over the parts of the reef previously colonised by healthy coral.\nBleaching can be strangely beautiful\nUnfortunately, what we are now seeing on the northern third of the Great Barrier Reef is the death of many of these beautiful organisms. But, as noted above, the bleaching can in some cases be weirdly beautiful, as the corals shed their algal cloaks and reveal themselves.\nThese pictures show a variety of heavily bleached corals, with almost no remaining symbiotic algae. From this point it is a long, slow road to recovery – even those corals that survive will remain metabolically and reproductively compromised for months.\nThe amazing colours are pigments present in the coral polyps themselves. They are often fluorescent – hence the day-glo appearance of some corals and their amazing fluorescence on torch-lit night dives.\nSome healthy corals display such vivid blues and other colours naturally, not during a bleaching event. But these corals are rare. What we are seeing on reefs in northern Queensland is certainly bleaching.\nWhen the polyps die, macro or turf algae take over – a process that is already evident along parts of the 800 km of worst-affected Great Barrier Reef.\nEspecially in warm or nutrient-rich waters, these algae outcompete any coral trying to settle or spread on the reef, taking over areas that corals previously dominated.\nFish losing their homes\nNot only is the turf algal community uglier than healthy coral, but it means the other species that depend on the coral lose their livelihoods too. Eventually, the reef structure itself breaks down, meaning that many fish species will need to move on or die.\nThat includes fish that feed on coral, such as this Okinawa goby…\n… and those that just use it for shelter, such as this black damselfish juvenile.\nThe turquoise-blue chromis damselfish form huge clouds or schools over coral heads, and use coral branches for shelter when predators come along. The picture immediately below was taken before bleaching, while the one after that shows the fish on a bleached colony.\nAnemones (which are close relatives of corals) are also prone to bleaching, which causes similar problems for the fish that use them for shelter.\nHere are some more before and after photos, showing the effects of bleaching on the anemones that species such as clownfish use as a refuge.\nLiving with coral… or without it\nWhen I saw the coral this perky little blenny is sitting in, I was convinced I was looking at a healthy colony! Maybe Lizard Island was not 100% bleached after all.\nUnfortunately, closer examination shows that the coral head has died and a thin film of algae covers the branches. The little blenny is farming his patch and cropping the algae so that it does not become overgrown.\nOne-third of all marine life spends at least part of its life cycle on a reef. What happens when these reefs disappear?\nCurrent predictions are that coral reefs worldwide could be gone within 25 years. How much will be left after this global bleaching event? How much will be left for future generations?\nGiven the globally accepted link between carbon emissions, climate change and reef bleaching, the decision to approve the Carmichael coal mine in Queensland right next to the Great Barrier Reef really is adding insult to injury.\nThe continued loss of the Great Barrier Reef is an environmental tragedy and a huge blow to all Australians who cherish this natural wonder and to the tourists who flock here to see the reef – particularly after seeing David Attenborough’s new documentary on it.\nFurther afield, coral bleaching is a potential humanitarian crisis in countries that rely on reefs for food and basic livelihoods. Let’s not forget that when Australia burns or sells coal it is contributing to this global problem as well."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:76ce8867-c1f2-410e-bb5d-9a5ba539da34>","<urn:uuid:8bfb9817-8e23-4219-9b76-33912f2a532f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do competitive bidding and resource allocation strategies compare in terms of their impact on project success? 💼","answer":"Competitive bidding and proper resource allocation both influence project success but in different ways. Competitive bidding tends to realize better cost savings and can lead to more innovative proposals than in-house incumbents, though it is more resource-intensive for both supplier and client. Meanwhile, proper resource allocation during the project start-up phase is crucial for delivering the project on time and within budget - improper allocation can adversely affect profitability, cause budget overruns, and potentially lead to project failure. The key is to avoid assigning insufficient or overqualified resources, as underqualified resources cause delays and compromise quality, while overqualified resources become unnecessarily expensive.","context":["How to start off a successful outsource project\n1.0 Know what you want\nThere must be clear scoping of the demand and what is being put to the market. The objectives for the outsourcing must be consistent and reasonable – cost reduction, as an aim together with increase service may be inconsistent. Sign off internally why you are doing this and agree what is driving the whole process – this is important from the vendors perspective as well. If the vendor knows that cost reduction or technology refresh are key objectives the response can be tailored to your precise needs. Furthermore, objectives can change over time and the original case for an Outsource can be undermined by events. Revisiting the rationale you agreed internally is an important task during the process – don’t be driven by the running train take a time out to check you still need to do this.\n2.0 Put in place a clear process.\nDecide whether you are asking for a sole source versus competitive bid from the market. Sole sourcing is usually suggested (particularly by the vendor) if there is a history with the supplier and there is a time constraint – but there are significant negatives. Loss of leverage, not being able to compare alternatives, less aggressive pricing to name but three – and a sole source could have high impacts such as the legitimacy of the deal. Last but not least, the process may actually take longer as there is no time pressure that comes from a competitive environment.\nIn a competitive bid position cost savings have a better chance of being realised and new suppliers can come with more innovative proposals than the in-house incumbent – at least in principle. The process can actually be quicker as the client can drive the competitive process – by a strict time based approach to the process for example. But on the other hand competitive bidding is more resource intensive, for the supplier as well as the client, so make sure you resource well.\nBe precise, not prescriptive, comprehensive but concise in the layout – focus on key objectives. We need the ‘what’ not the how – avoid laying down all sorts of preconditions about how the service is to be delivered – that’s the suppliers job in the proposal. I have seen in several RFP’ s detailed specifications of what packages to use and how precisely the service is to be delivered – effectively closing off all innovative solutions that may have been available from the vendor. Also specific demands will drive up the cost – the vendor may be able to offer off-the-shelf solutions that will work just as well as your specific demands but at very favourable rates.\nA request for informartion (RFI) is a high-level document inviting a general response and can be used as a test for possible solutions and to pre-select candidates for the bid. Usually there is no bid price given by the suppliers – nor should we expect too much detail here. An request for proposal (RFP) invites a formal response and takes longer for the vendor and the customer to evaluate. In a large bid this cost can come to millions of dollars so make sure before you issue a RFP you really mean to go ahead. Ensure you are being realistic in your demands and take care that the quality and clarity in the RFP promotes conformance in the proposals received.\n3.0 Manage the Communication Channels\nIn negotiation avoid shortcuts and set specific goals – and ensure they are delivered. Evaluate, clarify and frame negotiations to keep competition alive. Document all discussions and carry out frequent self-assessment. Use a term sheet as this helps drive and track the discussion and allows apples to apples comparison – over time the term sheet can evolve into a contract so it is well worth the effort to create one.\nManage the up and down communication channels carefully. Make sure no seniors speak to vendors and control vendor access to senior management carefully. Some vendors are good at getting around the formal process to the senior management and exploiting this access to short-circuit the tender process. We all know of ‘golf course’ deals that cut through a bid process and enable vendors to return to the customer team informing them they ‘know’ the requirements of senior management. Most golf course deals end in disaster so should be avoided like the plague.\nKeep talking to vendors and meet frequently to discuss the proposals – the more open and interactive the better the eventual outcome will be.\n4.0 Cover the Details\nFirst of all vendors to this for a living – often the vendor sales team have been doing this for years and when this is done will move onto the next. The customer side on the other hand may have not done this before or at least the team carrying out the supplier proposal evaluation may be completely new compared to the last time the outsource process was done. Also some of the customer team will have a day job to contend with – don’t forget this (or holidays etc.) and plan capacities well. Plan well, resource well and set realistic time scales – time pressure can act in the vendor’s favour and allow skipping of important details.\nNever let issues that should be solved at negotiation drift into ‘we will solve this later’ discussions. They never are and these can be a source of major conflict later. A trade union official some time ago told me: ‘It is better for the negotiation to break down rather than the agreement’. All-important details must be cleared before signing a contract.\nPartnership rhetoric will appear at some stage in the discussions from the vendor side. Partnership usually means giving all the risks to the vendor from the customer side or closing out competition from the vendor side (sole sourcing). Partnership can be invoked to get over tricky points and put them off until later stages or to close out competition. Partnership should be based on performance and strict business principles not waffle. I know it is often said we can handle the things we forgot later in a change process – I have personally never found this to be free of major problems and cost – so beware of this.\nFinal point maximum gain minimum vendor pain during the proposal stage – and remember to ask yourself what you are looking for from outsourcing until you know what it is!","An improper allocation of resources can adversely affect the project’s profitability, cause the project to go over budget compared to the project baseline, and, in some cases, lead to project failure.\nSometimes, the project’s scope may suddenly change, which can disrupt the project plan, and you may need to add more resources that were not initially considered.\nThe project manager needs to ensure that the budget is reviewed regularly and, more importantly, in such a situation.\nIn addition, the project’s costs can be monitored by reviewing its progress during each stage and making sure there are no discrepancies.\nAllocate competent resources during the project start-up phase\nIdentifying and assigning the right resources during the start-up phase helps deliver the project on time and budget.\nIt also helps avoid allocating insufficient or overqualified – and therefore expensive – resources to certain project activities.\nOn the other hand, assigning underqualified resources will cause delays in delivery and compromise the quality of results.\nLook for cheaper resources\nThe resources used by a project can often be expensive and can reduce profit margins.\nThere are many instances of companies increasing the cost of the resources they offer when competing and many projects wasting resources, which means you are paying higher costs than you should be.\nHowever, there are many ways to reduce the amount and cost of resources used, such as comparing pricing from multiple vendors and implementing streamlined processes.\nReduce project duration\nAnother way you can reduce the expense of a project is to shorten its duration.\nThe longer a project is, the more resources will need to be used, including materials, administrative costs, energy, and employees, all of which will need to be paid.\nProject length is one of the main reasons why companies fail to meet their original budgets.\nTo shorten the critical path, you might consider performing multiple tasks simultaneously, turning full dependencies into partial dependencies that can run parallel.\nReduce project scope\nIf the project’s cost is a concern, one solution might also be to consider reducing the scope of the project.\nAlthough the scope is determined during the initial planning stages, this can prove costly and time-consuming if it is too broad.\nYou can reduce the scope by reducing the number of tasks that will be met simultaneously, limiting the project to only the most essential processes and requirements.\nReview workload estimates\nDo resources need 8 hours a day to perform a task, or can some of them work fewer hours a day on that given task?\nNot only should duration estimates be evaluated to shorten the program, but also workload estimates.\nManage your budget correctly\nIn addition to the aforementioned tips, it is also essential to implement a sustainable budget into the project plan and for the project manager to be able to monitor progress and adjust it to needs when necessary.\nMost budgets are relatively rigid because of budget approval early in the planning phase, which often includes funding from project sponsors.\nTherefore, the project manager must be able to work within these boundaries throughout the process.\nTo do this, you need to map your expenses before you start and use budget tracking tools to stick to them throughout the project lifecycle.\nUse agile management techniques\nAgile management can be the perfect way to avoid wasting resources, leading to lower project costs.\nAgile management uses short development cycles to advance and improve a project continuously.\nUse project management software\nAlthough project management software often has a high upfront cost, using it can help reduce the cost of a project.\nThat’s because dedicated software can help reduce the cost of manual processes and the extra time to be invested and allow employees to be more productive through automated processes, resource optimization, the ability to meet deadlines, and the reduction of administrative errors.\nIn this regard, the advice is to try a free project management software such as Twproject.\nSeek process improvements\nA final solution might be to see if there are ways in which you can achieve your goals differently.\nFor example, is it possible to do work remotely instead of requiring office visits?\nIs it possible to gather requirements in one day, through a joint design session, rather than in three weeks using traditional methods?\nIs it possible to outsource some of the work at a lower cost than doing it in-house?\nThese and other questions can lead to money-saving process changes.\nIn conclusion, the main goal of cost management for a project is to eliminate unnecessary costs without compromising the quality of the final results.\nHowever, this is an ongoing process within project management and requires constant monitoring to try to maintain the project budget.\nAlso, determining discrepancies helps you take timely action and avoid going over budget.\nOften, project managers reserve 10 to 20 percent of the budget for unforeseen circumstances and create the project plan with the remaining budget so that there are no last-minute hiccups."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without

{"question":"How do investment strategies differ between protecting urban water resources and maintaining agricultural stream corridors?","answer":"In urban water resource protection, as exemplified by Quito, Ecuador, investment strategies focus on education and understanding the source of water, including taking city school children on field trips to learn about conservation's role in water distribution. In contrast, agricultural stream corridor protection requires physical investment in forest buffers of specific widths (35-50 feet minimum, up to 150 feet for comprehensive wildlife protection), planting diverse tree species for food (such as oaks and black cherry), and establishing shrubs for cover. Both approaches recognize that people are part of the ecosystem and require direct investment in human well-being alongside natural resource protection, but they implement this understanding through different means based on their specific contexts and needs.","context":["I am guessing that few if any people reading this would picture people when they think about an ecosystem. I know when I think ecosystems, I think plants, animals, rivers, etc., but not people.\nEcosystems are about nature. People aren’t nature, right?\nBut, by definition, there is nothing that excludes people from being part of an ecosystem. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, ecosystems are “a biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment.” Guess what? People are organisms. We are also a biological community. Ecosystems inevitably include both natural resources and the people that use them, depend on them and extract them.\nNevertheless, in climate change discussions (and, let’s face it, most conversations and news about nature are about climate change these days), there are two conversations:\n- Helping nature (i.e. ecosystems) adapt to climate change through investments in natural systems to ensure their resilience — otherwise known as Ecosystem-Based Adaptation (EBA).\n- Helping people adapt to climate change.\nAnd this dichotomy is why adaptation to climate change really hasn’t caught on as a concept that’s moving environmental policy — not to mention people and their investment in “nature.”\nThe scientific literature on these topics is what really made me aware of this dichotomy:\n- Some are all about EBA — creating resistant and resilient systems that can respond to climate change.\n- Some are all about people adapting to climate change (right down to titles such as “Lifting the Taboo on Adaptation“).\n- And while some try to bring the conversations together, they still don’t talk about investments in people AND in land as a means to adapt to climate change.\nConversations about ecosystem services — the services nature provides us, like water filtration or fisheries — get us closer, too, when they include the benefits of EBA for people. But conservationists need to talk about people as part of an ecosystem, or better yet, as part of nature — not just people benefiting from some entity outside themselves known as “nature.”\nPeople depend on natural resources. But resource extraction tends to alter native vegetation and systems — so, as our population continues to grow and climate change shifts resource availability, we are going to extract more from new areas. This ever-roaming extractive behavior can threaten invaluable biodiversity…not to mention our quest for sustainable livelihoods.\nSo yes, EBA needs to be in climate change policy. It also needs to factor into on-the-ground conservation efforts. But it won’t succeed if the investments we’re advocating to help ecosystems adapt don’t also include investments to provide for human well-being directly. Conservation organizations might not be the best equipped to invest in people, but if we at least define ecosystems as including people, we can more effectively partner with those who can make such investments.\nNow, while we still have the time, let’s do more than just invest in nature or protected areas or native systems. Let’s also invest in:\n- Best management practices on productive systems (such as riparian buffers, contour farming, organic agriculture, among others);\n- Education to teach the importance of native systems for the long-term sustainability of resource availability (example: Quito, Ecuador, where as part of the Quito water fund, a project The Nature Conservancy helped spearhead, children in city schools are taken on field trips to understand the source of their water and the role conservation plays in its distribution); and\n- Alternative livelihoods for people, making them less dependent on any one resource.\nSound impossible? Think about marine protected areas — which provide a sustainable fish harvest to people or regions where we’ve also invested in providing people with other income options, thereby decreasing pressure on non-human systems and resources while securing livelihoods and protecting biodiversity. Marine protected areas are a perfect example of why EBA must be about human AND non-human systems — because conservation works better if you consider both.\nIf you still need convincing, then read “An Amazon Culture Withers as Food Dries Up,” a powerful, poignant recent story in The New York Times, depicting just how people suffer “along with the animals” as their fisheries resources dwindle away because of deforestation and climate change.\nFrom the Arctic to the Amazon to the Maldives, indigenous peoples who rely on nature’s cycles are suffering because of climate change — and serve as a warning to us all.\n(Image: Farming landscapes in the Ecuadorian countryside in the Paute watershed with a protected area in the background.

This poses obstacles to water quality in the form of nutrients, sediments, and other pollutants, but also to terrestrial wildlife that have little or no habitat in these settings. Trees planted along city streets and in suburban backyards may feel like a sort of coexistence with nature, but in reality these manicured settings provide habitat for very few native species. Farmland can also be deceptively “natural”; despite expansive hayfields and lush row crops, there are few places for wildlife to nest, raise young, or eat. Waist-high hay and six-foot-tall corn are eventually cut, leaving no cover for all but the smallest animals. Luckily, both water quality and wildlife habitat issues can be addressed with one management practice: buffering streams and water bodies with forest cover.\nA four year old riparian forest buffer in Huntingdon County, PA. Without this buffer, nutrients and sediments from the adjacent pastures would freely enter the stream and degrade water quality from here all the way to the Chesapeake Bay. Many wildlife species would not be able to breed or survive without the buffer because there is also no other source of year-round herbaceous or shrubby cover on the landscape.\nHealthy streams and watersheds rely on functional riparian forest corridors. A streamside forest will trap and filter nutrients and sediment from the uplands that would otherwise flow into the stream, and the overhanging tree canopy will cool down the water to make it suitable for trout and other native aquatic fauna. They can also be important for terrestrial wildlife, especially in landscapes dominated by agriculture or development. Stream corridors that hold trees, dense shrubs/saplings, and native herbaceous vegetation provide breeding, foraging, and escape cover for an array of upland and lowland wildlife species that would other have little to eat and no shelter from predators or the elements.\nIf you have existing forest cover around a stream, protecting and restoring it will be best for the water and wildlife. The width of buffer needed to improve water quality depends on the quality of the buffer and the adjacent land use, but 35 to 50 feet should be sufficient in most cases. A 50 foot buffer on either side of a stream will also be beneficial to many wildlife species such as deer, rabbits, woodcock, and pheasants, but many area-sensitive songbirds and other species require at least 150 feet of forest cover on each side.\nA mature buffer in Bedford County, PA. This buffer is protecting the water from pollutants, slowing and cooling the water to support habitat for aquatic fauna, and providing habitat for many species of wildlife that would otherwise have nowhere else to breed or escape from predators.\nIn areas currently devoid of canopy cover, planting trees and shrubs may be necessary. Natural regeneration can successfully restore riparian corridors in some situations, but in predominately non-forested landscapes there are often either not enough seed sources or too much pressure from invasive vegetation that chokes out beneficial native species. Improvements in water quality require canopy cover to reduce water temperature and perennial vegetative cover to filter nutrients and sediment. Buffers can be improved for wildlife by planting diverse overstory species that provide food (oaks, blackgum, tulip-poplar, black cherry) and shrubs that provide dense cover and food to improve winter survival (alders, silky dogwood, red-osier dogwood, viburnums, ilexes). Additionally, consider pollinators when planting riparian buffers; in heavily developed and farmed landscapes these forests are often their only habitat as well. Pollinators require undisturbed soil and brush for nesting and nectar sources over the duration of the growing season. Consider the blooming period of trees and shrubs and try to ensure that there will be something flowering over as much of the year as possible, and avoid disturbing the herbaceous layer to encourage growth of native wildflowers such as ironweed, Joe-pye weed, and goldenrod.\nEstablishing a buffer by planting can be challenging, but there are many online resources and technical guidance to assist interested landowners. Visit forestsforthebay.org to see what assistance is available in your state or email me at email@example.com if you are interested in restoring streamside forests on your property.\nSenior Forests Projects Manager\n(717) 517 8698\nNews Staff Blog"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f71c475b-7fc5-4e60-a50d-989f4b4beba7>","<urn:uuid:79600925-bfc6-4625-9d8e-eaf61cccbf33>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What seasonal considerations affect travel access to both Bhutan and the Everest Base Camp region?","answer":"Both destinations are significantly affected by seasonal conditions. Bhutan's ideal visiting time is October to December when the air is clear and skies are sunny, while January and February are colder. The monsoon season from June to September brings heavy rains. For Everest Base Camp, October to December is also cited as the best season. Additionally, access to Bhutan's Paro airport is restricted by visual flight rules - pilots must be able to see the runway and surrounding hills, meaning no flights operate at night or in poor visibility, potentially causing days of delays. Similar weather constraints affect flights to Lukla for Everest Base Camp treks, where early morning flights are typical and schedules depend on weather conditions.","context":["Bhutan Travel Guide: Overview\nIt’s easy to see why Bhutan is known as the “Last Shangri-La.\" Its culture—deeply influenced by a unique form of Buddhism and rich with traditions of spirituality, art, music, dance and food—has not only been preserved but treasured by its citizens. This is, in fact, a foundational tenet of Bhutan. Until only a couple of decades ago, the country chose to isolate itself from the rest of the world and refused the influences of other societies and customs. Televisions, smartphones and the Internet exist in Bhutan, but their ubiquity and impact on the local culture is much less than that seen with its neighbors. Further differentiating itself from other nations, Bhutan measures its economic and national success with a rather unique self-created methodology: Gross National Happiness (GNH).\nBhutan cares deeply about preserving its culture, traditions and environment. Located deep in the Himalayas, its natural beauty is abundant and timeless. Its charm and appeal also lie in its refusal to let tourism run wild. There’s no overdevelopment, no mass land sales and no exploitation of its people solely to make Bhutan a popular destination with travelers. Bhutan has strict controls regarding who can enter the country, how long they stay and where they go. For these reasons, it's not a budget travel destination, and it takes some planning to visit here, but as anyone who takes on the challenge can attest, once you arrive, you immediately realize, appreciate and celebrate just how truly special it is.\nArchaeological evidence suggests this area was inhabited as far back as 2000 BC. Tibetan king Songtsen Gampo introduced Buddhism to Bhutan in the seventh century AD, extending the Tibetan Empire into the region and ordering the construction of two Buddhist temples in the Paro area.\nUntil the early 17th century, Bhutan was essentially a patchwork of small, warring fiefdoms, and then the Tibetan lama and military leader Ngawang Namgyal, who had fled religious persecution in Tibet, unified the area. To defend the country against periodic Tibetan advances, Namgyal built a network of impregnable dzongs (fortresses) and promulgated the Tsa Yig, a legal code that helped to bring local lords under centralized control. Many dzongs still exist and are active centers of district administration and religion.\nThrough the British East India Company, the British entered Bhutan in the 18th century as part of its colonial expansion into India, China and the region as a whole. The British remained involved in the country's affairs for the ensuing two hundred-plus years. After centuries of internal struggles, civil wars and conflicts with neighboring peoples, during which the British backed certain leaders and factions, Bhutan chose a king in 1907. The nation settled into an agreement that gave the British control of Bhutan's foreign affairs.\nIn 1953, the king established the 130-member National Assembly in order to promote a more democratic form of governance, and the country eventually changed from an absolute to a constitutional monarchy.\nIt was only in 1999 that the country lifted its ban on television and the Internet and began to open up more to the outside world. In 2005, Bhutan began to implement a new constitution, and in 2007 and 2008, it held its first national parliamentary elections. After opening its country to commercial tourism in 1974, Bhutan welcomed 287 tourists that year. Every year, as the draw of this vibrant, unspoiled country increased, more and more people made the journey. Today, over a quarter-million people visit Bhutan annually.\nDue to its relative isolation from the rest of the world and strong adherence to its traditions and religion, Bhutan has maintained its customs over the last several centuries. Experiencing the nation’s unique culture is one of the strongest draws for Western visitors.\nBhutan is officially the only Buddhist kingdom still in existence, and the large majority of the country adheres to the state religion of Vajrayana Buddhism. (By and large, Hindus make up the remaining people.) The religious leaders have always had a strong say in Bhutan’s political affairs and have been political leaders in the past as well. The lifestyle of the people, therefore, largely conforms to these religious beliefs. The country controls the influence of foreign culture, which is also why the local traditions have remained so strong. However, this is slowly changing with the continued presence of tourism, as well as the curiosity of much of Bhutan's younger population. The juxtaposition of young Bhutanese tapping their smartphones while traditionally dressed Buddhist monks walk by is becoming a more common sight in Thimpu, the capital city.\nNo rigid clan systems exist in the nation, and men and women share equal rights. Most of the country relies on subsistence farming.\nThe Bhutanese inherit some truly unique customs that have their origin in the mythological legends and folktales of the country. For example, visitors will likely see giant phalluses painted outside the homes of otherwise reserved Bhutanese people. Theses images represent the Divine Madman, a figure believed to ward off evil spirits. Don’t be alarmed when you see this on a person's home.\nIt’s compulsory for all Bhutanese citizens to adhere to a national dress code when in public. Men wear robes called gho, while women wear brightly colored kira with ornate brooches and wraparound skirts.\nVisitors should take advantage of the opportunities to witness cultural experiences, such as dance, music, archery (a very popular sport) and religious ceremonies.\nGood to Know\nWhen traveling in Bhutan, keep some of the following in mind:\nThe official currency is the ngultrum (BTN), which is pegged to the Indian rupee (INR). US dollars are widely accepted. Bhutanese currency is only needed for personal expenses and small souvenir items. For larger expenses, travelers can use US Dollars and other foreign currency. Most ATMs in Bhutan (mostly concentrated in Thimphu and Paro) are compatible with international credit cards, such as Visa, Mastercard and Maestro. However, as the service is not overly reliable, it’s good practice to have a supply of ngultrum or US dollars on hand.\nTap water is unsafe in Bhutan. Stick to bottled water or the purified water provided by your hotel.\nTipping is not obligatory. Hotels and restaurant bills include service charges of 20 percent. There’s no need to add anything further to these bills, but do feel free to tip your guides, drivers and other crew members accompanying you throughout your trip.\nBhutan is a modest country that adheres to its Buddhist principles. Dress conservatively, and be respectful of the local culture and customs. Never touch someone on the head, and don't use your feet to point at anything. A formal greeting is to bow with outstretched, open hands (palms up). Always show the utmost respect in temples and holy places.\nThe standard voltage is 230 volt, and the frequency is 50 hertz. If you're coming from North America, you’ll need a voltage converter and plug adapter to fit your devices.\nMost hotels have Western toilets and provide toilet paper, though some exceptions exist, particularly in local hotels in eastern Bhutan. There are very few public toilets, so take full advantage of hotel and restaurant facilities before any long drive. Most public toilets are of the Asian squat variety, and toilet paper isn't provided, but a container of water should be present.\nWhen To Visit Bhutan\nOctober to December is the ideal time to visit Bhutan as the air is clear, and the skies are sunny. January and February are colder, but in March and April, the climate remains dry and pleasant. In late spring, the famous rhododendrons bloom spectacularly and flood the valleys with color. Heat and humidity increase in May, and from June to September, monsoon rains cover the mountains.\n- Thimpu is one of just two Asian capital cities that doesn’t have a single traffic light. (The other is Pyongyang, North Korea.)\n- “Bhutan” translates roughly to “Land of the Thunder Dragon.” It earned this nickname due to the fierce storms that often roll in from the Himalayas.\n- In Bhutan, killing a black-necked crane, which is highly endangered and culturally sacred, could carry a lifetime sentence in prison.\nFull article coming soon.\nRegions and Cities\nJakar: This administrative town in the north is the birthplace of Buddhism in Bhutan.\nPunakha: A former winter capital of Bhutan, the city still hosts the monastic body in winter.\nThimpu: The capital and largest, most developed city, Thimpu contains many monasteries, museums and landmarks to visit.\nWorth a Visit\nJigme Dorji National Park\nBhutan's largest national park, this stunning place provides sanctuary for many wild animals. Keep a keen eye out for any number of species, including snow leopard, Himalayan black bear, red panda, musk deer, sambar deer and barking deer.\nRoyal Manas National Park\nThis park and the adjoining Manas National Park in Assam provide an opportunity to spot many kinds of wild and exotic animals, including tigers, leopards, rhinos, bears, pangolins and elephants.\nNo Bhutan travel guide would be complete without mentioning the hike to this monastery perched atop the side of a cliff. It's said Guru Rinpoche (an eighth-century Tibetan Buddhist master) was carried from Tibet to this spot on the back of the tigress, hence the name. First constructed in 1692 near the cave where Guru Rinpoche first meditated, this monastery (still functioning amid daily visits from tourists) consists of four temples with residential accommodations for the monks.\nThings to See and to Do\nFull Article Coming Soon!\nHow to Get to Bhutan\nBhutan has one international airport (Paro) and two airlines (government-owned Druk Air and the privately run Bhutan Airlines). Although schedules change by season, usually several flights a week arrive from Kathmandu, New Delhi, Singapore and Bangkok. These are either direct or have a stopover. Only a few aircraft can operate on a runway as short and high as Paro's, and because all landings and takeoffs in Paro are by visual flight rules—the pilot must be able to see the runway and surrounding hills before landing—no flights can be operated at night or in poor visibility. When Paro’s valley is clouded in, flights are potentially delayed for days. When this happens, your tour program must be changed and everything rebooked.\nSince independent travel to Bhutan is not allowed (you must apply and go through an approved tour operator), your tour operator will apply for and receive your visa for you when you book your trip, and you’ll normally have already paid the visa fee directly to that operator. When you arrive at one of the ports of entry for tourists, your visa endorsement is stamped in your passport at that time. You’ll receive a visa for the exact period you have arranged to be in Bhutan. If extenuating circumstances require you to obtain a visa extension, your tour operator will arrange it.\nBhutan doesn’t have a railway system, and because there’s only one main road through the country, the only way to see Bhutan is by foot, car or the very limited domestic air service, which is restricted to Paro, Bumthang and Gelephu, as of 2018. Travelers should discuss their desired routes and itineraries with their tour operators since tourists aren’t able to book their own flights or travel unaccompanied through the country.\nThe national highway, a stretch of tarmac that winds its way up and down mountains, across clattering bridges, along the side of cliffs and over high mountain passes, is in the process of being widened to double lanes. This is a massive undertaking because of the rivers, mudflows and landslides that currently present hazards—especially when it rains. Roads can easily become blocked due to snow or landslides and can take anywhere from an hour to several days to clear, and these conditions won't change with a wider road. Public buses are crowded, uncomfortable and generally not recommended for travelers. Point begin, however you travel, bring plenty of reading material for your journeys!\nTaxis frequent Thimpu, Paro and Jakar, and drivers usually don't use their meters. If you’re traveling on a tourist visa, transport costs are likely included in the price of your trip, and you'll have a vehicle available for both short- and long-distance travel.\nBhutan is a multilingual society with 19 different languages and dialects spoken throughout. That said, Dzongkha is the national language. Widely spoken in the western region, this became the state language in 1971. Besides Dzongkha, you’ll likely encounter three other dominant languages: Tshanglakha (or Sharchokpa), spoken in eastern Bhutan; Lhotshamkha (or Nepali), spoken in the southern region and Bumthangkha, spoken in central Bhutan. As the medium of instruction in schools, English is widely spoken. Hindi is also common and understood by most Bhutanese because of the influence of Bollywood (Indian cinema).\nIf you want to practice the local language, here are some key phrases in Dzongkha:\n- Hello: Kuzu zangpo la\n- How are you?: Gaday bay zhui?\n- Yes: Inn\n- No: Men\n- Nice to meet you: Ga choe da je di sem ga yi\n- Excuse me: Atsi zur nang\n- Thank you: Kadrin chhe la\nFood and Drink\nAlthough Indian, Tibetan and Nepali influence can be felt in the local cuisine, Bhutanese food is quite unique and strongly reflects the local ingredients. Datshi (cheese) is ubiquitous throughout Bhutan and is combined with potatoes, meat and other vegetables in a number of dishes. Ema datshi (chilies and cheese) is the most famous dish in Bhutan, and it’s present in nearly every meal. The chilies, which can either be fresh green chilies or dry red chilies, are sliced lengthwise and cooked with Bhutanese cheese and plenty of butter. Chilies are used in lots of Bhutanese dishes, and they can pack a punch! Meat is eaten more commonly in Bhutan than in other neighboring Buddhist regions, which is largely due to the mountainous geography and relative lack of many fresh ingredients beyond chilies, potatoes and a few other vegetables. As a result, it's common to see beef, yak and pork meat used in Bhutan.\nFood in Bhutan: What to Know and to Eat—Full Article Coming Soon!\nBhutan is generally one of the safest places in the world for tourists. Tourism is a huge part of the Bhutanese economy, and daily tariffs and strong government control ensure there’s little to no crime committed against visitors. Thimphu police are quite active and do rounds around the city at night to ensure the safety of those enjoying Bhutan travel.\nBhutan has a universal health care system, and hospitals and clinics are located throughout the country, even in the remotest areas. Travelers, however, should not expect high-tech facilities.\nIn terms of the natural environment, bears are a threat in remote mountainous regions.\nThe US State Department advises LGBTQ travelers that homosexuality is illegal in Bhutan, and the law is enforced. Punishment can include prison sentences of one month to one year. Tobacco users should know that the sale of tobacco (cigarettes, chewing tobacco or other tobacco products) is effectively banned throughout Bhutan. (Bhutan remains the only country in the world to enforce this policy.) Penalties for possession or use of tobacco might be severe. That said, due to a parliamentary amendment in 2012, the country now allows visitors to import a limited quantity of cigarettes and tobacco products into the country for personal use only. To do so without facing fines, one must have receipts proving the payment of import duties.\nWHAT IS BACKROADS\nEstablished in 1979, Backroads is a pioneer in active, immersive and off-the-beaten-path travel.

This leisurely itinerary allows a direct approach to the foot of Mt. Everest, the world's highest mountain. You trek through enchanting Sherpa high country and unspoilt Buddhist monasteries to Everest Base Camp and the amazing Khumbu Glacier. This trek gives you the opportunity to climb Kala Pattar, a 5554 metre peak on the way to the Everest B.C, which is the superb vantage point for magnificent views of southwest face of Mt Everest and surrounding Himalayan Mountains. Your trail along the Khumbu Glacier takes you to the foot of the Everest where you have an amazing perspective on the Khumbu Ice fall.\nDay 01: fly to Lukla and trek to Phakding(2610m)\nThe most of the trekker option to fly to Lukla from Kathmandu to utilize their time. Our flight to Lukla is early in the morning, so you will be transferred to Kathmandu domestic airport. On your arrival at Lukla, your trek guide instantly begins the trekking adventure to Everest Base Camp. Our trek guide gives short brief about trekking routes then starts trek. The trail begins from the beside of Dudh Kodhi river. The first day trek is short; we just 3 or 4 hours trek in the first day. Through up and down hill, Sherpa hemlets, and forest we reach Phakding.\nDay 02: Phakding to Namche bazaar (3420m)\nOn the second day of our trek, the trail crosses the river on a long, swaying bridge. After 2 hours of walk we arrive at sagarmatha National Park in monjo. We need to TIMS card and permit at the entrance, without TIMS card and permit we can’t go there. Then walking 3 hours we reach Namche, which is most popular stopover during the treks in Everest region. On the reaching to the top of the hill at Namche, we will sit in the lodge. There are many hotels and lodges.\nDay 03: Acclimatization day; Namche Bazaar\nOn the third day of our trek, first acclimization day of Everest Base Camp. Namche bazaar is the main trade and administrative centre for the solu khumbu region and there have many restaurents, bakeries, hotels, shops, bank and other facilities also available. Higher the altitude, thinner the air, we need to gain altitudes slowly and steadly. However, we need acclimatization day on the trek. We will do just short hike in this day.\nDay 04: Namche Bazaar to Tengboche(3870m)\nIn this day we will hike to Tengboche from namche bazaar. The slightly longer route from Namche bazaar to Tengboche via Khumjung and Khunde is more intersting then one. The route starts through hillside and enjoying the view of Ama dablam(6856m). We followed by the descend of river , tropical forest hill; we will reach Tengboche.\nDay 05: Tengboche to Pheriche (4240m)\nWe starts trek after breakfast with enjoy the view of Ama Dablam. The trails drops down to Debuche, crosses the Imja Khola and climbs through rhododendron forest past superb mani stones to Pangboche. The typical Sherpa village, the village is a good place for lunch stop. The trail then climbs orsho to pheriche.\nDay 06: Acclimatisation day in Pheriche\nAnother acclimatization day should be spent at Pheriche. Pheriche is good place to spend a day. The villages of Dingboche and Chukkung are possible distinction and both offer good views, we just hike one or two hour hike on this day.\nDay 07: Pheriche to Duglha(4620m)\nThe trail climbs to Phulang Kala then Duglha. it is short trek. Himalayan Rescue Association (HRA) doctors at Pheriche urge everyone to stay for aid acclimatization. If any kind of problem in your health it help to you immediately. After walking four or five hours you reach in the Duglha and overnight in lodge.\nDay 08: Duglha to Lobuche(4930m)\nEverest Base Camp trail today gains the attitude almost of 5000m. After early breakfast, we start our hiking uphill gradually. The trail goes directly up the gravely terminal moraine of the Khumbu glacier,for about an hour. It eventually takes you to the higher altitude; so slow and steady pace is important for comfortable ascending. On the reaching top, we have memorial stupas of the dead Sherpa’s and western trekkers and climbers who lost their life in tragic accident in the Himalayas. And we stay overnight in Lobuche.\nDay 09: Lobuche to Gorak Shep(5160m)\nThis is the most important day of Everest Base Camp Trek as we reach Everest Base Camp (EBC). After the breakfast, we walk along the rocky terrain alongside the Khumbu glacier to EBC. We’ll visit Khumbu Ice fall, glacial area of EBC, enjoy the view of Himalayas and make best photos and videos, then we return back to Gorakshep. Gorakshep was base camp for the 1952 Swiss expedition to Everest. There is accommodation here but it’s cold and the altitude makes life uncomfortable. We stay overnight in Gorekshep.\nDay 10: Gorek Shep to Periche via kala Pattar(5545m)\nAfter the breakfast, we will start hiking to a big black rock hill kalapatter, just above Gorekshep. This hike is straight climb up hill for two hour. The trek to Kalapatter is most tough because of there has very windy so we prepared with warm clothing. The summit of Kalapatter offers us the good view of the Mt.Everest (8848m) including the full spread of Khumbu Himalayas. You get better chance to see the highest mountain in the world. As the sunset, the views are more colourful, the kalpatter is one of the prime highlights of Everest Base Camp Trek. We stay overnight at Lobuche because descending down is better for the body and minimize the risk.\nDay 11: Periche to Namche Bazzar (3440m)\nToday, we start our trek from Periche in early morning after breakfast. We begin the trek from Periche cross the bridge over Khumbu Khola then we trek down to Orsho and keep on down pangboche and cross the small bridge again and enter the jungle. And we walking through Debuche , Khumjung and finally we arrive Namche Bazzar. Overnight at Namche.\nDay 12: trek to Lukla from Namche Bazzar\nThe trail from Namche to Lukla (2840m) takes about six and half hours. This day the trail gradually descends and then ascends as well as you cross the Dudh koshi river. On arriving Lukla our trekking officially ends. Stay overnight at Lukla.\nDay 13: fly to Kathmandu\nOur flight to Kathmandu is in the morning. After the breakfast we will check in to Lukla airport then the plane to Kathmandu. Flight is depends on the weather condition sometime flight may delays. On arrival to Kathmandu, we will transfer you to hotel.

{"question":"As a special education expert, what are the main differences between sensory strategies and TEACCH in terms of their educational setting approach?","answer":"Sensory strategies and TEACCH differ significantly in their educational setting approach. Sensory strategies are designed to be non-invasive accommodations that can be implemented in any context and all environments, focusing on integrating movement breaks and visual schedules throughout the day in both home and school settings. In contrast, TEACCH often educates children with ASD in separate classrooms away from typically developing peers, though its principles can be applied in any setting. TEACCH's approach is based on the 'Culture of Autism' concept, where teachers and therapists act as 'cross-cultural interpreters' between the neuro-typical world and the way individuals with autism understand and communicate.","context":["Sensory strategies are associated with a variety of diagnoses and conditions through childhood, adolescence and adulthood. These strategies are non-invasive accommodations that can be made in any context, to all daily activities in all environments. Sensory strategies are often referred to as “movement breaks,” or other similar titles, but provide the same suggestions and are truly sensory strategies at their core.\nThese strategies have been found to be very useful for children with Autism who also have sensory processing challenges:\n- Utilize a visual schedule throughout the day (both at home and at school). Visual schedules are often easier to understand for a child with autism, or any young child, as there is a pictorial representation of each activity or time of day. Using a visual schedule more clearly outlines the expectations that you have for the child and gives him/her a sense of control over their day. A visual schedule may also be used as a tool to develop a morning and bedtime routine and increase independence in self-care activities, such as brushing teeth and getting dressed.\n- Allowing the child to take a 2-3 minute movement break every 10-15 minutes. This break should involve intense movement when possible, such as jumping jacks, pushups, jumping on a trampoline, etc. When intense movement is not appropriate, breaks may involve the student walking to the drinking fountain, getting up to sharpen his/her pencil and/or walking to the bathroom.\n- If an assigned task involves intense academic work, such as testing, lengthy projects or problem-solving assignments the child should be given the opportunity to take a longer break (approximately 10 minutes) to allow time for more intense physical exercise.\n- Utilize a timer during activities and make sure it is visible to the child. Timers can be either visual, meaning that there is an area of the clock that becomes shaded and as time elapses the shaded area becomes smaller and smaller however there is no noise associated with it, or auditory, in which there is a digital display and an alarm that sounds when the time has fully elapsed. Using a timer is especially helpful during preferred activities, such as free-play, as it sets a clear limit for the child regarding how long they will have to participate in this designated activity. This makes the environment and the activity more predictable and eliminates any element of surprise which is present during verbal warnings such as “2 more minutes,” and should make transitions happen more easily.\n- Along with a timer, providing transition warnings and using transition items will help a child with autism move from one activity to the next. A transition warning can be used in conjunction with a timer to create more clear expectations surrounding transitioning from one activity to the next. A transition warning involves setting the timer for how long the child will have until moving on to the next activity, as well as verbally or visually communicating that the transition is approaching. For example, if a child has 5 minutes of free play prior to a structured task, when I set the timer for 5 minutes I would tell him/her “You have 5 minutes to play and then when the timer beeps it is time to go sit at the table.” Then when there are 2 minutes remaining on the timer I would follow-up with “Look at the timer, you only have 2 more minutes until table time.” If a child does not yet understand the concept of time, the visual timer would be the better choice for a timer as you can clearly see the shaded or colored area disappearing.\n- A transition item is a physical thing that the child is allowed to bring from one activity to the next. If a child was playing with blocks and it was time to go to the table for a writing activity, a transition item could be allowing the child to bring a block with to the table. Or substitute an item, such as allowing him/her to bring an action figure, small doll or ball with him/her from the block area to the table. Transition items help stop “tantrums” or the feeling that something is being taken away form the child and make the transition smoother.\n- Provide a toy or item for the child to manipulate during solitary work. These items are often referred to as “fidgets,” and provide the child with an outlet to release their restlessness. Rather than continuously moving his/her body, the child can move his/her hands quietly in their lap or on their desk while manipulating the fidget.","In the field below enter the email address where you received the invitation letter.\nPlease enter a valid email addressSet & Continue\nTEACCH began at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1972 under the direction of the late psychologist, Dr. Eric Schopler. TEACCH now includes seven centers in North Carolina that provide diagnostic evaluations, parent training, and social and support groups. TEACCH also operates model early intervention and supported employment programs and a residential/vocational program, as well as providing individual consultations and professional training workshops nationally and internationally.\nTEACCH developed the concept of the “Culture of Autism” to convey the idea that like cultures, autism spectrum disorders yield characteristic patterns of learning, thinking, communicating, and behaving. TEACCH proposes that teachers, parents, and therapists can function as “cross-cultural interpreters” who use specialized strategies to work back and forth between the expectations of the neuro-typical world and the ways individuals with autism understand and communicate.\nFeatures of the Culture of Autism include:\nThe overall TEACCH approach is called “Structured TEACCHing.” The fundamental principles of Structured TEACCHing are:\nStructured TEACCHing suggests that for teaching new skills or to minimize behavioral difficulties in situations, visual answers should be provided for the following questions:\nFor young and beginning learners, typical techniques for answering ‘where’ include defining learning spaces through furniture placement and blocking out sources of distraction. For older and more abstract thinking individuals, it is often useful to provide visual guidance (or options) about where to sit, where to put possessions, and how to get from place to place in the school or work setting. Techniques for showing ‘what’ involve visual or written directions (often accompanied with brief verbal directions) about the steps in an activity and the sequence of activities to be completed. Possible techniques for showing ‘how much’ or ‘how long’ include 1) having materials organized into containers that become emptier as the activity moves toward completion; 2) having a list of activities that are checked off or removed as they are completed; 3) using a visual timer that provides information about the passage of time and arrival of the end of the activity. Consistent with these techniques, ‘finished’ is shown by empty containers of materials, a completed checklist, or a visual and/or auditory cue from a timer or clock. When activities are completed, there is typically a visual cue for guiding the individual to look back to the schedule to find the next activity.\nStructured TEACCHing is appropriate for individuals with ASD at all ages and functioning levels, because the general principles are applied flexibly for each individual. That is, visual answers to these questions for a young or developmentally delayed child would look very different from those for a high school student or adult with average intelligence, but the general principles of using visual or written supports to organize time and space would still apply.\nStructured TEACCHing can help individuals with ASD learn new skills or participate appropriately in any setting, including but not limited to\nEvidence-Based research on TEACCH:\nComparative efficacy of LEAP, TEACCH and non-model-specific special education programs for preschoolers with autism spectrum disorders. Journal of autism and developmental disorders.1 This study compares three programs for children with ASD under age five. The first approach, TEACCH, is based on the “culture of autism” and cognitive-social learning theory. TEACCH involves changes to the environment such as visual schedules, work areas, and organizational systems to promote learning. The second approach, LEAP (Learning Experiences and Alternative Program for Preschoolers and their Parents) is based on a combination of applied behavior analysis (ABA) and common aspects of early childhood education, with a goal of reducing symptoms of autism that interfere with learning. One important difference is that TEACCH often educates children with ASD in a separate classroom away from typically developing peers, while LEAP uses an inclusive educational approach. These two approaches were compared with the third approach of non-specific special education. According to the researchers, the third approach “did not use practices aligned with any particular theoretical or conceptual model.”The study took place in public schools in four U.S. states. One hundred ninety eight children between age three and five years were randomized to one of the three programs. Communication skills, sensory and repetitive behaviors, social interaction and fine motor skills were measured at baseline and at the end of a year. All three programs were found to produce statistically improvements in child outcomes, but no important differences in outcomes by program.\n1 Boyd BA, Hume K, McBee MT, et al.

{"question":"I'm comparing water storage solutions - how do holding tanks differ from rainwater harvesting tanks in terms of their main purpose and typical applications?","answer":"Holding tanks and rainwater harvesting tanks serve different primary purposes. Holding tanks are designed to store and treat wastewater, being a critical component of wastewater management systems. They temporarily contain wastewater until it can be treated and discharged, helping reduce contaminants entering the environment. In contrast, rainwater harvesting tanks are specifically designed to collect and store clean rainwater from roofs and other surfaces for later use. These tanks are typically used to provide an alternative water source for activities like garden irrigation, household use, and in some cases drinking water after proper filtration. While both are storage solutions, holding tanks manage waste output while rainwater tanks collect fresh input for various beneficial uses.","context":["When it comes to wastewater management systems, one of the most important components is the holding tank. But what is the purpose of a holding tank exactly, and how can it benefit your home or business? In this article, we’ll discuss the various purposes of a holding tank and how they can help you manage your wastewater. Read on to learn more about the importance of a holding tank and the various ways it can be used.\nWhat is the Function of a Holding Tank?\nHolding tanks are a critical part of many water and wastewater systems, performing a variety of functions. They are used to store and treat wastewater, house tanks for pumps, and provide temporary storage for wastewater during peak periods. In some cases, they can even be used for water supply. In this article, we’ll explore the various uses of holding tanks and how they contribute to water and wastewater systems.\nA holding tank is a large, sealed container that is designed to store wastewater or process water. They are often constructed from concrete, steel, or plastic, and can range from small, single-use tanks to large, industrial-sized structures. Holding tanks are designed to store wastewater for extended periods of time, allowing for it to be treated and reused.\nHolding tanks are typically used in water and wastewater systems for several reasons. They can be used to store wastewater during periods of peak demand, allowing for it to be treated and reused in the future. They can also be used to store and treat wastewater prior to its discharge into the environment. In some cases, they can even be used to store water during periods of drought or to supplement a water supply.\nThe Benefits of Holding Tanks\nHolding tanks are an important part of many water and wastewater systems, providing a number of benefits. They can help reduce the volume of wastewater that needs to be treated and discharged, which can reduce the costs associated with wastewater treatment. Additionally, holding tanks can help reduce the amount of contaminants that enter the environment, helping to protect the environment and public health.\nHolding tanks can also help improve the efficiency of water and wastewater systems. By providing a place to store wastewater during periods of peak demand, they can help to reduce the strain on the system, allowing for better use of resources. Additionally, they can be used to provide a reliable source of water supply during drought or other shortages.\nTypes of Holding Tanks\nThere are a variety of different types of holding tanks, designed for different purposes and applications. The most common types include:\nSeptic tanks are large, sealed containers used to store and treat wastewater. They are typically used in residential and small commercial applications and are typically buried underground. Septic tanks are designed to contain wastewater and allow it to be treated and reused.\nStormwater tanks are large, sealed containers used to store stormwater runoff. They are typically used in urban areas to prevent flooding and pollution of local water sources. Stormwater tanks are designed to capture and store stormwater until it can be treated and released.\nStorage tanks are large, sealed containers used to store water for extended periods of time. They are typically used to provide temporary storage for water during periods of peak demand or to supplement a water supply. Storage tanks are designed to store water safely and securely for extended periods of time.\nPumping stations are large, sealed containers used to house pumps. They are typically used in water and wastewater systems to provide lift and pressure to move fluid. Pumping stations are designed to provide reliable pumping services and ensure safe and efficient operation of the system.\nTreatment tanks are large, sealed containers used to store and treat wastewater prior to its discharge into the environment. They are typically used to remove pollutants and contaminants from the wastewater prior to its release. Treatment tanks are designed to reduce the amount of pollutants discharged into the environment.\nHow Do Holding Tanks Work?\nHolding tanks are designed to store wastewater for extended periods of time, allowing for it to be treated and reused. Most holding tanks are designed to be airtight and watertight, preventing the release of contaminants and pollutants into the environment. They can be used to store wastewater during periods of peak demand or to supplement a water supply.\nHolding tanks are typically filled with wastewater from a variety of sources. This wastewater is then stored in the tank until it can be treated or discharged. Depending on the type of tank, the wastewater may be treated with chemicals, filtered, or aerated before it is released.\nMaintenance and Operation\nHolding tanks require regular maintenance and operation in order to ensure that they are functioning properly. This includes checking the tank for leaks, cleaning the tank, and ensuring that the pumps and other equipment are functioning properly. It is important to note that all tanks must be inspected and maintained regularly to ensure that they are operating safely and efficiently.\nIt is important to remember that holding tanks contain wastewater, which can contain harmful bacteria and other contaminants. As such, it is important to take safety precautions when dealing with holding tanks. This includes wearing protective clothing and equipment, such as gloves and goggles, when working with tanks. Additionally, it is important to keep tanks away from areas where children and pets may have access to them.\nFew Frequently Asked Questions\nWhat is a Holding Tank?\nWhat Are the Benefits of a Holding Tank?\nWhat Types of Holding Tanks Are Available?\nHow Is a Holding Tank Installed?\nWhat Are the Maintenance Requirements of a Holding Tank?\nWhat Are Some Common Applications of Holding Tanks?\nEverything You Need to Know About Holding Tanks!\nA holding tank is a necessary component of many wastewater systems. Its purpose is to temporarily store wastewater until it can be safely released into a sewer or septic system. Without a holding tank, wastewater would be sent directly into the environment, potentially contaminating the nearby water supply. By providing a safe and efficient way to store wastewater until it can be treated, a holding tank helps to protect the environment and keep our water sources clean for future generations.","Believe it or not, rainwater harvesting is the third largest water source in Australia after surface and groundwater. In fact, approximately 1 in 4 Australian homeowners have a rainwater collection tank on their property. For the other 3 out of 4 Australians, we ask, “what are you waiting for?”\nIn this complete inspirational guide, we will fully explain the most frequently asked questions regarding rainwater collection. We’ll take a look at the benefits, methods, and components of rainwater harvesting, as well as 3 large-scale rainwater harvesting examples to help inspire your future installation.\nWhat is Rainwater Harvesting?\nDespite sounding complex, rainwater harvesting is much simpler than most people imagine. Rainwater harvesting can be used to refer to any rain collection system on a property that prevents the water from running off. Most commonly, rainwater is collected on a roof and sent to a large storage container for reuse.\nWhy Harvest Rainwater?\nThere are many benefits of harvesting rainwater, some of which are more obvious than others. Today, Aussies typically harvest rainwater for the following reasons:\n- Lowered water bills in the home\n- Smaller ecological footprint\n- Independence from water mains\n- Control over water quality in a home\n- Provide an ongoing source for clean drinking water\n- Easy, automatic garden watering systems\n- Reducing the negative impacts of stormwater in the area\nIn some cases, local government regulations may actually cause rainwater collection to be a necessity, rather than a luxury. This is especially true in some of Australia’s dryer and more arid climates where rainwater collection is entirely necessary to support ongoing water demand in a remote location (looking at you Southern Australia).\nCommon Issues with Rainwater Harvesting\nDespite all of its incredible benefits and potential, there are many issues that arise when installing and operating a rainwater harvesting tank and system in Australia. While conditions and challenges may vary on a case by case basis, the following are some of the most common hurdles for ongoing rainwater harvesting systems:\n- An expensive upfront cost for materials and labor\n- Combating unpredictable or unreliable rain patterns\n- Ongoing upkeep and continuous maintenance\n- Potentially harmful chemicals in roof paint and other existing building components\n- Adhering to local storage limits and property regulations\n- And individual property challenges (i.e. flat roof or limited space for storage)\nMore often than not, it is easy to overcome challenges and install an effective rainwater collection system. For Australians, there are many local and national resources that help connect property owners with local experts and parts manufacturers to help find ideal, custom solutions.\nDifferent Rainwater Harvesting Methods\nAll rain falls from the sky, however, continuous industry innovations have led to many different methods for harvesting rainwater on a property. Below, we will outline some of the most common rainwater harvesting methods used by Australian homes and buildings today.\nRooftop Rainwater Harvesting\nFirst, rooftop rainwater harvesting is one the most popular and easiest methods to adopt for Australian rainwater collection. On most buildings, rooftops can serve as a large collection area where raindrops are able to land and be directed into a large storage container.\nRooftop rainwater harvesting systems are made up of 3 components:\n- the collection area (the roof)\n- a conveyance system (typically gutters)\n- and a separate storage container (large barrels or reservoirs)\nFrom the highly complex to the relatively simple, rooftop rainwater harvesting systems can be installed and optimized by contractors and DIY enthusiasts alike.\nSurface Runoff Rainwater Harvesting\nNext, surface runoff harvesting is another popular method for most collecting rainwater that is especially useful for large properties. Runoff rainwater collection systems are typically much harder to install than rooftop rainwater systems and are usually reserved for professional contractors or new construction properties.\nThe main difference between surface runoff and rooftop rainwater harvesting is the location of the storage. Surface runoff barrels and wells are usually dug deep into the ground at the lowest elevation point on the property. With this, more infrastructure can be added to direct all of the excess rainwater that hits the property into the in-ground storage.\nDue to the increased likelihood of toxic chemicals, surface runoff rainwater harvesting systems are typically only used for irrigation, rather than drinking. It is also necessary to build and install outflow systems so that the water can be easily used on the property nearby.\nAll-in-one Rainwater Collection Barrels\nLastly, there are also many great all-in-one rainwater harvesting systems that are perfect for first-timers, experimenters, and other small-scale applications. If you are not ready to invest in a full property system, it is possible to purchase one of these small all-in-one systems in order to “dip your toes in the [rain]water.”\nAll-in-one rainwater barrels can be placed overhangs or even in full-exposed areas of the property in order to collect the falling resources. Once filled, the barrel’s reserve can then be used for easy irrigation or other non-drinking purposes.\nThe Basic Components of a Rainwater Harvesting System\nAs we’ve mentioned, rooftop rainwater harvesting systems are by and large the most popular and practical for most Australian properties. Knowing this, we will break down the components of a typical rooftop rainwater harvesting system to showcase how easy and effective they are to install and use.\nImage from https://homesteadandchill.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/rainwater-collection-system-schematic.jpg\nFirst, the location of a rainwater harvesting system should be scrutinized prior to installation. To minimize upfront material costs, rooftop rainwater collection systems should be stationed as close to the home as possible. All of the components should also be in a location where it is easy to access, as maintenance may be necessary in order for continued use to be possible.\nThe Catchment / Collection Area\nNext, the catchment (or collection) area is one of the most important features of an effective rainwater collection system. Since the dawn of modern building techniques, sloped roofs of various materials have been installed to whisk water away, which works to the advantage of a rainwater collection system.\nIn short, the larger the roof, the more rainwater it can collect and send into storage. Nearly all roof types are effective, although old roofs with lead-based materials should be replaced or repaired prior to using a rooftop collection system for drinking water in a home.\nConveyance System & Downspout\nAfter hitting the roof, rainwater is then collected in the conveying system and sent through a downspout. Working with gravity, rainwater trickles down the roof and into gutters which are sloped downwards towards the storage container. In most high-quality systems, gutters are covered by a screen to prevent the build-up of dirt and debris.\nScreens & Filters\nThroughout the collection and distribution process, the rainwater is sent through a series of screens and filters to improve water quality and ensure ongoing system operation. Before entering the storage area, water is typically filtered at least twice: once for the big stuff and a second time to weed out bugs and bits of dirt.\nIf you plan on drinking the rainwater that you are collecting, then a whole house water filter is necessary to purify the rain so that it is safe to drink. Although rainwater is typically not very hard, a water softener may also be used within the house to prolong appliance life and minimize damage to tubs, sinks, and more.\nOverflow Protection / First Flush Diversion\nNext, overflow protection is a critical part of any rainwater harvesting system that is often overlooked by first-time experimenters. No matter how large your barrels are, it is often very surprising just how fast your water storage can fill up to capacity during rain storms.\nIn order to prevent damage to the tank and the rest of the system, automatic overflow protection is used to divert excess water capacity from entering the storage unit.\nBeyond this, overflow protection systems are also usually equipped with a first flush diversion to keep water quality high. For those that are unfamiliar, the initial rainwater that runs off a roof is typically much dirtier than the successive flows. With this, smart systems use a “first flush diverter” in order to reject the initial rainwater to save room for cleaner water to be sent to storage.\nAs we’ve alluded to several times, storage is perhaps the most critical component of a rainwater harvesting system. Large tanks can be installed above the ground, below the ground, and even bladder tanks can be used in unused spaces, such as below the deck. Tanks can also be linked together for maximum water storage. Rainwater tanks can be made up of a variety of materials including plastic, wood, metal, and more.\nAlthough there is a lot of wiggle room for creative storage solutions, a few things are necessary to keep stored water safe for use on the property. For one, all plastics should be BPA free. Secondly, containers cannot be clear or see-through, because sunlight may cause stored water to grow algae or other system-damaging lifeforms.\nImage from https://www.texasvox.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Rainwater-Harvesting-Diagram-by-Vanisle-Water.jpg\nSpigots and Outflows\nLastly, your harvested rainwater can only be used with proper spigots and outflows for your water to travel through. Typically, most simple systems have some sort of tap on the exterior of the barrel and room to easily fill a bucket or watering can. Spigots should be installed with some sort of a switch or human control to halt the water from constantly leaking.\nIn full-residential systems, outflows may be triggered simply by the water controls in your kitchen, bathroom, and laundry area. For landscape watering, it is also common to have a system of pipes installed for even distribution of the collected rainwater.\nConsiderations for Rainwater Harvesting Systems\nThe first step to designing a rainwater collection system is evaluating your property’s potential with a full feasibility analysis. In order for a rainwater harvesting system to be effective, the property should receive enough annual rainfall and have ample room for collection and storage. To get started, here are a few things you should determine:\n- Your area’s annual rainfall\n- And your roof’s surface area (potential to collect rainwater)\nBy multiplying your estimated annual rainfall (in mm) with your roof’s surface area (in square mm), you can then calculate your maximum expected rainwater collection in litres. Of course, as we mentioned earlier, annual rainfall collection potential should be lowered slightly to account for first flush diversion and tank overflow.\nOnce you’ve determined your property’s rainwater collection potential, then you can begin to brainstorm the possible uses for your new harvested resource. For small systems, rainwater can be used extremely effectively, even if it never enters the pipes of your home. Simple systems for irrigation and landscape watering can typically be sized to store rainwater all the way through even the driest of dry seasons.\nSecondly, if rainwater harvesting will be used in the home, there are essentially 2 different capacities: limited or potable water. Both limited and potable water systems can dramatically reduce main water consumption and costs in your household, with a few different things to consider.\nLimited rainwater systems – Limited or “grey water” systems can be used in toilets, laundry, hoses, and more. Although it is not made to be safe for drinking, limited rainwater systems are an eco-friendly way to run water-based appliances in your home without having to install over-the-top expensive filters.\nPotable rainwater systems – Potable or “drinking water” systems can be installed so that rainwater can be used in cooking, cleaning, showering, washing food, and more. Although they are more expensive to install upfront, full-home potable rainwater systems allow for a property to be completely “off of the grid.”\nOf course, rainwater harvesting systems cost money to purchase and install. Despite being somewhat expensive upfront, rainwater harvesting is designed to lower costs at home by increasing self-reliance. While most expenses are impossible to avoid, there are also a few things that can be done:\n- Source material and labor from local sources\n- DIY when possible (DIY downspout diverters are one of the easiest)\n- Take advantage of local and national green system incentives and rebates\n- And purchase high-quality components with long system lifetimes\nWhen calculating a “break-even” period it may be hard to approximate rainwater collection and use against mains water costs. While rainwater is completely free, systems may be able to “pay for themselves” for high-water users over a number of years. Beyond this, rainwater collection systems also increase property value, which may provide financial returns when selling a home or building.\nLastly, it is very important to understand that rainwater collection is an ongoing system, rather than a “set it and forget it” home component. Systems must be installed in such a way that all components are easy to access and monitor. Throughout the first few years of a rainwater harvesting system’s lifespan, owners should pay attention to potential system stop-ups and leaks to prevent further, more costly damage from occurring.\nRainwater Harvesting Case Studies\nAlright, before we wrap up, let’s take a look at some real rainwater harvesting case studies from around Australia. Below, we will showcase a few of the most exciting and interactive active rainwater collection systems down under.\nImage source: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Ceres_rainwater_tank_1_Pengo.jpg/1024px-Ceres_rainwater_tank_1_Pengo.jpg\nCERES Community Environment Park in Melbourne\nFirst, Victorian readers may be well aware of the Centre for Education and Research in Environmental Strategies (CERES) Community Environment Park located in Brunswick East, Melbourne. Throughout the 4.5 acres of the urban greenspace, the CERES Environment Park gives visitors the opportunity to participate in or observe a number of sustainable practices including:\n- Beekeeping meetings\n- Community gardens\n- An organic grocery\n- A food nursery\n- A cafe\n- And more\nMost importantly, the CREES Community Environment Park is home to the Urban Water Conservation, Demonstration, and Research Facility which supports many local, sustainable water projects.\nIn the image above, you can see a large rainwater collection barrel that is attached to the gutter systems of multiple park rooves. Scattered around the park, there are many more barrels of various shapes and sizes. Altogether, the collected water is used to aid in the gardens and facilities, typically being cycled back directly to adjacent buildings.\nImage source: https://www.thefifthestate.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Marrickville-Library-Day.jpg\nThe Marrickville Library and Pavilion\nHeaded north to Sydney, the new Marrickville Library and Pavilion has made headlines as one of the best new purposefully-built structures in Australia’s most populated city. Remodeled from an old hospital, the Marrickville Library incorporates many cutting-edge design elements to reduce energy consumption and function independently.\nIn the image above, you can see six large rainwater collection barrels installed on the building’s spacious 1,200m² outdoor pavilions and garden. Here, the recycled water is used primarily to keep the low-maintenance plant features alive and well. Beyond rainwater collection, the Marrickville Library also features:\n- Natural ventilation & raised flooring\n- FSC certified timber and recycled building materials\n- Controlled passive solar design\n- And more\nOpen to the public, the Marrickville Library can now officially be added to any eco-tourism vacation to Sydney.\nImage source: https://www.solarquotes.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/la-trobe-sports-solar.jpg\nLa Trobe University’s Sports Stadium\nLastly, we’d like to head back to Melbourne to feature La Trobe University’s Sports Stadium in the suburb of Bundoora. This massive complex has a “6-star” green energy rating while providing space for an indoor stadium, commercial offices, and educational facilities.\nOn top of the stadium, the roof is the real MVP (most valuable player) for La Trobe University. The school, which has set a goal for carbon neutrality by 2029, has purposefully designed the roof for maximum sustainability. Here are its key features:\n- Sloped and supported by a large rainwater collection system\n- 519 kW of installed solar capacity\n- And white paint to reflect heat\nAlthough this is by far the largest system on the campus, La Trobe University also supports rainwater harvesting in a few smaller instances nearby. The University also plans to expand sustainability features across its regional branch campuses.\nIn conclusion, many Australian properties have the opportunity to reduce monthly costs and increase self-sufficiency with an installed rainwater harvesting system. We hope that this guide has helped clear up some of the most commonly sought after information regarding rainwater collection and has perhaps inspired you to begin your own installation.\nWith rapid adoption across the country, it is now easier than ever to find someone you know that has had their own rainwater harvesting experience to learn about the benefits first-hand.

{"question":"What are common misconceptions about frozen fish quality in seafood industry?","answer":"The belief that frozen fish is of lower quality is incorrect. Fish that is caught, processed, and frozen immediately during transportation can actually be fresher than 'fresh' fish that spent up to 10 days on a boat, was processed at port, and shipped to grocery stores - which could be 10-14 days old by the time it reaches consumers.","context":["by Lindsay Abrams, News Deeply\nTo feed a growing population, sustainable seafood advocate Ned Bell is encouraging fellow chefs and seafood consumers to look beyond ‘fresh’ and ‘wild.’\nNed Bell has no shortage of opinions about seafood. He grew up fishing Pacific salmon off the west coast of Canada and now evangelizes for the future of fish as the founder of Chefs for Oceans and the executive chef at Ocean Wise, a nonprofit organization based at the Vancouver Aquarium that develops criteria for sustainable seafood and lends its logo to vendors and restaurants that meet its standards.\nBell has worked in the tradition of activist chefs who aim to change minds by first filling stomachs. “I have to focus on what is within my wheelhouse,” he told Oceans Deeply, after meeting at the recent Sustainable Brands Vancouver Conference. “I feed people.” He means that literally, but sees his cookbooks, videos and other attempts at public engagement, such as appearances on various TV cooking shows, as another form of “feeding” us – in this case, inspiration for a more sustainable future.\n“I joke, if I put something tasty in your belly, you’re going to like me, and if you like me, you’re going to listen to my message,” Bell said. “I want to make sure that when I’m sharing a message, that it comes from a place of fact and experience, not just opinion.”\nBell spoke to Oceans Deeply about the travel and conversations that led him to embrace the seafood we’ve been conditioned to suspect – farmed fish and frozen fish chief among them – and how he hopes to change the global conversation around sustainable eating one plate at a time.\nOceans Deeply: Can you share some of your thinking in terms of what brought you around to seeing aquaculture as a good, sustainable option?\nNed Bell: Aquaculture is the future. Was it a come-around? Yes, absolutely. I grew up on Vancouver Island, where fish farming was a four-letter word. But that’s just because we didn’t know better. It’s just because we listened to the rhetoric, we listened to the environmental crusaders, we listened to the headline news and unfortunately we didn’t spend enough time with the fish farmers ourselves, challenging them to dive into technology and improve what they were doing and where they were doing it. And underneath our noses, they have been doing that.\nIs aquaculture perfect? Absolutely not. But we don’t eat wild animals. Most of us eat animals that we raise for our consumption. Most people don’t even know what they’re eating half the time, let alone whether it’s farmed or wild. They just see fresh fish and they think, “Oh, it must be good.”\nOceans Deeply: As a chef, how do you think about working to change that narrative?\nBell: I think if I could choose one thing that I’m going to focus on in the next decade, it’s to educate my peers. It’s not about promoting the next cool, really popular, unsung hero seafood. No. It’s about getting them to appreciate what responsible aquaculture means, and how to celebrate it. Feeding an ever-growing population needs to be something we’re focused on, and also getting clean, healthy protein in the mouths of people.\nFarmed fish is scary for many people, so they just end up staying away. Unless it says “wild,” they for some reason forget that wild fish can also be unsustainable Certainly if it says “frozen,” there’s, “Oh, my gosh, there’s no way that frozen fish can be of high quality.” This means it’s old. Well, that couldn’t be further from the truth. Fish caught, processed and then frozen immediately during its transportation, when you take it home and thaw it under cold water, is going to be way fresher than a fish that lived on the boat for up to 10 days, got to the port, got processed and then was shipped on to your grocery store and could be upwards of 10 to 14 days old by the time you bring it home. No wonder the fish you grew up eating tasted fishy, because it was.\nOceans Deeply: When you say “responsible aquaculture,” what does that look like?\nBell: From my perspective as the Ocean Wise executive chef, the fish that we deem responsible meet our criteria. We have a number of criteria that we base on science, the where and how of raising fish, so whether it’s closed containment, land-based, what they’re eating or what type of fish is being grown.\nI feel as though we’re only a few steps, and maybe a few technological improvements away from having most farmed fish be pretty darn “sustainable.” We’re going to fix the feed problem. We’re going to fix the siting of farms – where they are. We’re going to fix the species problem – what we’re growing. We get good at things if people are willing to support that journey. I’m literally having for lunch today some wild Pacific albacore that I torched last night at home. Aren’t I lucky to be able to eat that for lunch? Yeah. But if it was land-based coho salmon grown a couple hours from here, that would be amazing. If it was a species grown in net pens somewhere where I knew that it wasn’t having impact on the other Pacific species of fish or an ecosystem, I would support that.\nOceans Deeply: If we don’t think a lot about where the seafood comes from, we probably think even less about whom it’s coming from. What did your visit to Vietnam teach you about that aspect of sustainability?\nBell: We import 80 percent of the seafood we consume in North America. Why is that? Well, because it’s cheaper. By far, the most consumed seafood in North America is shrimp. So I wanted to go to Vietnam to go see the good, the bad and the opportunity of the shrimp farming industry in a country where we import a lot of those shrimp into my country.\nWhenever I go to a place where an industry has an impact on the community, I’m always amazed when you peel back the layers. When I went to Vietnam, I definitely saw some bad. I saw some of the low-end of the shrimp farming industry and the commodity shrimp farming production of large-scale, cheap product for some retailers and/or restaurant groups in North America that need inexpensive product. But then I also saw some really great sustainable stories that really focused on the family and the community. One of the farmers said, “You know, I live on top of a gold mine. All I have to do is take care of these organic black tiger shrimp, and they sustain me, my family and my community four, five, six times a year,” depending on his crop.\nSo here’s a guy who directly understood that the environment and the ecosystem that he is nurturing is giving him his livelihood, and I think we forget that when we’re all the way back across the ocean in North America, going to our local premium grocery store and buying an organic black tiger shrimp. We forget that by choosing sustainable, by choosing Ocean Wise-recommended, or by choosing Seafood Watch green, whatever the equivalent is depending on where you live, you are having an impact on a community, or fisher folk or a family.\nOceans Deeply: When you talk about clean, healthy food, does that mean you see that as something that can come out of aquaculture as well?\nBy being welcomed into the conversation, they’re going to share with me almost everything I need to know to make my own mind up. Of course, they might skew it slightly. You never know the full truth of everything, but I’ve spent 10 years now of my life in this space of healthy lakes, oceans and rivers and sustainability, and I’ve just started to feel confident enough to start championing the good stories that are out there.\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. This story was produced as a result of a partnership with the Sustainable Brands Conference.\nBell: Yes. And I’m not saying that all aquaculture is good. We have work to do. But I know that I will have a larger impact on the industry by working with them as opposed to working against them."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fcb3e767-5203-44d7-ac6d-f54555e009b2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What factors contributed to Husain's commercial success compared to other Indian artists of his time?","answer":"Husain's commercial success was driven by several factors. He had a unique working method that allowed him to produce art at a much faster rate - while other artists like Ganesh Pyne would do 10 paintings a year, Husain could do 10,000 thanks to his signboard painter's skills. Additionally, he was essentially a 'state artist' in Nehruvian India, serving as a cultural ambassador similar to Pandit Ravi Shankar. His work was featured in prominent locations like Delhi's North Block, and he was part of official delegations, such as the one sent to draw soldiers during the 1965 war against Pakistan. This high profile and immense visibility contributed significantly to his market success.","context":["Playing to the gallery: Collectors trace the Husain phenomenon\nThe art world is about big money. As MF Husain’s centenary celebrations draws to a close, collectors trace Husain phenomenon.Updated: Jul 04, 2016, 12:14 IST\nMaqbool Fida Husain walked into Pundole’s one day while Kali Pundole, the gallery owner, was up on a ladder trying to fix his lights.\nAnd they struck up a conversation that Kali’s son, Dadiba, has been continuing for more than 60 years. “What set Husain apart from other artists of his time was a huge appetite for risk,” says Dadiba, who, since 2014, has also been running an auction-house, in addition to the art gallery.\n“Gaitonde and Tyeb Mehta were contemplative, the painting stayed in their heads for a long time before it manifested itself onto a canvas. Husain had a slightly different working method. He sketched incessantly with his characteristic strong lines. His thoughts poured out onto whatever medium he had closest to him,” adds Pundole’s auctioneer Mallika Advani.\nIf the ’80s was the age of marriage between India’s artists and their collectors, it was the ’50s when they began their roaring affair. Their relationship was informal. Contracts were signed but rarely imposed. Works of art were bought and often paid for over long installments.\nWatch |M F Husain: A look at the maverick artist’s career\nIn Bombay, the work of the Progressive Artists’ Group, (PAG was influenced by the Calcutta Group, the first modern art collective of India), consisting of ‘local boys’ Francis Newton Souza, Syed Haider Raza and MF Husain were put up on the walls of local libraries and restaurants.\nThe art salons, patronised by emigre European collectors who had stayed on in India either by choice, or because they had been caught unawares by World War II, built the art milieu that would go on to develop India’s first art networks. It was this ecosystem that would help sustain the man who was the first Indian artist keen to study the art-market at a time when the other leading lights of the PAG, Souza and Raza, had left for Europe.\n“In a large nation like India, once you click in an art market set for globalisation, you need to produce paintings in number and that may eventually lead to repitition,” points out senior artist Ashok Bhowmick, who has written a book on the Husain phenomenon. “For example, Ganesh Pyne would do 10 paintings a year. Husain could do 10,000. He had the signboard painter’s skill to work fast.” Commercial galleries such as Pundole’s and Chemould opened in Bombay in 1963. In Delhi, Kumar Gallery, believed to have presented Husain’s first solo show, opened its doors in 1955.\nHusain’s rise runs on the tracks of a post-independent nation. In a Nehruvian India, he was a cultural ambassador as much as sitarist Pandit Ravi Shankar. Almost a ‘state artist’, Husain’s reach and visibility were naturally immense. He was part of an artist delegation to draw soldiers fighting the 1965 war against Pakistan.\nHe was one of the first painters to have his work hung in Delhi’s North Block. With such a profile, if he said he was “no less than Picasso” you had better believe it.\n“What he meant when he said that was, that for Indian modern art, his role would be as great,” explains Virendra Kumar, owner of Kumar’s Gallery in Sundernagar, Delhi, and one of his first collectors.\nGallerists could certainly claim to know the artist’s mind. They were privy to artists’ personal lives, their momentary or permanent obsessions. They had to be. They were the artists’ partners in ‘aesthetics’ and their patrons as well. Kumar self-consciously holds up a pink telegram from Husain (‘“Jaisalmer a masterpiece of textual essay in yellow and sand. Send me by wire 400 Rs at the PWD Dak bungalow”) from the early ’60s for funds to stay on in Rajasthan to paint. Such requests were common and were not included in the final price of a painting, says Kumar, who paid Husain Rs 1,800 / month for three medium-sized paintings in the ’50s.\n“These were stipends to get the artist by, irrespective of sales,” he adds. By the ’90s, when a medium-sized Husain had reached Rs 3 lakh, Kumar would be paying the artist Rs 2 lakh after deducting the gallery’s commission.\nNot everything was for sale though. Husain painted a family portrait of Anil Relia, an Ahmedabad collector, in the 19th century style, a period which he collects, as a gift. “He told me ‘your wife is the nucleus of your family so her portrait must be the most prominent. He placed her on a bench in our garden. He made me sit on the ground, my son next to me and my daughter behind her mother. So, us four plus the family parrot.” One of Relia’s prized paintings is the one he bought from Husain’s biographical series in Renu Modi’s gallery. “It is of Husain on a cycle.”\nDelhi’s Arun Vadehra, who introduced the concept of ‘buying art’ rather than pay the artist stipends, thus making a bigger financial commitment to the artist in the 80s, says Husain’s presence in his life was about sudden entries and departures. “He would announce his arrival in the gallery by asking for a canvas, paints, a brush, and we always had them ready…if he wanted to sleep, he did, on the leather sofa in my office…he would call me from London or New York and ask me to come over as if he was in Greater Kailash.”\nThe give and take between the artist and most of his collectors remained cordial, despite the transactional nature of the relationship. Both needed the other. Badrivisal Pittie, a cultural impresario of Hyderabad and scion of a prominent business family (his collection of Husains fetches top hammer price at most auctions for belonging to the artist’s best period, the ’50s) sponsored Husain’s first trip abroad. It was during a stay in his house that Husain would paint his famous Ramayana series. He is also said to have painted on every surface available – from table-tops, to matchboxes to the family Fiat car, which he plastered with his iconic horses.\nAre horses still the top Husain motifs that Husain buyers want? Renu Modi of Gallery Espace, another post-’80s Delhi gallery with a prominent Husain collection, says serious collectors would want his early period. “But there are buyers of all kinds,” she admits. “Some want horses, some don’t want horses, some want only horses….”\nDid Husain himself privilege his horses over his elephants, his oil paintings over his acrylics, his reds over his browns, his ’50s over his ’90s, his Ganesha over his much-maligned Sita? Perhaps these are academic questions. “One of the things Husain told me -- a painting is to be seen, not read. You can see whatever you want in it, but that is not his painting,” says Vadehra.\nThe controversies around Husain’s art coincided with the rise of rightwing forces in India in the ’90s. Nudes, an established tradition in Indian art, were identified in his paintings as Hindu goddesses. In a Guardian interview, Husain had said “3,000 cases” had been slapped on him between 2000-2008. In 2008, the Delhi High Court quashed five of them; the others have apparently remained. “He was made controversial,” says Pundole. “We just don’t know how to see a painting.”\nA re-evaluation of Husain as his centenary celebrations draw to a close, says Bhowmick, however, cannot just be about Husain. “KCS Panicker’s Progressive Painters Association (1944) in Madras, the Progressive Artists’ Association (1948) in Kashmir and The Delhi Silpi Chakra (1949) were other important collectives of the time…. But there’s no denying that because of Husain, Indian artists have a market.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f03c3dcb-2ba0-4b63-8684-cf176a603891>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How will the new mandatory automatic enrollment in retirement plans work from 2025?","answer":"Starting after December 31, 2024, all new 401(k) and 403(b) plans will be required to automatically enroll participants once they become eligible. While employees will have the option to opt out of coverage, this automatic enrollment feature will become mandatory for new retirement plans.","context":["The passing of SECURE Act 2.0 marks the second piece of major retirement plan legislation in three years.\nSECURE Act 2.0 provides incremental improvement to retirement savings. As the industry strives to expand coverage and build on the success of automatic features, there is much to like in this law.\n|#1||Automatic enrollment mandatory for all new plans.|\n|Opportunity||Ask plan clients and prospects, how well is your plan taking advantage of auto enrollment? Help sponsors understand their plan may be at a competitive disadvantage by not using auto enrollment.|\n|Provision||Section 101 requires 401(k) and 403(b) plans for plan years beginning after December 31, 2024, to automatically enroll participants once they are eligible (employees may opt out of coverage).|\n|#2||Startup credits — 100% of administrative costs.|\n|Opportunity||With state-level mandates to offer workplace retirement savings impacting small businesses in more than a dozen states (including heavily populated California, New York, and Illinois), now is the time to be up to date on the rules in the states where you do business. Armed with that knowledge, ask small businesses in states with mandates, “how do you plan to follow your state’s requirement to offer a retirement plan?” Creating relationships with small-business owners may lead to additional wealth management opportunities. This provision creates a sense of urgency and offers advisors the chance to help small businesses create new plans at no cost (subject to qualifications).|\n|Provision||Section 102 offers a three-year small-business startup credit that is currently 50% of administrative costs, up to an annual cap of $5,000. For 2023 and beyond, Section 102 increases the startup credit from 50% to 100% for employers with up to 50 employees. The provision is effective beginning in tax year 2023.|\n|#3||403(b)s can join MEPs and PEPs|\n|Opportunity||Did you know your clients may be serving on boards of organizations that offer 403(b)s? Find out by using networking tools like LinkedIn. Then, ask your client how the plan sponsor wants to take advantage of the new group plan opportunity. At minimum, you have the chance to provide education on this new opportunity while investigating how happy the sponsor is with their current RPS. For RPSs who also focus on wealth business or wealth referrals, explaining this new provision to the sponsor’s board may lead to wealth referral opportunities.|\n|Provision||Effective in tax year 2023, Section 106 allows 403(b) plans, which are generally sponsored by charities, educational institutions, and nonprofits, to participate in MEPs and PEPs.|\n|#4||Employer matching for student loan repayment|\n|Opportunity||Given the prevalence of student loan debt held by workers who are simultaneously battling inflation, this provision may prove popular with both workers and employers. Help employers understand that money contributed toward student loan payments will be treated the same as employee payroll savings contributions for match calculation purposes beginning with plan year 2024.|\n|Provision||Section 110 allows employees with student debt to receive employer matching contributions by using student loan repayment as a qualification for company matching contributions. Section 110 is effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 2023.|\n|#5||Financial incentives for employee participation|\n|Opportunity||With current plan clients or prospects, this provision provides an opportunity to target plans with less-than-desired participation rates. Whether for group education or to encourage a one-on-one coaching session, consider ways your plan sponsors can use this new rule.|\n|Provision||Section 113, effective immediately, enables employers to offer de minimis financial incentives not paid for with plan assets, such as low-dollar gift cards, to boost employee participation in workplace retirement plans.|\n|#6||Starter 401(k) plans/safe harbor 403(b)s|\n|Opportunity||Combined with the plan startup credit (Section 102), this provision provides an opportunity to meet with employers who do not have a plan. Explaining this “on ramp” to the power of workplace savings may help RPSs to develop business owner relationships. Examining your book for small business owners/decision makers who do not yet offer a plan is a good place to start.|\n|Provision||Section 121 permits an employer that does not sponsor a retirement plan to offer a Starter 401(k) plan (or safe harbor 403(b) plan). These plans generally require that all employees be default enrolled in the plan at a deferral rate of 3%–15% of compensation. This provision is effective beginning with the 2024 plan year.|\n|#7||Participant purchases of QLACs|\n|Opportunity||Although this provision is a participant-level provision and goes into effect without action from the sponsor, RPSs can use this item to start a retirement income conversation. This discussion could allow RPSs to examine how the sponsor defines “success” for their plan, and to ensure the definition of success is based on outcomes.|\n|Provision||Section 202 allows up to $200,000 (indexed) to be used from a participant account balance to purchase a QLAC. Section 202 is effective for contracts purchased or received in an exchange on the date of enactment of this Act, and the Treasury Secretary must update the relevant regulations within 18 months of the date of enactment of this Act.|\nAs you continue to improve your retirement plan practice in the new year and beyond, your Putnam Defined Contribution team is ready to partner with you.\nAs an example of our commitment to partnership, use our PlanVisualizer™ tool as a resource to see how various SECURE Act 2.0 provisions may impact employer-level plan matching costs.\nFor informational purposes only.

{"question":"What are the key changes in how market economies are evaluated following the 2008 financial crisis?","answer":"After the 2008 crisis, there was a significant shift in evaluating market economies. The crisis revealed that the framework had underplayed the importance of economic and societal resilience. Issues like banking panics and volatility in asset, food, and energy prices were recognized as factors that could undermine support for market economies. The new evaluation framework emphasizes that modern markets rely on efficient state institutions, and that market and state complement rather than substitute each other. Additionally, the importance of governance and institutions, which proved fragile during the crisis, gained more attention. The new approach focuses on building not just competitive markets, but also well-governed and inclusive ones to prevent transition reversals.","context":["The EBRD’s new broader transition concept argues that a well-functioning market economy should be more than just a set of markets; it should be competitive, inclusive, well-governed, environmentally friendly, resilient and integrated.\nHere Hans-Peter Lankes and Sergei Guriev explain how we design and evaluate our investments and technical assistance projects.\nWhy do we have a transition concept?\nBecause we need to know what our objectives are when we invest or provide advice. Article 1 of the Agreement Establishing the Bank (AEB) spelled out that “the purpose of the EBRD shall be to foster the transition towards open market-oriented economies and to promote private and entrepreneurial initiative”. This defined the purpose of the EBRD in terms unlike the charters of conventional development institutions. The EBRD was to foster a change in economic systems – i.e., the way economic decisions are made - rather than directly pursuing development outcomes. What exactly constituted a “market-oriented economy” was not specifically defined, and so developing a shared understanding of it was an important task early in the EBRD’s life.\nWhat lay behind the way transition was formulated in 1997?\nThough employed since 1994 for the qualitative assessment of projects, the transition concept was ‘formalised’ only in 1997 in a paper by the Chief Economist. It set out three dimensions for measuring transition impact. One was the creation, expansion and deepening of markets. The second was the establishment and strengthening of institutions, laws and policies that support the market (including private ownership). The third was the adoption of behaviour patterns and skills that have a market perspective.\nThe paper also set out the “transition impact checklist,” describing seven key areas of potential transition impact of projects within these three dimensions, now familiar to all our bankers. The checklist allowed the EBRD to assess the relative merits of a project.\nHow did the review process now reaching completion come about?\nThe 1997 transition concept was a pragmatic, effective response to the EBRD’s project selection challenge - robust but also accommodating evolution, while sticking with the systemic, means-oriented perspective that is at its heart. The aim of the review we are now completing was to bring what we have learned since 1997 formally into our definition of transition.\nThere has been a global evolution over the past quarter century in defining a successful market economy.That includes the importance we now attach to sustainable energy, the key role of governance and institutions which proved fragile in the 2008 crisis, and the growing understanding of the need for markets to provide opportunities for women and disadvantaged groups.\nWhat is the outcome?\nThe 2016 concept refines the notion of transition formulated in 1997, when all of the EBRD’s countries of operations were emerging from communism and faced a similar set of challenges on their way to capitalism. Now the basic components of market economies are in place, our countries are more diverse—some never had command economies—and they need different sets of reforms. The 2016 concept puts the emphasis on the desirable qualities of market economies in our region, in a language that is more accessible and easier to communicate than the transition checklist.\nDoes the new transition concept represent the need for a new balance between market and state?\nYes, one of the key lessons of the past 25 years is that transition is not only about building markets, but also about redesigning the state. Modern markets rely on efficient state institutions. Market and state are not substitutes, they complement each other. Therefore in order to build a market economy we should not minimise the state; instead, we should improve the quality of both state and market institutions. This new “complements rather than substitutes” view has direct implications for the EBRD’s work – as we enhance our policy dialogue activities to complement our investments.\nWhat changes with our new transition qualities?\nBy consensus, Article 1 remains at the heart of our mandate. But while the 1997 concept stressed the components or structure of a market economy, we are now shifting towards the desirable qualities of a market economy. This emphasis remains compatible with a focus on systemic change. But it also implies that fostering a market economy should not be separated from the intended outcomes. The six qualities identified foster and support sustainable market economies, which continues to be our overarching aim.\nHere we understand sustainability far broader than environmental sustainability only (although the latter obviously remains our priority). We have in mind sustainability of capitalist and democratic institutions mentioned in Article 1. During the twenty five years of transition we have seen many examples of transition setbacks. Whenever the benefits of the reforms were not shared broadly, transition was not perceived as fair by the majority of citizens so that reforms were stalled or reversed.\nIn order to avoid the risks of reversals, we need assure that our works contributes to building not just a competitive, but also a well-governed and inclusive market economy. Inclusion makes sure that reforms deliver to underprivileged groups (including – but not limited to – women and youth). Governance is crucial for rewarding talent and hard work rather than rent-seeking – and prevents creating crony capitalist institutions. Both governance and inclusion are vital for the continued popular support of the reforms.\nThe crisis of 2008 brought home clearly that our framework had underplayed the role of resilience of economies and societies. Banking panics, volatility of asset prices – as well as of food and energy prices – also undermine the support for market economy. This is why we believe that our work promoting resilience of financial systems, food security and energy security should be taken into account when we assess transition impact of our projects.\nWe also believe that markets economies must be integrated. Internal and cross-border connectivity and integration of markets promotes competitiveness and resilience; thus, integration could be considered as a tool to achieve other qualities. However, given the rising populist backlash against globalisation, we include integration as a separate quality of a sustainable economy as we want to indicate that for EBRD integration is especially important.\nThe environmental considerations set out as part of the EBRD’s operations from the start have also come under closer scrutiny as the world moves to tackle green issues. Their link to our transition concept was not straightforward since they could not purely be measured by price signals. Projects that targeted effluent reduction, for instance, such as those aimed at improving water quality in the Baltic Sea, used to receive low transition impact score. When the climate change agenda gained traction and the EBRD launched its Sustainable Energy Initiative in 2006 the transition concept evolved too. The solution, agreed in 2009, was to define investments in sustainable energy and associated subsidies as process decisions that compensated for inadequate price signals. Now, we go further, explicitly adding environmental sustainability to the list of desirable qualities of the market economy.\nFinally, there is the question of country specificity. Twenty-five years ago, all our countries of operation faced similar challenges. Now, some of them have almost closed the gap with the West, while other still have many economic and political transformations to complete. Also, while transition still has a clear direction, it may not have a single end-point, as highlighted by institutional diversity across advanced market economies. Finally, the EBRD has expanded into countries which have never had a command economy and therefore their transformation is to proceed along a very different path. Therefore the original one-size-fits-all approach to transition impact assessment does not work anymore. In order to apply the new transition concept, we need to run a “country diagnostic” in terms of the six qualities listed above and determine priorities – which may be different in each country."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:46b9f1f8-248b-44b5-9ffc-eff66212bc95>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do sustainable intensification and SRI compare in their approaches to soil management?","answer":"Both systems prioritize soil health but use different methods. Sustainable intensification through conservation agriculture focuses on not tilling the soil, leaving crop residues in place, and using mulches and cover crops to improve soil biology. SRI emphasizes maintaining moist, aerobic soil conditions instead of flooding, which allows for better root development and the use of organic compost rather than chemical fertilizers. Both approaches aim to enhance soil quality while increasing productivity.","context":["By Simon Ross, IWCAN\nIn an interview, Prof. Quentin Grafton, an economist from the Australian National University, referred to the Risks and Options Assessment for Decision-Making (ROAD) process used in the Eastern Gangetic Plains (EGP), which covers Bangladesh, India, and Nepal. The aim was to establish participatory processes for addressing food and water security in light of the risks associated with climate change in the context of a complex array of decisions about how to develop farming systems.\nThis article aims to clarify the ‘sustainable intensification’ concept that Quentin refers to and what that means for measuring the effectiveness of efforts to address food and water security in light of the risks associated with climate change, water scarcity and soil degradation in that context.\nFood systems are inherently complex and the options for their management are becoming increasingly diverse and subject to debate. There are however undeniable trends: world population is increasing, becoming richer, and demanding a more resource-intensive diet. There is an increasing burden on the natural base of land and water resources, which are becoming more unpredictable due to the impacts of climate change.\nTo get more food, or to cope with climate-induced stresses on food production, either the area of cultivation needs to increase or unit productivity must increase, or both. Sustainable intensification (SI) aims to obtain vastly higher yields, from 60 to120%, with no additional ecological impact, using only existing cultivated land and leaving the rest to support and maintain other ecosystem functions. This concept recognises the value ecosystem services from resources such as forests that can complement agriculture and provide other environmental and economic benefits such as improving water resources and improving soil quality provides, which will be required to ensure sufficient agricultural production to achieve food security for 9 billion people in 2050.\nHow this aspirational goal will be achieved is strongly based on the context, the values and the vision of each proponent. In many cases, solutions can appear to be incompatible. For example, SI has been interpreted by some in the farming industry and other interest groups as meaning high-input, high-output Western or modern of agricultural production and highly technical precision systems. Other interest groups may look at SI as highly diversified smallholder led knowledge-based systems with multiple local-scale, primarily organic, inputs and increased local participation in value chains.\nThere are also diverse views about the energy inputs into farming systems, with some optimistic about new efficient machinery to eliminate ‘drudgery’, with others associated more labour-intensive approached with local economic benefits. There is clearly a range of permutations in between these two views.\nWhat this demonstrates is the Sustainable Intensification is the destination but not the journey. In a complex world with a growing population, improved productivity through the more effective use of inputs and a reduction of undesirable outputs intensifies food production, which is essential to achieve sustainability. This is true regardless viewpoint farmers have on sustainable intensification, whether it is climate-smart agriculture, agroecology, eco-efficiency, permaculture, technological optimism, organic production systems or something else.\nThe Sustainable and Resilient Farming Systems Initiative and its application in the Eastern Gangetic Plains\nThis leads us back to practical application Quentin’s work in the EGP on a project to look at an inclusive framework of the Sustainable and Resilient Farming Systems Initiative (SRFSI). The EGP is home to 300 million people, with a high concentration of poverty and a strong dependence on agriculture and natural resources. There is great potential to address food security here but strong limitations related to productivity, diversification from rice and wheat crops, access to markets, knowledge and education, water resources and labour.\nFarmers are in the EGP are provided with training in conservation agriculture (CA) practices, which is an approach that prioritises soil conservation, reduced water consumption, and economic productivity as the most important strategies for sustainable intensification.\nThe info-graphic above provides gives more context, however, the three main strategies of this approach are:\n- not tilling or ploughing the soil so it is not disturbed or eroded;\n- leaving crop residues where they are and using mulches and leguminous cover crops to retain moisture, improve soil biology, and control weeds; and\n- using crop rotation and diversification, again to reduce the spread of pests and diseases and build soil infrastructure.\nOne pragmatic approach taken by CA is the use of machinery and limited use of herbicides and herbicide-resistant seeds and crops as a trade-off for soil conservation and productivity.\nIs it working?\nQuentin’s project, which is underway, aims to find out whether these SI practices can provide the basis for improved smallholder productivity and resilience to climate change, and whether this type of framework can develop local institutions that allow women and men to continue to innovate and adapt to the significant challenges this region faces.\nQuentin clarified his expectations around this. The project is on track, but in terms of the bigger picture;\n“You can’t track change over short periods of time; you are talking about over 300 million people; you are talking about transformational change. For complex problems, you are merely leading to a better set of outcomes that you would have otherwise not been able to achieve. This is a real-world incremental improvement approach.”Quentin Grafton, Australian National University\nAlmost 200 hectares of agricultural land is now covered by conservation agriculture-based sustainable intensification and institutionally strong interest has been generated. On another level, as many conservation agriculture mechanisation approaches such as direct seeding machines are reported to take away some the ‘drudgery’ of some farming roles and women are reportedly finding more attractive avenues to be involved in an agricultural economy.\nIf you wish to follow further progress on the project you can find more details the ACIAR article, ‘Sustainable and resilient farming systems intensification in the Eastern Gangetic Plains (SRFSI),’ or the CGIAR article ‘Transforming food systems in the Eastern Gangetic Plains.’","In late June, a few colleagues and I traveled to St. Paul, Minnesota for the National Cooperative Grocers Association (NCGA) Grocery and Wellness conference. As a newbie to the annual conference, I learned about the history of the NCGA and the importance of each Co-op in this network. As it turns out, Willy Street Co-op is among 120 independently operated stores that make up the NCGA. Formed in 2004 by eight separate regional Cooperative Grocers Associations, the NCGA has allowed co-op member stores nationwide to pool their buying power in order to better compete with chain stores and offer great value to our Owners. NCGA has the second largest volume of organic and natural foods sales in the nation, which means the brands and products we offer and you support have the potential to change the local and global food system one purchase at a time. One significant and inspirational change in the global food system is a new way to farm rice called the “System of Rice Intensification” (SRI).\nAt the NCGA conference, I took the opportunity to attend a workshop put on by Lotus Foods, a California based importer of SRI, heirloom, organic and fair trade rice. The whole premise of the workshop wasn’t to sell rice but to educate key decision makers in the organic and natural foods industry about an innovative and more sustainable method of cultivating rice. In short, the techniques of SRI farming require less seed and water, all the while producing better working conditions, higher yields, stronger food security, healthier communities, sustainability and biodiversity. The use and success of SRI is so important because rice is the major source of calories for at least half of the world’s population, and in many cases rice cultivating is the only source of income for rural communities. Major global organizations such as Africare, Oxfam and the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) have separately adopted the strategy of SRI in over 40 countries around the world because of the contributions to food security, farmers’ adaptability to climate change and environmental sustainability.\nSo what makes SRI cultivation so much more sustainable than conventional cultivation methods?\n- Age of Seeds: SRI seedlings are transplanted at 1-2 weeks old while conventional seedlings are 3-4 weeks old when transplanted. A two-week head start in the growing season is a significant advantage for any farmer, especially with changing growing seasons.\n- Number of Seeds: SRI calls for 1-2 seedlings per planting in damp soil while a half dozen or more conventional seedlings are bunched together and pressed deep into flooded soil. The moist and aerobic soil allows the few SRI seedlings to develop a root system multiple times bigger than the flooded conventional roots that are restricted from air.\n- Spacing of plants: SRI allows about one foot between plantings which is double the conventional spacing standards. The spacing is a key component for allowing the plants room to grow and enable farmers to access rows with manual weeding tools. Additional space is also needed because the SRI plants will double the size of conventional harvest despite the smaller number of plants.\n- Water Use: SRI uses just enough water to keep soil moist, which reduces water needs significantly compared to the constant flooding of conventional fields. Climate change is reducing the amount of fresh water, so plants that require less water are more sustainable.\n- Soil and Environmental Quality: Without the need for flooding, farmers can fertilize SRI via the soil with organic compost instead of being dependent on chemical fertilizers via the water. The reduction in chemical use also contributes to better air, water and soil quality. All of the rice from Lotus Foods are certified organic or certified in transition to being organic.\n- Weed & Pest Control: Integrated Pest Management is encouraged, but the majority of weeding is performed manually with specialty weeders. The SRI varieties of rice are also naturally more resistant to pests and disease. Again, chemical applications are mostly eliminated unless absolutely necessary for crops that are not certified organic.\nOn the first page of the NCGA conference logistics packet was the intended meeting outcomes and the first one was, “be inspired,” and I was. Honestly, it took a couple of days for the significance of SRI to sink in, but the more I thought about it, the more convinced I was that we need to offer more of these heirloom, organic and fairly traded rices at Willy Street Co-op. Next time you’re in the store and looking for some rice, I recommend you try one of the great Lotus Foods SRI rices in our bulk aisle. The sum of our purchases will make a world of difference.\nWe offer three varieties to choose from:\n- Volcano Rice: A colorful blend of prized traditional brown and red rice, grown on West Java’s mineral rich volcanic soil. Aromatic and nutrient-dense, Volcano Rice cooks in only 30 minutes, producing moist and tender grains.\n- Madagascar Pink Rice: A long grain rice lightly milled to retain 66% of its wholesome bran layer. With aromas of cinnamon and cloves, it cooks in only 20 minutes and is a great alternative to basmati.\n- Mekong Flower Rice: This popular Cambodian jasmine rice is called Phka Malis, which means jasmine flowers. It has a lovely floral aroma, soft sticky texture and cooks in 30 minutes."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1b7ff54d-d471-4183-9944-2c7186581a0b>","<urn:uuid:4d516d64-f600-4c03-9c16-c85fc7bb823f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do apprentice carpenters learn their trade skills, and what are the safety inspection requirements for scaffold structures?","answer":"Apprentice carpenters learn by working with experienced coworkers, starting with simple tasks like measuring and cutting wood, then progressing to complex tasks like blueprint reading. They must complete technical training and paid on-the-job training through sponsored apprenticeship programs. Regarding scaffold safety inspections, OSHA requires that a competent person must inspect scaffolds before each workshift and after any event that could affect the structure. This competent person must be trained in scaffold safety and must also supervise whenever a scaffold is assembled, changed, moved, or dismantled.","context":["How to Become a Carpenter\nApprentice carpenters learn by working with more experienced coworkers.\nCarpenters typically need a high school diploma and learn on the job or through apprenticeships.\nA high school diploma or equivalent is typically required to enter the occupation. Certain high school courses, such as mathematics and mechanical drawing, may be useful. Some vocational-technical schools offer associate’s degrees in carpentry. The programs vary in length and teach basics and specialties in carpentry.\nCarpenters typically learn on the job or through apprenticeships. They often begin doing simple tasks, such as measuring and cutting wood, under the guidance of experienced carpenters or other construction workers. They then progress to more complex tasks, such as reading blueprints and building wooden structures.\nSeveral groups, such as unions and contractor associations, sponsor apprenticeship programs. For each year of a typical program, apprentices must complete a predetermined number of hours of technical training and paid on-the-job training. Apprenticeship program requirements differ based on the type of program and by region. Apprentices learn carpentry basics, blueprint reading, mathematics, building code requirements, and safety and first aid practices. They also may receive specialized training in creating and setting concrete forms, rigging, welding, scaffold building, and working within confined workspaces. All carpenters must pass the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 10-hour safety course.\nWork Experience in a Related Occupation\nSome carpenters work as construction laborers or helpers before becoming carpenters. Laborers and helpers learn tasks that are similar to those of carpenters.\nLicenses, Certifications, and Registrations\nCarpenters may need a driver’s license to travel to jobsites.\nOptional programs offer certification by specialty that may allow carpenters to find additional work opportunities or lead to career advancement. For example, the National Association of the Remodeling Industry offers various levels of certification for remodeling. The National Wood Flooring Association offers certification for installers, craftsman, and master craftsman.\nCarpenters are involved in many phases of construction and may have opportunities to become first-line supervisors, lead carpenters, independent contractors, or general construction supervisors.\nBusiness skills. Self-employed carpenters must conduct activities such as bidding on new jobs, tracking inventory, and directing workers.\nDetail oriented. Carpenters must be able to precisely cut, measure, and modify the materials they work with.\nDexterity. Carpenters use many tools and need hand-eye coordination to avoid injuring themselves or damaging materials.\nInterpersonal skills. Carpenters need to work as a member of a team, cooperating with and assisting others. They also may interact with customers.\nMath skills. Carpenters frequently use math skills, including basic trigonometry, to calculate the area, size, and amount of material needed for the job.\nPhysical strength. Carpenters use heavy tools and materials that weigh up to 100 pounds. They also must be able to stand, climb, or bend for many hours.\nProblem-solving skills. Carpenters may work independently with little guidance. They need to be able to modify building materials and make adjustments onsite to complete projects.\nReading comprehension skills. Carpenters need advanced reading ability to understand and follow complex instructions for installing certain products, such as doors.","Discusses the main causes of injuries and deaths when using scaffolds and describes steps that can be taken to minimize the hazards.\nEach year, more than 60 workers are killed by falls from scaffolds, about 1 in 5 of the fatal falls in construction. Besides problems with planks and guardrails, the main causes of injuries and deaths on scaffolds are poor planning for assembling and taking them apart, missing tie-ins or bracing, loads that are too heavy, and being too close to power lines. Also, falling objects can hurt people below scaffolds.\nProtect YourselfScaffolds are supported (usually by posts/beams and legs) or suspended (by ropes).\n- OSHA says a scaffold must be designed by a qualified person.* Supported scaffolds must be able to support their own weight and at least 4 times the maximum intended load .\n- OSHA says a competent person* must inspect a scaffold before each workshift and after anything happens that could affect the structure. The competent person should be trained in scaffold safety.\n- A competent person must supervise if a scaffold is assembled, changed, moved, or taken apart.\n- Power lines: Keep scaffolds 10 feet or more from power lines (or 3 feet, if lines are less than 300 volts), unless you are sure the power lines are de-energized.\n- Weather: You cannot work on a scaffold in high winds or a storm unless a competent person says it is safe and you use personal fall-arrest or a windscreen. (If you use a screen, the scaffold must be secured against the expected wind force.) OSHA says you must not work on a scaffold that has ice or snow on it — except to get ice or snow off the scaffold.\n- If a scaffold is more than 2 feet above or below a level, there must be a way to get on or off — such as a ladder, ramp, or personnel hoist. The access must not be more than 14\" from the scaffold.\n- Put a standing scaffold on a firm foundation (with base plates attached to feet)— for instance, with one piece of wood under each pair of legs (across the shortest distance), extending at least 1 foot past each leg.\n- Uprights must be vertical and braced to prevent swaying; platforms must be level.\n- A scaffold that is more than 4 times higher than its base is wide must be tied to supports.\n- Most scaffold platforms and walkways must be 18\" wide or more. If a work area is less than 18\" wide, guardrails and/or personal fall-arrest must be used.\n- Ten-foot planks must extend at least 6\" past the end supports, but not more than 12\"; no more than 1\" between planks or between planks and uprights.\n- Wood planks must be unpainted, so any cracks will show.\n- For supported scaffolds, check at least these points:\n- Completely planked platforms\n- Proper access\n- Complete guardrails\n- Proper ties to buildings, where required.\n- Supporting outrigger beams must be able to support at least 4 times the intended load. To keep a scaffold from falling to the ground, it must be attached to the roof, tied to a secure anchorage, or secured with counterweights. The suspension ropes and rigging must support at least 6 times the intended load.\n- Counterweights must be attached to secure and strong places on a building so they won’t move. Do not use bags of sand or gravel, masonry blocks, or roofing materials that can flow or move.\n- Do not use gas-powered equipment or hoists. Hoists must have automatic brakes for emergencies.\n- A 1-point or 2-point suspended scaffold must be tied or secured to prevent swaying.\n- OSHA says if a scaffold is more than 10 feet above a level, workers must have fall protection.\n- A competent person must decide if fall protection is feasible when you assemble a scaffold or take it apart.\n- On most scaffolds, guard rails must be on all open sides and ends. On supported scaffolds and some other scaffolds, guardrails or personal fall protection is enough. On most suspension scaffolds, both are needed. Use a harness, not a body belt for personal fall protection.\n- You do not need a guard rail on the working side when the platform is less than 14\" from the work (18\" for plastering and lathing). The open side of an outrigger must never be more than 3\" from the face of the building.\n- On supported scaffolds most of the time, the top rail must be 38\" to 45\" above the platform. A top rail must be strong enough to hold 200 lb. (or 100 lb. on single-point and two-point suspension scaffolds). A mid-rail must be about halfway between the platform and the top rail; most mid-rails must be able to hold 150 pounds. If mesh, screens, or panels are used, a top rail is needed (unless mesh was designed and installed to meet guardrail requirements).\n- Scaffold walkways must have no more than a 9.5\" gap between planks and a guardrail.\n- Don’t let junk collect on the scaffold. You can trip and fall.\nThere must be a 3 1/2\"-high toe board to prevent things falling off a scaffold. If things on the scaffold are taller than 3 1/2\" — above the toeboard — other systems, like debris nets, can be used to catch falling tools or materials. If things can fall off a scaffold, people must be prevented from walking under or near the scaffold.\n- The employer must have a qualified person provide safety training for each worker who uses a scaffold. A competent person must give safety training to any worker who assembles, takes apart, moves, operates, repairs, maintains, or inspects scaffolds.\n- If the worksite changes or the type of scaffold or safety equipment changes, workers using scaffolds must be retrained.\n* OSHA says a qualified person...by extensive knowledge, training, and experience can...solve...problems related to the subject matter.... A competent person is...capable of identifying existing and predictable hazards...and has authorization to take prompt measures to eliminate them.

{"question":"What makes wet chemical fire extinguishers particularly suited for commercial kitchen fires compared to water and foam extinguishers?","answer":"Wet chemical fire extinguishers are specifically developed for commercial kitchen fires because they use a potassium solution that safely cools the fire and prevents oil from splashing or spreading. In contrast, water and foam extinguishers are only recommended for Class A fires and can be dangerous when used on kitchen fires, as they can actually spread the fire or create shock hazards when used on Class B or C fires. The wet chemical system's ability to create saponification (turning fats into a soap-like substance) makes it particularly effective for kitchen fires.","context":["Q: What comes out of the system nozzles to extinguish the fire, is it powder? All kitchen suppression systems must operate according to the UL 300 standard. UL 300 requires the use of wet chemical in kitchen suppression systems. The transition from dry chemical to wet chemical kitchen systems occurred due to changes in cooking oil/grease. When the system is activated, the wet chemical sprays onto the fire below and creates a chemical reaction called saponification. Basically this means that the fat on the grill or in the fryer turns into a kind of “soap” when it comes into contact with the wet chemical, which stops the fire and leaves it with nothing to fuel it.\nQ: What if my kitchen suppression system still uses powder?If your kitchen suppression system is still using powder, it is non-compliant and will need to be replaced or changed to a wet chemical system recognized as compliant according to UL 300.\nQ: How often does my system need inspected?Most kitchen suppression systems need inspected every six months. Additionally you will need to make sure you are having your kitchen exhaust hood cleaned regularly as well if you want to pass this semi-annual inspection. For more information about getting the most out of your hood cleaning, review these tips.\nQ: The fire department said my restaurant looks good, so why do I need it inspected again?When the fire department stops by any place of business, they are simply looking for current inspection tags. If they see your inspections are up to date, they are not checking on the compliance and condition of your fire protection equipment, as that is the job of the fire protection company that tagged it. If, based on their visit, you choose to skip your upcoming inspection or disregard the repairs or updates needed, your system will not receive a current inspection tag and will be considered past due or failing.\nQ: What if I don’t get my system inspected every six months?If you allow your inspections to lapse, the fire marshal or local authority can stop your cooking operations if they stop by for a surprise inspection and find your system non-compliant. Another possibility is grease build-up impeding the proper function of your system as the components start to stick, which can lead to costly repairs.\nQ: Do I have to call my fire protection company EVERY time I make changes?Yes! Every time you move appliances, add them, or change anything underneath your kitchen hood, you have to let your fire protection company know so they can make sure you still have proper coverage. Different arrangements call for different configurations of the nozzles and in some cases may require a larger or smaller chemical suppressant tank. A certified technician can assess your system and determine whether anything needs changed. You can also call ahead of time to have a technician help you understand if any changes can be made without requiring a reworking of your suppression system.\nThe most important thing to remember is that your fire protection company is here to help! It is our job to help you pass inspection and meet all requirements. If you are worried your system is not up to code, please give us a call so we can help you be prepared and safe.","When choosing a fire protection system, it’s important to understand the options available and what’s recommended for your building. Fire extinguishers come in many forms. The difference lies in how each is designed to extinguish fire and the type of fires they are used for. We’ll take a look at the type of fire extinguishers available in the market below.\nWater and foam\nThese types of fire extinguishers are designed to put off fire by separating the oxygen element from other elements. They are recommended for Class A fires only. When used in a Class B or C fire, a water and foam extinguisher can spread the fire or cause a shock hazard.\nCarbon dioxide extinguishers\nThese fire extinguishers contain carbon dioxide in liquid form. When let off, the extinguisher releases this liquid into the air, which neutralizes the oxygen element of the fire triangle. This disables the fires ability to spread further. There are situations when it’s dangerous to use a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher. For instance, when used in a confined space, they can reduce the level of oxygen available to breathe and cause serious casualties. There’s also the risk of accidental discharge so this is not recommended in areas where there are children. Fire protection companies recommend this type of extinguisher for Class B and C fires only.\nDry chemical fire extinguishers\nDry chemical fire extinguishers contain foam or dry powder, which is compressed with nitrogen. When released, the extinguisher works by smothering the fire. The layer of foam or dry powder puts out the fire by creating a barrier between the oxygen element and the fuel element. This is what happens in Class A fires. Dry chemical extinguishers can also be used in Class B & C fires and they work in the same way by disrupting the chemical reaction in the fire triangle.\nWet chemical fire extinguishers\nThese extinguishers were mainly developed to help put off fires in commercial kitchens. Not all extinguishers were designed to put off big cooking fires. Some present the risk of burns because the pressure can cause the oil to jet out, resulting in serious harm. Wet chemical fire extinguishers are made up of a solution of potassium, which cools the fire and reduces the temperature then stops it from spreading or splashing. The potassium also reacts with the hot oils creating a barrier between the fat and oil.\nClean agent extinguishers\nThese are waterless fire extinguishing systems, often used to put off fires in office buildings because they are designed to deploy immediately without causing damage to important assets like electronics. They work by releasing Halogen and halocarbon agents, which interrupt the chemical reaction and remove heat from the fire triangle. They are used for Class A, B and C fires.\nDry powder extinguishers\nThese extinguishers, which are only used in Class D or combustible metal fires, put off fire by separating the fuel from the oxygen or removing the heat element in the fire triangle.\nWater mist extinguishers\nThese extinguishers are used for Class A fires especially in situations where contamination is a problem. They work by removing the heat element of the fire triangle.\nCartridge-operated dry chemical extinguishers\nThese extinguishers put off fire by interrupting the chemical reaction of the fire triangle. A multipurpose dry chemical extinguisher can be used on Class A, B and C fires."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a7a454c2-30b4-4af9-9ada-d5419e32bec9>","<urn:uuid:5d75fac0-41b8-4bbe-b02b-9e17290cf76d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm studying cultural engagement in art residencies. What are the key differences between how artists engaged with indigenous culture at Lot 50-Kanyanyapilla versus how they connected with local culture in Dawson City?","answer":"At Lot 50-Kanyanyapilla, artists primarily engaged through camping on the land and incorporating imagery of the place, working within a framework of Indigenous cultural renewal led by the Kaurna people. For instance, artists like Veronica Calarco and Andrew Smith spent nights camping there to inform their work. In contrast, at Dawson City, artists engaged by fully immersing themselves in contemporary local life - buying groceries, drinking at local bars, and creating work that reflected the town's diverse population and gold rush heritage. The Dawson artists were challenged to create site-specific works in just 6 weeks, whereas the Lot 50-Kanyanyapilla engagement appeared more open-ended and focused on cultural learning.","context":["Regeneration is a tricky word when it comes to culture and has different nuances and meanings. It is some form of renewal, revival or re-creation and seems the most apt descriptor for the moment.\nGavin recognises the Williams family clan as the senior Kaurna cultural custodians of the Willunga Basin region. They have been leading the way in cultural and spiritual renewal and caring for Country for many decades. Senior members of the clan have full access to the land for cultural purposes. They will help guide the ecological regeneration to provide the attributes of a traditional Kaurna cultural landscape. As well as private cultural activities, a program of bicultural education, cultural presentation, research activities and events is envisaged.\nBestowing or adopting a Kaurna place name is a considered process which takes into account known place names, the source of the name, cultural practices and the physical topography. Fortunately, the traditional locality name, Kanyanyapilla, was recorded in 1839 and has therefore been adopted for this project and place as part of the bi-cultural naming. An explanation of the name is available on the Cultural History page.\nLinguist Flavia Hodges has explained the importance of place names this way:\nBefore Australia was colonised by European settlers, the Indigenous inhabitants had names for every topographical feature of significance to them.\nAn important contrast with the subsequent introduced system of placenaming, Indigenous place names forms structured, interlinked networks in which places, together with their names and attributes, are related to each other in complex ways reflecting the relationship between people and the land they inhabit. Place names are not arbitrary, but integral to the places to which they are attached, and derive from the activities of Ancestor figures in the Dreaming … (Hodges, 2007:383)\nIn June 2015 Karl Telfer, senior custodian, and three young men camped overnight around a campfire at Lot 50-Kanyanyapilla, the first Kaurna campfire in about 170 years. It was the first of many to follow. This was the start of reconnecting with this small part of Kaurna Yerta Kaurna Country.\nIn 1993 an archaeological survey of Lot 50 was undertaken as part of the assessment of a sand mining proposal. Aboriginal cultural material was found in almost 90% of test pits dug.\nIn 2015 Keryn Walshe, Project Archaeologist, also noted post contact artefacts; Aboriginal tools made of glass and other materials introduced by the colonists. Preliminary field research has now been undertaken. The location of this field work was not examined in any detail in 1993 (the area was overgrown) and a rich source of post contact artefacts has now been revealed. Follow up research and documentation is well advanced and findings are expected to be published in an academic journal.\nBottle/jar bases used as scrapers\nGlass fragments used as scrapers or punches\nGavin recognises the settlement process, land use history and achievements of the district. The impacts, positive and negative, of the incoming culture in the Willunga Basin permeate the region and are fairly self-evident. Activities and infrastructure will reflect aspects of this; cultural markers (sculptural forms, structures and cultural interpretation) express personal perspectives.\nTellurian Spirit 2, (River Redgum)\nUse by Artists\nThree artists have used L50K to inform their work as part of the Sauerbier House residency and exhibition program. Sauerbier House is a City of Onkaparinga art space located in an historic villa on the banks of the Onkaparinga River at Port Noarlunga, 11 kms away as the crow flies.\nLisa Harms, the first artist-in-residence, visited L50K and used imagery of the place in her work. Gavin contributed a text/spoken word piece to her project which was on exhibition late 2015.\nVeronica Calarco, artist-in-residence Dec 2015-Feb 2016, camped over at L50K several nights to inform aspects of her new work. Veronica mainly resides in North Wales where she has established her own international studio residency Stiwdio Maelor.

During this residency, artists explore significant issues such as landscape, consumer culture, and meaning in order to “stimulate and engage people in a re-examination of the various cultural and economic values imposed on the environment, while exploring alternative political, social, economic and aesthetic agendas and strategies towards a re-interpretation of the regional landscape and social infrastructure.” 1 In addition to the assigned theme and approach, the artists must present their work in the ODD Gallery or in a public art installation at the end of the residency.\nThe Natural & The Manufactured residency challenges the artists to create new site-specific works based on their stay in Dawson, which requires a certain amount of effort in engaging with the community rather than using the residency to work on ongoing projects. Ideally, all artists who participate in the year-round KIAC Artist in Residence program get involved with the town, but they are usually able to do so without the pressure of immediately displaying recently created work that reflects their engagement and understanding of the community. The format of the residency raises several questions: is meaningful engagement and understanding achievable in the course of six weeks? How can artists successfully complete this assignment?\nFor their time in Dawson, the artists buy expensive groceries, walk on the dyke, drink Pilsner at the Pit until last call, exceed bandwidth limits—essentially, they live the Dawson lifestyle, and they fit in easily due to the diversity of the population. For the purposes of this residency in particular, art historian Lucy Lippard’s notion of “sense of place” might serve as an answer to the question of belonging or engagement during the residency. In her work The Lure of the Local: Senses of Place in a Multicentered Society, she defines sense of place as “a way for nonbelongers to belong, momentarily.” 2 The goal for the artists becomes a way of belonging that is momentarily meaningful, a way that goes beyond drinking a shot containing a shriveled toe.\nFor the 2011 residency, Bill Burns (Toronto), Deborah Stratman (Chicago), and Steve Badgett (Chicago) utilized distinct strategies to meet the thematic requirements of the project, as well as exhibiting a nuanced sense of place that explored the psychic geography of Dawson in surprising ways. Rather than falling into the pitfalls of the “Artist as Ethnographer” 3 or by attempting some “authentic” representation of the town by regurgitating a clichéd visual identity, the artists incorporated facets of their Toronto and Chicago practices and selves into their work inspired by Dawson, resulting in a higher collaboration and engagement that genuinely belonged.\nStratman and Badgett’s public art installation Augural Pair consisted of two six-foot tall pine viewing stations. The first scope was installed on Second Avenue between Queen and Princess Streets. There was no explanatory plaque or sign, and the only decoration on the smooth blond wood was an electron shell diagram for gold, element 79 in the Periodic Table of Elements. The scope looked to a second-level window at the CIBC Bank, where a red digital display listed the current price of gold as provided by a live internet feed. Through the viewfinder, the commodity of gold is reified as we see the arcane value of the precious metal discretely quantified. Though the concept of gold’s value has been made real through its quantification, it becomes clear that we still cannot reach this gold which we desire; the scope emphasizes our distance.\nSimilarly, the second scope in Augural Pair (also six-foot tall, but lacking any inscription) was placed on the bank of the Yukon River, looking up and across to a mirrored disk installed on land belonging to the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in First Nation. The reflective disk was surrounded by realistic life-sized sculptures of ravens that responded to the mirror and invited interactions with live ravens. Again, through the use of the viewfinder and the division of the river, the viewer’s distance from the object is emphasized. Likewise, desire was heightened as anything in peripheral vision turned to black through the viewfinder. Depending on the weather, the form of desire changed. On a pleasant day with no clouds, the mirror reflected the blue sky in a bright, obvious way, creating the desire for something to extract. On a gray, overcast day, the disk resembled a hole in the landscape, exposing a desire for something that had already been extracted, or the need to be whole.\nViewers familiar with Dawson and the Yukon could identify the site-specific elements of Augural Pair. For example, the subject of gold was a timely inclusion in the project. In the summer of 2011, the historic Gold Rush town was buzzing with the idea of a second gold rush. GroundTruth Exploration, a local mineral exploration company, boasted an increased summer staff of over 70 soil samplers or “dirtbaggers,” ostensibly correlating with the appearance of new expediting and helicopter companies. 4 The Discovery Channel’s Gold Rush: Alaska filmed its second season of the mining reality TV show in the area. Even The New York Times had an extensive article about the Yukon’s mushroom forager-turned-millionaire Shawn Ryan of Ryanwood Exploration. 5\nLikewise, the incorporation of ravens into Stratman and Badgett’s project was a logical choice. The Common Raven is ubiquitous in the Yukon Territory, and is thus frequently employed in representations of Dawson. The highly intelligent birds hold a sacred place in regional mythology as beloved tricksters and world creators. Specifically, Augural Pair draws on a traditional story of how the raven stole the sun and released it into the sky. 6 Stratman and Badgett’s carved birds fit seamlessly into this story, as they held court as cautious guardians of the covetous shiny orb. Furthermore, the title of the project, Augural Pair,references the ancient Roman augur, a religious official who observed and interpreted natural signs, especially the behavior of birds, to determine divine approval or disapproval of a proposed action.”augur”. 7 There could be no better choice for such a bird in Dawson than the raven.\nAlthough the content of Augural Pair clearly employed Dawson iconography, the framework or narrative structure of the story that Stratman and Badgett extracted from their residency had all the distinct markings of their artistic practice. Stratman is primarily a filmmaker concerned with “how history plays out in the land.” A common theme in her films and public interventions is surveillance, whether being watched by someone or something else, as in the 2002 film In Order Not To Be Here, or a self-surveillance of emotions, as evidenced by Fear, an ongoing project in which participants call a toll-free number and describe their deepest fears. With the collective SIMPARCH, Badgett has created community-minded installations which fuse politics, humour, and utility. The collective aestheticizes sustainability in projects such as Hyrdomancy (2006), where the means of clean water acquisition is made visible. Works like Free Basin (2000), where wooden basins built for skateboarding were installed in five art gallery spaces, reflect the collective’s concern with understanding and playfully altering the purposes of a specific site. 8\nStratman and Badgett demonstrate the typical format of a residency, where artists arrive with pre-existing concerns in their practices and then find inspiration in a new, specific space. In a mutually beneficial exchange, viewers re-interpret and expand their conception of the site, and artists explore new dimensions and possibilities for their practices. This is not quite what happened with Bill Burns’ residency.\nWhen I first heard about Burns’ intentions for his ODD Gallery show, I thought it was bound for failure—and not a sexy failure. 9 For more on failure in contemporary art practices, see Nicole Antebi, Colin Dickey, and Robby Herbst, eds., Failure!: Experiments in Aesthetic and Social Practices (Los Angeles, California: Journal of Aesthetics and Protest Press, 2007). I remember having a conversation with ODD Gallery Director Lance Blomgren several weeks before the opening of the show, where I asked, with disbelief and moderate concern, “So he’s just going to carve the names of esoteric art world figures into logs? That’s his plan?” As if that would resonate with Dawson residents, or Mean Something.\nMy initial response at the opening of The Veblen Good wasn’t much more nuanced. The chalkboard wall work listing “those who have helped me, those I still hope will help me, and those who wronged me” gave context and imbued humour into the massive logs with the same names inscribed into them. The Photoshopped facelifts to the S.S. Keno (now the H.U. Obrist) and a Holland America tourbus (rebranded as Martin Kippenberger Tours) provided easy laughs, as did the witty autobiographical watercolours of Burns’ outdoor expeditions with curators, collectors, and editors. This was all fine and good, but I couldn’t help feeling cheated by Burns’ show. Did he even consider the place he had been living in for the past month?\nI mistakenly believed that a work that didn’t obviously reflect an engagement with Dawson couldn’t speak about Dawson on a meaningful level. This was a problem of framework. Where Stratman and Badgett used their own artistic framework to convey Dawson-specific content, it is helpful to view the autobiographical content of Burns’ work in a Dawson framework for its meaning and sense of place to be revealed. Burns’ inscription of himself into the world of Dawson is explicit (writing the names of people who have shaped his life on a blackboard, on logs, on a boat, on a bus), but the relationship of life in Dawson to Burns’ work is less deliberate.\nThe Veblen Good is not devoid of Dawson content. The lumber used for the engraved logs was sourced from West Dawson. Burns photographed the S.S. Keno, Holland America tourbus, and the “Building With No Name” during his residency. The name Martin Kippenberger holds significance to Dawson residents who recall the German artist’s METRO-Net project, in which he installed entrances to underground transit stations in cities worldwide, including Dawson in 1995. 10 The wildlife and outdoor travels depicted in the watercolour works would resonate with most northerners’ adventurous spirits.\nBut what really matters to Dawson is how Burns illustrated the social dynamics of a small town in the North in ingenious, subtle simplicity. In a town that so rigidly attempts to exhibit a coherent identity based on a four-year period in history, it becomes necessary to map new stories and heroes and values onto daily life in order to make present-day Dawson a place worth living. It requires carving a place for yourself and injecting your own brand of incoherence. It means coming to terms with the private (and public) lists of those who have helped us and those who have wronged us, because these are the people who help define us. One of the beautiful facets of Dawson is that it eludes a homogenous definition. In many ways it is a chosen community: many of its residents were not born and raised there, and its extreme remoteness requires an intentional arrival. The people who make up Dawson comprise a multitude of experiences and opinions. It’s a small town that’s anything but small-minded.\nStratman and Badgett’s project also taps into powerful emotional territory in its exploration of desire and loss. By presenting these emotional forces in context with a shared history of gold, extraction, and traditional mythology, desire and loss become very specific to Dawson. Augural Pair poses charged sociological questions: How do you put a price on your community? Can the acquisition of our desire fill the place of things we have lost?\nJust as The Veblen Good doesn’t promote a particular path or tell Dawson residents how to live, Augural Pair doesn’t provide answers or make suggestions for viewers. These are good things. There are countless examples of collaborations between artists and communities where projects end up being prescriptive, as if the momentarily belonging artist understands the needs of a community better than those who are a part of it. 11 The projects created in 2011’s The Natural & The Manufactured residency were successful because they uncovered more questions than answers in their exploration of Dawson.\nIn a diverse place like Dawson, there needs to be a variety of residents, residencies, projects, and frameworks for understanding. This results in a multitude of ways for artists and viewers to engage with Dawson and each other. Stratman, Badgett, and Burns actively challenged ideas of how we belong in a place and how a place belongs to us.\nOriginally from Richmond, Virginia, MEGAN GRAHAM is an administrator and writer living in Toronto.

With many causes of dry or flaky skin in dogs, it can be confusing for owners to know where to start.\n7 Things You Should Know About Dry Flaky Skin with Scabs in Dogs\nIn this article, I’ll highlight the most important things you should know and tips on how you can help your dog. Let’s get started!\n1. Regularly groom your dog’s coat.\n“Not regularly bathing or brushing your dogs coat can lead to dry flaky and even scabby skin. The skin naturally rejuvenates itself with time, and dead skin cells are pushed to the surface. If these aren’t brushed away then they can accumulate, giving the ‘dandruff’ look.”\nBrushing your dog’s coat a few times per week will help remove dandruff and dirt from accumulating in their fur.\n2. Ensure your dog is getting proper nutrition and enough water.\n“A poor-quality diet or a lack of essential nutrients such as vitamins and Omega 3 can lead to a poor coat condition and flaky skin. Oils in the diet are essential in keeping the skin moistened. Without these, it can dry out, leading to soreness and scabbing.”\nOmega-3 fatty acids, like this, may help improve the quality of your dog’s coat and skin barrier, preventing it from drying out and becoming flaky.\n- HELPS THEM LOOK & FEEL GREAT, INSIDE & OUT: Pet Honesty’s Omega-3 Fish Oil for dogs & cats is a convenient way to add whole body support to their daily routine. Picky pets can put up a fight when it comes to adding new things to their diet, but this tasty oil is like the cherry on top that’s secretly healthy & beneficial to their overall well-being. The perfect blend of four types of wild-caught fish packed inside every bottle will have them feeling their best & begging for more.\nAdequate hydration is also essential to the health of your dog’s skin and coat. Always make sure your dog has access to fresh water throughout the day.\n3. Try home remedies to heal your dog’s dry skin.\nIf your dog’s dry, scaly skin with scabs is in its early stages, and your pet isn’t experiencing significant pain and discomfort, there are a variety of things you can try at home.\nHere are a few home treatments I recommend:\nThere are a multitude of shampoo options in stores and online such as this one:\n- DID YOU KNOW WE USE NATURALLY DERIVED INGREDIENTS? Our dog coat shampoo formulas are made with 99.7% naturally derived ingredients including coconut oil, which provides a natural infusion of moisture to sooth dry dog coats\nIt’s important to avoid using shampoos labeled for treating certain conditions like fleas and ticks. Also be careful not to bathe your dog too vigorously or too frequently, as this can strip the skin of natural oils and cause dry skin.\nApplied in small amounts topically (to the surface of the skin), coconut oil such as this product listed below this one may have moisturizing properties that can help alleviate dry skin:\n- BALM FOR DOGS AND CATS: Organic Coconut oil for dogs, a soothing, natural treatment for dogs dry nose, elbows, ears, paws and wrinkles that heals and softens a pet's dry skin. As a dog ear cleaner or paw balm, coconut oil provides safe and highly effective itch relief for dogs. Great benefits for your feline friends too- all natural coconut oil is great for cats itchy skin, cracked paws and is effective in cleaning cat ears.\n“Apply a small amount of coconut oil to your dog’s skin and massage it thoroughly. Please do not apply coconut oil to open wounds, do not apply copious amounts (your dog should not look greasy), and don’t feed coconut oil to your dog unless under the direction of your veterinarian.”\nUse a Humidifier in your Home\nDry air can contribute to dry skin, especially in hot dry summers, or during winter when in-house heaters are naturally removing moisture from the air. Consider using a humidifier in your home, especially in areas where your dog frequently hangs out.\n4. See a vet if your dog’s skin problems are persistent or if your dog shows signs of discomfort or illness\nIt is important to see a veterinarian if your dog has persistent scabs and dry skin for more than a few days or weeks despite the interventions listed above. You should also see a veterinarian as soon as possible if your dog shows any signs of discomfort or illness, such as itching or red skin.\nThese symptoms may indicate an underlying medical condition that requires veterinary treatment:\n“While there are some remedies you can try at home for minor, superficial, new skin issues, ongoing skin problems or skin issues that are causing significant pain or discomfort should be seen by a veterinarian as soon as an appointment is available.”\nYour pet needs a veterinarian’s expert care if you’ve noticed any of these signs:\n- Severe itching or scratching (frequent or constant, maybe even enough to cause damage to the skin)\n- Hair loss or bald patches\n- Foul odor from the skin\n- Redness or inflammation of the skin\n- Discharge or pus from the affected area\n- Changes in behavior, appetite, mood, or activity\nIf left untreated, or not properly treated, these scabs and dry skin can lead to more serious skin infections or other health issues.\nPlease take a quick second to rate this page:\n5. The most likely causes include allergies, parasites, skin infections, and hormonal issues.\nA veterinarian can perform a thorough examination and diagnostic tests to determine the underlying cause of the skin issues, which can be related to allergies, parasites, infection, or another medical condition.\nDogs can be allergic to various things, just like humans. Food, pollen, insect or parasite bites, or even different materials or substances can cause an allergic reaction resulting in skin irritation, itching, and inflammation. This can then lead to flaky skin with scabs. Signs that you may have an allergic dog might be recurrent ear infections or anal gland issues, excessive paw licking or are constantly itchy “all over”.\nAvoiding the allergen is the most direct way to prevent allergic skin disease at home, but unfortunately that’s not always possible. Therefore, you may need to work with your dog’s veterinarian to start medications, topical treatments, or even allergy shots. Fortunately, there are many treatment options that can keep your dog’s allergy signs under control and prevent uncomfortable skin signs.\nBelow are 2 examples of dry flaky skin or scabs due to allergies:\nParasites on your dog’s skin, including fleas, ticks and mites, can cause irritation that may lead to flaky skin and scabs. The area around a tick bite may become red, flaky, and form a scab. Flea infestations can cause localized skin reactions and swelling, sometimes eventually even hair loss and severe skin thickening. Many mites also result in flaking and scaley skin as they burrow under the skin surface, resulting in irritation and shedding of the outer layers of the skin.\nPictures of dry / flaky / red skin due to parasites:\nTo take care of a parasite problem at home, there are many flea and tick prevention options readily available. These can stop external parasite issues before they start, and they can even help if you’re managing a parasite problem after it’s begun. It’s best to go with a veterinary prescription product for this as many products available in superstores and pet shops are not effective enough.\nIf you think your dog is suffering from a parasite infestation, then talk to your vet. They’ll have many great options, not only to manage the parasites, but also to treat the dry, flaky skin and scabs as your dog’s skin starts to heal again.\nBacterial or fungal skin infections (including ringworm) can cause skin inflammation, itching, and flaky skin with scabs. These infections can occur on their own or secondary to allergies or parasites, therefore it’s essential to talk to your veterinarian if you think your dog is suffering from these problems. You may notice excessive dampness, or even excessive dryness, in a patch of skin with an infection. Flakiness and scabbing are common, and often limited to a specific area, sometimes called a “hot spot”.\nPictures showing irritated, dry, flaky skin on dogs as a result of infections:\n“Sometimes topical treatments or medicated baths are enough to treat infections and help your dog’s skin heal at home. But if the infected area is large or badly inflamed, specialized wound care (including shaving the fur in the area and treating with antiseptics), systemic antibiotics (an injection or oral medication provided by the veterinarian), antifungals (in the case of ringworm) and even steroids (if it’s bad enough) may be necessary.”\nSwabs of the affected area may even need to be taken to identify the causative agent in order to target the treatment effectively. These veterinarian-prescribed treatments are very effective when given as directed.\nIf the infection is secondary to an underlying condition then this will need to be addressed as well in order to successfully treat the infection.\nHormonal imbalances/endocrine disorders\nSome hormonal imbalances, such as hypothyroidism or Cushing’s disease, can affect skin health and lead to flaky skin with scabs.\nOn this picture below, a Yorker mix has dry and flaky skin in places with some darkening of the skin (hyperpigmentation) due to Cushing’s disease. On his belly, there are some raised plaques and his skin also looks a little red and inflamed:\nIn the case of hormonal imbalances, these are conditions that need to be addressed and treated with the help of your veterinarian; diagnostic tests are required to figure out what disorder they need to treat. Various hormone regulating drugs can be administered to try and correct the imbalance once a diagnosis has been made.\nIn addition to treating the hormonal issue, your veterinarian may prescribe other treatments that will treat the skin condition separately at the same time as addressing the hormonal issue. Treating the dry, flaky skin condition often includes supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids, topical medications that promote skin health, or other medications to reduce inflammation.\nOther causes of dry flaky skin and scabs in dogs\nOther medical conditions, such as autoimmune disorders, cancer, or kidney disease, can also affect skin health and lead to flaky skin with scabs. Each of these conditions carries its own set of unique signs, and they each are treated differently. If attempts to treat dry, flaky skin with scabs at home prove ineffective, and your veterinarian has ruled out other causes, they may recommend additional testing to decide if another medical condition is to blame.\nA physical exam, along with a thorough medical history, are a veterinarian’s first step to diagnose your dog’s scabs and dry skin. Be sure to share all relevant information you can when you make your pet’s appointment, and again at the appointment when they’re asking questions.\nMost veterinarians are going to ask you the same kind of questions when it comes to your pet’s skin issue:\n- When did you first notice the problem?\n- Is your dog still eating/ drinking/ acting the way they always have?\n- How often is your dog scratching or biting at the area you’re concerned about? Have you noticed them scratching or biting other areas too?\n- How much has the affected area changed since you first saw a problem?\n- Are there any new cleaning products, shampoos, foods/ treats, medications, human food, etc that your pet has been exposed to?\n- What kind of parasite prevention are they on?\n- Do you notice issues are worse after your dog has been somewhere specific- like a bedroom, your laundry room, or outside?\n- Does your dog have a history of skin issues, allergies, or other medical conditions?\n- Is there anything that makes your dog’s dry, flaky, and scabbed skin improve noticeably?\nIt might seem like a lot of questions, but these can all help your veterinarian form initial opinions about the cause of your dog’s condition. The more relevant information you can share, the closer your vet will be to understanding how to help your pet.\nDuring the physical exam, the vet will look at your dog’s skin, coat, and overall appearance. They may also take a sample of your dog’s skin to examine under a microscope or perform skin scrapings to look for parasites or fungal infections. Depending on the physical exam, and any initial testing, blood tests and allergy testing may also be necessary help diagnose the cause of your dog’s skin issues.\nOnce the cause of your dog’s skin issue has been determined, you can expect a customized treatment plan that might include medications, supplements, or other therapies.\n6. Avoid irritants.\nBe mindful of any potential irritants that may be contributing to your dog’s skin issues, such as harsh chemicals in cleaning products or allergens in the environment.\nFor instance, if your dog likes to sleep on the kitchen floor, avoid using strong cleaners or lay down a blanket so your dog doesn’t have direct exposure. Reduce use of air fresheners, carpet fresheners, and other chemicals that you wouldn’t feel comfortable walking barefoot on or sprinkling in your own bed.\n7. Treatment can take a few weeks or months to be effective.\nOnce the cause of your dog’s dry flaky skin is determined by a veterinarian, treatment may include a combination of topical medications and shampoos, dietary supplements, medication, and lifestyle changes. These treatments will help to soothe the skin and reduce inflammation while also helping to heal scabbed areas. In some cases, anti-allergy or antibiotic medications may be required to help reduce the symptoms of dry flaky skin in your pet.\n“Recovery from dry flaky skin can take some time, usually a few weeks or months depending on the severity. If your pet is suffering from an underlying condition such as allergies, appropriate management and lifestyle changes may be necessary for long term relief.”\nIt is important to monitor your dog’s skin and coat regularly to ensure there is no reoccurrence of the problem. Regular visits to the veterinarian during treatment will ensure that your pet is on the road to recovery.\nTypical Veterinary Costs of Treating Scabs and Skin Infections in Dogs\nThe typical costs of treating scabs and skin infections in dogs can range from $50 to $150, depending on the severity of the condition. It’s important to note that some more complicated issues such as ongoing allergies or underlying skin cancers that require more advanced treatments are more expensive to treat.\nDry flaky skin with scabs in dogs: what does it look like?\nThe actual look of dry flaky skin with scabs can vary, depending on the cause. Commonly, this condition will cause a dog’s fur to become dull and brittle with flakes of skin that have either fallen off or are still attached to their coat.\nSome areas may become irritated and scaly, and you might even see open sore or scabs often as a result of signs of discomfort like scratching or chewing. Hair loss is also common on these affected areas of skin.\nDry flaky skin might look like small white or gray flecks on your dog’s skin or fur. These may be more noticeable in areas with less hair or where the skin is darker, such as the belly, groin, or armpits. You might even think it looks similar to dandruff in humans!\nScabs may also be present on areas of irritated skin. A scab is a protective crust or clot that forms over a wound or abrasion on the skin. As the damage to the skin begins to heal, a scab forms over the area to protect from further injury and infection.\nDisclaimer: This website's content is not a substitute for veterinary care.

{"question":"What are some traditional children's games suitable for outdoor gatherings, and what safety precautions should be taken when organizing activities near water?","answer":"Traditional children's games suitable for outdoor gatherings include Pass the Parcel (where children pass a wrapped gift while music plays), Oranges and Lemons (where children run under an arch while singing), The Farmer's in his Den (a singing game where children act out roles), and Dead Lions (where children pretend to be sleeping animals). Regarding safety precautions near water, it's essential to have a designated adult watching children, ensure no one is left unattended near water, prohibit running around the pool area, and post clear safety signs. Additionally, proper pool maintenance, working fences with locks, and emergency equipment should be in place.","context":["Members in the diocese of St Albans orgnise a picnic during the summer holidays and invite young families, toddler groups and Rainbow/Brownie groups.

If you're planning on throwing a pool party for your friends and family, it's important to make sure everyone stays safe. In this blog post, we will discuss some safety tips for both when guests are in the water and when they're out of the water. By following these tips, you can ensure that everyone has a fun and safe time at your party!\nTrain Your Family On Everyday Pool Safety Tips\nEveryday pool safety training is essential. This includes basics like making sure each of your family members knows how to swim and float as well as recognize signs that they might be too exhausted to swim.\nOther basic pool safety tips include:\n- Each person should know how to get out of the pool safely in case of an emergency\n- There should be a designated adult who is responsible for watching the children while they are swimming\n- Children should never be left unattended near any body of water\n- No diving in the shallow end\n- No running around the pool area\n- No horseplay in or around the water\nBy following these tips, you can ensure that everyone has a fun and safe time at your party!\nMake Sure The Pool Is Properly Secured And Maintained Before The Party\nTake a CPR / First Aid class and teach everyone in your family how to use the pool safely and show everyone in your family and all visitors where emergency equipment is at you pool. You never know when an emergency may happen and to who so everyone needs to know how to respond to an emergency. Most parks and recreation departments offer basic CPR and pool safety classes like this.\nMake sure that all pool pipes, and drains are in working order and are not a danger to you or your family. Check the APSP for recall information on your pool equipment and if you are not sure how to check your equipment call your pool installer and have them check everything out.\nMake sure your fence around your pool is in working order and locks. You are responsible for your pool and your property and a wondering child coming into your yard and falling in your pool could mean major lawsuits, and even jail time depending on the person’s injuries.\nPost signs that warn guests about the dangers of swimming\nPosting signs and even making your guests sign a waiver is an important step to ensure that guests understand the danger they could be in while swimming. By signing a waiver, guests are acknowledging that they understand the risks and will not hold you responsible if something happens to them while they are swimming.\nSome common pool party safety signs include:\n- No diving\n- No running\n- No glass near the pool\n- Adults only in the deep end\nBe sure to post these signs around your pool area so that everyone is aware of the rules. You may even want to have someone stationed near the pool to enforce the rules and make sure everyone is following them. Breaking these rules can lead to serious injury, so it's important that everyone takes them seriously.\nProvide Plenty Of Water, Sunscreen, And Shady Areas To Cool Off\nOne of the most important things to do when hosting a pool party is to make sure that your guests stay hydrated. Provide plenty of water and encourage guests to drink it often, especially if they are swimming. You may also want to provide some sort of non-alcoholic beverage for guests to enjoy as well. In addition to hydration, sunscreen is also key in protecting guests from the sun's harmful rays. Be sure to have plenty of sunscreen available for guests to use, and provide shady areas for them to cool off in between swims.\nLimit And Monitor Your Guests' Alcohol Consumption\nWhile it's important to provide non-alcoholic beverages for your guests, you may also want to serve alcoholic drinks at your party. If you do choose to serve alcohol, it's important to limit and monitor your guests' consumption. Alcohol can impair judgment and coordination, which can lead to accidents both in and out of the water. Be sure to have plenty of food available as well, as this will help slow down the effects of alcohol. In addition, designate a sober person to be in charge of watching the pool and making sure everyone is following the safety rules.\nConsider Your Attendees - Different Safety Measures For Kids vs Adults\nDifferent types of parties require different specific considerations. For instance, a pool party for kids might require you to get a trained lifeguard whereas maybe one for adults can simply have someone assigned to be sober and observant who is briefed on basic first aid and who to call in an emergency.\nLikewise, for a kids' party you may want to provide floaties and life vests as well as ensure that any pool toys that could tangle tiny legs or lead to dangerous situations are removed from the pool area.\nHave An Emergency Plan In Place\nNo matter what type of pool party you're hosting, it's important to have an emergency plan in place. Make sure everyone knows where the first aid kit is and who to call in case of an emergency. In addition, be sure to have a plan for getting guests out of the water quickly and safely in the event of an emergency.\nHire A Lifeguard Or Assign A Pool Monitor Who Will Not Be Drinking\nIf you're hosting a pool party for kids, it's important to have a lifeguard on duty. If you're hosting a party for adults, be sure to assign someone to be the designated pool monitor. This person should not be drinking alcohol and should be responsible for making sure everyone is following the safety rules. In addition, they should know basic first aid and CPR in case of an emergency.\nBy following these tips, you can help ensure that your pool party is safe and enjoyable for all of your guests.

Most of the associations between chemical exposures and disease are just that–associations. But we’re exposed to dozens, if not hundreds, of chemicals, and the effects of some multiple exposures may be more than the sum of their parts, say experts. Or, in some cases, they might cancel each other out.\nWhat’s more, toxins get into our bodies through more than just food. We’re exposed to them through our carpets, lawn chemicals–even our clothing.\nCheck out these 7 toxins you can avoid in your diet and get simple solutions for minimizing these chemicals and toxins in your diet and life.\n1. The Effects of Pesticides\nFrom rat (and bug) poisons to sprays that keep lawns lush and crop yields high, “pesticides” include hundreds of chemicals. Some interfere with animals’ nervous systems; others disrupt hormones, causing abnormal growth that kills the plant or animal. Thus, it’s not surprising that synthetic pesticide exposure is linked with diseases of the nervous system and problems with cell growth, including reproductive problems and some cancers.\nWhat You Can Do to Avoid Pesticides\n–Start a kitchen garden! It’s easy to grow your own herbs and worth doing: a 2011 report revealed that cilantro is often laced with pesticide residues.\n–Buy organic fruits and vegetables, particularly those with the highest pesticide residues, such as apples, celery and strawberries.\n–Consider a water filter certified by the Water Quality Association (wqa.org) or NSF International (nsf.org) to screen out pesticides from farms and golf courses that can leach into well water. (Even tap water may contain traces of unregulated pesticides.)\n–Remove your shoes when you enter your home–and ask guests to do the same–to avoid tracking in pesticides sprayed on lawns.\n–Limit lawn chemicals, insecticides and rodenticides. Find natural ways to eliminate pests.\n2. What Are Dioxins and PCBs?\n“Dioxins” are a family of chemicals (including some polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs) with known cancer-causing properties. Dioxins are by-products of combustion–released via industrial processes, volcanoes, forest fires, even backyard burn piles–widespread in the environment but in low levels. They take years to degrade and they accumulate in fat, so they concentrate up the food chain. More than 90 percent of our exposure to dioxins is through food, mostly meat, dairy, fish and shellfish.\nWhat You Can Do to Avoid Dioxins and PCBs\n–Trim fat from meats; opt for low-fat dairy products.\n–Select lower-fat sources of protein, including meat from grass-fed animals, which tends to be leaner than meat from animals raised on grains.\n–Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruit, vegetables and grains to avoid too much exposure from any given source (e.g., meat, dairy).\n3. What Are Phthalates and How to Avoid Them\nThis group of chemicals is used to make soft, squishy plastics, such as rubber duckies, medical tubing and polyvinyl chloride, a.k.a. PVC. Some phthalates are used to make synthetic fragrances last longer. Research suggests that phthalates act as endocrine disruptors, interfering with the body’s hormone systems and potentially leading to reproductive abnormalities, problems with fertility and increased risk for diabetes.\nWhat You Can Do to Go Phthalate Free\n–Choose personal-care products (e.g., shampoos, lotions) and household cleaners free of synthetic fragrance, which often includes phthalates. Opt for those scented with essential oils or nothing at all. “Fragrance-free” or “unscented” on the front of a product sometimes means that the final product doesn’t have an odor; fragrance may have been added to mask another smell. Scan the ingredient list if there is one; if fragrance is listed, it’s often synthetic. (Some manufacturers of safe natural products list natural fragrances this way, too, so if you’re in doubt, contact the company for more information.)\n–Make the bulk of your diet minimally processed fresh foods. Processing and packaging can introduce phthalates into your food.\n4. Avoid Perfluorocarbons\nResearch has suggested that 98 percent of Americans contain trace levels of PFCs (perfluorocarbons), chemicals that are used to repel water, grease and stains and are found in nonstick cookware, clothing, carpeting, furniture and food containers. Our bodies absorb PFCs through food, our skin and via fumes from overheated pans. They’re linked with liver damage, developmental problems, cancer and, according to one 2011 study in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, early menopause.\nWhat You Can Do to Avoid PFCs\n–Opt for cast-iron (including ceramic-coated) or stainless-steel pots and pans.\n–When using nonstick cookware, don’t cook over high heat and use wooden or other nonmetal utensils to prevent scratches.\n–Look for clothing made from recycled polyester and polyurethane, which is naturally waterproof, and wax-coated clothes, which repel water and are PFC-free.\nForgo the optional stain treatment on new carpets and fabric-covered furniture.\n5. What Is In Tap Water?\nWe drink water to stay hydrated and flush out toxins. But could tap water actually be exposing us to more potentially harmful chemicals? Perhaps. A 2009 analysis by the Environmental Working Group found a whopping 315 pollutants in U.S. tap water, including arsenic (a heavy metal) and pesticides. More than half of the compounds are not regulated by the EPA, which means they can legally be present in tap water in any amount.\nFor instance, perchlorate–a currently unregulated chemical (though that’s soon to change, the EPA announced in early 2011) that’s used to make rocket fuel, flares and explosives–contaminates the drinking water of up to 26 million Americans. The chemical has been shown to reduce thyroid hormone production; experts worry about the risks it poses particularly to babies and children.\n“Potentially, even a very mild degree of low thyroid function could have an adverse effect on cognitive outcomes for a fetus. However, no studies to date have shown effects of low-level perchlorate exposure on thyroid function in pregnant women,” says Elizabeth Pearce, M.D., an endocrinologist at Boston University School of Medicine.\nIn December 2010, the Environmental Working Group also reported finding hexavalent chromium (chromium-6), the “Erin Brockovich” contaminant that the EPA considers “likely to be carcinogenic to humans,” in the drinking water of 31 U.S. cities, including Chicago and Los Angeles. In the wake of this report, the EPA is reassessing the “oral reference dose” (or upper limit of what is considered safe), with a final ruling expected by the end of the year.\nWhat You Can Do for Better Water\n–Have your water tested, especially if your water comes from a private well or you live near a plant that might use perchlorate or in an area, like parts of California, where chromium-6 is a known a problem, says Pauli Undesser, M.S., director of regulatory and technical affairs of the Water Quality Association. In fact, says Undesser, it’s a good idea for everyone to test their tap water. (Call the EPA’s Safe Water Hotline: 800-426-4791 to locate a laboratory. Cost starts around $20.)\n–Once you know what’s in your water–mercury, lead from piping or even pesticides–you can choose a filter certified by NSF International or the Water Quality Association to screen specific contaminants. Often, a $20 carbon-based Brita pitcher with a filter will do the trick. Don’t assume that bottled water is better: per the FDA, it must meet the same standards as tap.\n6. What Is Bisphenol A (BPA)?\nBPA (bisphenol A) is a chemical traditionally used to make hard, clear plastics–including food containers, reusable water bottles and some baby bottles–and the resins lining some food cans. It leaches into food, particularly acidic items, such as tomatoes, or when containers are scratched or heated. Similar in structure to estrogen, BPA is considered a so-called endocrine disruptor. Based on animal and (limited) human studies, scientists are concerned that BPA may be linked with prostate and breast cancer, infertility, heart disease and diabetes.\nWhat You Can Do to Avoid BPA\n–Store and reheat food in glass containers.\n–Drink from reusable water bottles made of glass, stainless steel or BPA-free plastic. If plastic is labeled with a “7” recycling code and not marked BPA-free, it could contain the chemical. (Unless labeled BPA-free, aluminum bottles may be lined with the compound.)\n–If you use plastic containers, choose BPA-free, don’t put them in the microwave and do hand wash them: a 2003 study found that plastic bottles released more BPA after they were cleaned in the dishwasher.\n–Opt for fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables whenever possible. For things like tuna, beans, broth and diced tomatoes, look for BPA-free packaging. Consider making broth and cooking and freezing beans.\n–Switch to a pour-over ceramic or glass coffee maker, such as Melitta or Chemex, as electric makers made of plastic can leach BPA.\n7. What Foods Contain Mercury?\nThe most common exposure to mercury–which is both naturally occurring and man-made–is from eating contaminated fish. Other sources: compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs), silver dental fillings and batteries. In high doses, mercury can harm the nervous system, heart, lungs, kidneys, and immune system; even in low levels it can affect brains of young children, which is why the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have issued seafood guidelines for children and pregnant/nursing women.\nWhat You Can Do to Avoid Mercury\n–Make smart seafood choices. Use Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch guides (seafoodwatch.org) to find low-mercury selections. (Generally, smaller fish, such as sardines, have less mercury than larger ones.) Consult fish advisories issued by your local health department. If you’re pregnant, nursing or feeding young children, follow the EPA/FDA’s guides: avoid swordfish, shark, tilefish and king mackerel; limit albacore tuna to 6 ounces and total seafood to 12 ounces per week.\n–If you do break a CFL bulb, leave the room for 10 minutes and open a window to let the room air out. To clean it up, brush it into a sealable plastic bag or glass jar with a lid using stiff cardboard and wipe the area with damp paper towels. Don’t vacuum, as that could further disperse particles. And stay calm: one CFL contains only about as much mercury as 47 servings of swordfish.

They contain a mix of toxic chemicals, including mercury, that, if swallowed, are very harmful.\n– Nicci Micco, M.S., and Kerri-Ann Jennings, M.S., R.D.\nEatingWell is a magazine and website devoted to healthy eating as a way of life.
