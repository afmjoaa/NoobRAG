{"question":"Can someone tell me what Louis Kauffman & ECS teachers have in common re: making complex topics accessible?","answer":"Both Louis Kauffman and ECS teachers emphasize making complex subjects accessible through visual and contextual connections. Kauffman discusses how topology uses logical and topological images to understand mathematical structures, making abstract concepts more comprehensible through diagrams and iconic representations. Similarly, ECS teachers make computer science accessible by connecting learning to students' personal interests and experiences, using culturally-responsive teaching methods that relate concepts to students' prior knowledge and everyday lives.","context":["INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES\nMATHED FORUM MEETING\n(joint meeting with the Fields\nCognitive Science Network)\nat 10 am- 2 pm\n222 College Street, Toronto\n10:00 - 10:10am Reports: OAME, OMCA, OCMA, CMESG, CMS, and other.\n10:10 am - 11:00 am\nDragana Martinovic (U. of Windsor)\nDigital Technologies and Mathematical Minds\nAbstract: This talk is about the different roles that technologies have or\nmight have in learning and doing mathematics.

We are looking for practices that prior educational research has identified as being equitable and effective for rigorous and active learning for all students (Darling-Hammond, 2008; National Research Council, 2000). In 2011-12, we conducted 219 weekly observations in nine Los Angeles Unified School District ECS classrooms. Through this ethnographic field research, along with several years of pre- and post-student surveys, teacher surveys, and student/teacher interviews as data sources, we have identified three strands of computer science pedagogy critical for supporting broadening participation in computing. The three strands are:\n- Computer Science Content\n- Inquiry Practices\n- Equity Practices\nIt is important to note that these strands are interwoven and inseparable, and that no strand can exist alone. The actual classroom integration of these disciplinary practices relies on the pedagogical braiding of content, inquiry, and equity-based teaching practices.\nThis online report offers a brief summary of key findings from our research. A fuller description of these findings—including observation vignettes, survey, and interview quotes—will appear in future publications that are currently in progress. When these articles are finalized for publication, they will appear on our Research & Publications page.\nClick on the question to read the findings.\n- While more traditional computer science curricula commonly focus on programming and the computer as a tool, ECS classrooms focus on the underlying problem solving and critical thinking necessary to explore computer science.\n- Teachers who closely followed the ECS curriculum scaffold learning of standard computer science topics through a spiraling format in which the first two units introduce topics, the following two units reinforce topics, and the final units allow students to apply concepts.\n- Specific “Computational Practices” taught in ECS classrooms include:\n- Analyzing the effects of developments in computing\n- Designing and implementing creative solutions and artifacts\n- Applying abstractions and models\n- Analyzing students’ own computational work and the work of others\n- Communicating computational thought processes, procedures, and results to others\n- Collaborating with peers on computing activities\n- Teachers focus on the problem-solving process instead of only emphasizing the “right” answer, recognizing that there can be multiple solutions to a problem.\n- Teachers support inquiry-based learning with starting questions and prompts that facilitate cognitively demanding thinking and exploration.\n- Teachers engage students with hands-on activities allowing students to apply and test what they know and are exploring.\n- Teachers support exploration, autonomy, risk-taking, and creativity by resisting “giving” students immediate solutions and encouraging students to make projects uniquely their own.\n- Teachers encourage collaboration through peer-to-peer learning, small group work, and in-depth whole class discussions.\n- Teachers connect computer science concepts to students’ prior knowledge and concerns.\n- Teachers employ journal writing as a tool for metacognitive reflection.\n- Teachers use guided inquiry: carefully designing, facilitating, and assessing learning opportunities so that students engage in active learning.\n- Teachers use culturally-responsive teaching that makes computer science learning relevant to students’ personal experiences and out-of-school knowledge.\n- Teachers incorporate students’ cultures and out-of-school knowledge as assets instead of deficits.\n- Teachers connect classroom learning to the social and political contexts/issues relevant to students and their communities.\n- Teachers develop caring and respectful relationships.\n- Teachers maintain high expectations for all students that counter stereotypes about who should excel in computer science.\n- Teachers create opportunities for students to broaden participation in computing outside of the classroom through internships, access to extra coursework at local community colleges, and summer programs.\nIn order to examine how teachers addressed computer science concepts, inquiry, and equity, we began by looking closely at ten teaching practice codes that emerged while analyzing classroom observations and that were also aligned with those practices cited in the curriculum. These included:\n- Connects computer science learning to equity and everyday issues;\n- Encourages collaboration;\n- Uses guided inquiry one-on-one or in small groups;\n- Encourages exploration;\n- Scaffolds learning by making explicit connections between lessons or units;\n- Facilitates guided inquiry during the development of student-driven final projects;\n- Models/Demonstrates specific computing skills or processes;\n- Uses journal writing for metacognitive reflection;\n- Introduces/Explains computer science vocabulary.\nThe graph below shows the three most common practice codes that emerged in classroom observations.\n- The most commonly observed teacher practice was connecting computer science learning to equity issues and everyday life. Six of the nine teachers’ most common teacher practice was making computer science accessible by connecting ECS learning to students’ personal interests, experiences, perspectives, and everyday lives. Also, as part of this teaching strategy, several teachers explicitly discussed equity issues emerging in the classroom and in the field of computer science.\n- The second most common teacher practice that emerged as significant across all nine classrooms was encouraging collaboration. Teachers actively facilitated the ways that students engaged with one another in collaborative activities (e.g., establishing group work norms, eliciting student responses and conversation during whole class discussions, encouraging peer to peer learning, intervening when students are not working together, assigning roles, etc.).\n- The third most common teacher practice was guided inquiry in which teachers engaged closely with one or more students, coaching them and facilitating their problem-solving and learning processes without taking over their project or computers, thereby encouraging student autonomy in learning while supporting the problem-solving process.\n- Facilitation of higher order thinking.\nTeachers varied in their facilitation of students’ higher order thinking. We coded teachers’ questions following a framework of increasing cognitive complexity using Bloom’s Taxonomy of learning objectives (Bloom & Krathwohl, 1956; Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001). The types of questions teachers asked in large-group discussions and one-on-one ranged from “remembering” (yes/no-recall) questions to “evaluating” (more analytical and cognitively challenging) questions.\n- Teachers asked more questions that involved: 1) “understanding”—checking whether or not student(s) understood a specific idea or directive, and 2) “analyzing”—requiring student(s) to distinguish between categories, compare/contrast, break material or concepts into parts, and determine how the parts related to one another and the overall structure/purpose.\n- Teachers asked fewer questions that involved: 1) “applying”—eliciting the application of a new idea to a new situation, and 2) “evaluating”—requiring that students not only apply new ideas to a new situation, but also analyze the situation and make a judgment supporting that analysis.\n- Curriculum adaptations.\nTeachers ranged in their use of the ECS curriculum, making “No Impact” adaptations, “Productive” adaptations, and “Fatal” adaptations to lessons. These categories are drawn from Seago’s (2007) characterization of adaptations to professional development materials as described below:\n- “No Impact” adaptations refer to changes made to curricular lessons that did not impact the basic design or values of the curriculum, nor made the best use of them.\n- “Productive” adaptations refer to alterations teachers made for their specific classroom contexts that maintained the design and underlying values of the curriculum while enhancing student learning.\n- “Fatal” adaptations refer to changes made to lessons or unit order that undermined critical components of the curriculum, working against the inquiry, equity, and CS learning objectives of ECS.\n- Use of journals.\nWhile all classrooms used journals for reflective writing practices, there was variation in the degree to which teachers used journals as foundations for more cognitively demanding discussions.\n- ECS professional teacher learning community developed through face-to-face professional developments and external meetings.\n- Several years of professional development and support.\n- In-classroom coaching, mentoring, and breaking of isolation.\n- Teacher willingness to reflect about their own pedagogy.\n- The Important Role of Curriculum.\nIn addition to offering learning objectives and lesson plans, the ECS curriculum provides a specific sequencing of activities that help develop and support cultural norms of collaboration, culturally relevant learning, inquiry-based exploration of computer science, and inclusiveness. This groundwork gets set early on during Units 1-2 and is an important foundation upon which teachers can develop their pedagogy and classroom learning norms. Therefore issues of curriculum adaptations (whether “No Impact,” “Productive,” or “Fatal”) are important to address and resolve.\n- The Critical Role of Pedagogy.\nVariation in teacher practice (related to inquiry, equity, and CS content) did not always coincide with depth of teachers’ prior experiences in computer science, computer science content knowledge, teacher certification subject, years teaching ECS, or years teaching in general. Effective inquiry- and equity-based teaching require an understanding of pedagogy, willingness to reflect on teaching practice, and dedication to professional growth.\n- Teacher Growth is a Multi-year Process.\nTeachers want and need sustained support from program professional development leaders, coaches, and their colleagues in order to grow in both pedagogy and content knowledge in ECS. Changing one’s pedagogical approach from more traditional lecture-based methods to one focused on inquiry and equity takes time. A single year or even two of professional development may not be enough to fully support many teachers in their craft or in the creation of their teacher learning communities.\n- Innovation and Sustainability.\nAs the flagship partnership that developed the ECS curriculum and professional development model, the Los Angeles story offers an important lesson about innovation, program growth, and implementation. Each year, the curriculum and professional development model benefited from the previous year’s experiences. There was an iterative relationship between development and implementation with communication that was often challenging and not easy between curriculum writers, professional development facilitators, researchers, teachers, and students that took place over time. The continuous refinement of the curriculum and PD model which helps strengthen the LA program and national expansion would not have been possible without multiyear funding from the National Science Foundation, time to work out complex issues, and a dedication to collaboration between university and public school district communities.\n- Broadening Participation in Computer Science.\nBroadening participation in computing must go beyond access and numbers alone. Our research brings up important questions for the CS education community: How do teachers create an inclusive learning environment and what factors engage a diverse body of students with computer science, a subject that has historically attracted only a narrow stratum of students leaving the majority feeling that they don’t belong? What is the role and impact of curriculum, inquiry-, and equity-based teaching practices on broadening participation in computing?\nAnderson, L.W. & Krathwohl, D.R. (Eds.). 2001.

The documents emphasize that electricity is dangerous enough that it's recommended to always hire professional electricians for electrical work in homes.\\n\\nFor professional electricians in construction:\\n- 1.5% experience non-fatal injuries annually\\n- 0.01% experience fatal injuries annually\\n- 62% lifetime chance of experiencing a non-fatal injury\\n- 0.49% lifetime chance of experiencing a fatal injury\\n\\nBased on this data, while both activities carry significant risks, DIY electrical work appears particularly dangerous given that power tool misuse alone accounts for 8% of all electrocutions. This supports the recommendation that electrical work should be left to licensed professionals who have proper training and safety protocols.","context":["Home Improvement, the Safe Way\nSafety tips to keep in mind as you tackle DIY projectsBy Dale Lambert\nWith more time spent at home over the past year, many of us are finding new, creative ways to enhance and improve our homes. Tackling do-it-yourself (DIY) projects can be fun and cost-effective, and some projects can also make your home more energy efficient, providing an opportunity to save on energy bills.\nSo why not roll up those sleeves and get started? Whether you’re painting the front door with a fresh hue or finally upgrading those patio lights, successfully completing a DIY home project is incredibly satisfying. But many of these projects do not come without risks. Here are a few safety tips to keep in mind as you get to work, courtesy of the Electrical Safety Foundation International.\nSelect a designated work area\nThe amount of space you’ll need will depend on the size and scope of your project, but make sure you have adequate lighting and ventilation (if necessary). Required tools and equipment should be located in your workspace and organized for easy access.\nUse the right personal protective equipment (PPE)\nInvesting a few bucks in PPE is essential for most home projects. Stock up on safety goggles, dust masks, ear plugs (or noise reduction ear protectors), gloves and any other kind of protection you’ll need for your project. Remember to wear appropriate clothing and shoes.\nLeave electrical work to the pros\nElectricity is no joke — when mishandled it can cause serious injury or death — and it’s well worth hiring a qualified, licensed electrician to perform any electrical work in your home. If taking on smaller electrical work yourself, always turn off the power to the circuit that you plan to work on by switching off the circuit breaker in the main service panel and testing the circuit to verify the power is off.\nWork slowly and clean as you go\nWhen you rush through a DIY project, you’ll likely end up with less desirable results than you intended, or worse, you could make a costly or dangerous mistake. Take your time and remember that you are in control of the project. You should also clean as you go to ensure a safer workspace.\nBe cautious with power tools\nAnnually, 8 percent of electrocutions in the U.S. are attributed to improper use of power tools.\n- Use ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) with every power tool to protect against electrical shock.\n- Never use power tools near live electrical wires or water pipes.\n- Use extreme caution when cutting or drilling into walls where electrical wires or water pipes could be accidentally touched or penetrated.\n- If a power tool trips a safety device while in use, take the tool to a manufacturer-authorized repair center for service.\n- Do not use power tools without the proper guards.\n- When using a wet-dry vacuum cleaner or a pressure washer, be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions to avoid electrical shock.\nEnjoy working around your home this spring, and remember: you should only tackle DIY home projects within your skill and comfort level.\nAbout the AuthorDale Lambert is CEO for Randolph EMC, located in Asheboro.\nDIY projects to tackle safely","While advances in modern equipment and building techniques have made construction projects much safer than those of yesteryear, there are still a number of risks involved.\nRegardless of the specific occupation they’re in, construction workers put themselves at risk every day to provide us with the comfort, safety, and luxuries we’ve come accustomed to.\nInjuries are very common in the industry. In fact, one out of every ten construction workers experiences an injury every year according to the OHSA (Occupational Health and Safety Administration).\nThe construction industry is comprised of many different trades. Each job comes with its own set of hazards and risks. With that being said, injuries are completely avoidable if you know what to look out for and how to work safely.\n18 common construction occupations and their associated risks.\n- The odds of experiencing an injury are expressed as a percentage. The percentages represent the chances of injury over a 50 FTE period, which is equal to 2,000 hours worked.\n#18 Construction Manager\nConstruction managers are responsible for overseeing a project. They’ll manage various different trades to ensure that the work is done correctly and on schedule. Typically, managers will monitor the progress of work being done and make sure that the various contracting positions work together to create the final product.\nBecause they have their hand in every job, they’re susceptible to virtually every hazard. Common injuries among construction managers include falls, foot injuries from heavy objects, and electrical shocks. About 0.2% of all managers experience a non-fatal injury each year while 0.0035% experience fatal injuries. The lifetime risk of injuries as a construction manager is 12.7% for non-fatal and 0.43% for fatal.\nApproximately0.8% of painters experience a non-fatal injury each year. 0.007% suffer from a fatal injury. Painters typically work on completed construction projects to cover walls and ceilings.\nThe biggest riskin this trade is a slip and fall accident. Surfaces are often covered in slick paint that can lead to a serious injury if the proper footwear isn’t worn. Additional injuries include rotary cuff tears and muscle sprains. If you’re a painter, your lifetime risk for a non-fatal injury is 39%. The odds of experiencing a fatal injury throughout your life is 0.3%.\nConstruction projects utilize the skills of many foremen to oversee the quality of specific trades. Each task of the job may have a foreman monitoring progress to ensure that the final product meets code and aesthetic guidelines.\nThe exact hazards a foreman will face will depend on the trade they’re performing. Common injuries occur from slips and fall accidents and machinery. Approximately 1.18% of foremen experience a non-fatal injury each year while fatal injuries make up about 0.014%. The lifetime risk assessment for non-fatal injuries is 52.8% with fatal injuries at around 0.49%\n#15 Drywall Installer\nDrywall installers work on interior walls and ceilings to provide a finished look to construction projects. About 1.19% of drywall specialists experience an injury each year. 0.0038% experience a fatal injury.\nInjuries often occur when work is being performed overhead or on high platforms. About a third are a result of being struck by a falling object. Another common hazard to be wary of is slipping and falling from tall heights. Drywall workers have a 53.2% chance of experiencing an injury throughout their career. The lifetime risk for fatal injuries is much lower at 0.24%.\n#14 Operating Engineer\nRegardless of how small or large a construction project is, there’s likely an operating engineer at the helm of a large piece of machinery. These specialists work with heavy-duty equipment like bulldozers, pile-drivers, and much more.\nWhile they’re often off the ground and surrounding by a durable cockpit of metal, they can still experience injuries.\nIt’s not uncommon for operating engineers to experience electrical shocks and muscle pain from the jolt of the equipment. Falling debris can also injure workers that may be outside of the cockpit. About 1.27% of all operating engineers experience a non-fatal injury every year while 0.014 suffer from a fatal injury. The risk of experiencing a non-fatal injury and fatal injury throughout your career are roughly 56.7% and 0.73% respectively\nBrick masonry requires workers to lift heavy loads of bricks. Depending on the particular application, brickmasons may have to apply the brick at tall heights or on vertical planes overhead. As a result, workers in the trade are at risk for slip and fall accidents and injuries from falling bricks.\nInferior foot support and technique may also lead to fatigue and musculoskeletal injuries. About 1.36% of workers experience a non-fatal injury every year while 0.008% experience a fatal one. The overall lifetime risk of experiencing an injury is 57.6%. The risk for experiencing a fatal injury during your career is 0.39%.\nWelders are constantly exposed to high temperatures and extreme voltages. Works are at risk of experiencing burns to their face, arms, and legs. If improper footwear is worn, there’s also a risk of electrical shock from the voltage required to weld.\nWelders are also at risk for eye issues if the proper headgear isn’t worn. About 1.39% of welders experience an injury that requires downtime each year. 0.02% suffer from an injury that’s fatal. If you’re a welder, your lifetime risk of experiencing an injury lies at 59.6%. There’s also a 0.88% chance of sustaining fatal injuries.\n#11 Power Line Installer\nPower-line installers are responsible for connecting the local power grid to a new property. They may also connect high-voltage equipment and lines.\nBecause power lines are typically located high above the ground, workers at risk for falling. While safety measures are utilized to prevent accidents, there’s still risk involved. Installers are also susceptible to electrocution from the lines. In a typical year, approximately 2.1% of workers sustain non-life threatening injuries while 0.05% suffer from catastrophic injuries that result in death. The lifetime risk of experiencing an injury is 60%. For fatal injuries, the risk is 2.6%\nIn the construction industry, about 1.5% of all electricians experience a non-fatal injury every year. 0.01% suffer from a fatal injury.\nElectricians are tasked with creating the network of electrical lines throughout a building. They work with outlets, breakers, appliances, and much more. This puts them at risk for electrical shock. Depending on the particular worksite, they may also run into problems with slipping or falling from tall heights. Throughout their career as an electrician, workers have a 62% chance of experiencing an injury they can recover from. There’s also a 0.49% risk of sustaining a life-threatening injury.\nThe types of injuries plumbers are at risk for is vast. Plumbers typically work in slippery environments that could result in falls. If metal pipes are involved, there’s also a risk of experiencing burns or electrical shocks.\nThere’re also susceptible to sprains and abrasive injuries due to their equipment. About 2% of plumbers suffer from an injury that requires time off. Luckily only 0.008% suffer from an injury that results in death each year. Throughout their lifetime, plumbers have a 69.8% chance of non-fatal injuries and a 0.32% chance of fatal injuries.\nRoughly 1.8% of roofers experience an injury every year that requires medical care. 0.03% sustain serious injuries that result in death. This is due to the danger of working on top of buildings.\nEven on single-story houses, roofers are at risk for falling. Falling can result in serious health complications that last a lifetime. Not only that, but roofers are also susceptible to injuries on their feet from the abrasive roofing material and sharp nails that can penetrate traditional shoes. The odds of experiencing a non-fatal injury during your career as a roofer is 69.8%. The risks for fatal injuries is much lower at 1.42%\n#7 Heat and A/C Mechani\nHeat and A/C technicians work with a number of heavy equipment. In some cases, they may work from dangerous heights. Injuries like sprains are common. Injuries from the electrical equipment and various chemicals are also possible.\nDepending on the job, mechanics may also be susceptible to serious burns. On average, about 1.9% of workers sustain an injury. Approximately 0.006% of injuries are fatal. The lifetime risk assessment for this profession is 71.1% for non-fatal injuries. There’s a 0.37% chance of experiencing a fatal injury throughout a worker’s lifetime.\nThe specific task and work environment for carpenters varies quite a bit. However, similar hazards are present regardless of the job. Carpenters work with heavy wood, sharp nails, and powerful equipment. Injuries from equipment can lead to serious lacerations and punctures that require immediate medical attention.\nFurthermore, carpenters are often at risk for falling if they’re working on projects overhead. About 1.7% of carpenters experience an injury each year. Roughly 0.006% of carpenters suffer from a severe injury that results in death. Throughout a carpenter’s career, their risk for non-fatal and fatal injuries is 73.1% and 0.32% respectively.\n#5 Truck Driver\nTruck drivers are tasked with the job of moving construction materials to the work site. While there are many safety protocols that workers must adhere to, drivers are still susceptible to injuries when they work.\nAbout 2.4% of all truck drivers experience an injury every year. 0.02% experience an injury that’s fatal. Aside from the traditional dangers of being on the road, drivers are at risk for musculoskeletal injuries from handling their cargo. Sprains, fractures, abrasive damage, and foot fatigue are all common. Throughout your career as a driver, the odds of experiencing a non-fatal injury is 75.5%. The chances of sustaining fatal injuries is considerably lower at 1.1%\nLaborers have a unique job on the construction site. Unlike other trades, there’s not a specific task they’re trained to do. Instead, they help out with a variety of different jobs. In many cases, laborers are given quick training sessions to perform jobs. Unfortunately, this results in roughly 2.1% of laborers to experience an injury every year.\n0.017% sustain grave injuries that result in death. The hazards they may face vary based on the particular job. They can be faced with falling debris, crushing accidents from heavy loads, slips, and much more. The chances of experiencing an injury throughout your career as a laborer are at 89.9%. The odds of a fatal injury are at 1.04%\nIronworkers have a high risk of experiencing an injury throughout their career. There’s a 90% chance of a non-fatal occurring at some point throughout their lives and a 3.11% chance of suffering from an injury that results in death. This is because ironworkers often perform their jobs on high skyscrapers.\nFalling is one of the leading causes of death in the profession. There’s also the risk of getting struck by swinging objects or getting a jolt from electrical equipment. Every year, roughly 2.9% of ironworkers suffer from injuries. 0.03% of ironworkers experience a fatal injury.\n#2 Sheet Metal Worker\nSome common injuries that occur amongst sheet metal workers involve the material they’re working with. The sharp edges of metal can easily slice through skin that’s not protected. If they’re working at tall heights, they’re also at risk for being struck by objects or falling.\nDepending on their particular job, metal workers should also be wary of their equipment, as misuse can lead to burns or electrocution. About 4.01% of all sheet metal workers experience an injury. The rate of fatal injuries is substantially lower at 0.0048%. The odds of metal sheet workers to experience an injury during their career is at 91.7%.\nAs the title of the occupation implies, construction helpers assist tradesmen with a variety of different tasks. In most cases, helpers will perform basic tasks that require little training, such as carrying materials throughout the worksite. Unfortunately, this lack of training results in injuries to 5.1% of all helpers. About 0.001% of helpers die from their injuries.\nConstruction helpers are susceptible to a variety of hazards. These include being struck by falling objects, stepping on sharp materials, electrocution, and much more. Because they often work throughout the construction site, helpers are at risk the most. Throughout their careers, there’s a 95.9% chance for helpers to experience a non-fatal injury.\nHow To Reduce the Odds of Getting Injured\nWhile the odds of getting injured may be a bit off-putting, it’s important to know what you’re up against when you clock into work every day. Despite working in a dangerous profession, there’s a lot you can do to reduce the chances of experiencing an injury.\nIt’s important to consider the following tips from the very first day on the job. Up to 60% of all construction injuries occur during the first year. With that being said, even seasoned construction workers need to know how to avoid harm. With these tips in mind, you can beat the odds and create a safer work environment for you and your colleagues.\n1. Wear the Right Safety Gear\nThe right safety gear should always be your top priority before you start a task. Even if you’ve performed the same job for years, there’s still a chance an accident can occur. Hazards are present everywhere, so you need to make sure you have all the bases covered. Invest in a high-quality pair of work boots, a hard hat, protective eyewear, and durable clothing. You should also find gear that’s specifically catered to your occupation.\nBeyond the hazards that everyone on the site has to be wary of, each trade is faced with their own unique risks. If you’re an electrician, invest in boots that are shockproof. If you’re a welder, utilize fabric guards that’ll keep you safe from sparks. It’s a good idea to evaluate your job and pick up gear that protects you from any problem that may occur.\n2. Keep Your Work Area Clean\nConstruction sites are notorious for being messy. Debris and construction materials will often litter the work site. This can lead to a variety of different accidents. You can easily slip on spilled liquids or puncture your feet from a stray nail. One of the most effective ways of reducing the chances of injury is to keep your work area as clean as possible. It’s recommended that you pick up your tools as soon as you’re done with a specific task. Excess building materials should be dealt with accordingly. Doing this will decrease the numbers of hazards around you and make it less likely for you to experience an unnecessary injury.\n3. Heed the Warning Signs\nOne of the best ways you can avoid injury is to simply be aware of the hazards around you. By law, work sites need to have warning signs around dangerous areas. You need to be aware of the signs and heed their warnings, even if you don’t see an immediate sign of danger. If you spot a hazard that doesn’t have a sign, you need to report it to your employer or union representative to ensure that accidents don’t occur. Signs are often placed around live wires, areas where debris can fall, near spills, and much more. Whether the sign indicates the specific hazard ahead or not, it’s important that you only enter the area when you have the appropriate gear on.\n4. Participate in Training and Safety Meetings\nSafety and operational training sessions are essential for staying out of harm’s way. With all the heavy-duty machinery and tools present on a worksite, there’s always a chance for injury. Those odds increase if you’re not qualified or properly trained to handle it.\nSafety meetings are typically conducted every day. It’s important that you pay attention to the briefing and comply with all safety protocols. The environment and hazards will change as the construction project progresses. New issues may arise that you need to wary of. Paying attention could make all the difference.\n5. Keep Tools in Good Condition\nTools and machinery wear out over time, especially when they’re put through constant stress. Whether you work with a simple drill or a large bulldozer, you need to make sure that the equipment is in good working condition before you start a job. Tools should be inspected regularly to ensure that they won’t malfunction when they’re in use. If the tool isn’t operating the way it should be, put it through maintenance and use an alternative that works.\n6. Take Breaks and Eat Healthy\nFatigue is a leading cause of injury in the workplace. Overworking yourself will cause you to lose focus. It’s better to take frequent breaks and remain energized throughout the day than to work yourself until you start making careless mistakes. You should use your break to rehydrate and consume healthy snacks that can prolong your energy levels.\nFoods that are high in grease and carbohydrates should be avoided. The same goes for sweet carbonated drinks. Your body needs adequate fuel to operate efficiently throughout the day. The best things for your body are water and light snacks. Go with drinks that are filled with electrolytes. Consume protein and nutrient-rich foods. You should avoid a high level or carbohydrates at all costs, as it can lead to drowsiness.\n7. Stay Out of the Sun as Much as Possible\nToo much exposure to the sun causes about 15% of all construction injuries according to the Center for Construction Work and Training. Constant exposure to high temperatures can make your body feel fatigued much quicker. It’s good to cover up as much as possible. Go with a long-sleeve shirt that’s breathable. Invest in a safety hat that has a wide brim to keep the sun off your eyes.\nTo sum up, working in the construction industry has its risks. No matter what your occupational trade is, there are many hazards you need to be aware of. By understanding what types of injuries you’re at risk for, you can stay alert and avoid injury."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c0681280-a929-4070-94b9-75dc1724df6f>","<urn:uuid:069fbf5d-26ba-4658-bc90-266a7a9abc27>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Cómo ha evolucionado el uso del cuero a lo largo de la historia y qué colores y tamaños podemos encontrar hoy en día en las alfombras de piel de vaca? 🧐","answer":"Leather has played a vital role in civilization since prehistoric times, with humans using animal skins for clothing, shelter, and even armor. Ancient societies in Egypt (1300 BC), Greece (1200 BC), China, and North America all developed leather-making techniques independently. As for modern cowhide rugs, they come in various natural colors including black, white, brown, and shades of grey, often featuring unique patterns or markings. These rugs are available in a range of sizes, from small accent pieces to large area rugs, and can even be custom-made to fit specific spaces.","context":["Leather Type & Care\nLEATHER GARMENTS AND ACCESSORIES CARE:\nLeather garments must be hung on hangers so that their shape is maintained. Leather apparel must be prevented from direct sunlight.\nMost of the time you can clean the leather yourself. Smooth leather that has a finish can be cleaned with a damp cloth or sponge to get rid of dust and surface soil. Mild liquid detergent or saddle soap and water may be used to remove more serious dirt or stains. It is a good practice before you dampen leather is to test an inside seem to see if the leather has a finish. Water will bead on finished leather but will cause unfinished leather to spot. It a suede leather garment gets a spot, try using a suede brush or fine sandpaper.\nIf you need to remove wrinkles from your leather garment, you may do the following, but take great care. To remove wrinkles you may use an iron but do NOT put iron directly in contact with leather. Use a 100% COTTON cloth in between the leather garment and the iron. Do not use high heat with the iron either and do not leave the iron on the garment for very long. You can also try using a blow dryer but do not put in direct contact with leather. If the garment is not too badly wrinkled, then the blow dryer may work. Always use extreme caution and patience.\nSEAL AND RUBDOWN\nGive the leather a fine dusting with baby powder to seal the pores. Finish with a rubdown using a clean dry cloth to bring back the sheen. A wrinkled garment can be hung in the bathroom while you shower. If the wrinkles don’t steam out by themselves, gently iron the garment at a warm setting after layering clean brown paper between the iron and the leather. Store your leather garment in a well-ventilated area and cover with a cloth to keep it dust free. Avoid storing your leather garment in plastic. Leather is porous and it needs to “breathe”.\nYou can waterproof and protect your leather garment by feeding it with mink oil or silicone spray. However, the process will most likely darken your leather. So it�s a good idea to test it first on a tiny area on the inside seam. If you are caught in a shower with an untreated leather garment, allow your leather garment to dry on a flat surface away from heat. Leather should dry at room temperature overnight. Remember, the radiator is no place to dry leather — excess heat saps up the leather’s essential oils and can leave it hard and cracked. If your leather garment gets wet, hang it on a wooden or padded hanger away from heat to dry.\nHOW TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR COW HIDE\nCowhide hair-on-hide is best used in an inside home environment.\nYou can fold your cowhide rug, but it will need some time to relax after it is unfolded. If the hide is good quality, the creases will come out after a few days laying flat. A heavy weight like books can speed up this process. You can also use steam iron on the underside to reduce creases more quickly.\nCowhide does not move much on carpet or wooden floors, the textured underside has natural grip. You do need to be a bit careful in bare feet on the soft and silky upper side.\nWe advise keeping the dyed and printed hides out of direct sunlight to avoid any possible fading. Natural cowhides are fade resistant. To clean your cowhide rug, simply vacuum with the vacuum head brush in the down position (for hard floors) or give the rug a shake outside to take out dust and small dry particles of dirt. turn around your rug or move to a different place from time to time so that it wears evenly.\nYou can wipe cowhide smoothly in the direction of the hair with a damp (but not wet) cloth with mild soap and water. It is important to note that soaking the hide or getting it too wet may damage it. NEVER wash in a washing machine or dry clean.\nYou can Brush with a hard plastic brush. It helps to keep the hair soft and fluffy and helps to remove dirt.\nFor common spills like coffee, tea, juice, food, soup, urine and vomit – soak up the spills with a paper towel or sponge immediately. Remove solid matters with the blunt edge of knife by scraping gently in the direction of the hair. Then clean with a damp (but not wet) sponge or cloth using mild soapy solution. Finally clean with a damp cloth using a diluted 5% white vinegar and 95% water solution. This helps to eliminate unpleasant odors.\nFor spills like fat, grease, lipstick, tar and chewing gum – Remove solid matter with the blunt edge of knife by scraping gently in the direction of the hair. Then apply Eucalyptus oil directly to the affected area on a soft cloth by dabbing gently. Finally clean with a damp (but not wet) sponge or cloth using a mild soapy solution. We cannot promise that this will take out your stain, but it the best method of trying. You have to do this at your own risk.\nIt is not good for Cowhides to be damp or wet for long periods, try your best to avoid this. On a sunny day you can put your cowhide outside with the underside facing the sun to air out. Store your cowhide in a dry, well ventilated place, preferably rolled around a tube core with a clean cotton sheet to protect from dust and dirt while in storage.\nHistory of Leather\nThe role of Leather is very important in the development of civilization. From prehistoric times humans have used the skins of animals to fulfill their basic needs. They have used hides to make clothing, shelter, carpets and even decorative outfits. From leather, manmade footwear, belts, clothing, containers for liquids, boats and even armor. The basic protective shield of the Roman soldier was a heavy leather shirt.\nIn recorded history, pieces of leather dating from 1300 B.C. have been found in Egypt. ancient societies in Europe, Asia and North America all developed the method of turning skins into leather goods separately of one another. The Greeks were using leather garments in the age of the Homeric heroes (about 1200 B.C.), and the use of leather later spread throughout the Roman Empire. During the middle Ages, the Chinese people knew the technique of making leather. The Indians of North America also had developed great skills in leather work.\nAt some time, by accident or by trial and error, men discovered methods of preserving and softening leather. treating animal skins with things such as smoke, grease and bark extracts. In ancient societies, the art was a closely guarded secret passed down from father to son. As civilization developed in Europe, tanners and leather workers united in the trade guilds of the middle Ages, as did the craftsmen in other fields. Royal charters or licenses were issued permitting people to practice leather tanning. In the nineteenth century, vegetable tanning, i.e., tanning using the extracts from the bark of certain kinds of trees, was supplemented by chrome tanning.\nHow leather is sold\nThe most economical way to purchase leather is to buy it directly from the tannery. Leather is usually priced by the square foot and sold as a complete hide. The exact size, to the nearest 1/4 sq.ft. is measured on government approved measuring machines at the tannery. Purchasing leather this way, you are assured of getting value for money.\nLeathers come from tanneries in various shapes and sizes depending on its intended use and the animal source which it came from. One thing to always remember about leather – it is an animal�s skin that has been processed into finished leather, not a synthetic material. therefore, you will find each skin will be different in shape and size from another.\nFor easy handling during tanning procedures, large animal hides are usually cut into smaller sections (sides, shoulders, bellies, etc.) at the tannery. Skins of smaller animals such as calf, goat, pig and reptiles are tanned and sold in their original shape. Although leather is sometimes cut into various shapes for the convenience of the client, the price is always upper because of the additional costs for labor and waste.\nBuying leather becomes much easier if you understand what the different types of leather are used for, how different leathers are tanned and how large skins are cut and sold.\nTo make leather a uniform thickness, initially the hides are run through a splitting machine. As animal hides are not of uniform thickness, and since they are wet when they are put through the splitting machine, the thickness of the leather will not be the same throughout the hide. There will always be slight difference and that is why leathers are usually shown with a range of thickness – such as 0.6 -0.8mm 2.0 � 2.6mm., etc.","Cowhide rugs are becoming increasingly popular in home decor.

{"question":"How does water damage coverage differ between homeowners insurance and flood insurance? 🏠💧","answer":"Homeowners insurance and flood insurance cover different types of water damage. Homeowners insurance typically covers water damage that occurs before water contacts the ground, such as damage from severe rainstorms, burst pipes, or hailstorms breaking windows. In contrast, flood insurance specifically covers damage from water that rises from the ground and enters buildings, including overflow of inland waters, unusual surface water accumulation, or mudflow. Standard homeowners insurance explicitly excludes flood damage, which requires separate coverage through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).","context":["Understanding the Limitations of Homeowners InsuranceAs a homeowner, it is important to understand the limitations of your homeowners insurance policy. While it is designed to protect you from a range of potential risks and liabilities, there are some events and scenarios that are not covered under your policy. That’s why it’s crucial to read your policy carefully and understand what is and isn’t covered.\nThe Fine Print: What Homeowners Insurance Does Not CoverIt’s essential to read the fine print of your homeowners insurance policy to understand what is not covered. Some of the most notable exclusions include:\n- Natural disasters: As mentioned, homeowners insurance does not cover damage caused by earthquakes, floods, or landslides.\n- Home maintenance: If damage occurs due to wear and tear or lack of maintenance, it is not covered. For example, if a storm damages your roof, but it was already in poor condition, any repairs or replacements may not be covered by your policy.\n- Criminal activity: If damage occurs as a result of criminal activity such as theft or vandalism, it may not be covered.\n- Business activities: If your home is being used for business purposes and damage occurs, it may not be covered under your standard homeowners policy.\nWhy Natural Disasters Are Excluded from Homeowners InsuranceThe reason natural disasters are excluded from homeowners insurance policies is that they are considered high-risk events, and the potential insurance payouts can be significant. As a result, insurance companies typically require homeowners to purchase additional coverage or riders to protect against these types of events. Even with additional coverage, there may be exclusions and limitations based on the specific circumstances of the event. For example, earthquake insurance may not cover damage to your swimming pool, while flood insurance may not cover damage to your seawall.\nA Closer Look at Flood, Earthquake, and Landslide CoverageWhile standard homeowners insurance policies do not cover natural disasters, there are additional insurance policies available to help homeowners protect against specific risks. Flood insurance: Flood insurance is available through the National Flood Insurance Program and private insurance companies. It offers protection against damage caused by flooding, which is not covered under a standard homeowners policy. However, it’s essential to note that flood insurance typically has a waiting period of 30 days before coverage kicks in. Earthquake insurance: Earthquake insurance is available as a separate policy or as an add-on to your homeowners policy. It offers protection against damage caused by earthquakes, which are not covered under a standard policy. However, earthquake insurance can be expensive, and deductibles are often high. Landslide insurance: Landslide insurance is much more limited than flood and earthquake insurance and is only available in certain areas. It offers protection against damage caused by landslides or mudslides, but coverage is typically limited to damage to the structure of your home and not the land around it.\nWhat Homeowners Can Do to Protect Against Natural DisastersIn addition to purchasing additional insurance coverage, there are several steps homeowners can take to protect their homes against natural disasters.\n- Invest in home maintenance: By keeping your home in good condition, you can reduce the risk of damage from natural disasters and increase the chances of coverage from your insurance policy.\n- Prepare for disasters: By having an emergency plan in place, you can minimize the risk of damage and make the claims process smoother if there is damage.\n- Consider home improvements: Installing features such as a sump pump or reinforced roofing can help protect against damage from floods or high winds.","The risk of a flood is real, and unfortunately, many property owners don’t think about the hazard of a flood until the water is creeping up to their front door.\nThe purpose of this article is to provide basic information on flood insurance so that our clients, community, and all consumers understand the risk of flood and are able to make a more informed decision on whether or not flood insurance is right for you.\nWhat is Considered a Flood in the Insurance Community?\nThe basic definition of a flood is as follows:\nA general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of 2 or more acres of normally dry land area or of 2 or more properties (at least 1 of which is the policyholder’s property) from:\n- Overflow of inland or tidal waters;\n- Unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;\n- Mudflow; or\n- Collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels that result in a flood as defined above.\nTo take this one step further, consider this scenario.\nA large truck loses control driving through a residential neighborhood and smashes into a fire hydrant. The hydrant explodes and spills water throughout the street and enters several nearby homes. This IS considered a flood. No rain, no storm, no overflowing river or dam breach. By definition, any water from the ground that rises and enters land or buildings, no matter the source, is considered a flood.\nDoes My Homeowners’ or Commercial Building Insurance Policy Cover Flood?\nThe answer to this question is likely no. If you didn’t make a conscious decision to purchase flood insurance, then you probably don’t have this coverage. Most homeowners’ policies and commercial building policies specifically exclude flood. This must be purchased through the National Flood Insurance Program. There are some commercial insurance carriers that do offer endorsements to cover flood; but again, this is a conscious purchase decision you must make and it is not automatically included or in some cases even offered.\nHow Much Does Flood Insurance Cost?\nCurrently, the NFIP reports that the average national annual cost of flood insurance is about $700 per policy.\nOf course, the cost depends on many factors this article has already addressed, most specifically location. Your rate is determined by which flood zone your building is located in. Our agency has a complete staff of professionals who can quickly determine your zone and other factors in order to calculate the rate.\nDoes My Auto Insurance Cover Flood?\nFlood claims are covered under the comprehensive coverage section of your auto policy and are subject to your comprehensive deductible. Collision coverage covers damage to your automobile in the event you are at fault in an accident. The comprehensive coverage section of your auto policy covers things like hail damage, theft, fire, and yes…flood.\nIt is important to purchase comprehensive coverage before you think you will need it, because insurance companies will issue a moratorium (quit selling) in areas that are currently experiencing an increased risk of a natural disaster. For instance, an insurance carrier may cease to offer comprehensive coverage in Florida when a hurricane warning is in effect.\nWhat Water Damage IS Covered Under My Homeowners or Commercial Property Insurance?\nLet’s say water enters your home or building through the roof, windows, sewer backup, broken pipes, sprinkler leakage or from extreme torrential rains.\nThese scenarios usually fall under what is simply called water damage. Water damage is typically covered under homeowners and commercial property insurance; however, you should read your policy carefully to determine exactly what kind of water damage the insurer will pay for and if there is a monetary limitation to any of the above specific hazards. In general, water damage differs from flood damage in that it occurs before the water comes in contact with the ground. That could mean damage caused by something such as a severe rainstorm, pipes bursting, or a hailstorm that breaks your windows and allows water into your home.\nIf water damage extends to your yard, (e.g. a backyard pool leaks and ruins your lawn) that damage will most likely not be covered. You may also have trouble convincing an insurance company to cover damage caused by a maintenance problem that they believe should have been repaired – like a leaky roof that lets rain in. It is imperative that you understand exactly what damage your policy covers so you are aware of its limitations and the amount of risk you are taking before water damage occurs.\nWhat is the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)?\nLegislation to institute the NFIP was passed in 1968. Prior to 1950, homeowners had to purchase different policies to cover separate perils. It wasn’t until later in the 50’s that the Homeowners policy was formed to allow homeowners to purchase an “all risk” policy. The peril of flood was removed due to the frequency and costs associated with this particular peril and the policy premiums charged could not support the claims cost. Thus, the NFIP was born.\nWhat is FEMA?\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was created in 1978 and later implemented on April 1, 1979. The primary purpose of FEMA is to coordinate recovery efforts and respond to any disaster that occurs within the United States whether natural or man-made. Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress created the Department of Homeland Security. In March, 2003 FEMA was absorbed into this new agency. FEMA has several responsibilities, but as it pertains to this article we will focus on its role pertaining to flood disasters and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Although they don’t set flood insurance rates, FEMA does play a significant role in managing the NFIP, specifically:\n- Hazard identification and mapping, in which engineering studies are conducted and flood maps are prepared to delineate areas that are predicted to be subject to flooding under certain conditions.\n- Floodplain management criteria, which establish the minimum requirements for communities to adopt and apply to development within mapped flood hazard areas; and\n- Flood insurance, which provides financial protection for property owners to cover flood-related damage and contents.\nAm I in a Flood Zone?\nThe answer to this question is most likely yes. FEMA has prepared floodplain maps and developed flood hazard data for most communities in the country. Chances are you are in a Flood Zone. It is just a matter of which one.\nThe maps and data are used for several purposes:\nCommunities, States and Federal agencies use them as the basis for the regulating new flood prone construction, insurance agents use them when rating flood insurance policies, and lenders and federal agencies use them to determine when flood insurance must be purchased as a condition of extending a loan or financial assistance.\nWhat Claims Does Flood Insurance Actually Cover?\nThere are two coverage items within the NFIP policy.\n- Your actual home (building property) up to $250,000.\n(If you need higher limits, you may consider Excess Flood coverage offered by private companies.)\n- Your personal property up to $100,000.\nYou can purchase one or both of these coverages.\nNFIP’s building property policy covers the cost to rebuild or the actual value of your home, whichever is less. Items covered under this policy include:\n- Your home and its foundation\n- Electrical and plumbing systems\n- HVAC equipment including air conditioners, furnaces and water heaters\n- Kitchen appliances, including your refrigerator, stove and built-in appliances such as your dishwasher\n- Permanently installed carpeting over an unfinished floor\n- Permanently installed wallboard, paneling, bookcases and cabinets\n- Window blinds\n- Detached garages (limited to 10% of the coverage limit on your policy)\n- Debris removal\nThe NFIP policy that covers your personal property will provide coverage for items like:\n- Clothing, furniture, and electronic equipment\n- Window A/C units\n- Portable microwaves and dishwashers\n- Carpets not covered by your building policy\n- Washers &dryers\n- Your freezer and frozen food\n- Up to $2,500 in valuables, such as art and furs\nNote: Personal property claims are paid based on actual cash value which considers age and depreciation — not what you paid for them.\nWhat Claims are Excluded on Flood Insurance?\nIf it belongs in a safe or bank, it is not covered:\nPrecious metals, stock certificates, bearer bonds, and cash.\nOther items not covered:\nTrees, plants, wells, septic systems, walkways, decks, patios, fences, hot tubs, swimming pools, boat houses, retaining walls, storm shelters, temporary housing and other living expenses, loss of income, automobiles, post-flood mold damage, and sewer backups.\nDisclaimer: While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this article, it is not intended to be exhaustive or provide advice specific to your individual situation.

{"question":"Do I need a permit for my indoor mural?","answer":"For indoor murals, permits are typically not necessary. However, if the mural is part of a property that is designated as a San Francisco Landmark, you would be severely restricted from making alterations to its appearance. Additionally, it's important to note that if the mural was commissioned through a binding contract with an artist, you could be bound by that agreement and might face liability for any modifications. The wall will need to be properly prepared and primed before the mural can be applied, and multiple days should be allowed for completion due to necessary drying times between layers.","context":["Mural Best Practices\nCommissioning a mural offers more than just an opportunity to showcase your company or brand—it also enriches your employees and the community. To ensure the success of your mural project, consider these strategies.\nBefore embarking on a mural project, it's crucial to establish a clear timeline. Various factors such as design considerations, permits, easements, lift rentals, and payment arrangements can impact the project's schedule. By defining your desired delivery date upfront, we can work together to ensure the project stays on track. As the painting process unfolds, factors like mural size, surface type, detailing, paint types, weather conditions, and project complexity will also influence the timeline. It's worth noting that extreme weather conditions, such as temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit or dropping below 30 degrees Fahrenheit, can result in a price increase of over 25% due to the added challenges they pose.\nPermits & Permission\nWhen planning a mural, it's essential to consider permits and permissions. For indoor murals, obtaining permits might not be necessary, but outdoor murals often require approvals depending on location, design, and materials. For JC, in the case of murals taller than 9 feet, a lift is required, and permission might be needed from adjacent property owners to use the lift on their premises.\nDistinguishing between a mural and a sign is important, as requirements can differ based on this classification. In certain places like Chicago, artists might be allowed to acknowledge sponsors or partners of the art mural within a designated acknowledgment panel, not exceeding two square feet in size and located adjacent to the bottom edge of the mural.\nIn scenarios where a mural might obstruct sidewalks, alleys, or streets, a Right of Way Permit might be necessary to manage the potential disruptions caused.\nThe responsibility for securing all necessary permits and permissions falls upon the person or business commissioning the mural.\nBefore initiating the mural painting process, it's essential to evaluate the current condition of the wall surface. Typically, the wall will need to be primed before the mural can be applied. Addressing any necessary repairs should be a priority, and these repairs should be completed before beginning the mural painting process. While JC doesn't handle wall repairs directly, arrangements can be made to have the wall prepared and primed by one of his preferred vendors for an additional cost.\nWhether working indoors or outdoors, it's important to establish a reasonable timeline that accounts for drying times. These drying times can vary based on factors such as weather, location, and materials used. JC typically employs layering techniques in his work, so it's important to understand that even for smaller murals, completion might span multiple days.\nGiven that weather conditions can impact mural painting, JC might need to adjust the scheduled creation day to accommodate any weather-related delays. Even if the current day is sunny, prior weather disruptions might necessitate a slight postponement.\nTo ensure the longevity of your mural, consider applying a protective varnish. This step includes coatings that deter graffiti from adhering and UV protection to prevent fading, particularly for outdoor murals or those exposed to direct sunlight indoors. While these protective coatings are not part of the standard mural project, JC can assist in contracting these services through his preferred vendors for an additional cost.\nBy following these guidelines and understanding the intricacies involved in preparing for a new mural, you can set the stage for a successful and visually captivating project.","Q: There is a mural painted on one side of my building. I’d like to paint over it. Is this legal?\nA: You may have heard the news story about a famous but illegal Banksy painting on a private London building being removed and sold at auction. Before you paint over the mural on your property, it might be worthwhile to research the artist, if known, and attempt to determine whether the work has any value.\nIf the mural has a “recognized stature” and was painted with the owner’s permission after December 1, 1990, it is probably protected by the Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA). If it was painted without permission or the artist expressly waived their rights under VARA, VARA probably does not apply, though the courts have not clearly ruled one way or another on this issue. VARA is a federal statute preventing, among other things, the destruction or mutilation of fine artworks of recognized stature. Violations of VARA can lead to civil damages, so to protect yourself if your mural qualifies, you can 1) obtain an express waiver from the artist, or 2) make a good faith attempt to notify the artist and give them 90 days to remove the work—though it is unclear how this second option applies when removal of an intact artwork is not feasible.\nThe California Art Preservation Act also provides for civil damages and injunctive relief for the destruction of original artwork of “recognized quality.” A Los Angeles case in which an artist’s mural was painted over settled for $1.1 million in 2008.\nIf the mural has significant historic and/or cultural properties, or is an integral part of a historically significant building, it could already be a designated architectural or aesthetic historical landmark. There are dozens of protected houses—mostly mansions—throughout San Francisco. If your property is on the list of San Francisco Landmarks, you are severely restricted from altering its appearance.\nEven if your property is not a designated San Francisco Landmark or does not have recognized stature, there is a risk that painting over your mural could draw the ire of neighbors or even passersby. In addition to unwanted attention from the neighborhood, the general public, and the press, city agencies such as the Department of Public Health and Department of Building Inspection could be alerted. It is not unusual for concerned citizens to report façade work out of concern for lead and asbestos contamination. Once a city inspector visits to review the façade work, it is possible they will want to look around inside as well for other potential code violations.\nOne other potential issue is if the artist obtained permission from the owner and entered into a binding contract commissioning the mural. If there is an enforceable agreement between the artist and owner governing the artwork, you could be bound by that agreement and might expose yourself to liability for damages for painting over the subject of the agreement.\nIf you are uncertain about any of these issues, seek legal advice from a licensed attorney before taking action.\nCopyright © 2017 by Fried & Williams LLP.

{"question":"Can you compare the total RESTORE funding for Louisiana ($930M) with the Maurepas Swamp project funding ($130M) and show them in a table format s'il vous plaît?","answer":"Here's the comparison in table format:\\nRESTORE Act funding for Louisiana: $930 million\\nMaurepas Swamp project funding: $130 million\\nThe RESTORE Act funding represents Louisiana's total allocation from the BP oil spill penalties, while the $130 million for the Maurepas Swamp project is specifically allocated by the RESTORE Council to reintroduce Mississippi River water into the swamp for ecosystem restoration.","context":["Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan is the state’s blueprint for coastal restoration and protection, containing a mix of risk reduction and coastal restoration projects spread across the entire coastal zone. Updated every five years, the 2017 master plan has an estimated cost of $50 billion over 50 years. Given limited funding and resource constraints, the plan is a realistic prioritization of what can be accomplished during the 50-year timeframe.\nTo rebuild and fortify our coast in the face of increased sea level rise and storms, this funding challenge must be met head on. There are a number of sources available to help pay for coastal restoration in Louisiana, but to fully restore and protect our coast, additional funding will need to be secured and existing funding must be protected.\nNatural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA)\nNRDA is the federally-administered damage assessment and restoration process used to determine damages caused by an oil spill and to restore natural resources. The total Deepwater Horizon NRDA settlement was $8.8 billion, and Louisiana will receive $5 billion of those funds, to be used for ecosystem restoration. $4.3 billion of these funds will be used to restore and conserve habitat, while the remaining funds will be used to replenish and protect living coastal and marine resources ($343 million); for monitoring, adaptive management and administration oversight ($258 million); to provide and enhance recreational opportunities ($60 million); and to restore water quality ($20 million).\nNFWF Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund\nThe National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund was established in 2013 following the Gulf oil disaster. The fund contains $2.544 billion, half of which ($1.272 billion) is to be spent in Louisiana on barrier island restoration and sediment diversion projects.\nFollowing the BP oil disaster, in 2012, the federal Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities, and Revived Economies of the Gulf Coast States (RESTORE) Act was signed into law. This law ensures that 80 percent of all Clean Water Act penalties stemming from the spill flow through the RESTORE Act and are used for Gulf Coast restoration.\nFunding flows through the RESTORE Act via three “pots”:\n- Pot 1 evenly distributes 35 percent of RESTORE funding directly to the Gulf states.\n- Pot 2 allocates 30 percent of funding to ecosystem restoration projects selected by the RESTORE Council.\n- Pot 3 distributes 30 percent of funding to the Gulf states based on an oil spill impact allocation\nLouisiana is set to receive more than $930 million in RESTORE Act funding. Louisiana has committed to use all of its Pot 1 and 3 funding on the Coastal Master Plan. Via Pot 2, Louisiana has received an additional $52.2 million to fund coastal restoration projects included in the RESTORE Council’s Funded Priorities List, which includes marsh creation, hydrologic restoration and beach nourishment projects.\nGulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA)\nGOMESA was signed into law in 2006 and shares 37.5 percent of qualified outer continental shelf oil drilling revenue with oil-producing Gulf states. To date, more than $30 million has been distributed to the Gulf states via GOMESA Phase I. Louisiana will receive an estimated $176 million per year (approximately $8.5 billion total) in GOMESA funds during Phase II. Thirty percent of this funding will go directly to parishes, and the majority will go to the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA).\nCoastal Wetlands Planning Protection and Restoration Act (CWPPRA)\nCWPPRA was enacted in 1990 to provide funding for Louisiana wetlands restoration. Louisiana currently receives more than $80 million per year (approximately $4 billion total) through CWPPRA.\nAdditional sources of funding\nOther sources of funding for Louisiana coastal restoration include the Energy and Water Act (Corps Funding), Coastal Impact Assistance Program (CIAP), carbon and nutrient credits, future state funding and Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund.\nCHANGING RESTORATION COSTS\nRestore the Mississippi River Delta, in conjunction with Coast Builders Coalition, released an analysis prepared by The Water Institute of the Gulf that outlines opportunities for the state of Louisiana to achieve substantial cost savings as it advances its master plan.\nThe analysis, “Changing Restoration Costs,” analyzes the opportunities that exist for the state to achieve substantial cost savings, particularly related to marsh creation projects over time.","Victory for the Prothonotary Warbler in Maurepas Swamp\nRecently, a long-awaited victory in National Wildlife Federation’s efforts to restore the Mississippi River Delta and the Gulf of Mexico region was achieved when the RESTORE Council – which controls a portion from the 2010 BP Oil Spill Disaster money intended to go towards Gulf of Mexico ecosystem restoration – voted unanimously to contribute $130 million to the “River Reintroduction into the Maurepas Swamp Project.” This project is one of the National Wildlife Federation’s highest priority projects in the Gulf of Mexico and is the highest priority project for the Louisiana Wildlife Federation.\nThe Maurepas Swamp is one of the largest forested wetlands in the nation. Dominated by bald cypress and water tupelo trees, this swamp provides incredible habitat to a variety of birds and other wildlife, including the migratory Prothonotary Warbler. In the summer, many of these tiny, bright yellow birds flock to the Maurepas Swamp, building their nests in the cavities of trees–a trait not shared by other eastern wood warblers.\nThese brightly-colored birds can be seen flitting around in the understory of the swamps for food such as insects or snails. Sadly, these habitat specialists have declined substantially over the past half-century due to loss and alteration of forested wetlands used as their breeding grounds.\nUnfortunately, Maurepas swamp has been in long-term decline with dying trees standing in stagnant water and exposed to salt on the swamp’s outward fringes, and young trees are not growing to replace them. There are several reasons for this decline, including the construction of levees built along the Mississippi River for flood protection and navigation that completely cut off the spring flows of oxygenated freshwater, nutrients, and sediment from the river.\nIn addition, past logging activities removed old-growth trees and cut canals and ditches through the swamps, which altered the flow of water through the area and allowed saltwater from the Gulf of Mexico to intrude into these freshwater wetlands. Restoring this swamp for nesting prothonotary warblers and other wildlife dependent on this habitat is one of the many victories from the river reintroduction project.\nThe River Reintroduction into Maurepas Project will reconnect the Maurepas Swamp with the Mississippi River by building a structure through the existing river levee to allow 2,000 cubic feet per second of river water to be diverted into the swamp. The flow of oxygen-rich freshwater and nutrients from the river will flush out stagnant water and push back against intruding saltwater.\nThis project will increase the health and longevity of 45,000 acres of this swamp, improving and sustaining habitat for alligators, bald eagles, and the prothonotary warbler. The swamp also provides natural storm surge protection for nearby communities in southeast Louisiana as well as hunting, fishing, and other recreational opportunities.\nThe Restore Council’s commitment of $130 million of oil spill money to this project is a big win and a wise investment in a project that will help restore and sustain an incredible habitat for generations to come.\nThank you to everyone who took action to support restoring Maurepas Swamp.

{"question":"What's the key difference between operating revenue and cash flow from operating activities?","answer":"Operating revenue refers to income generated by a company's core business activities, like software development income for Apple or service revenue for law firms. In contrast, cash flow from operating activities measures the actual cash inflows and outflows related to core business operations, specifically tracking cash movements in accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory.","context":["In financial accounting, an inflow of money usually from sales or services thru business activities is called as revenue. It is also known as sales or turnover of the business. In other words, an income to a business or an organisation is termed as revenue. For example: royalties or interest or copyright fees may be a part of income for some business. Whereas services offered to customers may be the element of revenue for some companies. For non-profitable businesses, donations from organizations, corporate, individuals are termed as revenue.\nA business or a company may have various types of revenue accounts. Bottom line is all this revenue accounts are termed as income for it. For example: company may receive cash on sale of assets, company may receive cash on rental property and many more. These accounts are broadly divided into operating or non-operating revenue accounts.\nExamples of Revenue-1: Many businesses for example, manufacturing, grocery stores, retail stores, etc; their primary revenue is actually from sale of products / goods. For service provider businesses for example: chartered accountants, law consultants, barber shops, software professionals, etc; their primary revenue is from services provided to customers. Financing businesses for example banks, car rentals, etc; their primary revenue is from fees and interest received by customers.\nExamples of Revenue-2: Assume that the service that manufacture and sells cars would earn revenue from sale of cars is called as regular revenue.

Financial statements are vital to making investment decisions. Two important financial statements readily used by investors include the cash flow statement and statement of shareholders’ equity. The cash flow statement shows the cash that is coming into and leaving a company, while the statement of shareholders’ equity shows detailed changes in the shareholders’ equity listed on a company’s balance sheet. To make informed investment decisions, investors should understand the components of the cash flow statement and statement of shareholders’ equity.\nCash Flow Statement Components\nThe cash flow statement includes three main components: operating, investing and financing activities. Operating activities measures the cash inflows and outflows in reference to a company’s core business operations. Important categories under operating activities include the cash associated with accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory. Investing activities typically shows cash leaving the company to purchase long-term investments, such as equipment or buildings. Investing activities can also show cash a company receives from selling some of its investments. The third component shows the cash flow from financing activities, which may include cash a company raised from selling stocks and bonds to investors or money borrowed from a bank. The cash a company spends to repay a loan also appears under financing activities.\nImportance of the Cash Flow Statement\nThe cash flow statement is important to investors because it shows whether a company has sufficient cash on hand, even while it’s profitable. Companies need adequate cash flow to maintain business operations and make necessary business investments to spur growth. Many investors compare the cash flow statement to the income statement to determine if the cash the company receives from operating activities is exceeding net income. Some investors are wary of companies with cash that is significantly less than net income.\nUnderstanding the Statement of Shareholders’ Equity\nThe elements of the statement of shareholders’ equity include preferred stock, common stock, treasury stock, unrealized gains and loss, retained earnings and dividends. Preferred stock gives shareholders the right to receive dividends before common stockholders. Common stock allows shareholders to receive as large of a dividend as a company decides to issue. If a company chooses to pay out a small dividend, common shareholders may not receive dividends if the company pays all of the money out to preferred shareholders. Treasury stock includes shares that the company repurchased from the open market. Unrealized gains and losses reflect the price changes in a company’s investments that are available-for-sale. Retained earnings refers to the part of a company’s profit it chooses to keep instead of pay as distributions to shareholders. Dividends include the portion of net income a company pays to shareholders as an incentive for investing.\nImportance of the Statement of Shareholders’ Equity\nThe statement of shareholders’ equity is important to investors because it shows a company’s equity interest among shareholders. Investors subtract liabilities from the amount of a company’s total equity to determine its net worth. Retained earnings is a component of the statement of shareholders’ equity that investors closely analyze because it shows the amount of money a company is reinvesting in itself to further growth."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c52f8be8-46e9-49fc-8365-cf886323f9a4>","<urn:uuid:dfcd84f9-75e4-4bb2-a81e-5d64c6bd8d69>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How has the Mississippi River's historical significance in exploration evolved, and what current environmental challenges does it face due to climate change?","answer":"The Mississippi River has evolved from being a subject of historical exploration to facing modern environmental challenges. Historically, it captured the imagination of generations of explorers, with figures like Henry Rowe Schoolcraft credited with discovering its headwaters at Lake Itasca, though Native Americans and French fur trappers had prior knowledge of the region. The search for its true source was complicated by Minnesota's unique geography and changing scientific definitions. Today, the river faces significant environmental threats, particularly from climate change and illegal levee development. Climate scientists project extreme downpours could increase by 400% by century's end, and the magnitude of 100-year flood events has already increased by 20% over the past 500 years due to river engineering and climate change. These changes threaten both public safety and the river's ecosystem, which supports $24.6 billion in economic activity and 421,000 jobs through fishing, hunting, and boating.","context":["The Mississippi River is the third largest river system in the world and, as such, has played an important role in the history of our state and our nation. The river itself, and the search for its source, has captured the imagination of generations of adventurers, explorers, and travellers, many of whom have undertaken or dreamed of the journey to northern Minnesota to see head of the mighty river for themselves.\nAlthough Henry Rowe Schoolcraft is credited with being the first to \"discover\" the headwaters of the Mississippi Rivers, the actual story of the search for and the mapping of the Mississippi River's \"Veritas Caput\" is far broader than the confines of Lake Itasca. Native Americans, french fur trappers, and early American hunters and tradesmen had a familiarity with the headwaters region that, while not defined on paper in the form of published accounts or maps, nonetheless aided other early explorers in finding their way along various headwater tributaries.\nThe question of officially defining and mapping the river's \"True Source\" had great importance politically and historically, but was a complicated process due to the challenges posed by unique aspects of northern Minnesota's geography, hydrology, landscape, and ecosystems. Definitions and techniques used by scientists of the day to define the sources of rivers in Europe and the mountainous or hilly coastal regions of the United did not easily apply to a river whose source meandered somewhere in the flats of northern Minnesota bogs, marshes, and waterlogged forests.\nIn the early 1800's, a river's source was generally defined as being that tributary source which sprang from the farthest end of a rivers flow, in the cardinal opposite direction of the river's mouth; using that definition, Giacomo Beltrami was right to claim Lake Julia as the source of the Mississippi. However, as the sciences of hydrology and geography evolved over the next century, this definition would evolve and change as well, leading Schoolcraft to claim the source as the outlet of Lake Itasca, while Brower claimed the the Heute Terre near DeSoto Lake, Glazier would claim Elk Lake, and Nicollet defined it as springing from the bogs of what would later be called the Nicollet Creek valley.\nThough State Geologist Newton Winchell concurred with aspects of Nicollet's, Brower's, and Glazier's claims, and affirmed that Beltrami's reasoning was sound and scientific for his era, Schoolcraft remained the official \"discoverer\" of the source, and the geological and hydrological facts were further obscurred by the politics of the day as a battle ensued to define the headwaters basin and to delineate what would officially become Itasca State Park.\nOur mission is to research the history behind efforts to map and define the source of the Mississippi, and to document the story of its exploration through film. We hope to create a \"virtual fieldtrip\" by capturing the essence of natural landscapes and waterscapes of the headwaters region, as well by staging historical re-enactments of various expeditions and mapping parties, based on their journals, maps, and other primary sources. Interviews with regional experts on the history, geography, culture, and settlement of the region, and how these played a part in the definition and preservation of the headwaters, are also an important part of our story.\nIn addition to working on the production of a feature-length documentary film, we created this interactive website to help you explore the Mississippi Headwaters region on your own.","Climate change and illegal levee development threaten public safety, river health\nEileen Shader, American Rivers, (570) 856-1128\nElliot Brinkman, Prairie Rivers Network, (217) 344-2371, x202\nChristine Favilla, Sierra Club, (618) 462-6802\nDavid Stokes, Great River Habitat Alliance, (314) 918-1007\nMelissa Samet, National Wildlife Federation, (415) 762-8264\nRob Moore, Natural Resources Defense Council, (312) 651-7923\nMaisah Khan, Missouri Coalition for the Env., (314) 727-0600, x113\nWashington, D.C. – American Rivers today named the Upper Mississippi River among America’s Most Endangered Rivers® of 2019, citing the grave threat that climate change and illegal levee raises pose to public safety and river health. American Rivers and its partners called on state and federal agencies to prohibit the reckless raising of levees and promote better flood protection solutions.\n“The America’s Most Endangered Rivers report is a call to action to save rivers that face a critical decision in the coming year,” said Eileen Shader with American Rivers. “It’s time to stop the illegal levee development on the Upper Mississippi that is putting people and river health at serious risk.”\n“We are already feeling the impacts of climate change in the Midwest, including more frequent and severe flooding, and it’s only going to get worse. Abusing and degrading the Mississippi River will make us more vulnerable to these threats. Protecting and restoring the river will make us better prepared to face future floods and safeguard communities. It’s our choice to make.”\nThe Upper Mississippi River is threatened by levees that are being raised (i.e., made taller) without required permits and approvals. Eighty miles of levees between Muscatine, Iowa, and Hamburg, Illinois, have been raised without obtaining the required state or federal approvals. These levees not only destroy critical riverside and floodplain habitat for fish and wildlife, they also make flood heights higher and increase flooding downstream. For example, during the most extreme flood events, Hannibal, Missouri, is projected to experience an additional foot or more of floodwaters because their neighbors have raised their levees without regard to the impacts.\nAmerican Rivers and its partners called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the states of Illinois, Iowa and Missouri to take corrective action to stop and resolve these levee violations. Further, the groups called on the agencies to advance 21st century flood protection solutions that deliver multiple benefits to people and nature.\n“We have to stop the circle of absurdity where we spend enormous sums of money to build larger levees which make the next flood even worse and costs us millions more in emergency funds, only to have the entire cycle repeat year after year,” said David Stokes with the Great River Habitat Alliance.\n“We must move beyond this outdated vision of flood control that foolishly relies on bigger and higher levees and floodwalls to a new vision that makes room for rivers and allows nature-based solutions to protect us,” said Elliot Brinkman with the Prairie Rivers Network.\nThe threats posed by these unlawful changes are real and getting worse as climate change is leading to more frequent floods and intense storms in the Upper Mississippi River Basin and across the country. The three highest-volume rain storms ever recorded in the U.S. have occurred in the last three years, in line with climate scientists’ projections that extreme downpours in the U.S. could increase by 400 percent by the end of this century. Munoz et al. (2018) determined that the magnitude of 100-year flood events in the Mississippi Basin has increased by 20 percent over the past 500 years, with much of that increase being caused by the combination of river engineering and climate change. The increased risk of flooding is the reason some levee districts have pursued higher levees, but their actions are intensifying the impacts of flooding for their neighbors.\nThe Mississippi River is a globally significant flyway used by hundreds of species of birds and provides unique habitat for fish, mussels, reptiles and mammals. This significant ecosystem supports commercial and recreational fishing, hunting and boating, which contribute $24.6 billion to the region’s economy and an estimated 421,000 jobs. The river has been the lifeblood of many cultures throughout history and has served as the inspiration for a rich heritage of American music, art and literature.\nThe annual America’s Most Endangered Rivers® report is a list of rivers at a crossroads, where key decisions in the coming months will determine the rivers’ fates. Over the years, the report has helped spur many successes including the removal of outdated dams, the protection of rivers with Wild and Scenic designations, and the prevention of harmful development and pollution.\nSome portion of the Mississippi River was previously included on this list in 1991-1992, 1994-1996, 2000-2001, 2004, 2011, 2014 and 2018. Other rivers in the region listed as most endangered in recent years include the Buffalo National River (2019, 2017) and Middle Fork Vermilion River (2018).\nAmerica’s Most Endangered Rivers® of 2019\n#1 Gila River, New Mexico\nGov.

{"question":"How can food waste be transformed into PHAs, and what are the current challenges in plastic recycling that this process helps address?","answer":"Food waste can be converted into PHAs through a three-step process: first, bacteria cultures break down food waste into volatile fatty acids; second, these fatty acids are added to another bacteria culture that produces PHAs in their cells; finally, an extraction process breaks open the cells to collect and purify the plastic. This entire process takes just seven days. This innovative approach helps address significant recycling challenges in the current plastic industry, where less than 30% of plastic waste in Europe is collected for recycling, with even lower rates in other regions. Traditional recycling is limited because recycled plastics produce lower quality products than virgin plastics and are aesthetically less appealing to consumers. The food waste to PHA conversion offers a solution to both food waste (with over $1 trillion worth of food wasted globally every year) and plastic pollution problems.","context":["September 27, 2018 | Alumni\nU of T startup that turns food waste into high-quality bio-plastic eyes next phase of growth\nBy Don Campbell\nLuna Yu (BSc 2015 UTSC, MESc 2016), founder and CEO of Genecis, completed her master's degree at U of T Scarborough. Genecis is scaling up operations and looking at developing other materials from food waste (all photos by Don Campbell)\nLuna Yu (BSc 2015 UTSC, MESc 2016) is passionate about not wasting food.\n“I was taught at an early age by my grandparents never to waste food since it was throwing away the hard work of farmers and food producers,” says Yu, a recent graduate from the Master of Environmental Science program at the University of Toronto Scarborough.\n“More than $1 trillion worth of food is wasted globally every year. What we’re able to do is take this waste and turn it into something of higher value.”\nIt’s no wonder that passion led Yu to team up with a talented group of scientists and engineers – many of whom are U of T students or recent graduates – to form Genecis. The company uses recent advancements in biotechnology, microbial engineering and machine learning to take food destined for the landfill and convert it into PHAs – a high-quality, fully biodegradable form of plastic.\nIt’s not Yu’s first foray into entrepreneurship. She worked at a software company as an undergrad before moving to another startup that converted restaurant food waste into biogas. It was there she met several talented engineers, learned about the microbiology of converting discarded food into other materials, and discovered a valuable lesson in the economics of recycling food waste.\n“Converting food waste into biogas is time-consuming process and the end product is fairly low value,” she says.\nAfter connecting with a fellow environmental science student in The Hub, U of T Scarborough’s entrepreneurial incubator, they started looking into what else could be made from food waste.\n“We looked at different types of bio-rubbers and bio-chemicals before landing on PHAs. We felt it had the biggest market potential.”\nPHAs, or polyhydroxyalkanoates, are polymers produced by bacteria that have many benefits over other forms of bio-plastics, explains Yu. For one, they can be a thermoplastic, meaning it can be easily moulded and remoulded into different products. Another benefit is that, unlike many other forms of bio-plastics, it won’t ruin the recycling process.\n“Many people throw bio-plastics into the recycling bin rather than the compost, but if it’s not a thermoplastic it can’t be remoulded and this disrupts the physical properties of new recycled products. They will end up falling apart,” she says.\nPHAs won’t cause this problem if they accidentally end up in recycling bins, making them much easier for waste management companies to handle.\nBut what really sold Yu on the benefits of PHAs is the fact that they’re fully biodegradable. PHAs degrade within one year in the environment, and fewer than 10 years in water. Synthetic plastics can take hundreds of years to degrade in similar environments.\nWhile PHAs can be used to make pretty much anything out of plastic, Yu says the ones made by Genecis are best suited for higher-end, multi-use products like toys, flexible packaging, 3D-printing filament and medical applications including surgical staples, sutures and stents.\nGenecis uses a three-step process to create their PHAs. First, a bacteria culture breaks down the food waste into volatile fatty acids.The fatty acids are added to another bacteria culture specially selected to produce PHAs in their cells. Finally, an extraction process breaks open the cells, then collects and purifies the plastic.\nThe entire process takes seven days. “Making biogas, on the other hand, takes an average of 21 days,” Yu says.\nThe company’s main lab in U of T’s Banting and Best Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship houses pilot-scale bioreactors that can complete the three-step process. The other location in the Environmental Science and Chemistry Building at U of T Scarborough is responsible for research and development in looking for ways to optimize their production process. When Genecis opens its demonstration plant with an industry partner later next year, it will be able to convert three tonnes of organic waste into PHAs weekly.\nIn less than two years of existence, Genecis has already won more than $330,000 in prize money from startup competitions. Yu says the support, guidance and mentorship they’ve received from The Hub, the Creative Destruction Lab, and the Hatchery, a startup accelerator at the Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering, have also been instrumental in their growth.\nAs they aim to ramp up production, Yu says this support and the lessons learned from her work in other startups will be invaluable.\n“Our goal is to create the highest value from organic waste,” says Yu, adding they have cultured and isolated hundreds of species of bacteria that currently don’t exist in databases.\n“Soon we will be able to synthesize speciality chemicals and other materials from organic waste, all at a lower cost than traditional production methods using synthetic biology,” she says.\nThose specialty chemicals can be used in a range of products, including those found in cosmetics and the health and wellness industry, says Yu.\n“It’s a really exciting time for us.”","Plastic waste: A global problem and an opportunity for microbiology\nPosted on May 1, 2018 by Roya Ziaie\nPublic appetite for reducing plastic waste is insatiable following the release of Blue Planet II; a series narrated by David Attenborough and focusing on the impact of human activity on the marine.\nAt the Microbiology Society’s Annual Conference 2018, delegates heard from Professor Kevin O’Connor, a leading principal investigator at University College Dublin. In his talk ‘Plastic waste: A global problem and an opportunity for microbiology’, he described strategies to reduce plastic waste, consumer confusion and opportunities for the future.\nThe plastic problem:\nDue to its versatility, plastic is used in billions of products worldwide, and we are predicted to produce over 600 million tonnes of it by 2035. The plastic production industry employs 1.5 million people in Europe, plastics play a key role in reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs) by allowing us to build stronger and lighter vehicles and better insulate homes.\nHowever, the production and incineration of plastic contributes to over 400 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually and single use plastics are major pollutants on land and in the sea. Alternative materials or methods of plastic management are desperately needed. Many consumers are already aware that plastics are recyclable – why isn’t there an efficient recycling system already in place? Currently, less than 30% of all plastic waste in Europe is collected for recycling, with recycling rates in many other regions even lower. This may be because recycled plastics produce lower quality products than virgin plastics and are aesthetically less appealing to consumers.\nEighty percent of marine litter is made up of plastics. Items such as straws, coffee cup lids, plastic bottles, and plastic bags are single use items that make up the majority of beach pollution. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles and containers can take up to 1,000 years to break down in the environment.\nMicro-plastics are also a major issue. Defined as plastics that are less than 5 millimetres in length, micro-plastics are formed in a variety of ways including through degradation of larger debris or are manufactured as micro-beads for use as exfoliants in beauty products such as cleansers and toothpastes. These minute particles often pass through water filtration systems, ending up in oceans and lakes. Micro-plastics can be extremely damaging to aquatic life; they can be mistaken for food by smaller fish and eventually enter the food chain in the guts of fish we eat.\nIf we can’t prevent the use of plastics, then society should work to reduce its consumption. Do we really need that much packaging? How can we design plastics to aid their re-use?\nTackling plastic waste:\nIn 1999, Kevin and his team began to investigate the reuse of petrochemical plastic waste. They used pyrolysis – a thermal decomposition method that reduces petrochemical plastic polymers to their precursors, or monomers. These monomers were then fed to the bacteria Psuedomonas putida. After consuming the petroplastic monomers, the bacteria produced biodegradable plastic polymers called polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). PHAs break down in the environment to produce no harmful by-products, and were shown to perform either as well as, or better than, petrochemical polymers used for products such as glues, making them a viable alternative use in things like post-it notes.\nKevin’s team also focused on biodegradable polymers and how well they degrade in managed and non-managed environments. These included industrial composting, home composting and the marine, each of which has different composting standards. Ranging from industrial processes, which require plastics to degrade within 180 days at around 50°C, to the marine, which requires plastics degrade after 56 days at 30°C.\nWhat became clear was that different plastics, even those within the same polymer family, vary greatly in their rate of degradation in different environments. The fastest growing biodegradable plastic in the consumer market, polylactic acid (PLA), does not degrade at all in the 28°C conditions seen in home composting. Similarly, many plastics degrade poorly in the marine. With a well-managed industrial composting method however, biodegradable plastic produced fantastic results.\nMore research is needed to ensure that biodegradation is possible for different plastics in different environments, something which will need to be built into the design of new products.\nThe ultimate reality we face is that there is no quick-fix, and biodegradable plastics still need to be managed in the same way as petrochemical ones. A lack of clear messaging on the difference between biobased and biodegradable plastics is causing confusion for consumers and will not build consumer confidence.\nResponsible consumption should continue to be promoted, and initiatives to reduce plastic waste implemented quickly. Charges on supermarket carrier bags have already seen a 95% reduction in their use across Ireland, and 80% across England.\nThe war has officially been waged on plastics, with the government working with trade associations, campaigners and over 40 companies to eliminate single-use packaging under the UK Plastics Pact. Individuals can also play their part, by purchasing a re-usable coffee cup or water bottle, taking a canvas bag to the supermarket and saying no to plastic straws and cutlery. Small changes can have big impact, and as Kevin O’Connor powerfully stated, the solution to plastic waste is us."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a867867d-07f4-412b-9863-ceda9e7d618a>","<urn:uuid:0608a9e7-f9e9-419b-999d-e01a08a1d753>"],"error":null}
