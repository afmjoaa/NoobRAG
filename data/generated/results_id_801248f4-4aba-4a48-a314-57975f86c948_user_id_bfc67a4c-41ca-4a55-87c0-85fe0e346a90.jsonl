{"question":"Why did Ernest Hemingway consider 'The Killers' (1946) the best adaptation of his work, and how much of the film was based on his original story?","answer":"Hemingway favored this adaptation despite the fact that only the first reel of the film was directly based on his original twelve-page short story. He was so fond of the film that he kept a personal print at his home in Cuba, Finca Vigia, where he would show it to guests, though he typically fell asleep after the first reel - the part faithful to his writing. The rest of the film was developed from a Brooklyn robbery story from Hellinger's newspaper days and incorporated other elements like Dutch Schultz's deathbed ravings. The film expanded the original story through a series of eleven flashbacks told by six different characters, creating a full feature-length noir narrative from Hemingway's primarily dialogue-based short story.","context":["The Killers (1946) Directed by Robert Siodmak. Burt Lancaster, Ava Gardner, Edmund O’Brien (105 minutes) (DCP)\nThe Killers is an essential film noir, merging expressive cinematography, a churning score and complex flashbacks in gripping style to solve a murder. A dogged insurance investigator excavates the rubble of a heist gone wrong, which entangled a washed-up boxer (one’s of noir’s classic existential heroes) and a sultry nightclub singer. “Lancaster is dreamy, dense and doomed. Ava Gardner, in her first major movie, doesn’t do much more than exist. She hardly needs to…it’s clear from Lancaster’s dumbstruck gaze that he has met his Circe.” New restoration from Universal Pictures and the Film Foundation. Pop-up exhibit from the Ava Gardner Museum.\nWe’re so lucky to be able to present in partnership with the Ava Gardner Museum in Smithfield, NC.\nAva (her real name, by the way) was the youngest daughter of seven children born to a poor share cropping farmer and his wife, from Grabtown, NC. Her mother ran a boarding house for teachers during much of Ava’s childhood. Her oldest sister, Beatrice, nicknamed Bappie, lived in New York with Larry Tarr, a professional photographer. A portrait he did of his wife’s little sister caught the eye of a passing clerk who worked at the parent company of MGM, Loew’s, headquartered in New York City. The Tarrs sent her photo to the office, and a silent screen test was filmed, as her Carolina country accent was considered to be unintelligible. In 1941 she left her secretarial studies at Atlantic Christian College to move with Bappie to Hollywood.\nShe posed for photographs, endlessly, and occasional had a bit part, silent or with a line or two (the MGM vocal coaches were working on that accent). At nineteen, she was so beautiful that men looked at her, desired her, but had little interest in who she was as a human being. The first one was Mickey Rooney, the top box office star at the time. She met him when she visited him while he was filming (in drag as Carmen Miranda) Babes on Broadway. He was smitten instantly. Known for his wholesome screen image, in reality Rooney was as experienced as Ava was innocent. He drank, he gambled, he had been a notorious womanizer since his mid-teens. He chastely courted Ava, but the head of the studio, Louis B. Mayer forbid him to marry her. Rooney would not take no for an answer, “This was Ava’s allure at nineteen: the biggest movie star in the world was ready to risk professional annihilation rather than give up the girl he had known for fifteen or sixteen weeks, and now…nothing, not even the great and powerful Mayer—was going to stop him for getting what he wanted to have” (Server 70).\nAva had wanted a dream wedding, but the studio wanted something more discreet. They were married, and after the honeymoon Rooney quickly resumed his previous habits. They fought about his gambling and his infidelities and divorced after about a year. Her next husband, musician and bandleader Artie Shaw was also dazzled by her beauty and endeavored to mold her into a suitable spouse (he tried and failed to do this with eight wives). Ava had always loved his music and idolized him, but their union also soured within a year or so, but not before he composed an appreciation of their personal life called “The Grabtown Grapple” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRt5Kszh6qs\nShe’d been in Hollywood five years and had only a failed marriage and a few bit parts to show for it. MGM seemed uninterested in promoting her career. But then, Universal, and Mark Hellinger called. Hellinger had been a celebrated reporter and storyteller in New York during the Roaring Twenties, his work focused on the periphery of gangland big shots. His newspaper column gave 22 million readers “short, swift, sobby little tales” of old Broadway (Buford 65). But when the Depression hit, he migrated to Hollywood, where his inside track on urban low lives and hangers on secured him a place at Warner Brothers as an associate producer on films like The Roaring Twenties, They Drive By Night and High Sierra. After returning from WW II, he formed his own production company at Universal. His first picture there would have to be a smash.\nHe had been thinking about Ernest Hemingway’s 1927 short story “The Killers” since before the war. Hemingway was considered by many at the time to be America’s greatest writer. “Hellinger’s experience and strength had always been in tough-guy melodrama and Hemingway’s famous story was one of the touchstones in the history of hard-boiled literature” (Server 114). Hemingway was not interested in selling screen rights, but since the author was an old buddy, he’d agree to $50,000 for his twelve-page story, most of it dialogue. That was a lot of money, but the publicity value of being the most expensive sale in Hollywood history was worth something.\nThis is the section of the film that was taken almost verbatim from Hemingway’s story.\nThe film would start with Hemingway’s prose, but then, in order to make a feature film, something else would have to happen. Writer Richard Books tracked the author down to ask about the rest of the story, and Hemingway supposedly replied, “How the hell do I know?” (Server 115). Hellinger was inspired by a Brooklyn robbery from his newspaper days, in which the gang had escaped with the loot, but then things went wrong. He added the deathbed ravings of noted gangster Dutch Schultz to Blinky, one of the gang members, played by Jeff Corey. The script would eventually be credited to Anthony Veiller, but his uncredited collaborator was John Huston, still under contract to Warner Brothers. The film would open with Hemingway’s complete short story, and then open out the story with a series of eleven flashbacks, told by six different characters. Siodmak liked flashbacks in his films, “suggesting both the complexity of the past and the function of memory” (Alpi 160). The film is suffused with an oppressive fatalism, one of the hallmarks of the film noir genre. “What would bring a man so low that he would surrender himself to violent death?” (Server 117). The answer was an otherworldly beautiful woman, Kitty Collins.\nWhen the script was submitted to the Hays Office for comments on what was permissible on screen, they had a lot of suggestions. Too much violence, and too much “how-to” as far as the payroll robbery was concerned. Hellinger put their notes in a folder marked “F*** you” and continued as planned (Server 118). Director Robert Siodmak was under contract at Universal, he was considered second only to Alfred Hitchcock in the making of suspenseful films. A Jewish refugee from the Nazis, he brought his Expressionist eye to Hollywood. He took Universal’s tight budget, and strode into deep chiaroscuro, “Even still, it was virtually impossible not to appreciate Siodmak’s visual flair, and it went remarked upon by many. This unspoken language, leaning back into German Expressionism and the symbolism of silent cinema, would be a vital maker of meaning in Siodmak’s most famous film noirs. The way he lit amoral gangsters’ molls could turn them into avenging angels; his use of deep focus could reveal fractures in the psyche of sympathetic local street cops; de rigeur heist scenes were ghostly and surreal” (mubi.com).\nHellinger wanted strong casting, and some fresh faces. He didn’t want anyone already associated with crime films, like Humphrey Bogart. Those who came back hardened from their war experience were preferred. He rejected Wayne Morris, a boring B-picture actor under contract to Warner Brothers, and instead chose Burt Lancaster, in his first film, as the Swede. Lancaster grew up in East Harlem, New York, where he discovered acting at the Union Street Settlement House. He met Nick Cravat, and they formed an acrobatic act, which eventually played the Ringling Brothers Circus. He joined the Federal Theater Project during the Depression. After he returned from WW II, he was cast as the lead in a Broadway play, and talent scouts brought him to Hollywood. Hellinger saw the screen test he did for a film called Desert Fury, and arranged a meeting. He was startled by Lancaster’s intense physical presence. He told him, “The Killers is the best script I’ve ever had. It will make you a star” (Alpi 156). The fact that the Swede is so handsome, so powerful looking makes his acceptance of his fate even more affecting. He gets an amazing introduction in the film, the camera lingers on his face, so we can drink it all in. When the reviews came out, Lancaster was called “the brawny Apollo” and “the brute with the eyes of an angel” (Buford 69).\nHellinger and Siodmak agreed that a blonde bombshell would be a cliché, that they wanted a dark-haired temptress, and Mark Hellinger had just seen a film called Whistle Stop, which featured Ava Gardner. She met with Hellinger, and he immediately felt she had what it took to make a man die for her. “Siodmak helped Ava to create a coherent characterization and a haunting erotic presence out of such things as the shift of her eyes, the turn of her lips, and the feline sprawl of her exquisite body. He wanted her to act not more, but less. She would say a line or give an expression and Sidomak would tell her to do it again, but ‘half as much.’” (Server 125). His key to her character was a simple “Smiling—but not smiling” (Alpi 158). At the end, he would have to badger her into an explosive outburst, but it was really the first time anyone had taken a real interest in her acting ability. And Helllinger was confident he could make her a star; unlike the years she had spent treading water at MGM. She has relatively little screen time, but she haunts the film as its “black heart” (Server 128) “Like so many femme fatales, Gardner undergoes ritual punishment by the conclusion. But it’s her defiance that’s most memorable: her attitude and appearance fly in the face of domesticated mid-century femininity, and it’s largely down to how Siodmak frames and films her” (mubi.com).\nLancaster and Ava decamped to Malibu for some swimsuit publicity photos in which he showed off some of his acrobatic skills with her. Composer Miklos Rosza and lyricist Jack Brooks wrote a song, “The More I Know of Love” which is supposed to enthrall the Swede and put the spiral of the script in motion. Even though Ava hesitated, she did record the song, and the voice you hear on screen is hers.\nAva said in her autobiography, “I liked Mark Hellinger at once, because I could tell he saw me as an actress, not a sexpot. He trusted me from the beginning, and I trusted him. He even talked me into relaxing enough so I could sing that sensual song in my own voice. And he gave me a feeling of responsibility about being a movie star that I’d never for a moment felt before. Until I played Kitty Collins, I’d never worked very hard in pictures, never taken my career very seriously. I felt no burning ambition to become a real actress. I was just a girl who was lucky enough to have a job in pictures. Playing Kitty changed that, showed me what it meant to try to act, and made me feel that I might have a little talent in that area after all (Gardner 86).\nThe cinematographer, Woody Bredell, wanted to use available light to create a realistic look to the film, even though today we consider this film noir technique to be highly stylized. Bredell talked Ava out of her heavy, glamour girl makeup, just a little Vaseline rubbed into her skin for shimmer under the soft glow of the table lamps, and of course, lipstick. The payroll heist was shot in a single take with 18 camera stops and more than 60 focus changes. “Everything was very confused with people not knowing where they ought to be, a car backed up wrong and left in the middle of the road…but curiously enough the result turned out to give just the right effect.” Hellinger arranged a secret screening for some of his underworld buddies, and they gave the robbery a thumbs up. (Ballinger and Graydon 103). Sadly, Hellinger died of a heart attack the following year, at the age of 44.\nAva, too, got a breathtaking entrance in a sinuous draped black satin dress. A portrait of her as Kitty Collins in it is on the front jacket of her autobiography. The costumes were by Vera West, a Universal contract designer, usually assigned to the B picture unit of thrillers and Westerns. She did supervise all the costumes of the great 1930s Universal monster movies, designing for Dracula, Frankenstein and his Bride. She usually didn’t get the choicest assignments, whenever a star became famous, they often chose to use another designer, with the exception of Deanna Durbin. West left Universal in 1947 with over 400 film credits and shortly afterwards either committed suicide, or was murdered, found floating face down in her swimming pool like William Holden in Sunset Blvd.\nThe film was also an enormous influence on Rob Reiner’s homage to film noir starring Steve Martin, Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid. In fact, Martin’s character is named Rigby Reardon, specifically so Ava Gardner can speak to “Mr. Reardon” (played in the film by Edmund O’Brien) with a reverse shot of Martin, as if they are having a conversation.\nThe Killers was a huge hit and remains a quintessential film noir. Hemingway considered it the best of all the adaptations of his work. Later in life Ava became a friend, and in her autobiography said, “…after Mark Hellinger, the producer, gave him a print of his own, he’d invariably pull out a projector and show it to guests at Finca Vigia, his place in Cuba. Of course, he’d usually fall asleep after the first reel, which made sense, because that first reel was the only part of the movie that was really taken from what he wrote” (Gardner 84). The director, screenplay and editor were all nominated for Oscars (The Best Years of Our Lives was the big winner that year). Hellinger had an eight-story sign installed on Broadway in New York, three stories was Ava in her slick black satin dress “lured the customers to the ticket vendor just as irresistibly as she did Burt Lancaster to his doom” (Server 130).\nhttps://avagardner.org/, Ava Gardner: Love is Nothing by Lee Server, Robert Siodmak by Deborah Lazaroff Alpi, 100 Film Noirs, by Jim Hillier and Alastair Phillips, Rough Guide to Film Noir by Alexander Ballinder and Danny Graydon, Ava: My Story by Ava Gardner , Burt Lancaster: An American Life by Kate Buford, Hollywood Costume Design by David Chierichetti, Creating the Illusion by Jay Jorgenson and Donald L.

{"question":"Could someone explain the main differences between how Gzhel porcelain and Inuit art are produced and sold nowadays? I need to understand the production and distribution systems for both! 🤔","answer":"Gzhel porcelain and Inuit art have different production and distribution systems. Gzhel porcelain is produced in a specific region southeast of Moscow, comprising 27 villages, through both large enterprises and small workshops that offer custom-made items. These products can be purchased in factory stores, specialized porcelain shops in large cities, and souvenir shops. In contrast, authentic Inuit art sculptures are created by Inuit artists in northern Arctic areas of Canada and are primarily sold through trusted galleries specializing in Inuit art, which can be found in major Canadian cities' downtown tourist areas. These galleries often have websites for worldwide purchases, and some tourist shops also sell authentic pieces alongside souvenirs, though buyers must be careful to verify authenticity through the official Igloo tag certification.","context":["Tips on Ways To Purchase and Buy Authentic Canadian Inuit Art (Eskimo Art) Sculptures\nNumerous visitors to Canada will be exposed to Inuit art (Eskimo art) sculptures while exploring the country. These are the stunning handmade sculptures carved from stone by the Inuit artists living in the northern Arctic areas of Canada. While in some of the major Canadian cities (Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Ottawa, and Quebec City) or other tourist locations popular with global visitors such as Banff, Inuit sculptures will be seen at different retail shops and showed at some museums. Considering that Inuit art has been getting a growing number of global exposure, individuals might be seeing this Canadian fine art kind at museums and galleries located outside Canada too. As a result, it will be natural for many travelers and art collectors to decide that they wish to purchase Inuit sculptures as good souvenirs for their homes or as really unique presents for others. Assuming that the intention is to get an authentic piece of Inuit art rather than a low-cost traveler imitation, the concern develops on how does one differentiate the real thing from the phonies?\nIt would be pretty frustrating to bring home a piece only to find out later that it isn't authentic or perhaps made in Canada. If one is lucky enough to be traveling in the Canadian Arctic where the Inuit live and make their fantastic artwork, then it can be safely assumed that any Inuit art piece purchased from a local northern shop or directly from an Inuit carver would be genuine. One would have to be more careful elsewhere in Canada, especially in traveler locations where all sorts of other Canadian keepsakes such as t-shirts, hockey jerseys, postcards, key chains, maple syrup, and other Native Canadian arts are sold.\nThe safest locations to shop for Inuit sculptures to guarantee authenticity are constantly the trusted galleries that focus on Canadian Inuit art and Eskimo art. Some of these galleries have advertisements in the city tourist guides discovered in hotels.\nCredible Inuit art galleries are likewise listed in Inuit Art Quarterly publication which adheres totally to Inuit art. These galleries will usually be located in the downtown tourist locations of significant cities. When one walks into these galleries, one will see that there will be just Inuit art and perhaps Native art but none of the other typical traveler souvenirs such as t-shirts or postcards . These galleries will have only authentic Inuit art for sale as they do her response not deal with replicas or fakes . Just to be even safer, make sure that the piece you have an interest in features a Canadian federal government Igloo tag certifying that it was handcrafted by a Canadian Inuit artist. The Inuit sculpture might be signed by the carver either in English or Inuit syllabics however not all genuine pieces are signed. Be conscious that an anonymous piece might still be undoubtedly genuine.\nSome of these Inuit art galleries likewise have websites so you could go shopping and buy genuine Inuit art sculpture from house anywhere in the world. In addition to these street retail specialty galleries, there are now reliable online galleries that likewise specialize in genuine Inuit art.\nSome tourist shops do bring authentic Inuit art in addition to the other touristy souvenirs in order to cater to all types of travelers. When shopping at these types of shops, it is possible to differentiate the genuine pieces from the reproductions. Genuine Inuit sculpture is carved from stone and therefore ought to have some weight or mass to it. Stone is also cold to the touch. A recreation made of plastic or resin from a mold will be much lighter in weight and will not be cold to the touch. A recreation will in some cases have a company name on it such as Wolf Originals or Boma and will never feature an artist's signature. An genuine Inuit sculpture is a one of a kind piece of art work and absolutely nothing else on the shop shelves will look precisely like it. The piece is not authentic if there are duplicates of a particular piece with specific information. If a piece looks too perfect in detail with outright straight bottoms or sides, it is most likely not real. Naturally, if a piece includes a sticker label showing that is was made in an Asian nation, then it is certainly a phony. There will also be a huge price distinction between genuine pieces and the imitations.\nThis can be a real gray location to those unfamiliar with authentic Inuit art. If a seller declares that such as piece is genuine, ask to see the main Igloo tag that comes with it which will have info on the artist, location where it was made and the year it was sculpted. The authentic pieces with the accompanying authorities Igloo tags will always be the greatest priced and are generally kept in a different ( possibly even locked) rack within the shop.\nConsidering that Inuit art has been getting more and more international direct exposure, people may be seeing this Canadian fine art form at museums and galleries located outside Canada too. If one is fortunate enough to be taking a trip in the Canadian Arctic where the Inuit live and make their fantastic art work, then it can be securely presumed that any Inuit art piece purchased from a local northern shop or directly from an Inuit carver would be genuine. Trusted Inuit art galleries are also listed in Inuit Art Quarterly publication which is dedicated totally to Inuit art. The Inuit sculpture Kurt Criter may be signed by the carver either in English or Inuit syllabics but not all authentic pieces are signed. Some of these Inuit art galleries likewise have websites so you might go shopping and buy genuine Inuit art sculpture from house anywhere in the world.","Gzhel is the name of a traditional Russian craft production of porcelain and pottery items – dishes, tiles, and other decorative pieces. To be more precise, Gzhel is the name of a region southeast of Moscow that includes about 27 villages and small towns which comprise the so-called “Gzhel Bush” where this pottery production and porcelain manufacturing are based.\n“Around 1800 the artisan Kulikov brothers discovered the secret to white porcelain earthenware”\nThe porcelain-pottery industry developed there due to the presence of clay that is perfectly suited for these purposes. Around 1800 the artisan Kulikov brothers discovered the secret to white porcelain earthenware and since then the region has been the center of this porcelain craft. The Kulikovs tried to keep their recipe and technology secret, but could not hide the information for long; soon, a porcelain-making tradition spread throughout the area.\nThe owner of a famous porcelain enterprise by the name of Kuznetsov was definitely from Gzhel region. He founded a small workshop and started porcelain production in 1812. Remarkably, by 1917 Kuznetsov’s manufacturing plants produced two-thirds of all porcelain goods in Russia, and his company had the largest porcelain factory in Europe.\nAfter the Bolshevik revolution in 1917, when Communist took control of Russia, the huge enterprise was nationalized.\nWhen we hear the word Gzhel today, we imagine white porcelain goods with bright blue painting; these are the hallmarks of Gzhel products. Craftsmen in the region produce a wide range of utensils and decorative items – porcelain sculptures and figurines, boxes, vases, candlesticks, ashtrays, and even clocks.\nWhat protects the painting?\nColoring is done with special cobalt paint that is applied to raw unglazed porcelain pieces. Then the painted products are baked in high-temperature kilns. As a result of this firing, the cobalt paint becomes almost black before turning bright, vivid blue. The products are then coated with glaze and fired a second time. This technique protects the painting very well.\nDespite using only one color of cobalt, porcelain production artists get lively paintings with many shades of blue. This is achieved through a brush technique where various strokes produce different thicknesses of paint and effect varying degrees of translucency.\nCurrently, there are some relatively large enterprises in Gzhel region; however, production of traditional Gzhel porcelain still engages a lot of small workshops. These workshops offer custom-made items, with each of their products an original, one-of-a-kind piece.\n“Gzhel is one of the favorite symbols of Russian arts and handicrafts”\nHand painted with cobalt blue on white porcelain, Gzhel remains one of the favorite symbols of Russian arts and handicrafts. Gzhel is now not only a national art form, but also a true cultural and historical symbol of Russia.\nEvery Russian family has at least one piece of Gzhel kitchenware. So, if you want to take home something very traditional and completely Russian, you should definitely buy a set of Gzhel porcelain ware. Products made in Gzhel style can be purchased in many places – factory stores, specialized porcelain shops in some large cities, as well as in souvenir shops and gift stores."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8cfe9f92-9499-422a-a4a5-55a7ae879410>","<urn:uuid:6f9d8bd1-e0b2-46a1-9481-8f0089b2a545>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Eve and Iblis differ in their reasons for disobedience in religious texts? I'm curious about their motivations!","answer":"Eve and Iblis had fundamentally different motivations for their disobedience. According to Islamic teachings, Iblis disobeyed due to hubris and pride, refusing to bow to Adam because he considered himself superior, saying 'I am better than he: Thou didst create me from fire, and him from clay.' In contrast, Eve's actions were not driven by pride or malice. The Islamic perspective shows that both Adam and Eve simply slipped in their judgment when Satan caused them both to err, and neither was more to blame than the other. Furthermore, while Iblis was cursed to Hell for eternity for his deliberate defiance, Eve was not eternally punished - rather, Islam portrays her as a role model for womankind and the steward of future generations.","context":["Nila Ahmad, USA\nThe imagery is nearly always the same. A tree stands centred in the middle ground. A serpent figure twists around the tree, its hideous face foreshadowing sinister intent. And nearly always a woman holds an apple. This is the story of when Satan tempted Adam (as) and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, as told in Christian and Judaic traditions. This particular narrative of events has permeated western society and religious traditions to the extent that few question Eve’s role. Born from Adam’s (as) rib, Eve is perceived to have brought ruin upon humankind through her wicked wiles. She is the villain of this account, assigned nearly as much fault as the serpent. However, the truth of the matter is that Eve was no more to blame than Adam (as) was and Islam sheds light upon Eve as a role model for all womenkind. She did not, in fact, lead humans down the path of sin, but rather is the means to lift humankind to the heights of spirituality.\nTo break down the notion of Eve in these religious teachings we must go back to the beginning. The Bible states:\n‘And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place.\nThen the rib which the Lord God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man.\nAnd Adam said:\n“This is now bone of my bones\nAnd flesh of my flesh;\nShe shall be called Woman,\nBecause she was taken out of Man.”’ \nFrom the very onset, Christian tradition assigns Eve a secondary position. Adam (as) is fully formed, whereas Eve has been formed from merely his rib. In larger Western culture, Adam (as) has come to symbolize all men and Eve has come to symbolize all women. Unfortunately, throughout time, some have taken Eve’s supposed secondary status as justification to award men superiority over women. Christian theologians, most notably Thomas Aquinas, interpreted the Scriptures to state that because Eve was created afterwards, women were defective males, and were inferior to men in intellect and form. These depictions remained not only within the Christian traditions but within the larger society as well.\nIf we fast forward to the incident in the Garden, the site of Original Sin, we see the story unfolds even further. Original Sin is what Christian tradition designates as the first sin ever committed among humans, i.e when Adam (as) and Eve first ate fruit from the tree which God had forbidden them. According to these religious traditions, Adam (as) and Eve lived in the Garden of Eden. God allowed them to eat from the fruits thereof, except for the fruit of one tree. A serpent sat in this tree and incited Eve to pluck the fruit and take a bite. Having eaten the fruit, she then lured Adam (as) into partaking of the fruit as well. Once they had eaten, their shame became manifest to them and they both covered themselves.\nThe Book of Genesis describes the incident:\n‘So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.\nThen the man said, “The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.”\nAnd the Lord God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”’ \nBoth Jewish and Christian religious traditions assign Eve the blame for this incident. In fact, it is widely believed that Eve’s punishment for her crime was to suffer the pain of childbirth. Not only that, but any woman lucky enough to bring a child into this world would also suffer for Eve’s crime i.e labour pains. Throughout known history, this assignation of blame seeped into the larger society and remains still today, a part of the larger cultural rhetoric. If religious traditions portrayed Eve as inferior and the source of sin, the secular society portrayed her as a dangerous woman. Countless portrayals of Eve, from Renaissance painters such as Michelangelo to Albrecht Durer, portray Eve as being the first to sin. On the other hand, popular culture has used Eve to depict danger and wickedness, from DKNY’s (a well-known fashion house) print ad of a woman holding an apple to lure the audience to purchase her perfume to the popular television show, Desperate Housewives, where the ‘housewives’ coyly smile at the camera, apples in hand. These images serve to reinforce the depiction of Eve as luring the guileless to their ruin.\nBut what if the narrative is all wrong? What if the concept of ‘Original Sin’ does not exist? What if Eve did not lure Adam (as) to wrongdoing? Does the whole notion of a woman’s qualities and her place in this world change if Eve’s role also changes? Fortunately, Islam upends the whole story of Adam (as) and Eve.\nFrom the very beginning, Islam clears up the misconception of Eve having been created from Adam’s rib. Hazrat Mirza Bashir Ahmad (ra) writes in Our God,\n‘Similarly, a Tradition has it that Eve was born out of Adam’s rib. Now people begin to imagine that Adam’s body was physically torn open and Eve was created out of his rib bone, in keeping with the same incident repeated in all revealed books; the fact is that these statements are metaphors used in all revealed books. What this tradition means is that woman was created to live close to man. She is an integral part of his life.’ \nIslam teaches that the notion of Eve being born from Adam’s (as) rib is to signify that they are both of the same species, of the same kind. The clear logic of Islam fells centuries of misinterpretation. If Eve no longer inhabits an inferior status because God created both Adam (as) and Eve of the same kind, then what does Islam say of her responsibility in plucking the forbidden fruit?\nThe Holy Qur’an visits the incident of the garden and states:\n‘But Satan caused them both to slip by means of it and drove them out of the state in which they were. And we said: “Go forth; some of you are enemies of others, and for you there is an abode in the earth and a provision for a time.“\nThen Adam learnt from his Lord certain words of prayer. So He turned towards him with mercy. Surely, He is Oft-Returning with compassion, and is Merciful.’ \nThe verse above explicitly states that Satan caused both of them to slip, meaning no one was more to blame than the other. There is no mention of Eve deceiving or luring Adam (as) to the tree. The verse continues to state that Adam (as) turns to Allah and Allah teaches him the words with which to pray for forgiveness. It is erroneous to believe that Adam (as) and Eve’s mistake would cascade down to all men or women to bear. The Holy Qur’an states,\n‘And no burdened soul can bear the burden of another; and if a heavily laden soul call another to bear its load, naught of it shall be carried by the other.’ \nAllah is Merciful and does not give us burdens or mistakes of others to bear when most likely we carry enough of our own. In fact, the Holy Qur’an again states, ‘Allah burdens not any soul beyond its capacity.’  Thus, Eve is not only innocent of her crime of luring her husband to sin but according to the Islamic perspective, is also innocent of burdening all womenkind with her mistake.\nIn fact, Hazrat Mirza Bashiruddin Mahmud Ahmad (ra), the Second Caliph and Worldwide Head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, writes in his commentary of the Holy Qur’an,\n‘Meaning Satan swore before Adam (as) and his companions that surely I am your well-wisher.” In turn, Adam (as) slipped. The commentary continues to state, “Adam (as) was the first prophet. There were no such examples as lessons present before this. In fact, it is likely that God Almighty tolerated this instance, this lapse to occur as a lesson for future people.’ \nIslam fells the notion of Eve as the means of man’s fall to disgrace by revealing to us the truth of what happened. The blight for which so many centuries stained Eve and womenkind in association, is now wiped clean.\nBut, if she is not what we thought she was before, then who is she? Does she play a role within the larger society and our religious understanding? Hazrat Mirza Bashiruddin Mahmud Ahmad (ra) states,\n‘The word Hawwa is derived from [hawwa yahowi] which means to cover something, to collect something, or to become the owner of something. As such, Hawwa means somebody who gathers children round herself, rules them and is known as the head of the household.’ \nIn Islam, we believe that the names of Adam (as) and Eve were bestowed upon them by Allah. Hence, these names are not arbitrary, but rather signify each of their roles in society. While Adam’s (as) name means one who works the earth and earns his living by working it, Eve was the steward of the next generation. She was meant to gather her progeny around her, teach them, and rule over them. She was to be the queen of her home. What a drastic change from how western culture and religious traditions have portrayed her. Instead of vilifying her for the demise of humankind, Islam instead lifts Eve up as the model for all womenkind. If we wish to be the queen of our homes, to transform society into one of righteousness, one which is deserving of conversing with God, then we should all become like Eve.\nHazrat Mirza Bashiruddin Mahmud Ahmad (ra) continues on to state that women who,\n‘… do not train their children in such a way that the future generation should become pious, righteous, brave, fearless, ready to offer every sacrifice for the sake of their faith, and acquire religious knowledge, are something else entirely. They are daughters of Hawwa in name only, not in practice. For they did not gather their children around themselves nor did they prove themselves to be the true master of the household.’ \nThus, Islam so beautifully clears up every attempt at besmirching Eve’s character, for both Adam (as) and Eve made a mistake. Upon realizing this mistake, God taught them the prayer for forgiveness. Allah sent both Adam (as) and Eve out into the world and assigned Eve the responsibility of creating a kingdom within her home of which she was the queen. In which she was responsible for raising righteous progeny. Righteous progeny goes on to create righteous societies, essentially creating Gardens of Eden here on Earth.\nThe lush garden of paradise which is bemoaned by so many as to have been lost by delicate hands plucking fruit from a tree is no longer relevant. For no garden was lost, no virtue tainted, the fall of man does not exist. Rather this is an opportunity to gain everything if we follow in the footsteps of Eve as we should. Let us leave the apple and serpent to the patriarchal imaginations of old and embrace the queendom of Eve as one who upholds the best a woman has to offer.\nAbout the Author: Nila Ahmad lives in the southern United States with her family.

In Islam, Iblis is a jinn who refused to bow for Adam. (Some Islamic scholars [Notably Muhammad Asad] believe him to be one of the angels, but this view is hard to reconcile with Iblis' own statement that he was created from fire).\nThe primary characteristic of the Devil is hubris. His primary activity is to incite humans and jinn to commit evil through deception, which is referred to as \"whispering into the hearts\". The Quran mentions that Satans are the assistants of those who disbelieve in God: \"We have made the evil ones friends to those without faith.\"\nNamings and etymology\nThe term Iblis (Arabic: إِبْلِيس) is probably altered from Ancient Greek διάβολος (diábolos), also the ultimate source of English devil. An alternative folk etymology derivation is from the Arabic verbal root بَلَسَ (balasa, \"he despaired\"). The term Shaytan (Arabic: شَيْطَان) has the same origin as Hebrew שָׂטָן (Sātān), source of the English Satan.\nIn popular Islamic culture, \"Shaytan\" (Arabic: شيطان), is often simply translated as \"the Devil\", but the term can refer to any of the jinn who disobey God and follow Iblīs. Some scholars are of the view that Iblīs is the father of all of the jinn, just as Adam is the father of all of humanity as mentioned in the Quran (sura 18, Al-Kahf), \"Will you then take him and his progeny as protectors rather than Me? And they are enemies to you!\"\nThe Devil in Islamic theology\nAccording to basic Islamic teachings, God revealed the creation of three intelligent species: angels (malāʾikah), demons (jinn), and humans (basher), of which the latter two have been granted free will to choose between good and evil, and the Quran states that there is other creation beyond human knowledge \"and He has created (other) things of which we have no knowledge.\"\nThe angels, being creatures of pure reason without lower animal desires, do not sin. When God created Adam, he commanded all the angels and Iblis (whose high rank allowed him to worship Allah with the angels) to prostrate to Adam. All the angels did so, but Iblis refused, and was deprived of Allah's Mercy because of his arrogant disobedience. For this God cast him out of Jannah (paradise), and intended to punish him. Iblis begged God to delay the punishment until Yawm al-Qiyāmah (Last Judgment), and his request was granted.\nIt is We Who created you and gave you shape; then We bade the angels prostrate to Adam, and they prostrate; not so Iblis; He refused to be of those who prostrate.\n(Allah) said: \"What prevented thee from prostrating when I commanded thee?\" He said: \"I am better than he: Thou didst create me from fire, and him from clay.\"\nIblis was proud and considered himself superior to Adam, since Adam was made from clay and Iblis from smokeless fire. For this act of disobedience, God cursed him to Jahannam (Hell/Purgatory) for eternity, but gave him respite until the Day of Judgment, after Iblis requested it. Iblis obtained permission from God and vowed that he would use this time to lead all men and women astray to Hell. In this way, he would prove humanity's inferiority, and justify his act of defiance. For refusing to abide by the will of God, Iblis was cast out of Heaven, and thereafter he was called \"Shaytan\" (Satan).\nHe said: \"Give me respite till the day they are raised up.\"\n(Allah) said: \"Be thou among those who have respite.\"\nHe said: \"Because thou hast thrown me out of the way, lo! I will lie in wait for them on thy straight way:\n\"Then will I assault them from before them and behind them, from their right and their left: Nor wilt thou find, in most of them, gratitude (for thy mercies).\"\n(Allah) said: \"Get out from this, disgraced and expelled. If any of them follow thee,- Hell will I fill with you all.—Quran sura 7 (Al-Aʻraf), ayah 14-18\n\"As for My servants, no authority shalt thou have over them:\" Enough is thy Lord for a Disposer of affairs.\nSuch individuals had previously been mentioned in the Torah and the Gospel as the Elect.\nShaytan as a \"whisperer\"\nIn Islamic theology, Shaytan and his minions are \"whisperers\", who whisper into the hearts of humans and jinn, urging them to sin.\nThe Quran provides a supplication for mankind which is effective in repelling the evil of Satan and his minions:\nSay: I seek refuge with the Lord and Cherisher of Mankind,\nThe King (or Ruler) of Mankind,\nThe God (or judge) of Mankind,-\nFrom the mischief of the Whisperer (of Evil), who withdraws (after his whisper),-\n(The same) who whispers into the hearts of Mankind,-\nAmong Jinn and among men.\nDifference between Iblis and Shaytan\n- Quran 7:12\n- Quran 2:30\n- Quran 114:4\n- Quran 7:27\n- New World Encyclopedia, Iblis\n- Is Iblees the father of all Jinn, evil and righteous ones, or a father for only the evil Jinn?.\n- Quran 18:50\n- Esposito, Oxford Dictionary of Islam, 2003, p.279\n- Quran 10:44\n- Quran 16:8\n- Juan Eduardo Campo.

{"question":"What's the typical recovery time: postoperative care vs small bowel resection?","answer":"For general postoperative care, the recovery time varies depending on the type of surgery, while small bowel resection specifically has a recovery period of 6-12 weeks. During both recovery periods, patients need to follow their doctor's instructions and watch for complications, but small bowel resection may have specific concerns like chronic diarrhea and malnutrition due to compromised nutrient absorption.","context":["Postoperative care is the care you receive after a surgical procedure. The type of postoperative care you need depends on the type of surgery you have, as well as your health history. It often includes pain management and wound care.\nPostoperative care begins immediately after surgery. It lasts for the duration of your hospital stay and may continue after you’ve been discharged. As part of your postoperative care, your healthcare provider should teach you about the potential side effects and complications of your procedure.\nBefore you have surgery, ask your doctor what the postoperative care will involve. This will give you time to prepare beforehand. Your doctor may revise some of their instructions after your surgery, based on how your surgery went and how well you’re recovering.\nAsk as many questions as possible before your surgery, and ask for updated instructions before you’re discharged from the hospital. Many hospitals provide written discharge instructions.\nAsk your doctor questions such as:\n- How long will I be expected to remain in the hospital?\n- Will I need any special supplies or medications when I go home?\n- Will I need a caregiver or physical therapist when I go home?\n- What side effects can I expect?\n- What complications should I watch out for?\n- What things should I do or avoid to support my recovery?\n- When can I resume normal activity?\nThe answers to these questions can help you prepare ahead of time. If you expect to need help from a caregiver, arrange for it before your surgery. It’s also important to learn how to prevent, recognize, and respond to possible complications.\nDepending on the type of surgery you have, there are many potential complications that can arise. For example, many surgeries put patients at risk of infection, bleeding at the surgical site, and blood clots caused by inactivity. Prolonged inactivity can also cause you to lose some of your muscle strength and develop respiratory complications. Ask your doctor for more information about the potential complications of your specific procedure.\nAfter your surgery is complete, you will be moved to a recovery room. You’ll probably stay there for a couple of hours while you wake up from anesthesia. You’ll feel groggy when you wake up. Some people also feel nauseated.\nWhile you’re in the recovery room, staff will monitor your blood pressure, breathing, temperature, and pulse. They may ask you to take deep breaths to assess your lung function. They may check your surgical site for signs of bleeding or infection. They will also watch for signs of an allergic reaction. For many types of surgery, you will be placed under general anesthesia. Anesthesia can cause an allergic reaction in some people.\nOnce you’re stable, you’ll be moved to a hospital room if you’re staying overnight, or you’ll be moved elsewhere to begin your discharge process.\nOutpatient surgery is also known as same-day surgery. Unless you show signs of postoperative problems, you’ll be discharged on the same day as your procedure. You won’t need to stay overnight.\nBefore you’re discharged, you must demonstrate that you’re able to breathe normally, drink, and urinate. You won’t be allowed to drive immediately following a surgery with anesthesia. Make sure you arrange transportation home, preferably ahead of time. You may feel groggy into the following day.\nIf you have inpatient surgery, you’ll need to stay in the hospital overnight to continue receiving postoperative care. You may need to stay for several days or longer. In some cases, patients who were originally scheduled for outpatient surgery show signs of complications and need to be admitted for ongoing care.\nYour postoperative care will continue after you’ve been transferred out of the initial recovery room. You will probably still have an intravenous (IV) catheter in your arm, a finger device that measures oxygen levels in your blood, and a dressing on your surgical site. Depending on the type of surgery you had, you may also have a breathing apparatus, a heartbeat monitor, and a tube in your mouth, nose, or bladder.\nThe hospital staff will continue to monitor your vital signs. They may also give you pain relievers or other medications through your IV, by injection, or orally. Depending on your condition, they may ask you to get up and walk around. You may need assistance to do this. Moving will help decrease your chances of developing blood clots. It can also help you maintain your muscle strength. You may be asked to do deep breathing exercises or forced coughing to prevent respiratory complications.\nYour doctor will decide when you’re ready to be discharged. Remember to ask for discharge instructions before you leave. If you know that you’ll need ongoing care at home, make preparations ahead of time.\nIt’s very important that you follow your doctor’s instructions after you leave the hospital. Take medications as prescribed, watch out for potential complications, and keep your follow-up appointments.\nDon’t overdo things if you’ve been instructed to rest. On the other hand, don’t neglect physical activity if you’ve been given the go ahead to move around. Start to resume normal activities as soon as you safely can. Most of the time, it’s best to gradually return to your normal routine.\nIn some cases, you may not be able to care for yourself for a while after your surgery. You may need a caregiver to help tend your wounds, prepare food, keep you clean, and support you while you move around. If you don’t have a family member or friend who can help, ask your doctor to recommend a professional caregiving service.\nContact your doctor if you develop a fever, increased pain, or bleeding at the surgical site. Don’t hesitate to contact your doctor if you have questions or aren’t recovering as well as expected.\nAppropriate follow-up care can help reduce your risk of complications after surgery and support your recovery process. Ask your doctor for instructions before you have your surgery and check for updates before you leave the hospital. Contact your doctor if you suspect you’re experiencing complications or your recovery isn’t going well. With a little planning and proactive care, you can help make your recovery as smooth as possible.","Small bowel resection is a surgical procedure involving the removal of a small portion of the small intestine, or small bowel. Small bowel resection is commonly used to treat conditions such as Crohn’s disease, cancer, intussusception, volvulus, and strictures. It is also sometimes used to treat gastrointestinal bleeding.\n## What is Small Bowel Resection?\nSmall bowel resection is a procedure where a portion of the small intestine is surgically removed. This procedure is typically done to treat medical conditions such as cancer, Crohn’s disease, diverticulitis, intussusception, volvulus, strictures and gastrointestinal bleeding. The length of the section of small bowel removed vary depending on the condition being treated and can range from a few centimeters to several feet.\nDuring small bowel resection, the surgeon will use equipment to carefully cut away the affected portion of the small intestine. The ends of the healthy intestine are then stitched together. This allows for the normal flow of food and nutrients through the remaining intestine and prevents hazardous leakage.\nSometimes, a portion of the affected intestine will be removed and examined in a laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. This procedure is known as an intraoperative biopsy.\n## Benefits of Small Bowel Resection\nThe primary benefit of small bowel resection is improvement in, or complete resolution of, the symptoms associated with the condition that is being treated. Conditions such as Crohn’s disease can cause severe abdominal pain, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and even life-threatening malnutrition. Removing the affected portion of the small intestine can thus provide tremendous relief from these symptoms.\nIn some cases, small bowel resection can also reduce the risk of long-term complications associated with certain medical conditions. For instance, in cases where small bowel resections are used to treat cancer, it can help to slow the progression of the disease or even reduce the chance of it spreading to other areas in the body.\n## Expected Results After Small Bowel Resection\nMost people who undergo small bowel resection can expect to recover completely within 6-12 weeks. However, the recovery period may be longer for some people. It is important to consult with your health care provider to get an accurate estimation of recovery time.\nThe recovery process typically includes both physical and emotional elements. It is important to take time to rest and to follow the instructions from your health care provider regarding medications, lifestyle changes, and other recommended treatments.\nIt is also important to note that it is normal to experience some pain and discomfort during the recovery process. Your pain should gradually subside over time.\nThe expected outcome of small bowel resection is usually improved, or complete resolution, of the symptom being treated. In the long run, small bowel resection can reduce the risk of long-term complications for some medical conditions.\nIn summary, small bowel resection is a surgical procedure involving the removal of part or all of the small intestine and can be used to treat conditions such as Crohn’s disease, cancer, intussusception, volvulus, and strictures. The benefits of small bowel resection include relief of symptoms associated with the condition being treated and in some cases it can reduce the risk of long-term complications. Following small bowel resection, most people can expect to recover within 6-12 weeks and can expect improved or complete resolution of the symptom being treated.\nDefinition and Overview\nThe small bowel or small intestine is the tube that connects the stomach to the colon (large intestine). It is the part of the digestive system responsible for absorbing nutrients from the food a person eats. The organ is made up of three segments, namely:\nDuodenum – The first and shortest segment that receives partially digested food from the stomach.\nJejunum – The middle segment where most nutrients from food are absorbed.\nIleum – The last segment that intersects with the large intestine.\nAny of these parts can be damaged and if the damage is beyond repair, small bowel resection can be performed. Depending on which part is removed, the procedure is referred to as duodenectomy (removal of all or part of the duodenum), jejunectomy (excision of all or part of the jejunum), or ileectomy (removal of all or part of the ileum).\nWho Should Undergo and Expected Results\nSmall bowel resection is used to treat the following conditions:\nCancer of the small intestine – Malignant tumours can form in the small intestine and cause a blockage. In the majority of cases, doctors elect to remove the section where the cancer is found to treat the condition. The surgery is often followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy to ensure that no cancer cells remain in the small intestine. Small bowel resection is also used if precancerous polyps and noncancerous tumours are found in the organ.\nCrohn’s disease – Crohn’s disease is a painful and debilitating inflammatory bowel disease that is associated with a number of life-threatening complications. It is initially treated with lifestyle changes and drug therapy with surgery reserved as the last option. If patients are unable to experience symptoms relief with non-invasive treatments, small bowel resection is performed.\nSevere ulcers – Ulcers refer to holes in the mucous membrane of the small bowel. They usually occur due to infections or cancer and often cause severe bleeding.\nAs for the expected results, most patients recover well from surgery while some experience complications including problems with absorbing enough nutrients, which can lead to malnutrition.\nHow is the Procedure Performed?\nPrior to the procedure, the patient undergoes blood, urine, and imaging tests as well as electrocardiogram (EKG). The surgeon will also discuss the details of the surgery, the technique to be used, and possible risks and complications. Preoperative bowel preparations, such as completely cleaning the bowel and taking antibiotics, are standard practice.\nBefore the actual surgery, a nasogastric tube is inserted through the nose. It prevents vomiting and nausea as well as removes gastric secretions during the procedure. A urinary catheter is also used to keep the bladder empty.\nSmall bowel resection can be performed either through traditional open surgery or laparoscopically.\nIn a traditional open surgery, the surgeon makes a long incision in the abdominal wall to access and remove the diseased part of the intestine. The same is the goal of laparoscopic surgery, which uses up to five small incisions where a miniature camera, light, and surgical tools are inserted. The two healthy ends of the resected small intestine are then stapled or sewn together (anastomosis). If this is not possible, the surgeon will create an opening in the belly called a stoma where the end of the resected intestine is attached.\nMany surgeons and patients prefer laparoscopic surgery because it is minimally invasive. Patients typically recover faster because their wounds are much smaller and the interruption to their digestive system is minimal.\nThe procedure, which is often performed under general anaesthesia, can last between one to four hours. Following surgery, patients are transferred to a recovery room until the effects of anaesthesia wear off. They are then moved to a regular hospital room where they typically stay for a week before being discharged.\nPossible Risks and Complications\nMost people who undergo small bowel resection recover fast and return to their normal activities weeks after the procedure. Some, however, suffer from chronic diarrhea and malnutrition as the small intestine’s ability to absorb enough nutrients from food has been compromised.\nSmall bowel resection rarely leads to serious risks and complications. However, a small number of patients experience the following:\nScar tissue formation resulting in the blockage of intestine\nHernia at the incision site\nThe risk of complication is higher in patients who are smokers, malnourished, or suffering from chronic illnesses or have undergone abdominal surgery in the past.\nPatients are discharged about a week following a small bowel resection. They are urged to call their doctor if they develop any signs of infection, persistent abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, chest pain, and urinary symptoms.\nSmall bowel resection.

{"question":"How do government space agencies and private companies complement each other in modern space exploration, and what are the financial dynamics between them?","answer":"Government space agencies and private companies have developed a complementary relationship where space agencies like NASA and ISRO focus on scientific exploration and R&D, while private players handle commercial activities. Private companies currently generate reliable profits through contract work for public agencies - for instance, NASA has allocated US$2.6 billion over a decade for private companies to conduct lunar missions and plans to hand off ISS maintenance to outside agencies by 2025. In India, IN-SPACe will facilitate this partnership by allowing private companies to access ISRO's infrastructure and resources while enabling ISRO to concentrate on science, R&D, and strategic launches. This arrangement helps generate additional revenue for government space agencies while fostering private sector growth in activities like satellite manufacturing, ground-based systems, and space-based services.","context":["SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY/ DEVELOPMENT/ GOVERNANCE\nTopic: General Studies 2,3:\n- Science and Technology- developments and their applications and effects in everyday life\n- Government policies and interventions for development in various sectors and issues arising out of their design and implementation.\nIN-SPACe: Growing private role\nContext: The government has approved the creation of a new organisation called Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe), which is expected to be functional within six months\n- IN-SPACE will be a separate vertical within the Department of Space (DoS) that will make independent decisions for permitting and regulating activities of the private sector.\n- It will have its own legal, technological, activity promotion and monitoring directorates and its Board will comprise members from the private industry, academia and government of India\n- It will act as a national nodal agency for hand-holding and promoting private industry in the space sector and will even help private players build facilities within DoS premises\nWhy private participants?\n- It is not that there is no private industry involvement in India’s space sector. In fact, a large part of manufacturing and fabrication of rockets and satellites now happens in the private sector\n- However, Indian industries’ role has been mainly that of suppliers of components and sub-systems while there is huge scope for participation in satellite-based services, and ground-based systems.\n- Indian industry had a barely 3% share in a rapidly growing global space economy ($360 billion). There were several Indian companies waiting for make use of these opportunities but the policy environment in India was supportive of private players\n- Additionally, the demand for space-based applications and services is growing even within India, and ISRO is unable to cater to this.\nSignificance of the creation of IN-SPACe:\n- Facilitator and regulator: IN-SPACe will act as an interface between ISRO and private parties, and assess how best to utilise India’s space resources and increase space-based activities.\n- Fair Competition: IN-SPACe will provide a level playing field for private companies to use Indian space infrastructure.\n- Better utilisation of space resources: Existing ISRO infrastructure, both ground- and space-based, scientific and technical resources, and even data are planned to be made accessible to interested parties to enable them to carry out their space-related activities.\n- Strategic benefits: ISRO, like NASA, is essentially a scientific organisation whose main objective is exploration of space and carrying out scientific missions. The private industry will also free up ISRO to concentrate on science, R&D, interplanetary exploration and strategic launches.\n- Widening the horizon of Private participation: IN-SPACe will promote private players in end-to-end space services, including building and launching rockets and satellites and providing space-based services commercially.\n- Reorients space activities: IN-SPACe will reorient space sector from a ‘supply-driven’ model to a ‘demand-driven’ one, thereby ensuring optimum utilization of the nation’s space assets.\n- Leveraging the potential of Young Country: So far only ISRO was doing all space related activities. Opening up of the space sector means the potential of the entire country can be leveraged\n- Boost to Space Start-ups: This will not only result in an accelerated growth of the sector but also enable India to generate large scale employment in the technology sector.\n- Additional revenue: ISRO can earn some money by making its facilities and data available to private players\n- Need for new navigation policies: India has the SatCom policy and Remote Sensing Data Policy (RSDP) but they need suitable modifications for the purpose of IN-SPACe to perform its duty in an effective manner\n- Changes needed in New Space India Limited (NSIL): It needs to be recalibrated to transform its approach of a supply-driven model to being a demand-driven model for space-based services\n- Enhancing ease of doing space business: Space activities are multi-layered projects which involve a lot of intricacies across domains, such as gaining access to frequencies, licensing of satellites for operation, ability to export products, imagery\n- The SatCom policy dictates the use of Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system’s capacity by non-governmental agencies, the establishment and operation of Indian Satellite Systems and the use of foreign satellites for SatCom Services\n- India’s Remote Sensing Data Policy (RSDP) is for the acquisition and distribution of remote sensing satellite data — from Indian and foreign satellites — for civilian users in India\nConnecting the dots:\n- UN Outer Space Treaty\n- Gaganyaan Mission of ISRO","On 12th April 1961, cosmonaut Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin became the first man in space when he completed one orbit of the earth in the Russian Vostok spacecraft. A similar, yet equally extraordinary event occurred 43 years later when, on 21st June 2004, Mike Melvill crossed the 100-km boundary line that marks the edge of space in the rocket-powered aircraft SpaceShipOne. With this achievement, he became the world’s first commercial astronaut, securing the US$10 million Ansari X Prize for the SpaceShipOne team.\nMelvill’s flight harnessed all the latest aeronautical technology – the culmination of more than 45 years of human space exploration. However, SpaceShipOne’s mission is memorable for what it did not use: a single government dollar.\n“Making the cosmos profitable may prove harder than putting a man on the moon.”\nSince that pivotal moment, space has become increasingly commercialised. According to analytics and research firm Bryce Space and Technology, space-related start-ups attracted over US$18.4 billion of investment from 2000 to 2017.\nHundreds of new companies have formed, countless entrepreneurs have mobilised, and along with a few charismatic billionaires, they have all entered a different kind of space race. The idealistic milestones of the Cold War space race are no longer relevant – this contest is far more pragmatic. Making the cosmos profitable, however, may prove harder than putting a man on the moon.\nThe new space companies looking to build a free market beyond the Kármán line – the boundary where space begins: 100 km above sea level – all face a nagging incongruity. Unlike public agencies such as NASA and the European Space Agency, privately funded companies must eventually turn a profit. Currently, however, the only reliable way of generating profit has been through contract work for publicly funded space agencies.\nSatellite, equipment and crew launches, along with research opportunities paid for by public coffers, have enabled the burgeoning private space industry to grow. Moreover, government support for private companies in space is only set to increase. The most recent budget presented to the US Congress calls for NASA to end direct funding for the International Space Station by 2025, effectively handing off earth’s lower orbit and the maintenance of the ISS to outside agencies. Another more lucrative opportunity for new space companies came in late 2018 when NASA announced the allocation of US$2.6 billion over the next decade for private companies to fly small payloads to the moon.\nNASA is candid about their rationale to contract private companies for lunar exploration and development. The move may have a basis in cost-cutting, but NASA‘s stated intention is to increase competitiveness thereby encouraging the complete commercialisation of space. The realisation of this goal, however, is not unlike our knowledge of deep space: nobody knows what it will look like or how to get there.\nAn Economy in a Vacuum\nIn terms of funding, current activities in space are entirely public or a mixture of both public and private. For true space commerce to exist, private sector companies must offer products or services for private sector customers using solely private sector capital. Presently, satellite television is one of the only viable industries which meets these stipulations, but other commercial endeavours are starting to take off.\nPrivate space travel or space tourism is perhaps the most visible expression of the commercialisation of space. Regardless of its viability, it’s certainly the most publicised among the services offered by the private sector through companies like Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic. The company plans to launch its first paying passenger in 2019, with more lining up ready to pay US$250,000 for an extraterrestrial ride. The potential scope of space tourism was further elucidated in September 2018 when Elon Musk’s SpaceX announced it would ferry Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa around the moon in 2023.\nCommodities are another consideration: the precipitous demand for metals resulting from the exponential growth of populations reliant on digital technologies has private companies looking elsewhere for resources. Not only has this recent push generated extensive interest in excavating the ocean’s floor, but it has also seen the inception of several new space mining companies. In the near future, the private industry hopes to make significant profits by securing valuable minerals from asteroids and other celestial bodies.\nA 2017 report by investment firm Goldman Sachs declared that the financial and technological barriers presented by asteroid mining were low – even comparable to terrestrial mining operations. The Government of Luxembourg is invested: their Space Resources initiative, worth US$227 million, seeks to establish Luxembourg as the European hub for space resources.\nStill, there are some who believe the best opportunities for the commercialisation of space lie in the immediately viable GPS and imaging sectors. Orbiting satellites that can provide everything from communication to spectrum optics services for private industry can turn real profit today rather than sometime in the next 30 years.\nThen there’s logistics – closer to the ground and less glamorous but arguably as important are the start-ups developing practical solutions for space infrastructure. Life support systems, crew habitats, traffic management and food products are the framework that other, more grandiose ventures will depend on over the next several decades."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2165f0f7-eb2a-4720-8a08-dbbfe97ead2d>","<urn:uuid:fce92499-5b39-4dba-aa72-a1ccea93ab90>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do polyaspartic and epoxy floor coatings differ in their moisture sensitivity and surface preparation requirements?","answer":"Both polyaspartic and epoxy coatings require careful moisture consideration and surface preparation. Polyaspartic coatings require moisture testing first, as excessive moisture transmission through the slab can cause problems, and a vapor barrier is recommended beneath concrete. For epoxy, concrete surfaces must be bone dry and at least 55 degrees, with air temperatures between 60 and 90 degrees. New concrete must cure for 30 days before epoxy application. Both types require thorough cleaning, but epoxy specifically needs acid etching and multiple cleaning steps including degreasing, while polyaspartic mainly needs general cleaning to ensure good bonding.","context":["Polyaspartic Garage Floor Coating\nWhat is Polyaspartic Floor Coating?\nAverage Cost Range: $4.00 to $9.00 per square foot\nPolyaspartic floor coating is a two-part coating, like epoxy, but made with aliphatic polyurea. It is sprayed or rolled onto concrete to form a tough and durable flooring. Pigment is added to the polyaspartic flooring to give you the color you prefer. Metallic or vinyl chip packs are often sprinkled onto the wet coating for aesthetics..\nFebruary 21, 2023, by: Rob Parsell\nThis polyaspartic coating report covers cost, pros and cons, a look at polyaspartic floor coating vs epoxy, and additional information that will assist you in deciding if this is the right flooring for your project.\nWe’ve given you a brief summary of polyaspartics and average costs, now we’re going to get into the details.\nMORE ABOUT POLYASPARTIC FLOOR COATING\nLike epoxy, Polyaspartic floor coating is a two-part flooring system. It consists of a polyurea component, similar to polyurethane, and a hardener. This class of floor coatings is termed polyaspartics or polyurea polyaspartic coating.\nThe components are mixed just prior to application. The pot life, or the time in which you can apply it before it thickens too much to use, is just 20-30 minutes. It dries to the touch in 2-3 hours and can be recoated in 4 hours. Give it two days before walking on it.\nThis basement and garage floor coating comes in low-gloss and high-gloss options. Keep in mind that a high gloss finish has the potential to be slippery. However, sand is often added to produce a non-slip flooring.\nDeveloped in the 1990s, polyaspartic garage floor coating is catching on with homeowners, and more contractors are offering it as a tougher alternative to epoxy coatings.\nFurther Reading: Garage Floor Ideas\nHOW MUCH DOES POLYASPARTIC FLOOR COATING COST?\nThe cost of polyaspartic floor coating is $4.00 to $9.00 per square foot. The major cost factor is whether you DIY or hire a contractor for the job. The cost of polyaspartic coating when installed by a contractor is $6.50 to $9.00. DIY application costs around $4.50 to $6.25 for the coating and tools needed.\nIs polyaspartic expensive? Yes, compared to garage floor paint ($) or epoxy ($$), this option is a little more expensive ($$-$$$).\nYou’ll save around $2.00 to $3.25 with DIY application. Here’s what the cost looks like:\n$4.00 – $6.25 for DIY\n$6.50 – $9.00 when you hire pro installers\nIf you’re considering DIY, this two-part floor coating is sold in kits from 2 gallons to 10 gallons. The kits consist of equal parts coating and hardener.\nCost is around $4 to $6 per gallon. A gallon covers 195 to 250 square feet depending on the porosity of the surface covered. If sealers are applied to the concrete first, coverage is greater. The sealer usually improves the bond of the material to the base concrete. And because sealers are much less expensive than polyaspartic flooring, it’s a cost-effective decision to seal the slab first.\nTwo layers, a base coat and a topcoat, are typically applied. The result is a finished coating of 5-6 mils.\nTo seal or not to seal? If your concrete is unsealed, check the label of the product you choose. Some manufacturers suggest applying it to unsealed concrete. This allows the coating to penetrate the concrete, which can improve the bond and prevent peel issues.\nHowever, sealers on concrete prevent the migration of moisture from beneath the floor to the surface of the concrete. If moisture is trapped between the slab and the applied material it might cause it to peel, a problem known as delamination.\nBottom line? You’ll be sure of getting the best results if you hire an experienced professional that will check the moisture content of your concrete and recommend the right products to give you the durable flooring you want.\nRelated Reading: Epoxy Basement Floor\nPROS AND CONS OF POLYASPARTIC FLOOR COATINGS\nIs a polyaspartic floor coating good? That’s a good question. The answer is yes, mostly, with a few potential drawbacks.\nDurable and tough: This is a high performance floor coating that resists stains and abrasions – it doesn’t scratch easily. It also has high chemical resistance, ideal if your garage or basement doubles as a workshop.\nWon’t fade: Apply it to a garage floor or concrete patio, and you won’t see fading or the material becoming yellow due to sun exposure.\nWaterproof: This coating resists moisture penetration.\nApply it in any season: Some polyurea polyaspartic coating can be applied in sub-freezing temperatures, so you don’t have to wait for warm weather to cover your garage floor and protect it from stains and winter salt deposits.\nDIY is doable: Kits come with clear, easy-to-follow directions. Application is pretty easy. Clean the floor to ensure a good bond. Sealing concrete first will allow you to use less mix to get the thickness you want because less will be absorbed. Then roll on the coating in one or two coats.\nHealthy air quality: Most products in this class are low VOC or no VOC material. Odor is minimal too, though you’ll probably want to vent the room or leave the garage door open until the coating cures.\nQuick cure time: Walk on it in 4-6 hours. Drive on it in 2-3 days.\nGood looks: Pigment is added to produce a color you’ll enjoy living with. And metal of vinyl chip sprinkles add visual appeal where desired.\nPrice: Costs more than epoxy coatings – about $1.25 to $3.00 per square foot more depending on DIY or pro application.\nQuality varies: Like any flooring material, there are basic, better and best options. If DIY, choose a product with a high solids count (usually listed on the label). If hiring a contractor, choose one that uses a quality product and has a good track record of customer satisfaction.\nShort pot life: The flip side of fast curing is that the material hardens quickly. You’ve got 20-30 minutes to apply the coating once the components are mixed with the hardener.\nDIY Tip – Only mix the amount you need for each of the two layers. For example, if the garage floor is 20’x24’, or 480 square feet, you’ll need 2 to 2.5 gallons of mix per layer.\nToo much moisture? If you’re considering polyurea polyaspartics for a garage or basement, it is important to do a moisture test first. If a lot of moisture is transmitting through the slab, then polyaspartic floor coating is not the right flooring for your application.\nIf you are building a home or garage, be sure to install vapor barrier beneath the concrete. That will mitigate moisture and allow you to use this product or epoxy floor coating.\nWHERE IS POLYASPARTIC FLOORING USED?\nFor our purposes, this coating is usually applied to garage floors.\nIn residential use, it is also used in basements, utility rooms, laundry rooms, pole buildings, workshops and other areas where a tough, waterproof and abrasion resistant flooring is desired.\nTo give you an idea of their high performance, you might be interested to know that polyaspartic coatings are used in a range of industrial settings. They provide corrosion protection to metal.\nAnd the polyaspartic aliphatic polyurea (technical description) are UV resistant, so it can be applied to rooftops where UV exposure is an issue.\nIS POLYASPARTIC BETTER THAN EPOXY?\nEpoxy coatings cost less than a polyaspartic coating and are quite durable. But polyaspartics provides next-level durability, stain resistance and chemical resistance. It is more UV resistant too.\nHOW LONG TO POLYASPARTIC FLOORS LAST?\nA polyaspartic floor coating lasts 20 to 50 years depending on how the space is used. In most residential settings, the floor will look good and perform well for 30+ years. In short, you will probably get tired of it and want something different before the floor needs replacing from a performance standpoint.\nTo ensure the best durability, sweep the floor regularly. Power washing it is OK too. The key is to remove sand and other gritty materials that wear away the surface of the floor, reducing its sheen.\nIS POLYASPARTIC FLOOR COATING SLIPPERY WHEN WET?\nA polyaspartic floor can be slippery unless the kit you choose contains a sand additive that makes it more slip-resistant. Adding sand is definitely recommended.\nIS POLYASPARTIC COATING A DIY PROJECT FOR HOMEOWNERS?\nInstalling a polyaspartic coating can be a DIY project. The difficulty level is easy to moderate – about the same as applying epoxy floor coatings, if you’ve done that.\nThe steps are:\n- Clean the floor thoroughly\n- Apply a chemical etching agent (optional)\n- Fill cracks in the concrete\n- Tape off wall edges, cabinets, posts, etc.\n- Mix just enough material to apply one layer\n- Roll on the first layer\n- Let the first layer cure for a minimum of 4 hours, longer if the temperature is below 75F (see the label for guidance)\nLayers: Two thin layers are better than one thick and goopy layer.\nAbout the Author:\nRob joined the Home Flooring Pros team in 2014 and is a freelance writer, specializing in flooring, remodeling and HVAC systems (read more).\n“I’m the son of an interior designer and picked up an eye for design as a result. I started hanging wallpaper and painting at 14 and learned enough on the job to be the general contractor on two homes we built for our family and did much of the finish plumbing, electrical, painting, and trim work myself.”","Epoxy floor coating—a two-part mixture of resins and hardeners—enlivens, protects, and updates concrete floors in garages, basements, sunrooms, and patios. Rolled on in multiple layers, epoxy coatings create seamless stretches of flooring that withstand grease, scuffing, moisture, and chemicals. Epoxy coatings—which require blending two separate components before application—firmly adhere to concrete and are unlikely to chip or peel like regular garage floor paints.\nDurability and their non-flammable nature make epoxy coated floors a good choice for garages and basement work spaces. They are strong enough to withstand dropped power tools, carry the weight of rolling and parked cars, and stand up to spills of all kinds. In fact, when properly applied, epoxy floor finishes can endure for as long as 20 years.\nEpoxy floor paints are tough resin-base paints that come in two separate parts mixed together before applying. There are three different types of epoxy paint: solid, solvent-base, and water-base.\nSolid epoxy: Epoxy that is solid is the purest form of epoxy. It doesn't contain solvents that evaporate. These products are expensive and difficult to handle because they harden very rapidly. This finish should be applied by a professonal.\nSolvent-base epoxy: Solvent-base epoxies contain from 40 to 60 percent solids. They penetrate the concrete surface and adhere well. They are available in wide range of colors. Because the solvents are powerful and potentially hazardous, you must wear a respirator when applying the finish. You'll also need to ventilate the garage and keep people and pets away from the garage.\nWater-base epoxy: Like solvent-base expoxies, water-base epoxies also contain from 40 to 60 percent solids. The benefit of this type of epoxy is there are no hazardous solvent fumes. These epoxy finishes are sold at most home centers and hardware stores, and are becoming increasingly popular alternatives to solvent-based finishes.\nPre-tinted and metallic epoxy floor coatings expand decorating options—especially when it comes to stylish flooring inside and outside living areas. Some epoxy floor coating systems provide colored flakes, which are scattered as the second layer of coating is applied, to create speckled patterns in the surface.\nThere's nothing difficult about applying epoxy floor coatings—it's almost as simple as rolling paint on a wall or across a porch floor. But before you begin, you need to thoroughly clean and patch the floor to be coated. You should also carefully calculate how much mixture is required to cover the area you wish to coat with epoxy. Many floor epoxy kits supply only one coat of coverage, and you'll need a minimum of two layers. Measure the square footage of the area to be coated, and compare that with the coverage supplied by your preferred floor epoxy kit.\nTime is of the essence once the epoxy paint and the hardener components are mixed—the epoxy mixture is only workable for about 2 hours. Consider this time frame as you determine how you will paint yourself out of a garage, patio, or room.\nWant to hire out the work? Cost analyzers at How Much Is It say having a professional lay down an epoxy floor will cost you between $5 to $13 a square foot, with an average two-car garage floor costing anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000 to complete. The folks at Angie's List recommend you ask contractors how they plan to prep the floor, what type of epoxy they will be using, and how many coats they will be applying. It is recommended that professionals should apply three layers of 100 percent epoxy with low or no volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Get multiple quotes, and check the contractors' references.\nPrefer to tackle it yourself? Read the epoxy floor coating manufacturer's instructions before you start, and use these step-by-step instructions as your guide.\nAlthough their benefits are many, epoxy coatings require a good deal of surface cleaning and preparation up front, as well as multiple applications with curing times of at least 12 hours for each coat. For optimum curing, concrete surfaces should be bone dry and at least 55 degrees, and air temperatures should be between 60 and 90 degrees. Plan on at least a day of prep time (more if you have to fill holes and patch cracks in the concrete floor) and at least two days of painting time to complete a garage floor.\nEpoxy floor coating finishes are naturally shiny, which makes them easy to clean but slick when wet (anti-skid additives can be added to give surfaces more traction). There are some concrete surfaces—such as those that suffer from dampness or those that are already sealed—that are unsuited to epoxy floor coatings. New concrete must have cured for at least 30 days before epoxy coatings can be applied.\nIf necessary, use a flat-edged shovel or scraper to remove hardened debris. Then, vacuum the garage floor. Prepare a cleaning/degreasing solution according to manufacturer's instructions. Wearing rubber gloves, use a stiff-bristle brush and the solution to scrub off any grease or oil stains.\nUse a hose to wet the entire floor with water. Working in 5-foot-square sections, use a power scrubber with a brush attachment and the degreaser to clean the entire floor. Use the stiff-bristle brush to scrub the corners and along the walls where the machine can't reach. After the floor is clean, use a rubber squeegee to pull soapy water into a central area. Remove the solution with a wet-dry vac. Check with your county's environmental office to see if you are allowed to dispose of the solution by flushing it down the toilet.\nPour a gallon of water into a plastic sprinkler can. Wearing a vapor respirator, pour 12 ounces of 32-percent muriatic acid into 15 cups of water (for smaller or larger amounts, use 1 part acid to 10 parts water) in the sprinkler can. Mix the solution for a few seconds with a paint stirrer. Sprinkle the mixture evenly over a 10x10-foot area.\nPower-scrub the 10x10-foot area for 10 minutes or use a long-handled acid brush (to save on equipment rental). Repeat the sprinkling/scrubbing process until the entire floor is acid etched. Rinse three times to flush acid residue. Let the floor dry overnight.\nFollowing manufacturer's instructions, use a drill and stirring bit to mix together the two epoxy solutions. To ensure complete blending, pour the mixture into a second bucket and power-mix the paint again.\nUsing duct tape, tape the area directly beneath the garage door, then brush a 4-inch strip of epoxy against the tape and along the garage walls.\nUse a 9-inch-wide roller with a medium nap to paint the floor. Attach the roller to a pole. Then, dip the roller into the bucket of epoxy so only the bottom half of the roller is covered. (This loads the roller with the right amount of epoxy.) Working in a 4-foot-square area, apply epoxy to garage floor in a large \"W\" pattern. Backroll to fill in the pattern and remove any roller marks. Make sure edges remain wet as you move from section to section to prevent noticeable seams from forming. Let the first coat dry per manufacturer's instructions.\nIf you don't want a glossy floor (they are slippery when wet), add a non-skid floor coating into the epoxy for the second coat. Stir with the drill and stirring bit. Repeat Step 7. Want to add color flakes? Scatter them lightly while the area is still wet—add more flakes until you create your desired pattern.\nMask off and paint the bottom 4 inches of garage or basement wall with the epoxy mix used on the floor. This border creates a cohesive look that also acts as a protective baseboard.\nAngie's List recommends the following maintenance tasks: Vacuum or sweep up debris, immediately wipe away spills with a soft cloth, and deep-clean soiled floors by mopping with a mixture of ½ cup ammonia to a gallon of water. Lift rust stains by gently scrubbing with a kitchen scrubbing pad and hot water; never use an abrasive cleaner, acids, or chemicals on epoxy-coated floors. The easiest way to clean epoxy floors? Hose them down and dry them with a squeegee on a pole."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bd3aba7d-5a4d-43d8-a854-e716e15a54cd>","<urn:uuid:2429c5bf-bb1c-4fdf-8905-124dc861bf4c>"],"error":null}

The plant has played an important role within the indigenous cultures of Paraguay, northern Argentina, and Brazil where the roots were used for binding and the yellow/white berries were used as a sweet food and medicinal source.\n- Family: Araceae\n- Genus: Thaumatophyllum\n- Species: bipinnatifidum\nThere is much confusion with the naming of the Split Leaf Philodendron, so it may be worth noting the other names it has been known by. Its synonyms are: Arum pinnatifidum, Philodendron bipinnatifidum, Philodendron pygmaeum.\nTo prevent further confusion Philodendron selloum (which some sources list as a synonym) has not been included here. It does appear to have been a synonym in the past, as mentioned in a Kew Bulletin article from 1991. But, Plants of World Online (a more modern Kew resource, considered by professionals to be an authority naming source) does not include this name as a synonym.\nThe Split Leaf Philodendron is an evergreen shrub with dark, glossy green, long-stalked leaves. The plant grows to around 10 feet (3m) high and 15 feet (4.5m) wide. Its deeply divided leaves can reach up to 3 feet (1m) in length. The RHS reports that it can occasionally produce purple and cream spathes (flower spikes) a foot (30cm) in length.\nMost Common Varieties to Grow as Houseplants\nThere are a number of varieties of Split Leaf Philodendron on the market. One of the most common is Philodendron Xanadu (Philodendron bipinnatifidum ‘Winterbourn’). Xanadu is a more compact cultivar with an ultimate height of only 3-4 feet (90-120cm).\nOther common cultivars include:\n- ‘Gold Satin’ – bright yellow leaves.\n- ‘Little Crunchy’ – a dwarf plant with thick ‘lettuce-like leaves.\n- ‘Lime Fiddle’ – variegated patterned leaves.\nSplit Leaf Philodendron vs Monstera – What’s the Difference?\nThe Split Leaf Philodendron plant is often confused with Monstera deliciosa, the Swiss Cheese plant. Both are commonly known by the name Split Leaf Philodendron and, although they do look rather similar, they are totally different plants. This confusion has become so widespread that some plant nurseries are now selling Monstera plants that are incorrectly labeled as Split Leafed Philodendrons.\nHere are the differences between the two:\nMonstera deliciosa – Has holes in the leaves that don’t reach the edges. It has a climbing habit and needs support as it grows. In its natural environment, it would grow up a tree.\nSplit Leaf Philodendron – Has splits in the leaves that run from the edges, inward. It’s also a self-heading type of plant, meaning it doesn’t need support to grow up. It supports itself with a trunk, like a tree.\nSplit-Leaf Philodendron Uses & Benefits\n- Ornamental – Its lush, dark green foliage makes it a perfect choice for adding a tropical feel to your home.\n- Feng Shui – Its softly rounded leaves make it a good choice for bringing gentle, natural energy to any room.\n- Food – The berries can be cooked to make a compote.\n- Medicinal* – The Useful Tropical Plants Database lists the Split Leaf Philodendron as a medicinal plant. The roots can be used as a purgative, the stems for inflammation.\n*Note – The medicinal properties of Split Leaf Philodendron are often reported under its other commonly used names, Philodendron bipinnatifidum and Philodendron selloum.\nSplit-Leaf Philodendron Meaning & Symbolism\nA Split Leaf Philodendron makes a wonderful gift for anyone who cares about the natural world as it symbolizes a love of nature. Its ability to grow to a great size reflects personal growth and abundance. It is a plant that keeps on giving. It is also used to symbolize good health so it makes a thoughtful present for someone going through a period of illness.\nHow to Grow Split-Leaf Philodendron Plants at Home:\n5 Things to do Before Planting:\n- Using the information provided above, make sure that your new plant is actually a Split Leaf Philodendron and not a Monstera deliciosa!\n- Check it over thoroughly to make sure there are no signs of pests or disease. The most obvious signs are the presence of insects and, discolored or drooping leaves.\n- Consider where in your home you would like to place your new plant. You should plan for a height and spread of at least 6 feet (1.8m). An ideal location is free of draughts and, is away from any heat sources. Natural light is essential, a location within 3 feet of a window is best. (See below for further details on lighting needs)\n- Choose a decorative pot with drainage holes and a saucer to match. Your pot should be large enough to comfortably hold the root ball, plus a couple of inches excess space all round.\n- Buy in plenty of good quality potting compost. A standard houseplant mix will suit it just fine. (See below for the ideal potting mix)\nGrowth Expectations – How Big Will the Split Leaf Philodendron Grow Indoors?\nIt is possible for the Split Leaf Philodendron to grow to around 10 feet (3m) high and 15 feet (4.5m) wide in 10-20 years. Within a household setting it is more likely to be around 6 feet (1.8m) tall and wide.\nHow to Plant a Split Leaf Philodendron:\nSuitable Pots for a Split Leaf Philodendron\n- Your pot should be large enough to comfortably hold the root ball of your new plant.\n- There should be a couple of inches of extra space all around the root ball to allow space to grow into.\n- It should have drainage holes at the bottom to allow the water to run freely away from the roots.\nHow to Pot Your Split Leaf Philodendron\n- Remove the plant from its plastic pot.\n- Gentle loosen any tightly packed roots, taking care not to break them.\n- Add a couple of inches of your potting mix to the base of the pot then pop your plant on top.\n- Place more compost around the sides of the root ball, gently pressing it into place.\n- Fill the pot to the top of the root ball. No higher than it was in its original pot.\n- Gently firm the plant into place and water thoroughly, until the water flows from the bottom of the pot.\nWhat’s the Best Potting Soil Mix for a Split Leaf Philodendron?\nThe best potting mix for a Split Leaf Philodendron is a soil that is rich in nutrients and well drained.\nIt will be more than happy in a standard peat-moss based mix but if you wish to make your own mix, the perfect ingredients are:\n- Standard houseplant mix\nMix the three together, in equal parts, to achieve a potting mix that has a good balance of moisture retention, and drainage.\nSplit Leaf Philodendron Care\nSplit Leaf Philodendron Care – Light Preferences:\nIdeally, Split Leaf Philodendrons need bright, indirect light, so a position within 3 feet of a south or east-facing window protected by Venetian blinds would be perfect. Hot, midday sun can scorch the leaves so shade should be provided during those hours.\nTemperature & Humidity Preferences:\nTemperature: Average house temperatures are perfect for the Split Leaf Philodendron. They thrive at 65-80°F (18-27°C). They can’t tolerate anything lower than 60°F (16°C).\nHumidity: The Split Leaf Philodendron is a rainforest native and therefore prefers an environment where humidity is at 40% or more.\nWatering Split Leaf Philodendron:\nThese plants like their soil to be kept consistently moist, but never waterlogged. Water when the top inch or two of soil feels dry to the touch. Water thoroughly, until the water drains out from the bottom of the pot. If using a saucer, after an hour or two, empty any water left standing in it.\nHow and When to Fertilize Split Leaf Philodendron:\nFertilizing it not usually necessary when plants are regularly re-potted (see below for schedule). If your plant begins to show signs of needing extra nutrition (such as yellowing leaves or a marked reduction in growth rate) you can feed monthly, with a balanced liquid fertilizer. You can feed from spring through to fall, according to the instructions on the packet.\nWhen and How to Prune a Split Leaf Philodendron\nWhen to prune:\nPrune out any dead, diseased or damaged growth as it appears. To restrict growth prune in late winter/early spring.\nHow to Prune:\nUsing a sharp, clean pair of secateurs you can cut back any stem by trimming it back to the trunk, or to just above a node. A node is the part of the stem where the leaves grow from. Usually there is a line around the stem where a node is, you should cut just above this point.\nPropagating a Split Leaf Philodendron\nSplit Leaf Philodendrons are easily propagated by seed (if it appears), by layering, or by stem cuttings.\n- Sow the seed in spring, close to the surface of your potting mix (as detailed above).\n- Water well and place in a propagator, or cover with a plastic bag until germination occurs.\n- Your seeds should be kept at an even temperature of 66-75F (19-24C).\n- Once the seedlings appear you can remove the plastic bag/take them out of the propagator.\n- Pot them on into individual pots when they have two sets of leaves.\n- Locate a stem that is flexible enough to bend to soil level without breaking\n- Pin an area of stem with a node to the soil. You can use a wire peg, or something heavy like a rock to hold it down. The aim is to get the nodes to stay in contact with the soil.\n- You can cover the stem area with compost if you wish but it isn’t usually necessary.\n- Leave in place for a few months until roots form at the nodes.\n- Cut away the rooted stem parts and pot up individually.\nBy Stem Cutting:\n- In spring, remove a section of stem from the main plant, cutting just above a node. The cut section should contain at least 3 nodes.\n- Trim your cutting just under the lowest node.\n- Insert the cutting into a pot of compost (as detailed above) or specialist cutting compost.\n- Water well and place into a propagator or cover with a plastic bag. Use sticks to hold the plastic away from the cuttings if using the bag method.\n- Keep your cuttings in a warm place, out of direct sunlight, until you can see roots appearing at the holes in the bottom of the pot.\nWhen and How to Re-pot Split Leaf Philodendron\nSplit Leaf Philodendrons should be re-potted every year, preferably in Spring. Repotting in spring gives the plant a boost of fresh nutrients that will last throughout the growing year ahead.\nIf the root ball is becoming congested, move it to a pot that is a couple of inches larger to allow plenty of space for new roots to grow.\nTo repot you plant:\n- Remove your plant from its pot and shake off any loose, old compost.\n- Add a layer of compost (a couple of inches deep) to the bottom of your new pot then replace the plant.\n- Add more compost around the sides of the root ball gently firming into place until the pot is evenly filled.\n- Water thoroughly, until the water runs from the bottom of the pot.\nCommon Split Leaf Philodendron Problems & How to Treat Them\nLeaf and Root Problems\nThe appearance of yellow leaves can be a symptom of overwatering, a lack of light, or a nutrient deficiency. Move your plant closer to a light source, begin a feeding regime (as described above), and/or reduce the frequency of watering.\nDark brown spots are also a sign of overwatering and can be an indication that the roots are beginning to rot. Remove the plant from its pot and inspect the root system. The compost should be damp but not wet. If water appears to be pooling around the roots you can repot (as described above) or, you can leave the plant out of its pot for a few hours to dry out a little. If you see any dark or obviously rotten roots trim them off with a sharp, clean knife.\nPale brown, crispy leaves are a sign of underwatering or low humidity. Increase the frequency of watering and/or increase humidity levels with a humidifier. Alternatively, you can place a tray filled with water and gravel underneath the plant. As the water evaporates from the tray it will raise the air humidity.\nCommon Pests & Diseases\nSplit Leaf Philodendrons are generally pest and disease free.\nScale insects and spider mites are common houseplant pests so it is advisable to check your plants regularly for signs of any infestations. Pests can be eradicated by applying an insecticidal soap to the leaves or, by applying a systemic pesticide to the roots.\nEssential Tools to Have Around\nNo specialist tools are needed to care for a Split Leaf Philodendron. The only things to have on hand are a sharp knife or pair of secateurs for pruning and, a cloth to wipe dust from the leaves.\nDespite the confusion surrounding the identity of the Split Leaf Philodendron, they are readily available and super easy to care for. Just use the tips mentioned above to make sure that what you are getting is actually a Split Leaf Philodendron and not a Monstera!

{"question":"Can you explain the differences between active and passive euthanasia, and what tests are required to diagnose brain death?","answer":"Active euthanasia involves the deliberate killing of a patient (e.g., by injecting an overdose of morphine), while passive euthanasia refers to withdrawing or withholding treatment while letting the disease take its course. The distinction is between killing and letting die. As for brain death diagnosis, it requires specific clinical tests including: checking for absence of pupillary response to light, corneal reflexes, vestibulo-ocular reflex, cranial nerve response to pain, and gag and cough reflexes. Additionally, an apnea test must be performed by disconnecting the patient from the ventilator for 10 minutes while providing 100% oxygen to demonstrate the death of the respiratory center in the brainstem.","context":["End of Life Decisions 101\nDennis M. Sullivan, MD, MA (Ethics)\nThe care of patients near the end of life can be ethically challenging. Physicians and other health care professionals may find certain concepts vague and hard to understand. Furthermore, there must be a balance between two extremes: a treat-at-all-costs vitalism on the one hand, and a too-rapid withdrawal of potentially beneficial treatments on the other. The purpose of this article is to provide some conceptual clarity.1\nA terminal condition is a disease or disease process that will result eventually in a patient’s death, no matter what treatment is given. Of course, this may include cases where death is inevitable but far off, as in patients with cancer who live for years with their disease. On the other hand, the expression imminent death is used when death is expected within a short time, usually days or weeks.2\nThe word euthanasia comes from two Greek words: eu for “good,” and thanatos for “death.” Thus the term means a “good” or “gentle” death.3 Active euthanasia is the overt, deliberate killing of a patient, e.g., by injecting an overdose of morphine or by giving potassium chloride to stop the heart. Passive euthanasia refers to the withdrawing or withholding of treatment, while the disease process takes its course to cause death.4 In other words, the distinction is between killing and letting die, but the intent in both is the patient”s death.\nMost would condemn active killing. “Letting die” may seem to be more acceptable, though it can be just as unethical as active killing. Some ethicists would thereby argue that there is no morally relevant distinction between active and passive euthanasia.5 However, this oversimplifies the reality of medical care. “Letting die” may be morally justifiable in medicine if a particular intervention is truly futile, or if a patient or her authorized surrogate refuses it.3 Thus, the medical cause of death does have moral relevance, though not in and of itself. For these reasons, the term passive euthanasia has only added confusion to the ethical debate, and should be discarded.\nAnother way to look at euthanasia involves three categories: voluntary, nonvoluntary, and involuntary. Voluntary euthanasia is the act of bringing about a competent patient”s death at his request. Nonvoluntary euthanasia means ending the life of an incompetent patient, usually at the request of a family member, as in the Karen Quinlan case. In 1975, the New Jersey Supreme Court granted Miss Quinlan”s father the right to authorize removal of the respirator from his comatose daughter.6 Involuntary euthanasia means taking the life of an competent patient who does not wish to die.7 A moment”s reflection will demonstrate that these are not morally helpful distinctions. As mentioned earlier, the active taking of a patient”s life is usually considered wrong, even if a patient requests it. The focus here is on the agent who gives consent, rather than on the ethical merits of the act of killing or letting die. Physician-assisted suicide is a variation of voluntary active euthanasia, where the agent who causes the death is the patient herself, with means provided by the physician.\nFinally, the omission v. commission argument is frequently cited in making a distinction between withholding treatment, i.e., not starting it, versus withdrawing treatment, i.e., stopping an intervention already begun. Historically, the latter has always been more difficult in medicine than the former, though this is probably more psychological than real. Bioethicists Beauchamp and Childress call the distinction “both irrelevant and dangerous.”7\nAnother aspect of end of life decisions involves terms relating to neurological functioning. The Terri Schiavo case fostered a great deal of discussion around the diagnosis persistent vegetative state (PVS). PVS is a state of severe brain injury, characterized by wakefulness (i.e., the presence of sleep-wake cycles), but no awareness of oneself or the external environment. This is due to severe damage to the cerebral cortex, with preservation of the brainstem. Patients in PVS have their eyes open, and may make non-purposeful movements. The presence of “sustained visual pursuit” (the ability to track movement) or “visual fixation” (the ability to sustain gaze upon an object) should cast doubt on the diagnosis of PVS.8,9\nThe minimally conscious state (MCS) is a closely related diagnosis, but differs from PVS in that MCS applies to patients who are awake and show minimal signs of responsiveness. There is greater activity of the cerebral cortex in MCS patients, and this may be dependent on the “emotional relevance” of the external stimulus.10 Both PVS and MCS are clinical diagnoses; in other words, such determinations are made at the bedside from careful examinations repeated on several occasions.\nFinally, there is the state of brain death, or more accurately, death by neurological criteria. Brain death is not as controversial as PVS and MCS, and is well accepted by most physicians. According to this definition, death has occurred after massive neurological injury to both the cerebral cortex and the brain stem. Clinically, this means that no reflexes are present, there is no spontaneous breathing (the patient is ventilator dependent), and an electroencephalogram is isoelectric or “flat,” after two readings taken 24 hours apart.11 Under these circumstances, it may be ethically appropriate to discontinue life support or consider organ donation.\nA full discussion of the ethical issues raised here goes beyond the scope of this article. Hopefully, these definitions will serve as a starting point.\n1.

Urol Dipl ( Lond.).\nDeath can bring life is a unique concept new to mankind. The Egyptians were perhaps the first to believe in it and took elaborate measures to preserve the body by the complex process of embalming. In modern times, the field of preservation of tissues has constantly looked at newer methods of preserving tissues and organs after death. Preservation of cells is dependent on the complexity of their function. The more complex the function the lesser time the tissues can be preserved outside the body. Skin, bones, cartilage, arteries and veins are essentially structural tissues and have the ability to be preserved for many years whereas cells of organs like liver, heart, pancreas, lungs, kidneys, and intestine can only be preserved for few hrs to a few days. The concept of Brain Death is more recent and its acceptance as an entity has provided a boost to the whole organ donation and transplant programme in the world. In brain death patient it is possible to preserve the required hemodynamic stability to keep the critical organs alive by providing them with oxygen and nutrition. Organ donation in a brain death situation is a positive outcome of death which sometimes maybe unnecessary as it happens in road traffic accident. Over 50% of Brain Death involves young people with head injury due to a road traffic accident. The tragedy for the family members of the deceased at this unnecessary loss of life is immense. Organ donation is perhaps the only positive outcome of this grave tragedy provided the relatives agree to the process. However one must always remember that the condition was not invented for the benefit of organ donation and the wishes of the loved ones should always be respected and no pressure should be put on the relatives to donate. Ideally they should be aware of the concept in advance and should come themselves come forward for organ donation.HISTORY OF THE CONCEPT OF BRAIN DEATH\nIn 1959 two French physicians first recognized Brain Death on patients being ventilated in the intensive care units and called it coma depasse (a state beyond coma). In 1968, an Ad Hoc Committee of Harvard Medical School defined brain death as irreversible coma with the patient being totally unreceptive and unresponsive with absence of all cranial reflexes and no spontaneous respiratory efforts during a 3 minutes period of disconnection from the ventilator. A matter for debate has been how much of brain needs to be actually dead before death can be diagnosed. Experiments have conclusively shown that a few cubic centimeters of tissue called brainstem that is located beneath Aqueduct of Sylvius anteriorly and floor of fourth ventricle posteriorly is the vital section of the brain that determines consciousness and ability to breathe spontaneously. If this tissue is destroyed it will result in brain death. However in certain countries, the whole brain including the brainstem needs to die to diagnose this state of irreversible death. This can be a difficult to diagnose and sometimes requires four vessels (carotid and vertebral) angiography and Isotope studies of the cranium. In contrast the tests to diagnose brainstem death are more clinically oriented and over the last 35 years have stood the test of time. They are simple, clinical, fool proof and capable of confirmation of brain-stem death. In 1988 the Irish working committee on Brain Death in its memorandum said, if the brainstem is irreversibly lost, what goes on elsewhere in the brain is immaterial and Life cannot return.Patho-physiology\nBrain death is similar to physiological decapitation and can result from intra cerebral bleeding or increase in the pressure of the cranium due to a tumor. Increasing intracranial pressure results in coning of the brainstem and ischemia leading to brainstem death. In this situation the heart can continue to beat if the patient is kept adequately ventilated and hemodynamically stable. However this situation cannot be maintained indefinitely and in majority of the situations the patient has hemodynamic instability, electrolyte imbalance and cardiac arrest due to loss of the central receptors.LEGAL ISSUES\nIn the last three decades the concept of brain death has evolved and has had judicial approval in many parts of the world.\nIn 1994, India accepted the concept of brainstem death and passed an act to this effect and called it the Transplantation of Human Organ Act (THO). The act also proposed to stop commercial dealing of organs by making regulatory authorities in each state to look into the whole process of organ donation for both live related (or unrelated) and cadaver organ donation and transplantation.\nAs health and education are state subjects this act had to be accepted by various states and passed in their assemblies. So far the act has been passed in most of the Indian states; however there are still a few states that have to accept the act. Brain Death Certification\nAs per the Transplantation of Human Organ Act two clinicians who are experts in the field (like neurologists or neuro-surgeons) are required for brain death certification. Ethically these clinicians must not have interest in or benefit in any way from transplantation of cadaver donor organs. They are expected to do two sets of tests six hours apart to certify brain death. One of these two clinicians should be a nominated member from the panel of doctors listed by the State Government for this purpose. The legal time of death in these circumstances is taken as the second set of brainstem death tests. The certification should be done on laid out forms as per the act. In a medico-legal case a forensic expert is also required for the certification. The medical director or medical superintendent of the hospital should finally countercheck and sign the form. It is only after this has been done should ventilatory support be discontinued or retrieved.CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF BRAIN STEM DEATH\nThe aim is to establish that the patient has absent brainstem reflexes and is apnoeic. The testing itself is straightforward. There are certain preconditions that should have been fulfilled to make sure that the tests are performed on the right patients and at the right time. These are as follows:\n- Patient should be comatose and on ventilatory support.\n- The cause of irreversible structural brain damage should be known\n- Functional reversible causes of a non-functioning brainstem should have been ruled out. These causes include.\nPatient should have no circulating therapeutic levels of any drugs that could cause comaEstablishing loss of 'Brainstem reflexes' at the bedside\n- Primary Hypothermiab\n- Alcohol intoxication\n- Neuromuscular blockades (like use of muscle relaxants)\n- Use of central nervous system depressant drugs like use of sedatives\n- Severe metabolic or endocrinal disturbances\nAbsence of brain stem function is essential for establishing the diagnosis of Brain Death (Figure 2). In a brainstem dead patient cranial nerve reflexes are tested to observe motor response to a sensory input. The absence of brain stem function is documented by conducting the following tests:\na. Absence of Pupillary reflex response to light\nb. Absence of Corneal reflexes\nc. Absence of vestibulo-ocular reflex\nd. Absence of cranial nerve response to pain\ne. Absence of gag and cough reflexes\nTo check for absent pupillary response to light, a bright pen torchlight should be used in a darkened room. It should be made sure that no eye drops to dilate the pupils have been used in the four hours previously. The pupils may not be necessarily fixed and dilated in the brainstem dead patients; however there should be no pupillary response to light.\nTo test the corneal reflex moist cotton tipped swab should be used and firm pressure should be applied to the cornea without damaging it. The vestibulo-ocular reflex testing involves instilling 20 ml of ice-cold water into the external auditory canal and looking at eyeball movements of either eye for about a minute. No eyeball movement indicates absence of reflex. Presence of ruptured eardrums or discharge from the ear prevents this test from being performed.\nTesting of gag and cough reflex requires temporary disconnection from the ventilator. A cotton tipped swab can be used to stimulate the posterior pharynx to look for a response. Experienced ICU staff usually notice a progressive loss of response during the evolution of brainstem death when performing the routine suction of airways and oropharynx.\nThe plantar response may continue to be present in brain death patients along with spinal reflexes and should not be tested. The decorticate and decerebrate posturing is absent, however on occasions it may be difficult to differentiate from complex spinal reflexes.Apnoea Test\nThe aim of apnoea test is to establish death of the respiratory centre in the brainstem. It demonstrates that the spontaneous respiratory response fails to occur even in the absence of stimulatory drive from CO2. For this test the patient is disconnected from the ventilator for 10 minutes. However, to avoid hypoxia to vital organs, 100% oxygen is given for 5 minutes before disconnection of the ventilator. Even during the test period, 100% oxygen is given through a tracheal catheter. In the patient who is brain dead the carbon dioxide tension increase at a rate of 2mm/min (0.3kPa/min) during apnoea testing. If the initial CO2 tension before testing is about 40mmHg (5.3 kPa), then arterial CO2 tension after 10 minutes is likely to be 60mmHg (8 kPa). However a rise to 50mmHg in CO2 tension is acceptable and should provide sufficient stimulatory drive for spontaneous respiration in an intact respiratory centre. In patients with chronic airway disease or severe chest trauma, the apnoea test may be difficult to perform.Role of Cerebral Angiography & EEG for brain death testing\nFour-vessel angiography is used to show absence of the flow of cerebral blood flow and confirm death of whole brain. However this is cumbersome investigation in an unstable patient and is not done routinely. Nor is it necessary to use EEG to diagnose the condition. If there is any doubt in the diagnosis of brain death, one should not proceed for a request for organ donation and ventilatory support should be continued. In a case of severe facial trauma or presence of paralyses or severe chest trauma routine tests may not be possible and one may require doing special tests like isotope scanning or colour flow duplex scanning of the cranium to confirm brain death. All these tests can have limitations and can sometimes be inconclusive. In these inconclusive situations, if organ donation is being contemplated, the patient’s relatives should be told about it and the ventilator should only be disconnected in the operation theatre and organ retrieval started only after cardiac standstill. The Transplantation of Human Organ Act does not require investigations like cerebral angiography or EEG brain death certification.\nIn children there remains uncertainty about the reliability of clinical brainstem testing. In neonates, especially organs for transplantation should not be removed in the first seven days of life with beating hearts. Radioisotope brain scanning has been recommended under the age of one year when brainstem death certification is required."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8b04d72c-259d-493c-8cf5-b6e008b01ec8>","<urn:uuid:771b49e1-9b8c-4610-ba18-b59868c9d2d6>"],"error":null}

Here is a quote [source used]:\nI will not forget to insert into these rules, a new theoretical invention for knowledge’s sake, which, although it seems of little import and good for a laugh, is nonetheless, of great utility in bringing out the creativity in some of these inventions. This is the case if you cast your glance on any walls dirty with such stains or walls made up of rock formations of different types. If you have to invent some scenes, you will be able to discover them there in diverse forms, in diverse landscapes, adorned with mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, extensive plains, valleys, and hills. You can even see different battle scenes and movements made up of unusual figures, faces with strange expressions, and myriad things which you can transform into a complete and proper form constituting part of similar walls and rocks. These are like the sound of bells, in whose tolling, you hear names and words that your imagination conjures up.\nI propose to you five graphical formalisms, or visual languages, towards the goal of “computing with space”.\nThey all come from a “stain on the wall”, reproduced here (is the beginning of the article What is a space? Computations in emergent algebras and the front end visual system, arXiv:1009.5028), with some links to more detailed explanations and related material which I invite you to follow.\nOr better, to threat them as a stain on the wall. To share, to dream about, to create, to discuss.\nIn mathematics “spaces” come in many flavours. There are vector spaces, affine spaces, symmetric spaces, groups and so on. We usually take such objects as the stage where the plot of reasoning is laid. But in fact what we use, in many instances,are properties of particular spaces which, I claim, can be seen as coming from a particular class of computations.\nThere is though a “space” which is “given” almost beyond doubt, namely the physical space where we all live. But as it regards perception of this space, we know now that things are not so simple. As I am writing these notes, here in Baixo Gavea, my eyes are attracted by the wonderful complexity of a tree near my window. The nature of the tree is foreign to me, as are the other smaller beings growing on or around the tree.

Colors are seen as warm or cool mainly because of long-held (and often universal) associations. Yellow, orange and red are associated with the heat of sun and fire; blue, green and violet with the coolness of leaves, sea and the sky. Warm colors seem closer to the viewer than cool colors, but vivid cool colors can overwhelm light and subtle warm colors. Using warm colors for foreground and cool colors for background enhances the perception of depth.\nAlthough red, yellow and orange are in general considered high-arousal colors and blue, green and most violets are low-arousal hues, the brilliance, darkness and lightness of a color can alter the psychological message. While a light blue-green appears to be tranquil, wet and cool, a brilliant turquoise, often associated with a lush tropical ocean setting, will be more exciting to the eye. The psychological association of a color is often more meaningful than the visual experience.\nColors act upon the body as well as the mind. Red has been shown to stimulate the senses and raise the blood pressure, while blue has the opposite effect and calms the mind.\nPeople will actually gamble more and make riskier bets when seated under a red light as opposed to a blue light. That's why Las Vegas is the city of red neon.\nFor most people, one of the first decisions of the day concerns color harmony. What am I going to wear? This question is answered not only by choosing a style and fabric appropriate to the season, but by making the right color choices. And it goes on from there. Whether you're designing a new kitchen, wrapping a present or creating a bar chart, the colors you choose greatly affect your final results.\nHow often have you caught your breath at the sight of a flowerbed in full bloom? Most likely the gardener has arranged the flowers according to their color for extra vibrancy. Have you ever seen a movie in which a coordinated color scheme helps the film create a world unto itself? With a little knowledge of good color relationships, you can make colors work better for you in your business graphics and other applications.\nColor is light and light is energy. Scientists have found that actual physiological changes take place in human beings when they are exposed to certain colors. Colors can stimulate, excite, depress, tranquilize, increase appetite and create a feeling of warmth or coolness. This is known as chromodynamics.\nAn executive for a paint company received complaints from workers in a blue office that the office was too cold. When the offices were painted a warm peach, the sweaters came off even though the temperature had not changed.\nThe illusions discussed below will show you that sometimes combinations of colors can deceive the viewer, sometimes in ways that work to your advantage. They can also cause unfortunate effects in your graphics, so be sure to watch out for these little traps.\nSometimes colors affect each other in unexpected ways. For example, most colors, when placed next to their complements, produce vibrating, electric effects. Other colors, in the right combinations, seem quite different from what you'd expect.\nThe most striking color illusions are those where identical colors, when surrounded by different backgrounds, appear to be different from each other. In a related effect, different colors can appear to be the same color when surrounded by certain backgrounds.\nWhen you look at a colored object, your brain determines its color in the context of the surrounding colors.\nIn this picture, the two bows are the same color, but because the surrounding areas are strikingly different in contrast, it seems to our eyes that they are different. Keep this effect in mind when creating graphics where color matching is critical. If you attempt to match your corporation's official colors, you may find that even if you achieve an exact match, it may look wrong in context.\nIn the same way that one color can appear different in different surroundings, two similar colors may appear to be identical under some conditions. Even though the two symbols are actually slightly different tones, the contrasting backgrounds cause our brains to think that they are the same color. This effect is harder to control, but be aware of it because it can affect your graphics in hidden ways.\nThe feeling you get when looking at bright complementary colors next to each other is a vibrating or pulsing effect. It seems that the colors are pulling away from each other. It's caused by an effect called color fatiguing. When one color strikes a portion of the retina long enough, the optic nerve begins sending confused signals to the brain. This confusion is intensified by the complementaries.\nMixing brilliant complementary colors gets attention, but it should be used with restraint. The effect is disconcerting and can make your eyes feel like they've been shaken around.\nIf you want to use complementary colors without causing discomfort, you can outline each of the colors with a thin neutral white, gray or black line. The outlines separate the two colors, which helps your brain keep them separated.\nWhen two very similar colors touch in an image, both colors appear to wash out and become indistinct. This is because the borders between the colors are difficult to distinguish and your brain blurs the colors together.\nIf you outline each of the colors with a thin neutral white, gray or black line, the colors become easier to distinguish. This is called the stained glass technique and is a way to reduce this blurring of the colors.\nprevious | next"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d1e06b23-501e-44e5-9bc6-01448197aa6b>","<urn:uuid:6db417b7-3f91-47db-8777-cf1a0cdfe8b4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you explain how Type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis affects males over 50, and what are the risks of long-term prednisone use in treating it?","answer":"Type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis typically affects males over age 50, presenting with symptoms like painless jaundice, abdominal pain, weight loss, diabetes, and in rare cases severe abdominal pain and acute pancreatitis. Patients may also experience extra-pancreatic manifestations such as renal insufficiency and pulmonary infiltrates. Regarding prednisone treatment risks, long-term use can lead to several complications. The medication may increase the risk of developing osteoporosis, and due to its immunosuppressive effects, it can increase susceptibility to infections. Additionally, regular blood sugar monitoring is necessary during treatment, as prednisone can affect blood glucose levels.","context":["Type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis\nAutoimmune pancreatitis is a rare fibroinflammatory disease that accounts for 5-6% of all cases of chronic pancreatitis1. Due to its non-specific clinical presentation, laboratory characteristics, and radiological findings autoimmune pancreatitis can be a challenging diagnosis for clinicians especially since one of the main differential diagnoses is pancreatic adenocarcinoma1. Autoimmune pancreatitis is highly responsive to steroid treatment, making an accurate diagnosis essential.\nCurrently there are two subtypes of autoimmune pancreatitis. Type 1 is associated with elevated serum IgG4 levels and tissue invasion by plasma cells positive for IgG4. Histologically type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis is characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, storiform fibrosis, obliterative phlebitis, and elevated IgG4-positive plasma cells within the tissue. Type 2 autoimmune pancreatitis is not associated with IgG4 and is histologically characterized by neutrophilic infiltration into the pancreatic duct epithelium. Type 2 disease is also associated with inflammatory bowel disease, while type 1 is not. Type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis is more prevalent than type 210. The focus of this case report will be type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis.\nThe first presumed case of what is now called type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis was reported in 1961 by Sarles and colleagues when they described a case of pancreatitis associated with hypergammaglobulinemia and suggested autoimmunity as a potential mechanism3. In 1995, Yoshida and colleagues used the term autoimmune pancreatitis to describe patients with characteristic laboratory, clinical, and histological findings1,5. Before this, type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis had several names based on its clinical and morphological appearance. These names include lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis, chronic sclerosing pancreatitis, and non-alcoholic duct destructive chronic pancreatitis1.\nThe pathophysiological mechanism for type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis is currently unknown. It is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogrens disease. Patients with type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis often have an increased number of activated CD4-, CD8+ T-cells with increased HLA-DR in the peripheral blood and pancreas5.\nType 1 autoimmune pancreatitis usually affects males over the age of 501, but the clinical presentation can vary. The most common symptoms are painless jaundice and abdominal pain. Additional symptoms can include weight loss, diabetes, and in rare cases severe abdominal pain and acute pancreatitis. Because this disease can be systemic, patients may also present with extra-pancreatic manifestations, such as renal insufficiency, and pulmonary infiltrates1.\nThe diagnosis of type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis spans across several medical disciplines. Classic radiological findings include diffuse pancreatic (\"sausage-shaped\") enlargement with homogenous attenuation and peripheral enhancement of the pancreas along with diffuse narrowing of the pancreatic duct. Focal involvement most often involves the head of the pancreas, which often mimics pancreatic adenocarcinoma1. A CT can often reveal lymphadenopathy of the cervical, abdominal, or hilar lymph nodes5.\nType 1 autoimmune pancreatitis is associated with other autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren disease, making laboratory testing and monitoring imperative in suspected patients. Individuals may have elevated titers of immunogammaglobulins, antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and/or anticarbonic anhydrase antibodies2. One of the most studied and possibly controversial lab values affiliated with type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis is serum IgG4 levels. Hamano and colleagues found that serum IgG4 concentrations of 135 mg/dL had a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 97% when diagnosing type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis versus pancreatic cancer7. However, Ghazale et al found the sensitivity of serum IgG4 levels to be only around 77%. In the same study, patients with serum IgG4 levels greater than 280 mg/dL (twice the normal value) had a greater than 95% likelihood of having type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis. Their study also illustrated that serum IgG4 levels had a high negative predictive value2. The diagnostic utility of serum IgG4 levels is also controversial because an elevated serum IgG4 levels is non-specific and can be found in a number of other illnesses including atopic dermatitis, asthma, parasitic diseases, pemphigus, and pancreatic carcinoma3.\nOn gross examination the pancreas can be firm and indurated1, often with a thick capsule5. A focal mass may be present1, but often without calculi, pseudocysts or necrosis, which are common in alcoholic-associated chronic pancreatitis4. Microscopically, the hallmark finding of type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis is a periductal infiltrate composed of plasma cells and lymphocytes1. This infiltrate is closely associated with fibrosis of pancreatic parenchyma1. The lymphocytic component of the inflammation is mainly composed of CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes and few B cells3. The acini are often atrophic3, and the interlobular septa are often thickened by the lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and a proliferation of myofibroblasts1. Perineural inflammation has been reported5. Other characteristic findings include the presence of obliterative venulitis that spares the arterioles2.\nSeveral groups have developed criteria for the diagnosis of type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis. These criteria can be found in Table 1. Kamisawa et al was the first group to devise diagnostic criteria in 20025. These criteria were later revised into the one proposed by Okazaki et al in 20068. This group of criteria focuses on the imaging characteristics as well as the histopathological and serological findings. The HISORt criteria was developed by Chari et al at the Mayo Clinic and encompasses histologic, imaging, serologic, extrapancreatic involvement, and steroid therapy response characteristics to the diagnosis of type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis6. The criteria developed by Kim et al is similar to the HISORt criteria except it does not take into account the extrapancreatic manifestations of the disease, and imaging characteristics of the pancreas is necessary for diagnosis. Across criteria, the microscopic and imaging requirements are very similar.\nThe most important differential diagnosis for type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis is pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Erroneous diagnoses of pancreatic adenocarcinoma account for 2.5% of all pancreaticoduodenectomies performed on autoimmune pancreatitis patients5. Pancreatic carcinoma shares many qualities with type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis which include an elderly preponderance, new onset diabetes mellitus, painless jaundice, focal swelling of the pancreas, strictures in the pancreatic and biliary ducts, and elevated tumor markers5. Alcohol-associated chronic pancreatitis can also be included in the differential, but can be differentiated from autoimmune pancreatitis based on characteristics previously described.\nThe foundation treatment for type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis is corticosteroids. Steroid regimens usually begin with a week of prednisone 40 mg daily followed by tapering of the dose by 5 mg per week. Prior to and during treatment, a patient should undergo imaging and lab testing in order to monitor response1. Steroid response consists of the pancreas returning to normal size and a normalizing of pancreatic function5. Patients with discrete masses undergoing corticosteroid therapy should have complete resolution of the mass as determined by imaging. Carcinoma of the pancreas can have some response to steroids, but complete resolution of the mass will not occur. Patients who fail to respond to steroids should have a surgical biopsy1.\nType 1 autoimmune pancreatitis is a challenging diagnosis for clinicians and pathologists alike and an accurate diagnosis is crucial to avoiding unnecessary and often life-changing surgical procedures. The wide variety of presentations, the lack of a highly sensitive and specific test, and the inaccessibility of the pancreas add to the difficulty of achieving an accurate diagnosis. Using multiple modalities across medical disciplines to screen patients suspicious for type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis can increase the likelihood of reaching an accurate diagnosis, which will provide the best possible outcome for the patient.\nContributed by Russell Silowash, DO and Aatur Singhi, MD, PhD","Prednisone is part of a class of drugs called immunosuppressants. It suppresses the body's immune response and reduces inflammation in your lungs.

Before taking prednisone: Prednisone may increase the risk that you will develop osteoporosis. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking prednisone and about things that you can do to decrease the chance that you will develop osteoporosis. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while you are taking this medication. Your doctor will order regular lab tests to check your response to prednisone and monitor for toxicity. You will need to have your blood sugar checked regularly. fluconazole treats Prednisone is used alone or with other medications to treat the symptoms of low corticosteroid levels (lack of certain substances that are usually produced by the body and are needed for normal body functioning). Prednisone is also used to treat other conditions in patients with normal corticosteroid levels. These conditions include certain types of arthritis; severe allergic reactions; multiple sclerosis (a disease in which the nerves do not function properly); lupus (a disease in which the body attacks many of its own organs); and certain conditions that affect the lungs, skin, eyes, kidneys blood, thyroid, stomach, and intestines. Prednisone is also sometimes used to treat the symptoms of certain types of cancer. Prednisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works to treat patients with low levels of corticosteroids by replacing steroids that are normally produced naturally by the body. It works to treat other conditions by reducing swelling and redness and by changing the way the immune system works.

Corticosteroid drugs — including cortisone, hydrocortisone and prednisone — are useful in treating many conditions, such as rashes, lupus and asthma. But these drugs also carry a risk of serious side effects. Working with your doctor, you can take steps to reduce these side effects so that the benefits of corticosteroid treatment outweigh the risks. Corticosteroids mimic the effects of hormones your body produces naturally in your adrenal glands, which are small glands that sit on top of your kidneys. When prescribed in doses that exceed your body's usual levels, corticosteroids suppress inflammation. This can reduce the signs and symptoms of inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis and asthma. Corticosteroid drugs are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, asthma, allergies and many other conditions. Prednisone is a potent corticosteroid drug used to treat inflammatory forms of arthritis as well as some types of cancer and autoimmune disease. It's available in tablet and liquid formulations and functions as an immunosuppressant, tempering inflammation by blunting the immune response. Inflammation is the body's natural response to anything it considers harmful. When the immune system identifies a harmful agent, it releases chemicals into the bloodstream which cause tissues to swell, in part to increase the size of blood vessels and allow larger immune cells closer access to the site of an injury or infection. With certain autoimmune disorders, the immune response is abnormal and excessive. Such is the case with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy joints. Acute RA symptoms often flares without notice, causing increased pain, swelling, and injury to the affected joint.

{"question":"Which heating system is more efficient in terms of maintenance requirements and longevity: ground source heat pumps or oil-fired boilers?","answer":"Ground source heat pumps are more efficient in terms of maintenance and longevity. They require very low routine maintenance and can be expected to last over 20 years, which is longer than a combustion boiler. The ground heat exchanger itself should have a life of over 100 years. In contrast, oil-fired boilers are higher maintenance appliances requiring regular attention to the blower and oil filter, and need regular servicing to maintain efficiency and check safety.","context":["Ground Source Heat Pump - Domestic\nHow efficient is a ground source heat pump system?\nModern systems can be very efficient. For each kilowatt of electricity used to run the heat pump, three to four kilowatts of heat can be delivered to the building. The efficiency of a GSHP installation is very dependent on the quality of the design and installation. The efficiency of the installation is improved by utilising solar recharge of the ground.\nAre ground source heat pumps new?\nGSHP systems are common, particularly in the USA, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland and Germany. The principles of ground source heat pumps were first described by Lord Kelvin in the 1850s and continuous development since they were first used commercially more than 50 years ago has greatly improved their efficiency and reliability. They now provide a proven, cost-effective, safe and environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels.\nHow large are ground source heat pumps?\nA heat pump for a house is about the size of a large fridge. More powerful heat pumps for commercial buildings do not increase in size or price as much as they do in power output.\nCan a GSHP supply hot water?\nYes. Some domestic systems are able to heat domestic hot water via a modern high efficiency indirect water cylinder.\nCan GSHPs provide cooling?\nYes. Reverse-cycle heat pumps can deliver both heating and cooling very effectively. Cooling provided by heat exchange with cold ground is inherently more efficient than air conditioning which typically exchanges heat with hot air.\nCan a standard domestic electricity supply be used?\nYes. Heat pumps are designed to run on a standard UK single phase supply. However, a three-phase supply is a preferable option, and will be essential for larger installations.\nWould a ground source heat pump system be suitable for a well-insulated house?\nYes. Almost all new houses in the UK are designed to meet Building Regulations and should be able to benefit from a ground source heat pump. Building Regulations have been designed to conserve fuel, reduce heat losses and ensure greater energy efficiency, in order to ensure that all modern properties need less heating. For a well-insulated building the size of heat pump will be smaller, will need smaller ground loops and will therefore be less expensive. You should take advice from an installer with experience.\nMy architect suggests I install underfloor heating. Is this a good idea?\nYes. Ground source heat pump systems are ideally matched to modern warm temperature underfloor heating because a heat pump transfers heat at a higher coefficient of performance if it delivers to a large warm water circuit (like underfloor heating) rather than a small high temperature circuit (like wall mounted radiators).\nI have an older property. Can a ground source heat pump be installed?\nYes, but the cost of a system is directly related to the heat losses, which will generally be higher in older buildings. Money spent on upgrading insulation levels can save a considerable amount on the capital cost of a ground source heat pump system.\nCan radiators be used instead of underfloor heating?\nYes, but you will need larger radiators, sized for the typical 45°C to 50°C water temperatures obtained from efficient GSHP systems. If your house is well insulated they may be suitable. Your installer will need to check how big they would have to be and the space they would take up. Modern die cast aluminium radiators are very efficient and smaller than conventional radiators. Upstairs is usually less of a problem as bedrooms are normally kept at lower temperatures.\nCan the heat pump be installed outside or in a car-port, garage or basement?\nYes. There normally means the pump will be nearer to the pipe connections to your ground loops, which often makes the whole system easier to connect.\nWill long trenches have to be dug on my land for the ground loops?\nMy land is too rocky to dig trenches – can I still fit a heat pump system?\nI don't have enough land to dig long trenches – what do I do?\nVertical boreholes can be used for heat exchange with the ground instead of trenches.\nHow big are the trenches?\nA typical heating-only installation for a medium sized, new build detached house would need two narrow trenches, each 300 mm wide and 40 to 50 metres long and 2 metres deep. The trenches can be straight or curved and laid in any direction to suit your site, providing they are five metres apart. A standard excavator can dig the trenches and backfill them after the ground loops have been installed. Your installer would be able to do this work and plan it to ensure the minimum of disruption to your site. Once the ground loops are installed, pressure tested and buried, your renewable energy collection system should need no further attention. However, its location needs to be recorded to avoid it being accidentally disturbed!\nCan trenches be installed on a downward sloping site?\nYes, provided the trenches can be dug, a moderate downward slope is not a problem. Consideration needs to be given to purging air from a system with ground loops higher than the heat pump.\nI have a large plot of land but the ground is quite hard. Can a shallower trench be dug?\nYes, the ground loop coils can be laid so that the coils lie horizontally in the trench rather than vertically. This would need a wider but shallower trench depth to at least 1.2 metres. However, this is not as satisfactory as a deep trench in which the coils are vertical and you will need a special slinky configuration and probably longer trenches. Your installer will be able to advise you accordingly.\nI have some very wet land. Can I use this?\nYes, wet land is better at conducting heat so, as long as a trench can be dug, it is ideal.\nI have a large pond. I have a stream. Could this be used?\nYes, it is possible to use very large ponds and fast flowing streams as a heat energy source using an open loop system.\nAre GSHP systems environmentally friendly?\nYes. In the UK, there is now a strong move towards alternative technologies that are sustainable and environmentally much more acceptable. 40% of CO2 emissions are derived from the heating of buildings. By using renewable sources of energy to heat your property you can help to reduce these carbon emissions, particularly when compared to burning fossil fuels such as oil. Most electricity suppliers are now offering 'clean green' electricity from a renewable energy source and, if you use this to power your heat pump, your property will be totally heated from renewable energy with zero carbon emissions.\nAre Ground Source Heat Pumps dangerous?\nThere are no hazardous gas emissions, no flammable oil, LPG or gas pipes, no flue or chimney and no unsightly fuel tanks. GSHP systems have absolutely NO site emissions. There is, therefore, no need for safety checks.\nAre Ground Source Heat Pumps noisy?\nNo, a ground source heat pump makes less noise than a gas boiler, and very much less than an air source heat pump which drives a fan to extract heat from ambient air.\nWhat about servicing and maintenance?\nAs with any valuable plant a ground source system should be covered by an annual maintenance agreement with the supplier. However, routine maintenace requirements are very low. A ground source heat pump can be expected to last over 20 years – longer than a combustion boiler – and the ground heat exchanger should have a life of over 100 years.\nGround source systems are automated. Because they come with low maintenance, low running costs, low noise and are out of sight, they are often referred to as \"invisible heating systems\".\nHow do running costs compare with conventional alternatives?\nIn a modern, well insulated house, a ground source heat pump can offer very high efficiency and low running costs. An oil-fired boilers cost considerably more to run, and electric heating is at least three times as expensive. Modern condensing gas boilers are more expensive to run at current gas prices, and gas prices are set to rise. Also, all fossil fuel boilers need regular servicing to maintain efficiency and check safety.\nWhat are the costs?\nThe initial purchase costs of a ground source heat pump system are more than a conventional oil or gas fired boiler. The initial capital expense is offset by lower running costs, lower maintenance and low servicing requirement. There is also the security of knowledge that the majority of your heating and cooling energy comes out of your ground, is under your control and will not increase in price.\nBe careful to avoid judging an installation on price alone. It is more important to ensure you have a well designed system if your aim is to save money over the life of the installation.\nIs Planning Permission required to install a GSHP?\nNo, a ground source heat pump installation is invisible, makes less noise than a gas boiler and issues no gases of any kind on-site: there is nothing for anyone to object to.\nAre grants available to reduce costs further?\nYes, the government introduced Renewable Heat Incentive for ground source heat pumps installed in domestic buildings at 18.8 p/kWhr on 9 April 2014. Heat pumps installed before April 2014 also qualify for RHI (if commissioned after 15 July 2009).","Oil Boiler Repair and Installation Reliability and Efficiency When You Need It.

This provides all that is necessary to efficiently ignite the oil vapor. Hot gases from the burning oil pass through metal tubes or sections in the boiler, heating them in the process.\nHot water oil boilers are a great way to heat your home. Shop our full line of hot water oil boilers from the top manufacturers, or give us a call and let one of our experts help you find the perfect one for your needs.\nOil-fired boilers work in a very similar way to gas-powered boilers but they use oil to heat your water instead of gas, making them ideal for properties off the mains gas grid. The water that is heated by the oil is sent to the taps and radiators around your home when needed.\nThe COWB3 offers an efficiency of up to 85.2% AFUE, meaning it can deliver significant energy savings, compared to an older boiler. That means you don’t have to worry about high heating bills, no matter how cold the winter gets.\nOil boilers are one of the most efficient for residential heating. The boiler basically consists of a burner and fuel tank. Once the burner has heated to the desired level, it transfers the heat into the boiler to heat the water. This produces steam which is then distributed throughout the house via\nA boiler typically uses a fuel such as natural gas, propane, or fuel oil in a vented combustion chamber, much like a furnace. Whereas a furnace directly transfers heat from combustion to supply air in the air distribution unit, a boiler heats a secondary transfer fluid (typically water, but sometimes steam) that is, in turn, pumped through a radiation/convection system located throughout a building or home.\nWe have boiler accessories on LennoxPros.com.

With efficiency ratings of up to 95% AFUE, Lennox boilers can help you save hundreds of dollars each year in utility bills, compared to older and standard- efficiency boilers.\nCombi Boilers: As we noted, combination boilers heat space and water in separate pipe systems to deliver 2-for-1 performance. Combi boilers range in size to about 150 MBH. Oil Boilers: Oil boilers are only used in the Northeast US and Eastern Canada due to a lack of natural gas and propane in those regions. Most are non-condensing boilers.\nThe Cooperative Extension Service at Michigan State University explains residential oil-fired heating systems [ 1 ]. The average AFUE rating for oil furnaces is 83%. Oil furnaces are relatively durable and reliable; they typically come with a 10-year warranty, and many homeowners report 15-20 or more years of service.\nAn oil-fired boiler allows keeping fuel stored near your place and topping up the unit when it is needed. Such boilers are perfect for smaller houses and flats, so if you have a big house, you should better seek for other alternatives that will suit all your living arrangements and hot water needs.\nEfficiency within a model group will tend to vary by the size (capacity) of the unit. Some products, like furnaces, may also be affected by installation orientation (horizontal, upflow, or downflow) or even by the nozzle used in installation, as is the case with boilers and oil furnaces.\nNon-condensing Boilers Ultra-reliable conventional boilers from Bosch.

{"question":"¿Cuáles son las principales diferencias en la dieta entre European otters vs African Clawless otters?","answer":"European otters are primarily piscivorous, feeding mainly on fish, though they also eat frogs and water birds. In contrast, African Clawless otters primarily feed on crabs, which they crush with their large, strong cheek teeth, and also eat mollusks, fish, reptiles, frogs, birds and small mammals.","context":["This species is perhaps more aptly named the Eurasian otter because it is found as far east as Manchuria. It is also found as far north as the tundra line of Siberia and Scandinavia and as far south as the coastal plain of North Africa.\nEuropean otters spend most of their waking hours in water, though they build their nests on land. The nests are often made up of a network of tunnels dug into the river bank or running through roots and thick shrubs. Each otter defends a short stretch of river bank, marking its territory with secretions from a scent gland under the base of the tail.\nWithin the territory an otter has a designated area for entering the water, basking in the sun and playing. Otters are very playful. They are often seen rolling in grass and sliding down muddy slopes into the water.\nThe European otter has a brown coat, which is paler in Asian populations. The feet are generously webbed to aid with swimming. Each foot is also equipped with large claws.\nOtters can dive for up to two minutes at a time. Once in the water they use sensitive whiskers to detect the currents produced by the movements of their prey. Air bubbles trapped in the fur keep the skin dry.\nIn spite of its wide distribution the otter population has declined, particularly in Europe, although there are now signs that it is increasing again.\nThe otter population has suffered from pollution of its waterways, which has resulted in a loss of fish and therefore food. Toxins have also passed up the food chain, adversely affecting their health. However, environmental improvements coupled with release schemes have seen otters successfully reestablished in some areas. Territorial by nature, they mark their territory with their droppings, called spraints.\nDistribution: Occurs across Europe up into Scandinavia, and in a broad band through the more temperate latitudes of Asia. Also present in northwestern North Africa.\nHabitat: Rivers and lakes.\nWeight: 7 - 10 kg (15 - 22 lb); males are heavier.\nLength: 92 - 165 cm (36 - 65 in); up to 30 cm (12 in) tall.\nMaturity: 2 years.\nGestation Period: 63 days; embryonic development does not begin straight after fertilization.\nBreeding: 2 - 3; weaning occurs at around 70 days.\nFood: Primarily piscivorous, feeding on a variety of fish, although will also eat frogs and water birds.\nLifespan: 5 - 10 years in the wild; up to 20 in captivity.\nThe water-resistant coat is generally dark brown over the back and paler on the underparts.\nThe whiskers help the otter find its way and locate prey underwater.\nWebbed paws help otters to swim more effectively, and end in sharp claws.\nA relatively long and powerful tail helps the otter to swim well.\nOUT OF SIGHT\nCover is very important for otters, so they can emerge undetected from the water, although they rarely stray far on land.\nAfrican Clawless Otter\nThis species is slightly larger than its close African relative, the Congo clawless otter. It lives in eastern and southern Africa. Like its relative, the African clawless otter has feet with less webbing than most otters and only rounded claws on the hind feet.\nThe African clawless otter swims and dives as well as other otters, although its feet have only small connecting webs. As its name suggests, this otter has no claws other than tiny nails on the third and fourth toes of the hind feet. It has less dense fur than most otters so has not been hunted as extensively.\nCrabs are the most important item of the clawless otter's diet, and it is equipped with large, strong cheek teeth for crushing the hard shells, it also feeds on mollusks, fish, reptiles, frogs, birds and small mammals. Like most otters, it comes ashore to eat and feeds from its hands. Clawless otters seem to be particularly skilful with their hands. They locate this prey by touch, using their dexterous, clawless hands.\nClawless otters do not dig burrows, but live in crevices or under rocks in family groups, in pairs or alone. The litter of 2 to 5 young stays with the parents for at least a year.\nRange: Africa: Senegal, Ethiopia, South Africa.\nHabitat: Slow streams and pools; coastal waters, estuaries.\nSize: Body: 37 - 39 in (95 - 100 cm); Tail: 21 1/2 in (55 cm).\nCongo Clawless Otter\nCongo clawless otters live in the waterways of the mighty Congo Basin, the largest river system in Africa. The otters avoid the main watercourses and are more often found in streams, swamps and ponds in the deep tropical rainforest.\nThese bodies of water have little or no current and are consequently heavily clouded with sediment. Lacking claws, these nocturnal otters are much better able to feel for slippery prey in this muddy water and overturn stones in search of food than their clawed cousins.\nClawless otters also have shorter whiskers than other species. This suggests that they are not as reliant on whiskers for detecting prey underwater as other otters. This species of otter catches fish and frogs and collects prey, such as shellfish, from the muddy bottom of the river.\nUnusually for otters, this species has no claws or webbing on its forefeet. There is a small amount of webbing on the hind feet and a simple peg-like claw on the three middle toes. Clawless feet help the otters to feel objects under muddy water as they search for prey.\nThe otter's teeth are also more suited to a wide range of food than other otters, which all have teeth adapted for gripping slithering fish. This feature, along with the short whiskers, suggests that Congo clawless otters spend a lot more time foraging on land than other species. Little is known about the breeding habits of this allusive species, but they are probably broadly similar to other species.\nDistribution: Congo River Basin.\nHabitat: Swamps and ponds in tropical rainforests.\nFood: Fish, frogs and shellfish.\nSize: 78 - 98 cm (30.75 - 38.5 in); 15 - 25 kg (33 - 55 lb).\nMaturity: 1 year.\nBreeding: Litters of 2 - 3 young.\nLife span: 15 years.\nThese otters live in the Great Lakes region of East Africa. They do not swim in cloudy water and are often found foraging beside clear mountain streams. As its name suggests, this species has white spots on its neck and throat against a background of brown fur. They have strongly webbed feet and large claws, which suggests they catch most of their food while swimming in open water. Fish makes up most of their diet, but they also eat frogs, freshwater crabs and insect larvae.\nSize: 85 - 105 cm (2.8 - 3.4 ft); 4 kg (8.75 lb).\nThis otter is one of the smallest otters in the world and, as its name suggests, has very small claws. These claws are in fact tiny blunt spikes that barely protrude beyond the tips of its paws. Unusually, the feet are webbed only to the last knuckles - not to the ends of the toes, as in other otters. These adaptations mean that it has considerable manual dexterity and sensitivity of touch compared to other otters.\nShort-clawed otters tend to catch food using their nimble paws rather than their teeth. They favour mostly crabs and molluscs, and have developed large, broad teeth for cracking the shells. Other food includes frogs and small aquatic mammals. They rarely eat fish, and so there is little competition for food.\nThe short-clawed otter's finger-like front toes make this the most dextrous of the otters. Its front paws are more handlike than any other otter, allowing it to feel for food in shallow water. This otter has short dark brown fur with pale markings on its face and chest.\nThis Asian otter is highly social, and breeding pairs often stay together for life. Small social groups of up to 12 animals are common, and 12 distinct calls have been recorded. These otters also make rewarding pets, and some have even been trained to catch fish by Malay fishermen.\nDistribution: Indonesia and the Philippines.\nHabitat: Freshwater wetlands.\nFood: Crabs, molluscs and frogs.\nSize: 450 - 610 mm (18 - 24 in); 1 - 5 kg (2.2 - 11 lb).\nMaturity: 2 years.\nBreeding: 1 - 6 young born yearly.\nLife span: 20 years.\nThe marine otter, or sea cat, lives on South America's Pacific coast, from its southern tip to northern Peru. Small populations also exist on the South Atlantic coast of Argentina. This is the smallest of the American river otters, which form a separate genus to the Old World otters and the sea otter. It is the only river otter that lives exclusively in the sea. It occupies exposed rocky coasts, sheltering from rough seas and strong winds in caves and crevices. Marine otters eat fish and shellfish such as crabs and mussels. They sometimes catch birds and small mammals.\nSize: 90 cm (35.5 in); 4.5 kg (10 lb)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d3a1875f-3bd8-4658-9083-20591e5918d0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the life expectancy and mating behavior difference between black widows and tarantulas? Really curious about this! 🤔","answer":"Black widows typically live for one year, though some can survive up to 3 years in the wild or 4 years in captivity. Their mating process involves males creating a sperm web and searching for females, with females capable of storing sperm for life. Female black widows guard their pear-shaped egg sacs until the spiderlings hatch. In contrast, female tarantulas can live up to 20 years, significantly longer than males who usually die shortly after mating. Female tarantulas also lay eggs within silk cocoons they create, producing between 75 to 1,000 eggs, which they guard until hatching. Both species exhibit maternal care by protecting their eggs until they hatch.","context":["A terrestrial environment is the habitat of the. It is ubiquitous and builds strong-walled retreats quite close to the ground and in dark sheltered spots. However, it also spreads its snares over plants. Webs of the black widow spider can be found in recesses under stones or logs in a woodpile, in crevices or holes in dirt embankments, in barns and outbuildings. They can also be found around lids of dust bins, around seats of outdoor privies, spaces under chips of wood, around stacked materials of any kind, in deserted animal burrows or rodent holes, and entwined in grape arbors. This spider may find its way into clothing or shoes and occasionally seeks a spot in a house to build a web, but it is usually not found indoors. When it does seek shelter in a building, it is due to cold weather and a need for a dry shelter. In addition, in the eastern United States, is associated with littered areas, with dumps of large cities, with garages, and storage sheds. In arid parts of Arizona, this spider inhabits almost every crevice in the soil and its nests are found in cholla cacti and agave plants. (Ferrand, 1988; Kaston, 1953; Preston-Mafham, 1984; Comstock, 1948; Gertsch, 1979; Shuttlesworth, 1959; Snow, 1970; Smith, 1980; Emerton, 1961; “Black Widow Spider, www.nscu.edu)\nBiomes: temperate and tropical zones, including temperate forest, tropical rainforest,\ntemperate grassland, chaparral, desert\nis the largest spider of the family Theridiidae. The black widow spider is shiny, coal black in color. The female averages 8-10 mm in length and has long slender legs and a round abdomen. Usually on the underside of the female’s abdomen (venter) is a red hourglass mark and one or two red spots over the spinnerets and along the middle of her back. The male is 3-4 mm long with an elongated abdomen. The male’s legs are larger than the female’s and each joint is orange brown in the middle and black on the ends. On the sides of the male’s abdomen there are four pairs of red and white stripes. Young spiderlings, or juveniles, are orange, brown and white; they acquire their black coloring with age, or with each molt. (Emerton, 1961; Milne, 1990; Comstock, 1948; Kaston, 1953)\nAnother important characteristic ofis its “comb foot.” The spider has a row of strong, curved bristles on the hind pair of legs, which form a distinct comb. The comb is used for flinging silk over its prey. (Shuttlesworth, 1959; Comstock, 1948)\nOnce the female produces her egg sacs she guards them until the spiderlings hatch. Once the spiderlings have hatched they leave the web (Milne, 1990).\nCopulation amongis unique. A mature male spins a small “sperm web” and deposits a small quantity of semen on it. He then charges his palps with the sperm, abandons his habitat, and spends considerable effort to locate a female of his species. Once the female black widow spider has been located, courtship begins. The male vibrates the threads of the female’s snare to be sure she is the right species, for her to recognize him as a mate, and to make her receptive to mating. Mating takes place when the male inserts his papal organs into the spermathecal openings of the female. The spermatozoa are released onto the eggs. The eggs are laid onto a small web and are covered with more silk until they are completely surrounded by an egg sac or cocoon. This egg saw is then camouflaged, guarded, or carried by the female. Within the egg sac, the eggs hatch and spiderlings (juveniles) emerge. The female black widow spider’s egg sac is pear-shaped. In addition, the female can store a lifetime supply of sperm to fertilize all the eggs she will ever produce. (Hillyard, 1994; Snow, 1970; Kaston, 1953; Wallace et al, 1991; Foelix, 1996)\nThe female rarely leaves the web. She watches over the eggs in the egg sac until the spiderlings hatch. The spiderlings disperse soon after hatching, at which time parental care ceases and the spiderlings must fend for themselves.\nMost spiders live for one year. Some are known to have lived 3 years in the wild, and in captivity, widow spiders may live for at least four years.\nis timid, sedentary, solitary, cannibalistic, and nocturnal. The only social life it exhibits is when it mates. During the daylight hours, this spider spends its time in the silken tunnel of its web, which is the core of the snare. The female black widow spider hangs upside down in her web; her red hourglass marking is a visible warning signal. This spider will drop out of its web at the slightest disturbance and pretend that it is dead. The female black widow is usually clumsy when she is not in intimate contact with the lines of her snare. is a tangled web weaver. Its irregular, funnel-shaped web of coarse silk has a definite plan. Three structural levels can be recognized: an uppermost complex of supporting threads, a central zone of tangle threads, and a lower zone of vertical trap threads. Also, the black widow spider is greatly active in the autumn months and its web is spread over everything. In addition, most of these spiders live only a year, but the yearly population is divided into two faunas, one identified with spring and the second with fall. (Ferrand, 1988; Shuttlesworth, 1959; Preston-Mafham, 1996; Hillyard, 1994; Gertsch, 1979; Kaston, 1953)\nis exclusively carnivorous and antagonistic. Ordinarily it feeds on insects; however, it also consumes wood lice, diplopods, chilopods and other arachnids. Usually, the black widow spider enswathes prey caught in its snare, bites it, and later drags it to its hub, or retreat, to be eaten. inflicts a small wound on its prey, uses its cheliceral teeth to mash it up, pours digestive enzymes on the prey; and sucks up the resulting food. The whole digestion process takes place outside the spider’s body. (Kaston, 1953; Snow, 1970; Preston-Mafham, 1996; Foelix, 1996; Levine and Miller, 1991; Gertsch, 1979)\nA known predator is the mud-dauber wasp (Desert USA Magazine, 2004). The black widow spider spins a web which acts as a defense mechanism against predators. When a possible predator comes in contact with the web, it becomes entangled in the threads allowing the spider to wrap more silk around it and then inject it with its poison. Also, the female spider hangs upside down in her web so that her red hourglass mark serves as a warning signal to a predator (Farrand, 1988). (Desert USA Magazine, 2004; Farrand, 1988)\nThe black widow spider creates its own habitat wherever it spins its own web. With the aid of its web, the spider plays an active role in the ecosystem by helping to control insect populations.\nBlack widow spiders are fairly common and they are afforded no special conservation protections.\nMatthew McCorkle (author), University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, Kerry Yurewicz (editor), University of Michigan-Ann Arbor.\nliving in the Nearctic biogeographic province, the northern part of the New World.

The question that lingers in the minds of many is whether these creatures pose a threat to our safety. In this article, we delve into the truth behind tarantula aggression towards humans and the risks of tarantula bites.\nContrary to popular belief, tarantulas are generally not inclined to attack humans. These fascinating creatures are solitary by nature and prefer to be left alone. While their large size and hairy bodies may seem intimidating, tarantulas are usually docile and non-aggressive towards humans.\n- Tarantulas are generally not aggressive towards humans and prefer to be left alone.\n- They typically only bite when severely provoked or when mistaken a finger for prey.\n- Tarantulas serve as important pest control providers in the ecosystem.\n- Their venom is usually comparable to a bee sting and not strong enough to pose a danger to humans.\n- While rare, some tarantula species can deliver bites with more severe symptoms.\nWill Tarantulas Attack Humans?\nTarantula Behavior and Habitat\nUnderstanding tarantula behavior is essential for individuals seeking to coexist with these fascinating creatures. Although their appearance may be intimidating, tarantulas are generally not aggressive towards humans. They are solitary creatures that prefer to be left alone, and their bites are typically a defense mechanism when severely provoked or mistaken a finger for prey. will tarantulas attack humans\nTarantulas are ambush hunters and rely on their venom to subdue their prey. While their venom is not strong enough to pose a danger to humans, a bite can be comparable to a bee sting. It is important to note that tarantulas do not spin webs like other spiders. Instead, they create silk structures for molting and mating, which they carefully construct and maintain.\nTarantulas are found on every continent except Antarctica and have adapted to various habitats. They have different species-specific adaptations, such as urticating hairs, which they can release as a defense mechanism.

{"question":"Can you explain how patient involvement works in individualized care vs palliative care? Need step-by-step info plz!","answer":"In both care approaches, patient involvement is central but implemented differently. In individualized patient care, patients have choice and control over how care is planned and delivered, with involvement including: 1) expressing personal preferences and needs, 2) participating in creating a customized care plan, 3) making decisions about managing their health based on information from healthcare professionals, and 4) deciding who among family and friends can be involved in care planning. In palliative care, patient involvement focuses on: 1) communicating goals for medical care, 2) receiving education about their illness and care options, 3) participating in crisis prevention and management planning that reflects their values and goals, and 4) working with a coordinated team of primary and specialty care providers to manage their serious illness.","context":["Personalized patient care (PPC), individualized patient care (IPC), customized patient care, and patient-centric care are different names for the same thing.\nWhat is personalized patient care (PPC)?\nThis latest trend in the nursing industry refers to nursing care tailored to meet individual needs and preferences. IPC is a major service coming to society and is growing rapidly. PPC or IPC means patients and/or their relatives have choice and control over how nursing care is planned and delivered. It is based on ‘what matters‘ to patients and their individual needs and strengths.\nThe new nursing care system works with the expertise, potential and competence of nurses who deliver care to patients, people, families and communities for better outcomes and experiences. Patient-based healthcare is created based on the medical and other needs of the patient and available options.\nPatient-centric care requires a holistic approach from the nurses and other professionals involved to address the patient’s need for physical as well as emotional wellbeing.\nEach patient is unique and needs to be assessed for individuality, preferences, cultural traditions, spiritual beliefs and socioeconomic conditions with a holistic approach to planning and providing quality nursing care. The IPC plan should be developed to treat the patient, ensuring that psychological and social needs are met in addition to medical treatment.\nIPC is based on a systems approach to patient care, in which nursing and allied services, including health, society, public health, doctors and other associated services, are integrated around the patients.\nIdentical to nursing care, individualistic care is available from maternity and childhood to the elderly. The growing number of elderly people and people living with chronic diseases or disabilities puts pressure on healthcare and social systems.\nFacilities like music and art therapy, pet therapy, naturopathy, meditation rooms, natural light rooms, healing gardens and other supportive programs are created for patients and their families, and communities. These spaces provide positive energy, low levels of noise, comfortable furniture, cleanliness, privacy and space for family and visitors.\nPersonalized patient care offers many advantages, including the following:\n- It improves patients’ health faster and reduces pressure on nursing services.\n- Patients with multiple health conditions can make decisions about managing their health based on quality information from healthcare professionals.\n- It combines different parts of the personalized care and support planning health system, including shared decision making and social and community-based support.\n- It creates a soothing and comfortable environment that allows patients to heal with dignity and respect.\n- It gives a sense of being cared for and homely feelings of comfort and calm.\nIPC is considered one of the simplest and most effective techniques available to improve patient care today and is based on treating the patient as a ‘person’ rather than just as a patient. Trust between healthcare professionals and patients is crucial for IPC, allowing caregivers to address all issues effectively and provide quality treatment and care.\nPatient-centric care in the hospital\nIndividualized patient care can be used in a variety of settings, including hospitals and clinics. The patient’s family and friends are an integral part of patient-centric care, and patients decide who can visit and when. Family members may also participate in planning discussions and decisions.\nConcept of individualized patient care\nAs IPC delivers care and medical expertise, it is imperative that patient concerns and priorities are frequently assessed. But despite efforts, it is still common for patients to express concern that caregivers do not adequately listen to them.\nIPC is a patient care model that is based on the delivery of nursing care and medical expertise with the patient in focus.\nThe most important aspect is free communication with patients, that is, listening to their feelings and expectations while telling the patients that they are treated as a person, not just as a patient. This creates trust between patients, physicians and nurses and decreases patients’ anxiety.\nCommunication with patients helps in understanding how to provide the best possible care for them. The nurse’s communication is highly correlated with the overall patient experience. Individualized patient care takes the patient’s preferences, fears and anxieties into account while preparing the care plan for a patient.\nKey factors that determine patients’ satisfaction\nIn order to provide consistent quality care through IPC and ensure patient engagement, it is vital to identify and sincerely address all the patient’s concerns.\nMany parameters are important from a patient’s point of view, including nurse communication, physician communication, responsiveness, treatment information, pain management, cleanliness, noise levels, instructions and knowledge.\nPatient-centered care toolkit\nThe IPC approach gives people more choices and control in their lives, appropriate to their needs. It is built upon the strengths, resources and skills of the individual, the caretakers, the family, the community and the support network to empower all of them. It requires a whole system and team approach, with all stakeholders respecting the principles and processes of person-centered care.\nImportant tools for IPC include social prescribing, collaborative care and support planning, shared decision making and health coaching. Some person-centered care toolkits have been developed to support nurses, physicians and primary healthcare teams to plan and deliver IPC.\nKey aspects of a person-centered care plan include:\n- Personalized and integrated healthcare, social care and support.\n- Involvement of family, friends, caretakers and community.\n- Respect for personal values, preferences and identified needs.\n- Level partnership between healthcare professionals and patients.\n- Education and information.\nOne of the key factors in the IPC model is to be proactive rather than reactive. IPC improves harmony between the health professional and individuals, thereby improving health outcomes, working relationships and job satisfaction and ultimately reducing the demand for healthcare professionals.\nIndividualizing a patient’s care plan\nIn patient-centered care, health and social care professionals collaborate with service users. It is customized and tailored to the needs of the individuals involved ensuring that people are always treated with dignity, compassion and respect.\nIndividualizing a patient’s care plan means tailoring or customizing the IPC plan to meet the specific and general needs of the patient. It requires considering the patient’s medical history, current health condition, family and friends and preferences for treatment.\nThis customized and tailored individualized patient care plan is unique for each person because each person is different with distinctive desires and will respond differently in various situations. By spending time creating a customized care plan for each patient, it can ensure that the patient receives the best possible care.\nThe importance of nurses and nursing process in patient-centered care\nNo one has any doubts about the nursing profession and nurses. Nursing is a noble profession that positively affects patients and the people surrounding them. To deliver personalized care, nurses get into many additional roles and responsibilities.\nIt is critical for a nurse to determine the patient’s requirements precisely to provide IPC. This demands a major change in the nursing process as it becomes vital for the nurses to understand the patient’s needs to provide the best possible personalized care.\nThe nurse’s role in patient-centered care\nPatient-centered nursing care provides an experience to the patients in which they feel it is for them, and they are heard, respected, involved and empowered in their own healthcare.\nIn patient-centered care, healthcare professionals advise, educate and support patients and help them make decisions about their individualized treatment and healthcare plans. In the process, nurses earn the respect and trust of patients, relatives and the community, resulting in improved patient outcomes.\nIn IPC, nurses and other healthcare teams support patient-centered care with a focus on a few important factors to consider the total wellbeing of the patient rather than focusing on only medical treatment for illness. These essential factors include culture, care, communication and collaboration.\nLearning the fundamentals of patient-centered care\nMany counties are currently experiencing a partial or major healthcare professional shortage. The demand for nurses has never been greater, especially for those who are educated in patient-centered care.\nThe demand for skilled and caring healthcare professionals continues to grow. In order to ensure that patient care is personalized and tailored to meet individual needs and preferences, nurses must learn the fundamentals of patient-centric care and advance their careers.\nSpecially designed online nursing career advancement programs are available based on the philosophy of patient-centric care. Those who want to become a nurse and fast track to a rewarding career can go for a fast track nursing program online, such as an accredited online Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing program from Marymount University.\nIt will empower them with all aspects of patient-centric nursing care philosophy and requirements. In just 16 months, nurses can move up in their professions and focus on individualized patient care specializations.\nOnline master’s in nursing practice programs are also available for holders of a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree or bachelor’s degrees in other fields. These are ways for nurses to earn a master’s degree and advance their qualifications, knowledge and career.\nPracticing nurses can move towards individualized patient care by undergoing short-term courses, workshops or diplomas offered by the Personalized Care Institute or training centers to get trained for individualized patient care issues and requirements.\nOther healthcare workers like allied health professionals and physicians also need to learn various aspects of personalized patient care and how to respond to these needs.\nHow can nurses ensure and deliver individualized patient care?\nDelivering compassionate medical care is an essential part of any nurse’s job. But patient-centric, more personalized patient care that meets individual needs and preferences is the new challenge for nurses.\nTo improve patient health quickly and provide a pleasant experience, many healthcare professionals are using training services, workshops, and short-term courses to improve their knowledge of individualistic patient care. For nurses, here’s an overview of important aspects they should consider for providing great personalized patient care:\nCurrently, there is huge exposure to technology and information that have changed patient expectations. Patients want more personalized care, faster service, access to devices, treatment and medicines information, and connectivity with their nurses and physician for personalized experiences.\nPatients want to be treated with courtesy and respect\nAddressing a patient by name with a smile, being respectful, asking about their day, explaining steps you will take to find a solution to their problem, being specific, and talking with a pleasant, positive attitude all give a pleasing experience to the patient and family members.\nBody language with eye contact adds value to nurses’ delivering individualized patient care.\nDelivering personalized care\nPatients in pain need and expect that the nurse fully understands their issues. This will make it easy for a nurse to deliver personalized patient care and achieve goals. Some helpful tips for nurses are:\n- Listen carefully and patiently to what the patient wants to say.\n- Be empathetic.\n- Make the patient feel comfortable and cared for.\n- Answer patients’ doubts and explain things in a way that is easy to understand.\n- Explain their condition and what they could expect during the treatment.\n- Provide them with authentic materials (brochures, fact sheets, videos, web resources) concerning their medical condition, treatment and medications.\n- Work as partners with their informed families.\n- Spend time with the patient and make a connection.\n- Understand their needs like an extra blanket, pillow, bath, something to read or listen to, TV or Wi-Fi, etc.\n- Soothe their anxiety and remove their fears.\nWith these tips in mind, nurses can succeed in delivering personalized patient care.\nBuild rapport with patients and families\nGood rapport creates a close and harmonious relationship with patients. It allows the nurse to understand the patient’s feelings and communicate easily with them. It connects the nurse to the patient and improves patient care.\nThe importance of rapport cannot be understated in IPC nursing, and nurses must seek ways to build rapport with each patient. Of course, rapport building is a skill only learned through practice.\nTo become more effective in building rapport, nurses can keep a few pointers in mind, which include maintaining eye contact, showing empathy, having open communication, active listening, keep their word and knowing the patients enough to make the conversations personal.\n- 10 Self-Care Tips for Optimal Physical and Mental Health This Year - March 26, 2023\n- How Nurses Can Deliver Truly Personalized Patient Care - March 5, 2023\n- 8 Tips for Getting Out of Debt That Will Help You Recover Financially - February 13, 2023\nLike what you are reading?

{"question":"How do the consequences of academic cheating compare to the behavioral patterns of wealthy individuals when it comes to rule-breaking and ethics?","answer":"Both academic cheating and wealthy individuals' rule-breaking behaviors show concerning patterns of ethical misconduct. Wealthy individuals demonstrate unethical behavior through actions like cutting off other drivers in luxury cars, taking candy meant for children, and cheating on dice rolls. Similarly, academic dishonesty has serious consequences including missed learning opportunities, risk of course failure or expulsion, increased stress, wasted money and time, compromised integrity, and lowered self-esteem. Both situations reveal how people justify their unethical actions - wealthy individuals consistently display a willingness to break rules for self-interest, while students sometimes rationalize cheating with excuses like 'everybody does it' or 'it's no big deal.'","context":["If you think about a stereotype of the well-to-do, the image that pops into your head might be one of impeccable manners, good breeding, and polite behavior. However, the results of a new study may shatter that perception forever. As it turns out, social status does not necessarily confer class or translate to people who behave well.\nThe research, which took place at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Toronto, was actually a compilation of seven different trials, some in the confines of a lab and others out in the real world.1 In both environments, however, those in the upper class tend to behave worse than anyone else.\nIn one of the field experiments, the researchers kept watch at a busy intersection. They determined that those driving luxury cars were more likely to cut off other drivers than were those in less expensive vehicles. Another similar experiment involved researchers walking across an intersection and taking note of which drivers allowed them the right of way. Again, those in expensive cars tended to resist yielding to pedestrians more frequently than those in more moderately priced automobiles. Of course, the argument can be made that some drivers of fancy cars are not necessarily rich and some very wealthy people may drive ordinary vehicles. But overall, the type of car -- especially when it's relatively new -- is considered a fairly accurate indicator of a person's economic level.\nBack on campus, the scientists had 129 undergraduate volunteers rank themselves in comparison to others on a rating of status. Upon being released from their responsibilities in the lab, the participants were invited to take candy from a jar as they left, but it was mentioned that the candy was really there for children. Those who reported themselves to be upper class helped themselves to more candy than their peers did. And in yet another experiment, 195 subjects rolled five dice and recorded the score. The dice, however, were loaded and always added up to 12. Nevertheless, many of those in a higher socioeconomic bracket failed to report their scores accurately. There were numerous scores listed in the 20s and several even reported a 30, the highest score theoretically attainable. (I mean really -- cheating on meaningless dice throws? This is starting to get disturbing -- and yet it gets worse!)\nOne of the trials conducted showed that maybe this willingness to break the rules that the wealthy seemed to consistently display could be instilled in others. This experiment had the researchers promoting the concept that greed is good and endorsing negative behavior. In fact, this was the one time that all classes of people appeared ready to abandon their morals and act only in their own self-interest. It makes sense that this is not an inherent quality in any way, but more a learned behavior gleaned from the values a person is either taught or learns through life experience. And yet sadly, in all settings, many of the rich are more likely to exhibit bad behavior.\nIt's a shame, really, that instead of using their status for something positive, such as finding ways to help others less fortunate than themselves, so many wealthy individuals just want more and always have to feel as if they are coming out on top, even if all they are gaining is a few extra pieces of candy meant for children…or just reporting meaningless scores from rolling the dice. But in life, maybe this competitive edge is what pushes them to be so successful and accumulate such wealth. It's just unfortunate that these are the morals they will clearly be handing down to their children or using while they manage our money while working on Wall Street.\nAnd the results of a 2010 ethics survey of 43,000 high school students published by the Josephson Institute of Ethics seems to show that today's youth (regardless of economic status) can use all the help it can get in the morals department.2 One-third of the boys and one-quarter of the girls admitted stealing from a store within the previous year. Eighty percent of the kids surveyed admitted lying to their parents about something important, and 59 percent admitted to cheating on schoolwork in the last year. Even worse, more than 25 percent of the respondents admitted that they had lied on at least a few of the survey questions, meaning the real numbers of cheater, liars, and thieves undoubtedly is higher. Yet in spite of their behavior, a stunning 92 percent of the kids reported feeling quite pleased with their ethical standards and conduct!\nClearly, it's not just the rich who are experiencing behavior problems. We would all do well to think long and hard about what kind of people we want our children to become as they grow up, upper class or not. Teaching morals and good behavior should be lesson number one for all of us -- not to mention practicing them ourselves in the here and now.\n1 McMillen, Matt. \"High Social Status Linked to Bad Behavior.\" WebMD. 27 February 2012.

The attitude of some students that grades are the end-all in academics has led many students to resort to academic dishonesty to try to get the best possible grades or handle the pressure of an academic program. Although you may be further tempted if you’ve heard people say, “Everybody does it,” or “It’s no big deal at my school,” you should be mindful of the consequences of cheating:\n- You don’t learn as much. Cheating may get you the right answer on a particular exam question, but it won’t teach you how to apply knowledge in the world after school, nor will it give you a foundation of knowledge for learning more advanced material. When you cheat, you cheat yourself out of opportunities.\n- You risk failing the course or even expulsion from school. Each institution has its own definitions of and penalties for academic dishonesty, but most include cheating, plagiarism, and fabrication or falsification. The exact details of what is allowed or not allowed vary somewhat among different colleges and even instructors, so you should be sure to check your school’s Web site and your instructor’s guidelines to see what rules apply. Ignorance of the rules is seldom considered a valid defense.\n- Cheating causes stress. Fear of getting caught will cause you stress and anxiety; this will get in the way of performing well with the information you do know.\n- You’re throwing away your money and time. Getting a college education is a big investment of money and effort. You’re simply not getting your full value when you cheat, because you don’t learn as much.\n- You are trashing your integrity. Cheating once and getting away with it makes it easier to cheat again, and the more you cheat, the more comfortable you will feel with giving up your integrity in other areas of life—with perhaps even more serious consequences.\n- Cheating lowers your self-esteem. If you cheat, you are telling yourself that you are simply not smart enough to handle learning. It also robs you of the feeling of satisfaction from genuine success.\nResist the temptation to cheat by using material from the Internet.\nThomas Favre-Bulle – Working on UML – CC BY-NC 2.0.\nTechnology has made it easier to cheat. Your credit card and an Internet connection can procure a paper for you on just about any subject and length. You can copy and paste for free from various Web sites. Students have made creative use of texting and video on their cell phones to gain unauthorized access to material for exams. But be aware that technology has also created ways for instructors to easily detect these forms of academic dishonesty. Most colleges make these tools available to their instructors. Instructors are also modifying their testing approaches to reduce potential academic misconduct by using methods that are harder to cheat at (such as in-class essays that evaluate your thinking and oral presentations).\nIf you feel uneasy about doing something in your college work, trust your instincts. Confirm with the instructor that your intended form of research or use of material is acceptable. Cheating just doesn’t pay.\nExamples of Academic Dishonesty\nAcademic dishonesty can take many forms, and you should be careful to avoid them. The following list from Northwestern University is a clear and complete compilation of what most institutions will consider unacceptable academic behavior.\n- Cheating: using unauthorized notes, study aids, or information on an examination; altering a graded work after it has been returned, then submitting the work for regrading; allowing another person to do one’s work and submitting that work under one’s own name; submitting identical or similar papers for credit in more than one course without prior permission from the course instructors.\n- Plagiarism: submitting material that in part or whole is not entirely one’s own work without attributing those same portions to their correct source.\n- Fabrication: falsifying or inventing any information, data or citation; presenting data that were not gathered in accordance with standard guidelines defining the appropriate methods for collecting or generating data and failing to include an accurate account of the method by which the data were gathered or collected.\n- Obtaining an Unfair Advantage: (a) stealing, reproducing, circulating or otherwise gaining access to examination materials prior to the time authorized by the instructor; (b) stealing, destroying, defacing or concealing library materials with the purpose of depriving others of their use; (c) unauthorized collaboration on an academic assignment; (d) retaining, possessing, using or circulating previously given examination materials, where those materials clearly indicate that they are to be returned to the instructor at the conclusion of the examination; (e) intentionally obstructing or interfering with another student’s academic work; or (f) otherwise undertaking activity with the purpose of creating or obtaining an unfair academic advantage over other students’ academic work.\n- Aiding and Abetting Academic Dishonesty: (a) providing material, information, or other assistance to another person with knowledge that such aid could be used in any of the violations stated above, or (b) providing false information in connection with any inquiry regarding academic integrity.\n- Falsification of Records and Official Documents: altering documents affecting academic records; forging signatures of authorization or falsifying information on an official academic document, grade report, letter of permission, petition, drop/add form, ID card, or any other official University document.\n- Unauthorized Access to computerized academic or administrative records or systems: viewing or altering computer records, modifying computer programs or systems, releasing or dispensing information gained via unauthorized access, or interfering with the use or availability of computer systems or information.\n- Being dishonest can have major consequences that can affect not only your college career but also your life beyond college.\n- “Everybody does it” and “It’s no big deal at my school” are not valid reasons for cheating.\n- When you cheat, you are primarily cheating yourself.\nWhat are the most common forms of academic dishonesty you have heard about at your school? What should be done about them?\nWhat resources do you have on campus to learn about correct forms of referencing other people’s work in your own?\nUndergraduate Academic Conduct Committee of Northwestern University, “Definitions of Academic Violations,” http://www.northwestern.edu/uacc/defines.html (accessed July 13, 2010)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:96d6dbc5-6ab8-44d1-9a1a-1888934777f9>","<urn:uuid:5e6da88e-6651-41fc-9512-1be65bbcbd5e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Why is wood conditioning important before staining, and how should power tools be maintained to ensure safe operation?","answer":"Wood conditioning before staining is important because pre-stain wood conditioners help improve the appearance of the finished project and enhance the wood's natural grain by filling it in to some degree. This results in a better-looking final product. Regarding power tool maintenance for safe operation, tools must be kept free from moisture, and their wiring should be regularly inspected for loose or damaged plugs and exposed wiring. If a power cord is nicked, it can be taped, but deeply cut cords should be replaced. Tools should also be disconnected from their power source when not in use and should never be carried by their power cords.","context":["Millions of people have enjoyed woodworking for centuries. Some people are even able to turn that hobby into a lucrative profession. If you’re interested in woodworking, you can find success by using the below advice.\nUse a pre-stain wood conditioner before staining the wood. These conditioners will make the finished project look better. It will also help to improve the appearance of the wood itself, as wood has a natural grain and the conditioner fills it in to some degree.\nMake sand blocks that you can reuse. Start by cutting a few blocks from a scrap piece of plywood for all the sandpaper grits you need to use. Be sure that they’re only around 2.5″ x 4.75″. Use some spray adhesive on your blocks and the cork tile. Start by sticking a block to the cork before cutting the cork with a utility knife. Put glue on the sandpaper and apply to the cork. Fnally, make sure you cut sandpaper flush with the cork, and label every block.\nThe height of the work bench you use affects the quality of your finished product. If you wish to determine your ideal workbench height, measure how far it is from the floor to the middle of your waist. This is the perfect workbench height.\nIf you’re working on a woodworking project that calls for stain, always stir the stain first. Some of the ingredients in these stains and finishes tend to settle to the bottom over time. However, shaking can cause bubbling, which keeps it from mixing well. Be sure you stir it up until your mix is dispersed correctly and in a smooth manner.\nAvoid using your fingers as guides while cutting narrow pieces of wood. Use a thin piece of wood instead. Use it to guide the wood through the saw. This will help you keep your fingers, which you need to be a great woodworker.\nAlways do a dry fit prior to gluing two pieces of wood together. You don’t want any surprises when you do actually have to apply the glue. You’ll be prepared. A dry-fit helps you figure out where to put things.\nUnderstand the properties of the wood you’re using. Keep in mind that all wood has different characteristics. Different types of wood will react differently to various stains. Splintering varies among cuts. You will also encounter a lot of different grains. All these factors will be taken into account when working on your project.\nMake sure to properly protect your ears. Woodworking can be very loud. Exposure over a long period of time can be bad on your hearing. Get some cheap ear plugs or high-quality headphones that block out noise. No matter what you choose, be sure that you use them whenever you operate machinery.\nWhether you’ve built a lot of things or are new to woodworking, it’s something that can be made a lot more simple if you follow the above tips. As you start using the tips, you will discover they transform your works into masterpieces. So, the research you’ve just done will go a long way in improving your skills.","Most people will tell you that some sort of tool is a must for any diy project around the house. Knowledgeable trades individuals who constantly need to use tools for their job could hardly live without them. Nowadays, power tools are definitely more efficient but additionally they bring an increased risk of operator injury. Accidents when using power tools are often on account of negligence, apathy or ignorance. With this in mind, here are some pointers to keep you protected when working with power tools.\nYour eyes are actually extremely vulnerable to injury when using power tools so eye protection is a must have. If you will probably use safety goggles you’ll be able to prevent a lot of things from getting into yours eyes, like dust, debris, wood shavings, and fiberglass, to name a few things. Eye safeguards is of the foremost importance when working in the area of power tools. Your ears must be protected also, making use of earplugs. Doing this, you will have a better chance of minimizing ear damage due to the loud noises from power tools.\nProtecting against injury can be done by using the appropriate tool for the job. When you use a tool for something that it wasn’t designed for, you increase, not only the odds of damaging the tool, but also the chance of causing injury. You ought to browse through the instruction manual to make sure you know the proper way to use your new tool. Tools are meant to be used in a certain way, and that is how you should use them. Almost any power tool not utilized should be separated from it’s power source by disconnecting it, and never carry it around dangling from it’s power cord. Take into account the clothes you might be wearing, and avoid loose clothing. Ideally, your whole body should be covered with your work clothes, and work gloves would help protect your hands. Wear masks as required, steel-toed work footwear, and hard hats are also good things for safety.\nPower tools should not be used in the rain and always keep them free of moisture. Frequently look at the tools for any wiring having loose, damaged plugs, or exposed wiring. Taping a nicked cord is okay, but if a cut is deep, the cord should really be replaced. A thoroughly clean work area clear of accumulated dust and flammable liquids won’t be a potential fire hazard. A tidy and organized work environment will probably be a lot safer and easier to work in. Don’t forget that power tools such as circular saws, nail guns and table saws tend to be potentially more dangerous than other tools so take more care when using them. Keep tools in their spot, where kids or unauthorized people can get to them.\nMake sure that there is lots of light if you are working. Whenever you pay attention to what you are doing, and understand all of the safety precautions, you should have no problems working without any accidents."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0376f212-7656-42d8-bb4b-40e87297bcaf>","<urn:uuid:40e030e8-bf31-4d78-984b-cb8e721856ab>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you explain the connection between diversity and organizational success? I'm especially interested in real examples!","answer":"Research shows that diverse and inclusive humanitarian leadership teams perform better in several ways, including improved listening to communities and colleagues, better decision-making and risk management, and enhanced innovation. This aligns with broader organizational studies that demonstrate teams with diverse qualities, experiences, and work styles have access to a richer set of ideas, perspectives, and approaches to business issues. However, achieving these benefits requires inclusion - creating an environment where each person feels welcomed, respected, supported, and valued as a team member. For example, UNHCR has implemented a staff-led diversity, inclusion, and gender equity project that addresses multiple aspects of diversity including language, disability, sexuality, gender, and race.","context":["New research has found that just 38 per cent of the staff of humanitarian agencies think they are being led by diverse leadership teams (conjure images of different ages, genders, nationalities and backgrounds) and only 42 per cent of humanitarian workers believe that leadership teams are inclusive (conjure images of being listened to, appreciated and included).\nAnd the statistics prove that they are right about diversity in the sector. Humanitarian Advisory Group conducted a survey reaching 1,500 humanitarian workers from 115 countries and also interviewed 24 people to explore the results. Whilst most respondents to the survey were women, men make up 57 per cent of senior leadership roles, and in high and extreme security risk countries, men make up 69 per cent of the most senior positions. Just four per cent of such positions are held by people who identify as having a disability.\nLow socio-economic status can also be a barrier to working in the humanitarian sector, skewing the pipeline into leadership roles and leadership teams. According to the survey, 90 per cent of all humanitarian staff have completed an undergraduate or master degree (90 per cent!). This may not be surprising given the way humanitarian jobs are advertised. But stakeholders believe that we need to be clearer about the skill sets that deliver effective humanitarian action and not immediately equate academic achievement with professional competence in humanitarian programming. One respondent stated:\n“Socio-economic background among international staff [is important] because looking at how we are recruiting now I see a very homogenous group of young people typically from [one] graduate institute.”\nInterestingly, there is a difference between how men and women perceive leadership diversity in the humanitarian sector. Men have a significantly more positive perception of the diversity and inclusiveness of their leadership teams than women. 54 per cent of surveyed men think their leadership team is mostly or very diverse; only 28 per cent of women think the same.\nThis research supports sneaking suspicions to date that humanitarian leadership teams that are more diverse and inclusive perform better. Those respondents who felt they had diverse and inclusive leadership teams also felt that their leaders were better at: listening and acting on the views of communities and of colleagues; making decisions and managing risk better; and promoting innovation.\nSo if we know this to be true, what are we doing about it?\nSome organisations are implementing strategies to encourage diversity and inclusiveness. These include internal staff surveys to understand inclusion barriers for different groups, setting up specific networks such as LGBTI networks, establishing recruitment quotas, increasing professional development opportunities, and establishing diversity and inclusion policies and implementation plans. For example, UNHCR has been pioneering a range of approaches to supporting a more diverse and inclusive workplace including launching a staff-led diversity, inclusion and gender equity project. This project collates stories on diversity challenges in the organisation and encourages open discussion of topics such as language inclusion, disability, sexuality, gender and race (documented here).\nWhat more can be done?\nWe believe this research provides the basis for three concrete actions to increase diversity and inclusion, and as a result improve leadership team performance.\nHave the conversation: Discuss the findings with your colleagues and share it with your leadership teams. Invite open conversations about how diverse and inclusive your teams are, and why. Making this conversation inclusive will involve having programming, leadership, human resources and finance people all in the same room. And making sure the loudest voices aren’t the only ones heard.\nInvest in change: Diversity and inclusion aren’t automatic. We need to allocate funding to improve recruitment and human resource systems to ensure we are drawing on more diverse candidates. Once we have more diverse workforces we need to invest in strong policies and procedures that support their voice and inclusion. This can include a range of policies such as carers leave, parental leave and flexible working policies. But beyond the policies we need to ensure that the culture and attitudes support diversity; we need to allocate time for inclusive conversations and set up systems for staff to provide feedback and resources to adequately respond to and learn from that feedback.\nTrack and understand the impact: Learn from how different teams operate and what delivers results for people in crisis. If you are really committed to getting this right we would love to hear from you as we move into the next stage of this research project where we look at the linkages between diversity and performance metrics in the field such as innovation, risk management and accountability to affected populations.","Overview Studies show that teams or organizations made up of individuals with a more diverse mix of qualities, experiences and work styles tend to have available a richer set of ideas, perspectives and approaches to a business issue. This overview covers the following major topics:\nRelationship with equal employment opportunity (EEO) and affirmative action.\nThe business case for diversity.\nDesign of a diversity initiative.\nElements of a diversity initiative.\nChange management as it relates to diversity and inclusion.\nCareers in diversity.\nDiversity Diversity has many definitions. Frequently, organizations adapt the definition to their specific environment. Generally, diversity refers to the similarities and differences between individuals accounting for all aspects of one's personality and individual identity. Some of the dimensions of diversity are shown below with examples of content available.\nInclusion Diversity provides the potential for greater innovation and creativity. Inclusion is what enables organizations to realize the business benefits of this potential. Inclusion describes the extent to which each person in an organization feels welcomed, respected, supported and valued as a team member. Inclusion is a two-way accountability; each person must grant and accept inclusion from others. In such an environment, every employee tends to feel more engaged and is more likely to contribute toward the organization's business results. This type of environment requires people from diverse backgrounds to communicate and work together, and understand each other's needs and perspectives—in other words, demonstrate cultural competence. SeeEmbracing Diversity Starts with Self-Awareness, D&I Expert Says.\nIntercultural sensitivity Intercultural sensitivity and cultural (or intercultural) competence are characterized by sensitivity to differences among people from different cultural backgrounds and effectiveness in communicating and working with them. People are similar or different in varying degrees across all dimensions of diversity. Research shows that people who are substantially alike tend more easily to communicate with and to understand each other. People who are very different tend to confront more obstacles to effective communication and mutual understanding. Research also shows that people consistently overestimate their intercultural competence, which poses a particular challenge for HR professionals. SeeEffective Workplace Conversations on Diversity.\nRelationship with Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action There is widespread confusion about the relationship between diversity and inclusion on the one hand, and EEO and affirmative action on the other. This traces to the historical evolution of these complementary yet distinct concepts. In the United States, EEO concerns fairness and equality of treatment for specifically designated protected classes as defined by law. EEO means that the employer gives equal consideration both in hiring and in the terms and conditions of employment to all individuals, and that the employer does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, age, marital status, national origin, disability or sex. EEO and affirmative action are primarily matters of legal compliance, although they do help create a workplace that is more supportive of all people and more diverse in terms of the specific included dimensions of diversity. Many early diversity programs grew out of a company's EEO and affirmative action programs. Companies began seeing business opportunity in focusing on awareness and sensitivity training, and later on building inclusion and intercultural competence. But the diversity functional area has evolved well beyond EEO and affirmative action compliance. Diversity and inclusion are aimed at realizing competitive advantage and business opportunity. The interrelationship between EEO, affirmative action, diversity and inclusion persists, in part because some organizational structures place functional accountability for the disciplines under one office. Though this interrelationship can lead to some continuing confusion, progress in each of these areas reinforces and helps achieve the objectives of the others. See:\nThe Business Case for Diversity The business case for diversity is an organization's statement of purpose in working on diversity and inclusion. There are many valid reasons for doing such work. The most effective reasons for any particular organization are aligned directly with that organization's key business objectives. Typically, these are the business objectives on which organizations measure and compensate their senior leadership's performance. In for-profit companies, these objectives relate to factors like sales, market share, profitability, corporate social responsibility and reputation.\nDesign of a Diversity Initiative Effective diversity initiatives require starting, planning, speaking and acting solely from key business priorities. The design and implementation process should adhere to these principles:\nEngage the CEO, senior leadership and other key stakeholders throughout the process.\nFocus on achieving business results.\nStart from and stay aligned with the business purpose.\nBe grounded in ownership and accountability.\nPlan ongoing internal and external communication to inform, engage and manage expectations.\nIf a diversity initiative is well designed, it should be able to explain the:\nKey business priorities the initiative will help meet.\nChanges in the workforce that are needed to help meet business priorities.\nChanges in the work environment that are needed to help meet business priorities.\nElements of a diversity initiative that will be put in place to achieve the needed changes.\nThe design process should address two additional areas—metrics and diversity training. Metrics can be designed once the needed changes are identified. Training may be designed to close specific gaps that are subsequently recognized. Both then are integral parts of the overall initiative.\nElements of a Diversity Initiative The diversity initiative is an organization's formal strategic plan for addressing diversity and inclusion. SeeHow to Develop a Diversity and Inclusion Initiative. Effective initiatives tend to exhibit several characteristics. For example, they:\nAlign with the organization's key business objectives.\nFocus on implementing specific changes to the workforce and workplace that will help achieve needed business results.\nIdentify the organization's level of intercultural competence and capacity to accept cultural change.\nUse a strategic and ongoing approach to employee communication.\nStakeholder analysis The most common potential internal and external stakeholders for a diversity initiative are shown below. Potential Internal Stakeholders Potential External Stakeholders\nBoard of directors\nCommunity organizations and leaders\nCEO and senior leadership\nCustomers (current and prospective)\nInvestors (current and prospective)\nEmployee network groups\nLabor organizations (e.g., unions, workgroups)\nSuppliers (current and prospective)\nEach stakeholder group has unique needs that tend to shape an organization's diversity initiative. Successful initiatives identify the primary stakeholders in two domains:\nStakeholders whose needs are most important and relevant to, and thus should most strongly influence, the organization's diversity initiative.\nStakeholders whose actions and behavioral change are most important to achieving the goals of the diversity initiative.\nDomestic versus global scope An organization's geographic footprint encompasses the regions in which it and its customers are located. It might be exclusively domestic, or it might be global. Combined, the primary stakeholders and the organization's footprint help determine whether the diversity initiative should have a domestic or global scope. Compared to most domestic initiatives, global diversity initiatives are concerned with a richer and more complex set of issues. The reason stems from the wider range of cultural norms represented among all the stakeholder groups. Global initiatives tend to be successful only when they are adapted to and reflect the cultural norms and needs of each region or country. Diversity practitioners and business leaders need strong intercultural competence regardless of the scope of the initiative.\nTypical areas of focus Comprehensive initiatives focus on revenue or analogous measures, expenses, employees, customers, suppliers and external communities. All work must be tailored to the organization's specific business needs. The table illustrates representative areas of focus for a diversity initiative.\nFocus Sample Action Steps\nUse multicultural marketing, focusing on existing or new domestic or international markets\nBuild innovation and creativity to bring new products or services to market\nIncrease recruiting efficiency through more diverse sourcing and engaging employees in identifying candidates\nIncrease retention by creating a more supportive and inclusive workplace, engaging employee network groups in the onboarding process, and focusing on employee needs\nEmployee network groups\nProcess and policy improvement (e.g., performance management, succession planning, benefits)\nSee Revenues, above\nBuild internal capacity to understand evolving and new customer needs\nDevelop minority and women-owned business enterprise programs\nEngage employee network groups\nDevelop relationships with associations to provide executive developmental opportunities and build reputation\nEmployee network groups Employee resource groups (ERGs), also called affinity or business resource groups, are a popular element of diversity initiatives, especially in organizations with more than 1,000 employees. ERGs are groups of employees that come together either voluntarily, based on a common interest or background, or at the request of a company. Examples of common ERGs are those formed around race, ethnicity, gender, disability, sexual orientation, parental status, national origin, religion or belief, or generation. Common objectives for ERGs include engaging employees, increasing diversity, providing developmental and networking opportunities, and ensuring that retention is consistent across all parts of the employee population. Two important success factors are clearly understanding the business purpose and dedicating resources to manage the relationships. ERGs may benefit members, the overall organization and the external communities in which the organization is located and operates. There also are potential downsides to be managed, such as the group's roles, external media presence, funding, structure, and use of the organization's name and brand. Proper planning and effective policies help realize the business advantages while managing the potential problems. SeeAddress Barriers to Diversity with Transparency, Employee Resource Groups.\nDiversity and Inclusion Requires Change Management Each organization has a maximum rate at which it can process cultural change. This depends in part on the organization's cultural competence and the magnitude of the gap between the current situation and the diversity initiative's objectives. Change management for diversity may occur in phases. For example, an organization might want to assign highest priority to changes with the greatest business impact and start with domestic diversity issues, expanding later to address global aspects."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6024a5d7-8191-44fa-9e8f-7e42be46a5ad>","<urn:uuid:3e437cf7-44c6-4df4-997b-03274147344c>"],"error":null}

Targeting a loyal readership, Relix spans generations.\nRELIX: The Book is a collection of material from the first 30 years of the magazine. As the book unfolds, so does the story of the most colorful band and subsequent culture in history—the Grateful Dead and the Deadheads. The long strange trip is told through editorials, interviews, articles, art, comix and photos, with long-time owner and publisher Toni Brown weaving the story together with an informative narrative.\nThe current Jamband evolution was born in the pages of Relix. As Phish, Blues Traveler, Gov’t Mule, Widespread Panic, Dave Matthews Band. String Cheese Incident, .moe and many others took their places alongside veteran artists like the Grateful Dead, Allman Brothers and Hot Tuna, the music scene grew to encompass not only the classic rock-era baby boomers, but their children and grandchildren.\nToday’s Jambands number in the thousands, and Deadheads are alive and well, supporting a very active number of Dead tribute bands and ventures featuring members of the Dead. Those fans number in the millions! The festival phenomenon would not exist without the Relix connection. RELIX: The Book serves to chronicle the early history of this 35-year-old-publication, bringing full-circle the world it helped create.\nAbout The Author\nToni Brown provided a valid niche for the Grateful Dead during her twenty-plus years as publisher of Relix Magazine, a Deadhead bible and birthplace of the Jamband music scene. From 1979-2001, she supported hundreds of up-and-coming bands, providing the most direct marketplace for musicians to reach their fans.\nIn 1995, Toni released her debut CD, Blue Morning, featuring the David Nelson Band and Hot Tuna’s Jorma Kaukonen, Michael Falzarano and Harvey Sorgen. Surrounded by a vast trove of musical talent, Toni made her way into the performance circle, touring internationally. Her second album, Dare To Dream, featured The Toni Brown Band, along with Vassar Clements and Flying Burrito Brother John Beland.\nReferred to by fans as “Patsy Cline on acid” and the “psychedelic Sheryl Crow,” Toni Brown spent the past fifteen years weaving an ethereal musical tapestry. The Toni Brown Band was a staple on the club and festival circuit for over a decade, and Toni has toured with the Grateful Dead’s Tom Constanten, Vince Welnich and Donna Jean, performed with Leftover Salmon’s Vince Hermann, used her band to back up Merl Saunders and Vassar Clements, and played with everyone from Phish to Blues Traveler, Hot Tuna, the New Riders of the Purple Sage, Flying Burrito Brothers, John Cipollina, and dozens of other notables from the classic, jam, psychedelic, blues, folk and country rock genres.\nMost recently joined by guitarist/songwriter Ed Munson, Toni has completed State of Mind, her fourth CD, and is touring in support of RELIX: The Book—The Grateful Dead Experience.\nFor more information: www.tonibrownband.com","All this and a brandnew herstory of comics story and world history of comics variant cover too.

{"question":"What's the ideal daily protein intake for an active person, and which sustainable meat options would be best to reach those targets? 🌱","answer":"The basic protein requirement can be calculated by multiplying your weight in kilograms by 0.8, though active people building muscle may need more (using multipliers of 1.0-1.5). For sustainable meat options, grass-fed animals provide better nutritional profiles, particularly regarding omega 6:3 ratios. However, it's crucial to consider the environmental impact when choosing meat sources. Sustainable practices should include responsible feed sourcing with practices preventing agricultural run-off pollution, proper manure management, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions across the supply chain. Over-consuming protein can lead to health issues like kidney problems, so it's important to eat only what your body requires within a balanced diet framework.","context":["Protein has become a buzzword in the fitness industry and every health food appears to boast a high content. But without understanding what protein is and its role in the body, how can you know how much you need? Today we’re going to cut through the gimmicks and give you the facts, so you can work out whether you’re falling short, keeping the perfect balance, or even going overboard.\nWhat is Protein?\nProtein is a macronutrient – as are carbohydrates and fats – which means that the body needs it in large supply to function. One of its main purposes is to repair, maintain, and build muscle mass which is why it’s so focused on by the fitness industry. However, it’s important to note that protein consumption does not automatically lead to muscle gain. Protein is only energy; your body still needs to be put through the stress of exercise to stimulate muscle growth.\nProtein itself is made up of 20 standard amino acids, 9 of which are essential amino acids. Essential amino acids are so called because the body can’t make them itself, they have to be taken in from food, whereas it can create the other amino acids if your diet doesn’t provide them – an amazing process when you think about it.\nNot all protein sources are equal. If a food contains all 9 essential amino acids, it’s known as a complete protein. Animal sources typically fall into this category, including meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy. The only plants to make the cut are soy beans, quinoa, buckwheat, spirulina, amaranth, hemp, and chia seeds.\nLuckily for vegans, lots of plants contain incomplete proteins and these can be combined to deliver the full profile of amino acids. Sources include beans, peas, nuts, rice, and wheat. So, whilst a plant-based diet may take more forethought than one that includes animal products, it can provide the body with the full range of amino acids.\nThe body can’t store excess protein. We must consume enough of it every day to meet our needs. This stemmed the diet rumour that we only absorb so many calories from protein and the rest will pass through undigested, so if you want to lose weight you should eat lots of protein because it won’t ‘count’. This isn’t true. Unused protein is converted into energy and stored as fat so it’s still important to calorie count if you’re looking to shed a few pounds.\nTo estimate how much protein your body requires, multiply your weight in kilograms by 0.8. So, for example, if you weigh 65kg you type 65 x 0.8 into your calculator to get 52, meaning that you need 52g of protein per day. If you’re very active and want to build muscle mass, you ought to increase your intake, but by how much is disputed. A popular rule is to multiple your weight in kilograms by 1, others follow 1.2-1.5.\nThere’s a reason why macronutrients are called MACROnutrients. We need large amounts of them on a daily basis. However, there’s a trend in the fitness industry to over-consume protein while simultaneously restricting fats and/or carbohydrates. Our bodies weren’t designed to run on this kind of diet so it’s unsurprising that it can cause problems. These include bad breath, headaches, mood swings, irritated skin, digestive issues, dehydration, and food cravings (not for kale, sadly). Long-term, a major worry is that protein digestion requires the kidneys to filter out harmful toxins and, obviously, the more you consume the harder they have to work. Over time this can lead to kidney damage.\nWhen it comes to protein consumption, the take home message is that you should eat as much as your body requires – and this can include short-term protein boosts when you’re building muscle mass – within a framework of balanced eating. But don’t go overboard and don’t confuse high protein consumption with a guaranteed way to gain muscle mass.","Meat Guide: Health Benefits, Concerns and Profile of Different Meat Cuts\n“There are a lot of reasons to eat meat, but there are more reasons not to eat meat.”\nPork: One of the most popular meat types is pork. It’s cheap in comparison to other meat and quite versatile when it comes to it’s uses. It can be cooked in a million different ways and it can be used to make ham, bacon, jamon, prosciutto, salami, sausages and hot dogs. As far as it’s nutritional value, it is a good source of protein, B1 vitamin, selenium and zinc. However, it contains high amounts of fat, and a high omega 6:3 ratio, which doesn’t make it a top choice.\nBeef: There are many different cuts of beef, with different fat content. It has higher nutritional value than pork (better omega 6:3 ratio, similar protein content, high iron content). However, it is more expensive in comparison to pork.\nChicken: Chicken makes the top 3 in the list of the most popular meat. It is classified as poultry, while the previous 2 are defined as red meat. It has a much lower fat content, similar protein and decent vitamin content. It is also a very good source of gelatin when making soups and broth with chicken bones. It is quite versatile when it come to it’s culinary use, as it can be cooked in any way you can imagine or it can be used to make burgers or ham. It is quite cheap to buy and provides a decent source of necessary vitamins and minerals, particularly selenium, potassium, phosphorus and B vitamins.\nLamb and Mutton: They are quite similar kinds of meat, lamb is from sheep less than a year old and mutton is from adult sheep. Lamb chops is the most popular cut but there are many more. They graze on pasture thus they have a very low omega 6:3 ratio when compared to other meat. It is quite expensive to buy and not so easy to find in some places. Lamb contains high amounts of Zinc, Selenium and B Vitamins.\nTurkey: Turkey is another type of white meat such as chicken. Roasted turkey is probably the most popular form of cooking it and appears mainly during Christmas. It’s nutrition profile is quite similar to that of chicken.\nVenison: The meat that come from deer. It is possibly the most nutrient-dense form of meat but also very expensive. It is considered read meat such as beef and pork but it’s low-fat content makes it’s nutrition profile similar to chicken but packed with more vitamins and minerals than most meat. It has and excellent omega 6:3 ratio because deer mostly live in the wild.\nBison: Very lean form of red meat. As most wild meat, bison has a low omega 6:3 ratio, unless it is grain-fed. Low calorie choice, high nutritional value.\nRabbit: Very nutrient-dense, low calorie form of meat. It is mainly found in Europe but also in the US and China. It’s got one the best omega 6:3 ratios. Not as high protein content.\nDuck: Mainly used in Chinese gastronomy, duck has a similar nutritional profile with lower fat. However, it is mostly served with high fat and sodium sauces in the Asian cuisine.\nOther things to consider:\nGrain-fed vs Grass-fed:\nThe nutritional value of meat is not only impacted by the type of cut. The same cut can have a quite better omega 6:3 ratio when the animal is grown outdoor and is grass-fed. A human diet should have a ratio as close to 1:1 of omega 6:3, however nowadays it can go up to 25:1. Thus, the type of meat we consume should be carefully selected.\nAnimal welfare can have a significant impact on the nutrition profile of meat and should be taken in account for ethical reason as well.\nThe environmental impact of meat production:\nLivestock is one of the most harmful activities for the environment nowadays. Animals release high amounts of substances like methane that pollute the atmosphere, and excessive manure that contains antibiotics, bacteria, pesticides, and heavy metals. When manure is decomposed it releases more methane, ammonia and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere which further contributes to climate change.\nForests like the Amazon that are extremely important for our planet’s wellbeing are being destroyed and millions of acres replaced with monoculture crop fields dedicated to feeding livestock. Converting natural habitats to agricultural fields releases carbon pollution, contributing to climate change. Fertilizers are used to treat the crop fields in much higher amounts that the plants can absorb, thus polluting the waterways.\n1. Sustainable Feed Sourcing\na.

{"question":"What's the genetic risk of allergies in kids with allergic parents + stats on CMA resolution?","answer":"When both parents are allergic, their child has a 50-80% chance of developing allergies. If only one parent is allergic, the risk drops to 20-40%. Notably, up to 15% of children can develop allergies even without allergic parents. Regarding cow's milk allergy specifically, most children grow out of it by three to five years of age. The condition typically develops within the baby's first year.","context":["What Is CMA or Cow's Milk Allergy?\nYou might see the acronym CMA or CMPA tossed around often and wonder: “What is CMA?” CMA, or cow’s milk allergy, is the most common type of food allergy in infants, affecting about 2–3% of infants. CMPA is another way to say cow’s milk allergy. The ‘P’ in CMPA stands for protein because it is the protein in cow’s milk that is linked to the allergy.\nCow's Milk Allergy\nCow’s milk allergy in infants, or dairy allergy, is the most common type of infant food allergy in the United States. It happens when the immune system mistakenly identifies a usually harmless protein within cow’s milk as harmful and triggers an allergic response. The associated issues can either occur immediately (within minutes) or be delayed for up to a few days after consuming dairy or foods containing cow’s milk protein.\nSigns of Cow's Milk Allergy\nCow’s milk allergies have a wide range of signs and symptoms, which may include:\n- Colic – Episodes of crying for more than 3 hours a day, for more than 3 days a week, for 3 weeks, in an otherwise healthy child.\n- Skin reactions - Red itchy rash, swelling of the lips, face and around the eyes, or eczema.\n- Digestive issues - Abdominal pain, vomiting or diarrhea.\n- Hay fever-like issues - Sneezing or itchy, runny or blocked nose.\nIt’s not always easy to tell if your baby has cow’s milk allergy, as the issues they experience might not be that clear or they could be caused by other things. If you think your baby might be allergic to cow’s milk protein, speak to your doctor, who may investigate further or refer your baby to a specialist.\nOccurrence of Cow’s Milk Allergy in Infants\nCow’s milk allergy usually develops within baby’s first year. Most will grow out of it as they get older, on average by three to five years of age.\nExperts aren’t sure why some babies become allergic to cow’s milk. What they do know is that your baby has a higher risk of cow’s milk allergy if there’s a family history of allergies, such as asthma, eczema or a food allergy.\nNow that you’ve answered the question of “What is CMA?,” and your doctor has told you that your baby has a cow’s milk allergy, they will advise you of how to eliminate cow’s milk protein from their diet so their issues improve.\n- If you’re breastfeeding, this may mean eliminating cow’s milk protein or dairy products from your own diet, as this could be passed to your baby through your breast milk. Always consult your doctor or healthcare professional before removing major food groups such as dairy from your diet.\n- If you’re bottle feeding, you’ll need to switch your baby onto a special hypoallergenic baby formula designed for infants with cow’s milk allergy like Nutramigen. It’s important that you only put your baby onto a dairy-free diet under the advice and supervision of a healthcare professional.\nWhich Foods Contain Cow's Milk Protein?\nThere are some obvious sources of cow’s milk protein such as cow’s milk products like milk, cheese, butter and ice cream. However, cow’s milk protein can also be “hidden” in a large number of foods, including bread, cookies, cakes, ready-made baby foods and processed meats, so be sure to always read food labels carefully.\nAre Babies With Cow’s Milk Allergy Allergic to Other Foods, Too?\nBabies with cow’s milk allergy could be allergic to goat’s and sheep’s milk, as the proteins in these milks are similar to each other. These milks are not recommended for babies who are allergic to cow’s milk protein.\nBabies with cow’s milk allergy might also be allergic to other non-dairy foods like egg, peanut, tree nuts, soy, wheat, shellfish and fish. If your baby is allergic to cow’s milk protein, be sure to speak to your healthcare professional before introducing them to these foods.","What are allergies?\nWhen a father comes with his son to the consultation, the first thing he asks is what is an allergy ?, and it is something very simple to explain: they are totally harmless substances for most of the population, but, in certain children, they are more sensitive, provoke reactions, antibodies, against that substance. This causes reactions in the child such as asthma, rhinitis or skin problems.\nWhat are the allergens that most affect children?\nThe allergens will depend a little on how old the child is. For example, in infants , especially are the foods, and the main one of all the cow's milk. Then we have other food allergens that are provoked many times by the very early introduction of them. Parents have to be guided by the pediatrician to introduce the feeding. There are foods, such as nuts or strawberries, which can cause allergic reactions. When the child is older , we get into different problems such as house dust mites, pollens or molds , which cause different allergic reactions in the child such as asthma or rhinitis.\nHow to know if a child has an allergy or is a simple cold?\nThis is the million dollar question and the one that people who come to the consultation always do. It is relatively easy. The catarrhal pictures of a child are always in winter, it is a child who has his cough, has his sneezing and has his fever or fever, and the duration of the process is usually very short: few days because they are always caused by viral pictures. The allergic problem has coughing, sneezing, itchy nose, watery eyes and tend to be more in times of pollens, spring times .\nHow is an allergy diagnosed?\nWell we do it with two different methods, one very easy that is what we do in the consultation usually with children, is what is called prick test , and consists of applying a series of drops with different substances of which we suspect that the child he is allergic to his little arm and with a small prick, which does not even make blood, is scraped on the child's skin, he waits a few minutes and after that time he sees if there is a reaction or not. The second test is what we do through the child's blood and it is called IGE. specific, and the procedure is the same: an IGE is requested. specific for house dust mites, for cow's milk proteins or those substances that we think the child may be allergic to, and analyzed.\nIs a child with allergic parents more predisposed to allergies?\nReally if. When we have two parents who are allergic the possibility that their son is also allergic is between 50 and 80%. If only one of the parents is allergic, the predisposition drops to between 20 and 40%. But keep in mind that up to 15% of children suffer from allergies without their parents being allergic.\nIs there a specific treatment to combat them?\nYes, we do have treatment and the children are cured. The treatment will be different depending on what the child has. For example, if it is a child who has an allergy to cow's milk, we make an exclusion diet and use a Nutramigen LGG type hydrolyzate, which is a highly hydrolyzed milk , and the child's problem usually disappears in a year. If the allergy is due to house dust mites or some pollen or mold, then the treatment is different. You can use, for example, immunotherapy , what people commonly call allergy shots, which consists of a puncture in the arm or droplets under the tongue that are put on every day. Lately for allergies to pollens have come some pills that make the patient's allergy disappear. Thank God with any treatment of these the allergy is permanently cured ."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:56b9cf70-5bfc-4ed3-a6ea-35774a505780>","<urn:uuid:045cb81e-4a3b-401e-85ac-cee6b63a24c4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you compare the religious/spiritual aspects of Gauguin's work in Tahiti with Lindauer's early career in Europe?","answer":"Both artists engaged with religious themes but in very different ways. Lindauer began his career creating traditional religious paintings and frescoes for Austrian cathedral churches, working on commissioned pieces for prominent religious figures like Bishop Jieschek. In contrast, Gauguin took a more experimental approach with religious subjects in Tahiti, as seen in his innovative portrayal of Mary and Jesus with colored skin (which was not yet permitted by the Catholic Church), and his goal was specifically to explore spirituality away from European materialism. While Lindauer worked within established religious artistic traditions, Gauguin deliberately challenged them in pursuit of new spiritual expression.","context":["5 January 1839|\nPilsen, Bohemia, now the Czech Republic\n|Died||13 June 1926\nWoodville, New Zealand\nCzech life and Austrian school\nHe was born Bohumír Lindauer in Plzeň (Pilsen), Western Bohemia, Austrian Empire (now part of the Czech Republic) His father Ignatz Lindauer was a gardener. His first drawing experience were plants and trees. From 1855 Lindauer studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, where he took classes of Leopold Kupelwieser, Josef Führich and Professor Rohl. To increase his chances on the market, he decided to change his name from the Czech Bohumír to the German translation of his name \"Gottfried\". From his studio in Pilsen he created paintings with religious themes for churches and painting frescoes in the Cathedral churches of Austria. His paintings attracted people, particularly the prominent people who were often the subjects of his paintings, including Bishop Jieschek, of Budweis, in Bohemia. After a sojourn in that city of eighteen months, he went to Moravia for three years.\nTo avoid being drafted to the Austrian military service he left for Germany and in 1874 boarded a boat to New Zealand. Many prominent Māori chiefs commissioned his work, which accurately records their facial tattoos, clothing, ornaments and weapons. A series of life-size portraits of Maori chiefs and warriors exhibited by Sir Walter Buller at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, 1886, were all from Lindauer's hand, who had made the \"Maori at home\" a subject of special study. One of these, a young Poi dancer without a facial tattoo, was so admired by the Prince of Wales that Buller gifted it to him. After visiting his native land in 1886-87, he settled down at Woodville, near Wellington, having shortly before married Rebecca, the daughter of Benjamin Prance Petty. Lindauer died in 1926 and is buried in the Old Gorge cemetery in Woodville.\n- Lindauer, the #1 New Zealand sparkling wine brand, is named after the artist.\n- See also C. F.

Gallery 825 of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\nWhat do you see? This painting contains five people. On the right is Mary with her naked child Jesus sitting in an odd pose on her shoulder. Both have a halo around their head and are looking at the viewer. Mary is wearing a red pareo (which is a dress that is wrapped around the middle or higher and is typical for people in Tahiti and the Cook Islands) wrapped around her with a hibiscus flower motif on it. On the left, you can see a female angel (probably representing the Archangel Gabriel) dressed in pink and with blue and yellow wings. The angel is partly hidden behind a flowering tree. The angel points out the presence of Mary and Jesus to the two Tahitian women on the purple path. These two women are dressed in a pareo from the waist down, and they fold their hands in devotion.\nIn the foreground is a collection of fruit laying on a fata, which is a wooden altar that Polynesians use to make offers to their gods. These fruits may be an analogy to the gifts that the three Magi brought to Jesus after his birth. The fruit includes red and yellow Tahitian bananas (some of which are in a wooden bowl) and the green breadfruit in the center. In the background, you can see the dark mountains, a lake, palm trees, and flowering bushes. There is a boathouse on the right side of the lake.\nWhat is Hail Mary? Also known as the Angelic Salutation or Ave Maria, Hail Mary is a prayer in the Catholic Church. The full text of this prayer is:\n“Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and in the hour of our death. Amen.”\nThis prayer is the most popular prayer aimed at Mary and asks for her help in intervening between the person praying and God.\nWho is Gauguin? Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin (1848-1903) is a Post-Impressionist artist who is known for his experimental use of colors. Vincent van Gogh and Edgar Degas were important for Gauguin in developing his unique style.\nIn 1891, Gauguin moved to Tahiti to start a new life. His idea was to set up a community of painters, called l’atelier des tropiques in an area that was far away from home and did not suffer from the materialism that was present in France. The main idea behind this initiative was to stimulate the role of spirituality in their artworks and to expose themselves to different cultures and religions.\nIn the end, no other painters joined him, and he left alone to Tahiti. However, this did not have a negative effect on the quality of Gauguin’s work, and he produced some of his best works during this period, including By the Sea (Fatata te Miti) in the National Gallery of Art and Spirit of the Dead Watching (Manao Tupapau) in the Albright–Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo.\nMost of Gauguin’s paintings are based on his imagination, and he expressed in a letter to his wife that he believed that his artistic center was in his mind and did not need to be inspired by other painters.\nFun fact: Gauguin did not have any models from Tahiti in front of him to paint this picture, but rather painted this based on his imagination and some other stimuli that he brought to Tahiti. For example, as Tahitians were not walking around half-naked, the two women in the middle are modeled after the figures of dancers on a bas-relief of the Javanese Borobudur temple of which he had brought a picture. Also, the pose of Jesus on top of Mary’s shoulder was based on a postcard that Gauguin bought during his trip to Tahiti. Moreover, Gauguin was one of the first artists to depict Mary and Jesus with a colored skin, something that was not allowed yet by the Catholic Church.\nWritten by Eelco Kappe"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9d96bc54-37fb-4dce-954f-b080bb993b9d>","<urn:uuid:d6725f10-a763-4445-a5d5-4445c879cb9a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the safety mechanisms in Q'Straint's Quantum system compare to the precision methods used in Mohs hardness testing?","answer":"Q'Straint's Quantum system employs automatic safety features including Bump 'n' Go technology that stops the arms if they encounter an obstacle, providing visual and audio alerts, plus constant adjustment of the arms' grip during transit and integration with the vehicle's interlock systems to prevent accidental release. In contrast, Mohs hardness testing is a more precise scientific measurement system using standardized minerals and specific testing methods - a pyramidal diamond needle is used to make controlled scratches, and the hardness is determined by comparing scratch results against 10 reference minerals in sequence from talc (softest at 1) to diamond (hardest at 10). While both systems prioritize accuracy, Quantum focuses on automated safety features while Mohs scale emphasizes precise measurement standards.","context":["Q’Straint’s Quantum leap\nFor the past 25 years Q’Straint has focused on the goal of developing the world’s most effective wheelchair passenger safety solutions for public and private transportation, a process that has seen it repeatedly create innovative product options. When I was invited to its Whitstable, Kent, headquarters with the promise of seeing a new product the company expects to revolutionise the wheelchair restraint market, it was an offer readily accepted.\nI was shown a video of CCTV footage that opened my eyes even further to the need for effective wheelchair and mobility scooter restraints on buses. The images taken inside a bus showed a gentleman in a wheelchair careering away from the wheelchair bay and tipping over. It was explained that the bus had merely turned a corner when the incident occurred, not even a particularly harsh manoeuvre. If, however unlikely, the wheelchair occupant was not physically harmed, it certainly would have created a lot of embarrassment, not just for the unfortunate wheelchair user but for the driver and the operator as well.\nIt was hearing of accidents like this that heightened Q’Straint’s determination to further develop in the area of wheelchair restraint equipment as it was clear that existing systems could be improved upon. Earlier this year it launched Quantum, which has been heralded as a truly innovative device for restraining wheelchairs. Described as the world’s first fully automatic rear facing wheelchair securement station, it is designed for fitment to virtually any bus as either original equipment or a retrofit.\nQuantum allows wheelchair users to position their chair in the bay and secure themselves in a stable and safe rear facing position without driver assistance. Once the wheelchair is centred against the backrest, the press of a button engages the automatic locking sequence. Two side arms descend, gripping the chair’s wheels. Q’Straint claim the process takes under 25 seconds and on the several demonstrations I was given, it certainly did work within that time frame. What is known as Bump ‘n’ Go technology is used, which means that when the arms close in to secure the chair, anything getting in their way will cause them to stop, with a visual and audio alert issued.\nOnce the arms are in place, a special compound is used in the rubber on the arms to achieve a secure grasp. If the chair moves whilst the vehicle is in transit, the arms constantly adjust to gain the best grip. Integration with the vehicle’s existing electrical and interlock systems should prevent accidental release while the bus is in motion. The press of the same button used to secure the chair also releases it when it is safe to do so.\nBefore launching Quantum, it was subject to a one year trial fitted to a bus in the US and Canada. The device was retrofitted to the vehicle, although it must be noted that it can be installed as OE. Q’Straint MD, Andy Cumming, told me that during this final scrutiny stage, there were a few very minor adjustments made to the system to finalise it.","Moh’s Scale of Hardness\nThere are two methods to measure the hardness of materials: scratch hardness and static load indentation hardness. Scratch hardness, also known as Mohs hardness, is a relative hardness and is rather rough.\nIt uses ten natural minerals as standards. The hardness order does not represent the absolute size of a particular mineral’s hardness, but indicates that a mineral of higher hardness order can scratch a mineral of lower order. The hardness of other minerals is determined by comparison with these standard minerals.\nThe unit of Mohs hardness is kilogram-force per square centimeter (kgf/cm²), denoted as [Pa]. It’s a standard for expressing a mineral’s hardness, first proposed in 1824 by German mineralogist Frederich Mohs. The hardness is represented by the depth of the scratch made on the surface of the tested mineral using the scratch method with a pyramid-shaped diamond needle.\nThe hardness scale is as follows: talc 1 (softest), gypsum 2, calcite 3, fluorite 4, apatite 5, orthoclase (also known as feldspar or periclase) 6, quartz 7, topaz 8, corundum 9, diamond 10 (hardest). Mohs hardness is also used to express the hardness of other solid materials.\nFor a more specific method: one would scratch the mineral to be tested against the standard hardness on the Mohs hardness scale to determine the hardness of the tested mineral.\nFor example, if a mineral can scratch calcite and be scratched by fluorite, then the hardness of that mineral is between 3 and 4. Alternatively, one can use a fingernail (hardness 2-2.5), a coin (hardness 3.5), or a small knife (hardness 5.5) to scratch the mineral in order to broadly determine its hardness.\n|Representative Mineral Names||Common Uses||Hardness Scale|\n|Talc, Graphite||Talc is the softest known mineral, commonly used in the form of talc powder.||1|\n|Skin, Natural Arsenic||1.5|\n|Nails, Amber, Ivory||2.5|\n|Gold, Silver, Aluminum||2.5~3|\n|Calcite, Copper, Pearls||Calcite can be used as carving material and industrial raw material.||3|\n|Fluorite (also known as Fluorspar)||Carving, Metallurgy, Building Materials||4|\n|Phosphorite||Phosphorus is an important component of biological cells; it is used as raw material in feed, fertilizer, and chemical production.||5|\n|Glass, Stainless Steel||5.5|\n|Orthoclase, Tanzanite, Pure Titanium||6|\n|Teeth (outer layer of crown)||The main component is hydroxyapatite.||6~7|\n|Soft Jade – Xinjiang Hetian Jade||6~6.5|\n|Pyrite||It is used as raw material for the production of sulfuric acid; gold refining; and can also be used in medicinal purposes.||6.5|\n|Hard Jade – Burmese Jadeite and Jade||6.5~7|\n|Quartz Glass, Amethyst||7|\n|Electric Stone, Zircon||7.5|\n|Quartz||According to the old hardness scale, quartz is rated as 7.||8|\n|Topaz, Chromium, Tungsten Steel||On the old hardness scale, topaz is rated as 8.||9|\n|Moissanite||Synthetic gems are 2.5 times brighter than diamonds and cost 1/10th of the price.||9.5|\n|Corundum||Corundum is rated as 9 on the old hardness scale. Natural gems such as rubies and sapphires are now considered types of corundum, as is the hardness of synthetic sapphire crystals.||12|\n|Diamond||Diamonds are rated as 10 on the old hardness scale, making them the hardest natural gem on earth.||15|\nWhat is Mohs Hardness?\nMohs Hardness is a standard that indicates the hardness of minerals, first proposed in 1824 by German mineralogist Friedrich Mohs. This standard is established by using a pyramid-shaped diamond drill to scratch the surface of a mineral, with the depth of the scratch indicating the hardness.\nThe hardness of a mineral refers to its ability to resist certain external mechanical forces such as scratching, indentation, or grinding. In mineralogy, the hardness often referred to is Mohs hardness, which is the scratch hardness compared to the Mohs hardness scale.\nThe Mohs hardness scale is based on ten minerals of different hardness, divided into ten levels from low to high: 1. Talc; 2. Gypsum; 3. Calcite; 4. Fluorite; 5. Apatite; 6. Orthoclase; 7. Quartz; 8. Topaz; 9. Corundum; 10. Diamond.\nIn use, standard minerals are scratched against minerals of unknown hardness. If the mineral can be scratched by apatite but not by fluorite, its hardness is determined to be between 4 and 5.\nThis method was established and named by German mineralogy professor Friedrich Mohs (1773-1839). However, accurate measurement of mineral hardness still requires a microhardness tester or hardness tester. Mineral hardness is also one of the physical properties of minerals. Minerals with high hardness have been widely used in industrial technology.\nDiamonds, corundum, and other minerals are not only used in industry, but also become precious gemstones. As gemstones, they usually have a high hardness.\nFor example, the hardness of opal is 5.5-6.5, quartz is 6.5-7, sphalerite is 7.5-8. Tsavorite is 8.5, and the hardness of sapphires and rubies is 9, second only to diamonds. People choose high-hardness minerals as gemstones, probably because they are wear-resistant, symbolizing their timeless value!\nAccording to needs, people have also developed a gem hardness scale to identify the mineral hardness of gemstones, from the softest to the hardest minerals: talc, gypsum, calcite, fluorite, apatite, zircon, corundum, silicon carbide, boron carbide, diamond, etc.\nWhen there is no standard hardness mineral, the simplest way to measure hardness is with a fingernail or a small knife. The hardness of a fingernail is 2.5, a copper coin is 3, and glass and a small knife are both 5. Those above 6 are almost all gemstone-like minerals."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ccca9166-6177-4ef7-a4ee-f95d96ca3e8a>","<urn:uuid:6f5dff6d-ddef-43d0-937c-cbff7f05f328>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do system interruptions impact facility operations during live construction, and what air quality considerations must be addressed?","answer":"System interruptions during live construction require careful coordination with system and process owners, as facilities often cannot be shut down. Critical considerations include getting buy-off from owners to modify systems, analyzing connections to piping and ductwork, and ensuring effective communication about anticipated interruptions. Regarding air quality, facilities must monitor construction activities that produce dust or odors, such as concrete saw-cutting, welding, painting, and gluing. This is especially important in facilities like food products, pharmaceuticals, and microprocessors, where air quality is crucial. Special attention must be paid to outside air intake locations and pressure relationships between areas within the facility and outdoors. Additionally, proper dust control methods must be implemented, as demonstrated by facilities using HEPA-filtered sweepers that can remove microscopic particulates and prevent dangerous dust from becoming airborne.","context":["Top 10 ways to streamline a 'live factory' project\nWhen designing a new project, consider these ten tips to evaluate whether you and your A/E are employing best practices\nWhen it comes to design and construction projects, the conventional design process is relatively straightforward: the client hires the firm, the client shares expectations and requirements for the project, the firm develops and refines the design, and the design is constructed. Client expectations are confined to satisfaction with the final constructed state as it relates to functionality and aesthetics.\nThe rules change when the facility is already built and operating and cannot be shut down for the sake of the project. While the objective of the project remains the same as in a conventional construction project—a functional, code-compliant design—the path to achieving a complete design and getting the project constructed under budget is far more complicated. This is especially so in large facilities that contain multiple exhaust streams and scores of gas, water, and chemical distribution systems—particularly when these processes and systems have an array of “owners.”\nFrom the perspective of designers and engineers, the difference between designing and constructing a brand-new facility versus designing and constructing for “live factory” projects is very important and can greatly impact the success of your project.\nSuccessful design and construction firms recognize the unique challenges inherent in taking on a significant project within an existing space. This article offers insights into these challenges and provides 10 great tips that can serve as a checklist of sorts to evaluate whether you and your A/E supplier are employing best practices on your new design project.\n1. Always be mindful that the A/E firm is a consultant accountable only to the project manager (PM). As the design is developed and the A/E interacts with stakeholders, new requirements and scope will be discovered, some more justified than the rest. The PM must decipher which of these elements should be incorporated into the project and determine the value of added design and construction costs.\n2. Do not underestimate project impacts to pipelines, electrical panels or equipment. Necessary work-arounds may require engineered designs, bypass piping, or ductwork. Temporary facilities or HVAC and/or a plan for partial plant or equipment shutdowns may also need to be provided.\n3. Keep the system owners in the loop. Generally, the purpose of projects is to upgrade or improve their systems. Being that they operate the systems, they can provide valuable insights for improvements or report system inadequacies. Sometimes projects can be oriented to be \"win-win\" by rectifying already existing issues at no incremental cost. System owners are also very aware of what commissioning the systems will entail. Can elements of what they need be incorporated into the design package?\n4. Field verification is crucial. Moving even small conduits, pipes or tubes in live factories can sometimes be impossible. Conflicts must be identified prior to releasing a design with foreknowledge that obstacles will be moved or the design will accommodate the obstacle in place. Diligence on the part of the A/E firm to identify conflicts between design elements and existing obstacles and decision making on the part of the facility's stakeholders to decide how to accommodate these conflicts in the design in a timely fashion is crucial to project success.\n5. When new equipment is being placed on a factory floor, consider move-in paths. Can the equipment physically get from the loading dock to its installation location in one piece? Equipment may have to be designed or ordered in pieces or scope may need to be included to clear a path.\n6. Interim conditions can be a crucial consideration. While the existing state works for the facility and the final constructed state also works, what about the state during construction? Is there room for the work-around and the new construction to exist simultaneously? Can the facility continue to operate between the taking down of a piece of old equipment and the installation of new equipment?\n7. Get buy-off from system and process owners during design development to shut down or modify systems. Sometimes the “obvious Plan A” is a no-go. For instance, the nearest available tie-in that can be used might be hundreds of feet further away than expected, which adds significant project cost. System and process owner input is crucial with these considerations.\n8. Analyze connections to piping and ductwork during design development. Some piping and ductwork materials or contents are not appropriate for hot-tapping either for engineering reasons, facility safety, or operational protocols. That said, if the design requires connecting to a system that doesn’t have an available connection and cannot be shut down, the facility is going to have to consent to the use of an existing connection or coordinate a shut-down of that system to make a tie-in.\n9. Focus design review sessions around the issue of system interruptions and associated ramifications. It is easy for an A/E to overestimate the effectiveness of communications within their client’s organization. Try to get system owners and process owners engaged in the discussion of anticipated system interruptions.\n10. Consider air quality requirements within the facility. Air quality can be an important concern to process owners at facilities that make food products, pharmaceuticals, microprocessors, etc. Concrete saw-cutting, welding, painting, gluing and roof work are just a few construction activities that produce dust or odors. Watch where outside air is taken in relative to these activities. Watch also for pressurization relationships between areas within the facility and outdoors.\nJulian Quist, PE, is a mechanical engineer with SSOE Group.","Your shopping cart is empty.\nMinimizing Silica Dust Exposure\nThe Wells Concrete plant in Albany, Minnesota designs, manufactures and installs a variety of structural and architectural precast wall panels. Workers pour insulated and solid concrete wall panels in a huge warehouse space of approximately 180,000 square feet.\nSilica is a natural substance found in materials common on construction sites, like concrete, rocks and sand. The dust created by cutting, grinding or drilling concrete products can contain respirable crystalline silica. Over time, exposure to these silica particles causes scarring in the lungs, which can harm your ability to breathe according to The American Lung Association.\nThe control of airborne silica dust is a constant challenge for industries that create the dust. And OSHA is insisting that employers ensure workers are safe and silica dust exposure is minimized. Companies need to comply with the new OSHA rule, part of which includes creating an Exposure Control Plan to demonstrate how they are implementing changes that move toward compliance.\nThe key to preventing silica exposure is to keep silica dust out of the air. That’s a tall order for a giant manufacturing site. Former methods like broom sweeping are neither efficient nor effective.\n“You can imagine, if someone were to ask you to clean your house with a toothbrush, that’s what it would be like when we use a floor broom to clean our factory,” says Ben Dalsing, Wells Concrete plant engineer. The OSHA rule prompted the Wells team to look to Tennant for a solution.\nTennant offers three types of dust control methods that can be used to support OSHA silica control housekeeping requirements. As Tennant was developing its offerings, they needed a location to test their HEPA-enabled sweeper and Wells decided dry sweeping with HEPA filtration was an ideal solution for them. “Tennant wanted a testing grounds for a machine with a HEPA filter, and I graciously offered our factory as a very dusty environment,” explains Dalsing.\nThe Tennant S30 is a versatile and durable mid-sized industrial sweeper with a three-stage primary filter system, plus the option of a 4th stage HEPA dust filter.\n“A HEPA filter has a special filter media that can clean to a very high standard by removing microscopic particulate from the air,” says Mat Segar, Tennant Current Products Engineer for Sustainability. The S30 with HEPA filtration sweeper has been in testing for over 60 days and has picked up over 9 tons of dust and debris. Segar goes on to say, “the impressive thing is that the primary filter system is so effective that the HEPA filter has only gained a little over a pound and a half of debris within that timeframe.”\nBased on the Wells testing, the HEPA filter should last at least six months, possibly up to a year depending on the customer’s application. Proper usage and maintenance practices will help increase the effectiveness of the machine’s filtration stages and the life of the HEPA filter up to six months, perhaps longer.\nWells Safety Manager Mike Frieler measures the dust in the air at the plant and says he’s seen improvement with the new sweeping system. “It’s a lot cleaner than just a broom and a dustpan. It contains the dust within the filters, so you don’t have it floating in the air and people breathing it in. A lot better than the old way,\" says Frieler.\n“The act of pushing a broom kicks dust up into the air. And that’s one thing that OSHA doesn’t want anymore. So we’re using the Tennant sweeper to capture the dust and debris,” says plant engineer Dalsing.\nThe Tennant S30 not only helps create a healthier environment for workers, it’s more efficient too. “I’m estimating that it takes between ten and fifteen hours of pushing a broom to clean our entire factory, and the Tennant machine can do that in anywhere between a half hour to an hour and a half,” Dalsing states.\n“This will allow you to have one operator be much more efficient, do the same amount of cleaning in a very short period of time, where you can free up operators to do other things,” says product engineer Segar.\nWhile it was the OSHA regulation that encouraged Wells to seek a healthier cleaning option, the company is committed to keeping its workers safe. “As a company you invest in your employees, so if you’re not taking care of your employees, you’re not going to have a company,” says Safety Manager Frieler."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:434a5968-4b63-48c1-b85e-82518b2ff55c>","<urn:uuid:50d73dfc-1d6a-4b4a-bc6f-1a5f2b2c73a2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which tool requires more technical expertise: V-Ray's sky system or Luminar's AI Sky Replacement?","answer":"V-Ray's sky system requires significantly more technical expertise than Luminar's AI Sky Replacement. V-Ray users need to understand and manually adjust multiple technical parameters such as Intensity Multiplier, Size Multiplier, Turbidity, Ozone values, and Caustic Subdivisions to achieve desired results. In contrast, Luminar 4's AI Sky Replacement is designed for simplicity, automatically handling complex tasks like sky masking and edge detection, even with detailed treelines. As stated in the documents, the process in Luminar can be completed in five simple steps, while similar sky replacement tasks in other systems (like the V-Ray approach) often require 'a good deal of skill, patience and expertise.'","context":["This page provides information on the V-Ray Sun Light and V-Ray Sky.\nThe V-Ray Sun and V-Ray Sky are special features which are provided by the V-Ray renderer. Developed to work together, the V-Ray Sun and V-Ray Sky reproduce the real-life Sun and Sky environment of the Earth. Both are coded so that they change their appearance depending on the direction of the V-Ray Sun. The direction of the Sun is marked with an arrow in the Rhino viewport.\nThe V-Ray Sun and Sky are based largely on the SIGGRAPH '99 paper \"A Practical Analytic Model for Daylight\" by A. J. Preetham, Peter Shirley, Brian Smits. For a more complete list of references, please see the References and links section.\nThe Sun is commonly used in ArchVis projects. If the project default settings are set to ArchVis through vrayChangeDefaultScene command, the Sun has to be turned on.

The intensity of the light no longer depends on the position of V-Ray Sun in the sky. Instead, intensity is controlled through the Intensity Multiplier.\nOverride – Sets the color of V-Ray sun to the color in the Filter Color parameter. The intensity of the light still depends on the position of V-Ray Sun in the sky.\nIntensity Multiplier – Affects the brightness of the sun and can be used to reduce the default brightness. See Notes for more information.\nSize Multiplier – Affects the visible size of the sun. This includes the appearance of the sun disc as seen by the camera and of the reflections, as well as the blurriness of the sun shadows.\nSky Model – Specifies the procedural model that is used to generate V-Ray Sky texture.\nPreetham et al. – V-Ray Sky procedural texture is generated based on the Preetham et al. method.\nCIE Clear – V-Ray Sky procedural texture is generated based on the CIE method for clear sky.\nCIE Overcast – V-Ray Sky procedural texture is generated based on the CIE method for cloudy sky.\nHosek et al. – V-Ray Sky procedural texture is generated based on the Hosek et al. method.\nHorizon Illum. – Specifies the intensity (in lx) of the illumination on horizontal surfaces coming from the sky.\nTurbidity – Determines the amount of dust in the air and affects the color of the sun and sky. Smaller values produce a clear, blue sky and sun as seen in rural areas, while larger values make them yellow and orange as seen in big cities.\nOzone – Affects the color of the light. Values closer to 0.0 make the sunlight yellow, and values closer to 1.0 make it blue.\nAlbedo Color – Sets the ground color of the V-Ray Sun and Sky system.\nBlend Angle – Specifies the angle in degrees where blending occurs between the horizon line and sky. Values close to 0.0 produce a sharper horizon line, while larger values produce a softer horizon line.\nHorizon Offset – Allows the user to manually lower the horizon line.\nExample: The Size Multiplier Parameter\nCommon settings in this example are Turbidity: 3.0. This example demonstrates the effect of the Size multiplier parameter. Notice how changes in this parameter affect both the visible sun size and the shadow softness (however overall illumination strength remains the same).\nExample: The Turbidity Parameter\nThis example is done with the default Sun settings, except for the Blend Angle: 10. It demonstrates the effect of the Turbidity parameter. Generally, it controls the amount of dust particles in the air. Notice how larger values cause the sun and the sky to become yellowish, while smaller values make the sky clear.\nExample: The Intensity Multiplier Parameter\nCommon settings in this example are Turbidity: 3.0, Size Multiplier: 1.0, EV: 14,48 (default).\nExample: Ozone Value\nThe default Sun settings are used for this example. The Ozone parameter affects only the color of the light emitted by the sun. Notice how the 0 value gives an overall yellowish contribution of the light to the scene, while a value of 1 is in the blue spectrum.\nInvisible – When enabled, the sun becomes invisible to both the camera and reflections. This is useful to prevent bright speckles on glossy surfaces where a ray with low probability hits the extremely bright Sun disk.\nShadows – When enabled (the default), the Sun casts shadows. When disabled, the light does not cast shadows.\nAffect Diffuse – When enabled, the V-Ray Sun affects the diffuse properties of the materials.\nAffect Specular – When enabled, the V-Ray Sun affects the specular of the materials.\nCaustic Subdivisions – Determines the number of caustic photons emitted from the light source. Lower values mean more noisy results but render faster. Higher values produce smoother results but take more time.\nPhoton Emit Radius – Defines the area around the V-Ray Sun from where the photons are shot.\nBy default, the V-Ray Sun and V-Ray Sky are very bright. In the real world, the average solar irradiance is about 1000 W/m^2 (see the References below). Since the image output in V-Ray is in W/m^2/sr, you will typically find that the average RGB values produced by the sun and the sky are about 200.0-300.0 units. This is quite correct from a physical point of view, but is not enough for a nice image. Using the VRayPhysicalCamera with suitable values also produces a correct result without changing the sun and sky parameters.\nHere is a list of links and references about the V-Ray Sun and Sky implementation, as well as general information about the illumination of the Sun.\n A.J.

It does a job that photographers have been doing manually for a very long time, and it does it so effectively that it almost feels like cheating.\nYou can replace skies in Photoshop and other image editors, of course, but it often requires a good deal of skill, patience and expertise. If you have a nice, uncomplicated horizon line it’s not too difficult, but if you have a highly detailed treeline or city skyline, with lots of fine edges, gaps and ‘holes’, making a perfect selection can be so time-consuming that eventually it’s easier to give up.\nLuminar’s AI Sky Replacement tool changes that complicated process.\nIt can automatically identify and separate the sky area in your original image. This is impressive enough, but it can also mask the sky area so effectively that it’s actually quite difficult to find any faults in the selection. AI Sky Replacement follows even the most detailed treelines perfectly and finds the gaps between trees that a regular Magic Wand tool would miss. There are sliders for fine-tuning the results to make the masking even better, but you usually don’t need them.\nTo make replacement skies look how you want them to, so they truly feel like part of the shot, you need to pay attention to the lighting, the colours and the exposure. We’ll show how this process works, and how a few simple tricks and techniques can make a big difference to the final result.\nHow to replace a sky in five simple steps\nTurn a regular daytime photo into a surreal nightscape!\n1. The Luminar layout\nFirst, select Luminar’s Edit panel. This shows a set of four icons for the four main filter panels, over on the far right of the screen: Essentials, Creative, Portrait and Professional. If you’ve used Luminar 3 or earlier versions, these are equivalent to the old Luminar preset workspaces. The AI Sky Replacement filter lives in the Creative section.\n2. AI Sky Replacement panel\nThe AI Sky Replacement panel has three sections. Use Sky Selection to choose a new sky and make basic adjustments. Advanced Settings shows additional options for refining your results. You won’t need Advanced Settings on every image – the results are usually really good right from the start – but they can help you get a better blend.\n3. Choose your sky\nIf you click the Sky Selection dropdown menu, you’ll see a long list of replacement skies that come with Luminar 4. Just pick a sky and see what it looks like. At first, the novelty of having a new sky added perfectly to your photo can distract you from the details, but it is important to find a sky that harmonises with your photo.\n4. Turn day into night!\nDon’t be afraid to try something dramatic. The ‘Galaxy’ and ‘Starry Night’ skies in Luminar 4 are amazing, and they can work really well with regular daytime photos. Here we’re going to use the ‘Galaxy 2’ sky to turn a dull overcast travel shot into a glittering night time scene. It looks pretty good already...\n5. Finishing touches\nThis is where the sliders in the AI Sky Replacement panel can help. One of the most useful is the Relight Scene slider: this progressively applies the replacement sky’s tones and colours to the rest of the image to produce a much more natural blend. We didn’t quite like the way the ‘galaxy’ was hidden behind the temple, so we used the Flip checkbox to flip the sky over. Finally, we increased the Sky Exposure to make the image brighter.\nThe AI Sky Replacement panel\nYour guided tour of the tools you can use to swap out your skies…\n1. Choose a sky\nLuminar 4 can add any sky you like, but try to choose one that harmonises with the scene. You choose the sky you want to use from this dropdown menu, but you can also insert a sky image you’ve shot yourself.\n2. Horizon Blending\nIf the join at the horizon looks unnatural, you can soften it with the Horizon Blending slider, just one of a number of tools for making sky replacements look more natural.\n3. Relight Scene\nThe original photo had a cooler tone than the sky we used, so we used the Relight Scene slider: this gradually shifts the tones and colours of your original photo to match those of the sky you’ve added.\n4. Advanced Settings\nYou may not need the Advanced Settings section at all, but it’s here if you need it, and it can be handy. We’ve used some of the Advanced Settings options to give the sky a darker, warmer tone and a little atmospheric haze to blend it into the photo.\n5. Sky Defocus\nSky Defocus slider is handy for close-ups or portraits with blurred backgrounds. We haven’t used the Flip Sky option below, but it can be used to flip skies horizontally for better positioning.\n6. Edit Mask\nThis picture works well without a mask adjustment, but these can be useful for subtler blends. If you want to make the sky paler near the horizon, use the Edit Mask button and add a gradient mask.\nThree great Sky Replacement examples\nHere are more Sky Replacement experiments we did in Luminar 4\nSometimes black-and-white is the perfect medium for dramatic skies. We created this photo by using a dramatic sky of our own, then adding a new Adjustment Layer (see our tips below) to apply a ready-made Luminar black-and-white Look. You can use other adjustments freely alongside the AI Sky Replacement tool.\nThis sunset effect was created using one of Luminar’s ‘Sunset’ replacement skies, with the Relight Scene slider turned up to maximum to spread the yellow glow across the image. We added a vignette to exaggerate the lighting, and applied Luminar’s Sun Rays filter to produce the appearance of rays from the setting sun.\nFrom a photographic point of view, flat blue skies can be almost as boring as dull grey overcast, so we decided to replace the blue sky in this scene with a more stormy version. The new sky needed a subtler gradation towards the horizon, so we used the Edit Mask button in the AI Sky Replacement filter panel (see the tips below).\nFive great tips for enhancing skies with AI Sky Replacement\nSometimes you can get lucky and find a replacement sky that blends with\nyour image perfectly first time out. Often, though, you need to spend a little time getting exactly the right sky and combining it with a few tweaks and adjustments. Here are a few ideas for getting your sky replacements to come out exactly as you imagined them – and you can do them all very easily in Luminar.\n1. Collect pictures of skies\nLuminar 4.1 comes with a wide selection of skies you can drop straight into your images, but it’s just as easy to add your own – so start taking photos of skies you like and save them.\n2. Add Looks to layers\nSometimes you need a little something to bring your new sky and your image together visually, and Looks are a great way to do it. Add an Adjustment Layer and choose a Look that complements your picture.\n3. Match the lighting\nPay attention to the lighting in the original scene, then try to find a sky that matches it. Here, the position of the sun in the sky matches the way the light is falling on the landscape below.\n4. Add a vignette\nIf you’re adding a dark sky to a bright scene, it can be hard to balance the brightness. One quick and easy solution is to apply a vignette, as the edge-darkening effect helps draw the image together.\n5. Blend with a gradient\nIn nature, skies have a lighter tone near the horizon, and a replacement sky won’t always have that. Click the Edit Mask button to add a gradient mask that blends in the replacement sky more gradually.\nHow to get a copy of Skylum Luminar 4\nIf you don’t have Luminar 4 already, you can download a free 14-day trial from the Skylum website.

Basel Action Network (BAN)’s e-Stewards certification ensures that certified recycling operations will not drop off their e-waste to third-world countries and will properly remove and dispose of dangerous substances in electronics like mercury and lead.\nStaples to the e-rescue —\nIf you can’t find a local recycling event or municipal drive that ethically recycles e-waste, drop by your local Staples as they are an e-Stewards certified location and will securely recycle your unwanted e-waste at no cost. Browse their site to view their list of items accepted for recycling.","Living Green Hawaii | Which Light Bulb Is Right?\nHow to choose “watt” bulb to buy? It’s becoming a real issue for green living as the options have grown.\nCFLs are available in different sizes to fit your fixtures and allow for ample air flow. Note that not all CFLs are designed to be used in damp or wet locations, so read the manufacturer’s label.

{"question":"What are the potential hazards of reflected laser light, and what precision-enhancing features are available in modern laser equipment?","answer":"Laser light reflections can occur in two forms: diffuse reflections, which scatter light in all directions and pose lower risk, and specular reflections, which mirror nearly 100% of the original light and are more dangerous. To enhance precision while managing these risks, modern equipment like the Sears Laser Trac drill press incorporates features such as laser cross-hairs that project onto the work surface for exact drill bit alignment. The system includes a chuck-mounted green beam laser head that requires minimal maintenance beyond battery replacement and can be precisely adjusted through dedicated adjustment screws for perfect vertical and horizontal alignment.","context":["Sears offers two “Laser Trac” drill press models, a 10-inch bench-mounted machine equipped with a 1/2-inch chuck, and a 15-inch floor-mounted unit fitted with a 5/8-inch chuck. Both tools shoot laser cross-hairs onto the work surface for precise drill bit alignment. Apart from replacing two AA batteries from time to time, after initial adjustment the chuck-mounted green beam laser head is virtually maintenance-free.\nUse a thin piece of fine-grained hardwood with a smooth surface to act as a test piece. Adjust a draftsman’s compass and scribe an approximately 1/8-inch diameter circle on the wood. This way the pinhole left by the compass will designate the center of the circle.\nAs a safety measure, unplug the machine's power cord before starting work. Place the test piece on the drill press table and adjust the table height so that the distance between the surface of the wood and the bottom of the chuck is 5 inches.\nInsert a 1/8-inch or 3 mm drill bit in the chuck and tighten it. Crank the handle counterclockwise and adjust the drill press quill (height adjustment) until the tip of the drill bit is just above the surface of the test piece.\nAlign the test piece so that the drill bit is centered fore, aft and sideways in the circle with the tip lined up with the pin hole. Once aligned, clamp the test piece to the table.\nRaise the chuck back to full height and turn on the laser by pressing the rocker switch. Once lit, verify that the bisecting lines resembling cross hairs are centered on the pinhole in the middle of the circle. If the alignment is off, switch the laser off and go to the next step.\nLower the quill and locate the two 1/4-inch diameter laser beam adjustment screws on each side on top of the laser head; each adjustment screw is flanked by two smaller clamping screws. Use a thin flat head screwdriver to loosen the four clamping screws by one full turn each.\nSwitch the laser on. Adjust the vertical beam left or right by turning the upper laser beam adjustment screw nearest the rocker switch by no more than 1/8 turn each way until the vertical beam of the cross hair lines is centered on the pinhole in the middle of the scribed circle. To adjust the front to back horizontal beam alignment, turn the adjustment screw located on the side of the laser head opposite the rocker switch left or right by no more than 1/8 turn until the horizontal beam bisects the middle of the circle forming a cross hair image centered on the pinhole.\nTighten the four clamping screws securely once you’re satisfied with your final adjustment. After this is done, restore power to the drill press by plugging the power cord back into the wall socket.\nThings You Will Need\n- Fine-grained hardwood test piece\n- Draftsman’s compass\n- 1/8-inch or 3 mm drill bit\n- Thin flat head screwdriver\n- Handle the laser with care while assembling the drill press. Never shine the laser beam into your eyes or point it at another person after loading the batteries and switching the unit on to test it. Once mounted and adjusted, turn the laser off when preparing to drill a hole through bright shiny metal, Plexiglas or similar reflective surfaces. If the laser is switched on during this type of operation, the beam could bounce off the surface into the eyes of the operator or someone standing nearby and cause serious injury.\n- Jupiterimages/Photos.com/Getty Images","With the constant changes coming to the industrial and manufacturing sectors, and advanced equipment like laser marking systems becoming increasingly prevalent, it’s more important than ever to be aware of laser marking safety procedures.\nThese procedures range from ways to protect from bodily harm while utilizing laser marking systems to ways to avoid electrical dangers on the factory floor. It’s important to know what all of these dangers are and how to train yourself and your staff in essential laser safety.\nCommon Laser Hazards\nOne aspect to remember about laser marking safety is the variety of hazards associated with the systems which are also prevalent in many other forms of equipment. Basic safety training should mean workers are already familiar with some of these issues, but employers should be aware of:\n- High voltage\n- Compressed gasses\n- Intense radio frequency energy\nLet’s take a look at each of these individually:\n- For concerns regarding high voltage, it’s important to know that pulsed CO2 lasers can produce internal voltages exceeding 25,000 volts while containing large capacitors that can deliver in excess of 200 Joules of energy.\n- Some pulsed lasers also utilize a flowing gas design, which requires connection to a cylinder of compressed gas. Most of the gases used for laser systems are extremely safe, though since pressurized cylinders can pose a risk, their transportation and usage should occur only when the cylinders are properly restrained.\n- As for radio frequency energy, severe burns can result from the improper servicing of units which use RF generators, such as sealed CO2 lasers. Anyone servicing such units should be trained in the unit’s safety procedures, and the connections for RF energy should not be touched during operation.\nDue to the laser engraving safety checks in place for marking systems, units are designed in such a way to prevent operators from coming into direct contact with the laser beam.\nOne of the issues that can arise, however, involves unintentional reflected light, which falls into the following categories:\n- Diffuse Reflections – This type of reflection occurs when a reflective surface’s irregularities create a scattering of light in all directions. Of the types of reflections, this is the safer of the two since energy is being divided in many directions and weakened.\n- Specular Reflections – This type of reflection is produced in a way that is more mirror-like, recreating close to 100% of the original light compared to the scattered light of diffuse reflections. Though there is a higher danger associated with this form, it is much less common and laser marking systems are often designed to eliminate specular reflective surfaces that would come across the beam’s path.\nWith proper safety procedures in place, and by following guidelines which accompany your laser marking systems, these hazards should be greatly minimized.\nSkin and Eye Hazards\nDue to laser engraving safety checks in place, the effects of lasers on skin are usually considered of secondary importance. Compared to laser marking and engraving systems, high powered infrared lasers utilized in applications for welding and cutting pose a much greater risk of injury.\nSome potential effects that can occur if safety procedures are not followed include mild reddening, blistering, and charring, all of which are usually reversible or repairable. Other potential issues could include ulceration, scarring of the skin, depigmentation and damage to underlying organs.\nIn regards to eye safety, some forms of laser beams operate at a wavelength which if exposed to the eye can pass beyond to the retina. With no pain indicators present and the beam being invisible, someone exposed can be unaware at the time of occurrence.\nThis is just another reason why utilizing industry-standard laser safety glasses is so vital to maintaining a safe and healthy workspace.\nAn additional hazard that can be posed when using laser systems is that of electrical shocks. Some of the ways shocks can occur is through contact with:\n- Exposed utility power utilization\n- Device controls\n- Power supply conductors operating at potentials of 50+ volts\nOperators and service workers for laser marking systems must be especially careful to avoid these dangers by following standard safety protocols. These hazards could be experienced during:\n- Set-up and installation\n- Maintenance and service\n- Troubleshooting, if equipment protective covers are removed\nThe electrical injuries that can be sustained from improper and haphazard use of laser systems can include everything from a slight tingle to serious bodily injury to death. To avoid accidental contact with these energized conductors, laser marking units utilize a barrier system within the equipment.\nIn the United States, laser systems are overseen by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), which is a component of the FDA. Depending upon the risk of a specific type of laser, it is graded from Class I to Class IV. Laser marking lasers tend to be graded as Class IV lasers, making laser marking safety all the more important.\nTwo important additional classifications to keep in mind are the Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) and Nominal Hazard Zone (NHZ) designations.\n- Maximum Permissible Exposure – This is the highest level of laser radiation an individual can be exposed to without receiving harmful physical effects to the eye or skin. Control measures for laser marking systems are in place to ensure any laser radiation emitted falls below the MPE.\n- Nominal Hazard Zone – To create conditions for flexibility in laser marking applications, the laser beam of the unit is often not fully enclosed for practicality reasons. In these instances, it is necessary to define an area of potentially hazardous laser radiation, which is the NHZ. Control measures are then put into place for this area to ensure safety during use of the laser system.\nBeing fully aware of these classifications and their rationales are vital to ensuring proper workplace laser marking safety.\nLearn More About Laser Engraving Safety Today\nFor a more detailed look at laser marking safety information, be sure to visit our laser safety manual, which includes graphics, information about warning labels, and procedural controls to utilize.\nAnd if you have further questions for our team, or would like to know more about our premier line of laser marking systems, be sure to contact us today.\nLaser marking and engraving has a wide variety of applications for businesses and hobbyists, with everything from the medical field to the everyday carry subculture and more getting real benefits from laser marked parts.\nAt TYKMA Electrox, we design and manufacture industrial laser marking machines for applications across an array of industries.

{"question":"How does genetics affect life expectancy, and what recent discoveries about gene length influence aging?","answer":"Genetics determines about 25% of human life span variation, with variants in genes like APOE, FOXO3, and CETP being associated with longevity. These genes are involved in cellular functions like DNA repair, telomere maintenance, and protection from free radicals. Recent scientific analysis has revealed that DNA length is directly related to biological age, with shorter genes associated with shorter lifespans and longer genes linked to better health and longevity. As people age, activity within cells shifts to shorter genes, disturbing the balance. However, people with very long genes have longer proteins available in cells, which helps counterbalance this effect.","context":["I think we can all agree it’s a great time to be alive! While the days of yesteryear were a simpler time, modern technology has added a wealth of knowledge regarding overall health.\nData from the National Vital Statistics System shows that in 2017:\n· Life expectancy at age 65 for the total population was 19.5 years, an increase of 0.1 years from 2016.\n· Life expectancy for females was consistently higher than it was for males, increasing 0.1 years from 4.9 years in 2016 to 5.0 years.\n· The infant mortality rate (IMR) changed from 587.0 infant deaths per 100,000 live births in 2016 to 579.3 in 2017.\n(The IMR – a ratio of infant deaths to live births in a given year – is generally regarded as a good indicator of the overall health of a population.)\nHowever, while life expectancy has increased through the years, some factors play into the equation, including human behavior, environment, living standards, health education, and genetics.\nLifeGuide’s Life Expectancy Calculator uses 3,000 unique points to help you understand how long you might expect to live and what can be done to help you beat the odds. Depending on the calculator’s results, you should consider making lifestyle changes in different areas:\nSmoking – We know lighting up is terrible for our health. Research shows that smoking reduces life expectancy by seven to eight years. On average, each cigarette shortens your life anywhere from seven to eleven minutes. In other words, the time it takes you to smoke a cigarette equals the time that cigarette takes off of your life. (1)\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that being in the presence of a spouse, parent or coworker who smokes causes about 3,000 lung cancer deaths each year. As a smoker, someone living with you has a 30% increased chance of getting lung cancer or having a heart attack. (2)\nEnvironmental tobacco smoke is the third leading cause of preventable death in this country. It kills approximately 53,000 nonsmokers each year through heart disease. For every eight smokers who die from cigarettes, so does one nonsmoker. (3)\nDiet – Research continues to underline the impact food has on our overall health. Americans whose diets include fresh, whole foods like fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, lean meats, and fish have a lower incidence of significant chronic disease and especially of diet-related diseases.\nAccording to the Center for Disease Control, over a third of the U.S. adult population is obese. Unfortunately, the standard American diet is heavy in saturated fats, partially-hydrogenated oils, refined carbohydrates, and highly processed foods. This diet, in combination with a sedentary lifestyle, large portion sizes, and high stress, is blamed for the increase in obesity and associated diseases in the U.S. (4)\nA healthy diet includes lots of fruit, vegetables, whole grains and a moderate amount of unsaturated fats, meat, and dairy. Having a good variety of these foods every day leaves less room for foods that are high in fat and sugar (a leading cause of weight gain).\nTogether with exercise, eating a healthy diet in the right proportions can also help you lose weight, lower your cholesterol levels and blood pressure, and decrease your risk of type 2 diabetes.\nExercise – Being active is one of the best ways to keep your body healthy. Exercise also can improve your overall well-being and quality of life. Regular activity helps the body maintain strength, stamina, and ability to function correctly. Exercise increases muscle strength, which in turn increases your ability to do other physical activities.\nRemember: Life expectancy is trending upward. People who are physically active and at a healthy weight live about seven years longer than those who are not active and are obese. The important part is to make those extra years generally healthier years! Staying active helps delay or prevent chronic illnesses and diseases associated with aging. Active adults maintain their quality of life and independence longer as they age.\nThirty minutes of exercise five times a week combined with a healthy diet is a winning combination. However, do not exercise heavily or eat right before bedtime! Sleep also is essential to your health. Quality sleep at the right times will help protect your mental health, physical health, and quality of life.\nEnvironmental improvements beginning in the 1900s extended the average life span dramatically with significant improvements in the availability of food and clean water, better housing and living conditions, reduced exposure to infectious diseases, and access to medical care.\nMost significant were public health advances that reduced premature death by decreasing the risk of infant mortality, increasing the chances of surviving childhood, and avoiding infection and communicable disease. (5)\nHowever, poor environmental quality has its most significant impact on people whose health status is already at risk. Preventing exposure to environmental hazards and education are essential resources for responding to disease and monitoring for hazards.\nAccording to the U.S. Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, among the most critical factors to help increase the quality of life are:\nDecreasing air pollution is an essential step in creating a healthy environment. Poor air quality contributes to premature death, cancer, and long-term damage to respiratory and cardiovascular systems.\nProtecting water sources and minimizing exposure to contaminated water sources are important parts of environmental health.\nReducing exposure to toxic substances and hazardous wastes is fundamental to environmental health.\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services notes that genetics, the environment, and lifestyle influence longevity. Now people in the United States live about 80 years on average, but some individuals survive for much longer.\nThe study of longevity genes is a developing science. Genetics determines about 25 percent of the variation in human life span -- but which genes, and how they contribute to longevity, are not well understood.\nA few of the common variations (called polymorphisms) associated with long lifespans are in the APOE, FOXO3, and CETP genes, but they are not in all individuals with exceptional longevity. It is likely that variants in multiple genes, some of which are unidentified, act together to contribute to a long life. (6)\nSome of the gene variants that contribute to a long life are involved with the necessary maintenance and function of the body’s cells. These cellular functions include DNA repair, maintenance of the ends of chromosomes (regions called telomeres), and protection of cells from damage caused by unstable oxygen-containing molecules (free radicals).\nOther genes associated with blood fat (lipid) levels, inflammation, and the cardiovascular and immune systems contribute significantly to longevity because they reduce the risk of heart disease (the leading cause of death in older people), stroke, and insulin resistance.\nIt is essential to note researchers have found that long-lived individuals share similarities that reflect their lifestyles – many are nonsmokers, are not obese, and cope well with stress. (Also, most are women.)\nBecause of their healthy habits, these older adults are less likely to develop age-related chronic diseases, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, than their same-age peers.\nWith longer lifespans, it is important to be confident that your retirement funds will last as long as you do.

Each chain of nucleotides translates into an amino acid, forming a protein.\nTherefore, a very long gene results in a large protein and a short gene results in a small protein. A cell must have a balanced number of small and large proteins to achieve homeostasis, and problems arise when this balance is out of whack.\nIn the study, the researchers looked at genetic data from several large datasets, including the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project, a tissue bank funded by the National Institutes of Health that archives samples from human donors for the purpose of research.\nThe research team first analyzed tissue samples from mice, rats and killifish of various ages.\nIn all the animals, the researchers noticed subtle changes in thousands of different genes across the samples.\nThis means that it’s not just a small subset of genes that contribute to aging. Aging, on the contrary, is characterized by changes at the systems level.\nThis view differs from mainstream biological approaches that study the effects of single genes.\nSince the advent of modern genetics in the early 20th century, many researchers expected to be able to attribute many complex biological phenomena to single genes.\nAnd although some diseases, such as hemophilia, result from mutations in a single gene, the narrow approach to studying single genes has yet to lead to explanations for the myriad changes that occur in neurodegenerative diseases and aging.\nAfter completing their animal research, the researchers turned to humans. They looked at changes in human genes from ages 30 to 49, 50 to 69, and then 70+.\nMeasurable changes in gene activity as a function of gene length have already occurred by the time humans reach middle age.\n“It already seems like something is going on early in life, but it becomes more pronounced with age,” Dr. Stoeger said.\nMen age FASTER than women, study finds\nMen technically age faster than women, experts say.\nAnti-aging researchers have found that men in their 50s are biologically four years older than their female counterparts, on average.\nAnd the gap already exists in your twenties, according to the first study of its kind.\nScientists compared the chronological age of thousands of volunteers – the number of birthdays they had – to their biological age.\nThis was done using tests that estimate body decline based on subtle markers attached to our DNA.\n“It seems that, from an early age, our cells are able to counter disturbances that would lead to an imbalance in gene activity. Then, suddenly, our cells can no longer counter it.\nLuis Amaral of Northwestern, lead author of the study, said: “The result for humans is very strong because we have more samples for humans than for other animals.”\n“It was also interesting because all the mice we studied are genetically identical, of the same sex and raised in the same laboratory conditions, but humans are all different.\n“They all died of different causes and at different ages. We analyzed male and female samples separately and found the same pattern.\nBut scientists have found that as we age, activity within cells shifts to shorter genes, upsetting the balance.\nThis is counterbalanced in people with very long genes, as they have longer proteins available in cells.\nDr Stoeger said: ‘Changes in gene activity are very, very small, and those small changes involve thousands of genes.\n“We found that this change was consistent across different tissues and across different animals.”\nScientists hope the study – published in Nature Aging – will spur the development of therapies to slow or reverse aging.\nCurrently, drugs target the symptoms rather than the causes of aging, which North West experts say is like using painkillers to reduce fever.\nDr Amaral said: “Fevers can occur for very many reasons. It can be caused by an infection, which requires antibiotics to cure, or caused by appendicitis, which requires surgery.\n” Here, it’s the same thing. The problem is the imbalance of gene activity. If you can help correct the imbalance, then you can deal with the downstream consequences.\n#Scientists #Unravel #Mystery #Aging #Gene #Length #Decisive #Factor"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:332e9ca5-b0b5-4476-977c-c5967d0a7caf>","<urn:uuid:e80e55d6-d00a-46cc-9e88-8d10ed8a5eda>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between how elite culture and folk culture are transmitted in Louisiana, particularly when examining traditional music and cooking practices?","answer":"Elite culture and folk culture in Louisiana are transmitted through fundamentally different mechanisms. Elite culture, including forms like opera and theater, is formally learned through established institutions such as museums, concert halls, and universities. In contrast, folk culture, which includes traditional music and cooking practices, is passed down informally through word of mouth, observation, and imitation within families and communities. For example, many people learn traditional cooking methods by watching relatives rather than through formal education. This distinction is evident in Louisiana's musical traditions, where folk music like traditional Cajun music is learned through informal community settings, while elite musical forms would be taught in formal institutional settings. These transmission patterns reflect the broader cultural characteristics of Louisiana's folklife, where traditional practices are preserved through generational learning within specific folk groups.","context":["to beginning our adventure into the cuisines of South Louisiana, it\nis imperative that I begin by outlining the basic principles, procedures\nand terminologies that are unique to Cajun and Creole cookery.\nIt is important to realize that cultures and cuisines must constantly\nevolve. This evolution process is brought about when new ingredients\nand ideas are introduced into a region. Here in South Louisiana,\nthe evolution process may be witnessed at every turn. The Cajuns\ntoday have more access to the outside world because of increased\nmobility and as interstates began to cross the bayous, cities arose\nfrom our swamplands. An example of this process of change is the\nmerging of cultures in New Orleans.\nToday it is difficult even for the locals to tell the Cajuns from\nthe Creoles. However, we all agree that evolution is imperative,\nif our cultures and cuisines are to survive.\nThough we will look into this evolution of Louisiana cuisines,\nI feel it is necessary to first understand from whence it came.\nKnowing the foundation of Cajun and Creole cooking will ensure a\nclear understanding of the direction we have chosen to take.\nAs the young chefs of America travel into\nthe bayous of South Louisiana and walk the French Market area of\nNew Orleans, their creative juices cannot help but flow.

So for a moment, let's look into the past.\nThis certainly will place a bright spotlight on the future of our\nmagnificent cuisine, a cuisine constantly evolving for the better\nin South Louisiana.\nThe Cajun and Creole cultures are quite distinct\nand so are their cuisines. The Creoles were the offspring born in\nNew Orleans of the European aristocrats, wooed by the Spanish to\nestablish New Orleans in the early 1690s. Second-born sons, who\ncould not own land or titles in their native countries, were offered\nthe opportunity to live and prosper in their family traditions here\nin the New World. It is believed the word Creole can be traced to\none of two origins. First, the old Spanish word \"Criallo\"\nmeaning a mixture of cultures or color such as in the word Crayola.\nSecondly, from the Latin word \"Creare\" meaning to create\nas in creating a new race. Although the first Creoles were documented\nin Mobile, Alabama in 1702, Natchitoches and New Orleans followed\nin 1714 and 1718 respectively. Today, the term Creole in New Orleans\nrepresents the native born children of the intermarriage of the\nearly cultures settling the city. These include the Native American,\nFrench, Spanish, English, African, German and Italian and further\ndefines the cuisine that came from this intermarriage.\nThe influences of classical and regional French, Spanish, German\nand Italian cooking are readily apparent in Creole cuisine. The\nterminologies, precepts, sauces and major dishes were carried over,\nsome with more evolution than others, and provided a solid foundation\nfor Creole cooking.\nBouillabaisse is a soup that came from the Provence region of France\nin and around Marseilles. This dish is integral to the history of\nCreole food because of the part it played in the creation of gumbo.\nThe Spanish, who actually played host to this new adventure, gave\nCreole food its spice, many great cooks and paella, which was the\nforefather of Louisiana's jambalaya. Paella is the internationally\nfamous Spanish rice dish made with vegetables, meats and sausages.\nOn the coastline, seafoods were often substituted for meats. Jambalaya\nhas variations as well, according to the local ingredients available\nat different times of the year.\nThe Germans who arrived in Louisiana in 1725 were knowledgeable\nin all forms of charcuterie and helped establish the boucherie and\nfine sausage making in South Louisiana. They brought with them not\nonly pigs, but chicken and cattle as well. A good steady supply\nof milk and butter was seldom available in South Louisiana prior\nto the arrival of the Germans.\nThe Italians were famous for their culinary talents. They were\nsummoned to France by Catherine de Medicis to teach their pastry\nand ice cream making skills to Europeans. Many Creole dishes reflect\nthe Italian influence and their love of good cooking.\nFrom the West Indies and the smoke pots of Haiti came exotic vegetables\nand cooking methods. Braising, a slow-cooking technique, contributed\nto the development of our gumbos. Mirlitons, sauce piquantes and\nthe use of tomato rounded out the emerging Creole cuisine.\nNative Indians, the Choctaws, Chetimaches and Houmas, befriended\nthe new settlers and introduced them to local produce, wildlife\nand cooking methods. New ingredients, such as corn, ground sassafras\nleaves or filé powder and bay leaves from the laurel tree\nall contributed to the culinary melting pot.\nI would be remiss if I failed to mention the tremendous influence\nof \"the black hand in the pot\" in Creole cooking. The\nAfricans brought with them the \"kin gumbo\" or okra plant\nfrom their native soil which not only gave name to our premier soup,\nbut introduced a new vegetable to South Louisiana. Even more importantly,\nAfrican Americans have maintained a significant role in development\nof Creole cuisine in the home as well as the professional kitchen.\nCreole cuisine is indebted to many unique people and diverse cultures\nwho were willing to contribute and share their cooking styles, ingredients\nand talent. Obviously, Creole cuisine represents the history of\nsharing in South Louisiana. Early on in the history of New Orleans,\nthe Creole wives became frustrated, not being able to duplicate\ntheir old world dishes with new world products. Governor Bienville\nhelped to solve this problem by commissioning his housekeeper, Madame\nLanglois, to introduce them to local vegetables, meats and seafoods\nin what became the first cooking school in America. This school\naided them in developing their cuisine in a new and strange land.\nCreole cuisine, then, is that melange of artistry and talent, developed\nand made possible by the nations and cultures who settled in and\naround New Orleans. Those of us who know and love it, keep it alive\nby sharing it with the world.\nThe cuisine of the Cajuns is a mirror image of their unique history.\nIt is a cooking style which reflects their ingenuity, creativity,\nadaptability and survival.\nWhen the exiled French refugees began arriving in South Louisiana\nfrom Acadia in Nova Scotia, Canada in 1755, they were already well-versed\nin the art of survival. Their forefathers had made a home in the\nwilderness of southeast Canada in the land of \"Acadie.\"\nFollowing their exile, these French Catholics found a new home compatible\nwith their customs and religion in South Louisiana.\nThe story of \"Le Grand Derangement\" is memorialized in\nthe epic poem EVANGELINE by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. This love\nstory tells of Gabriel and Evangeline, tragically torn apart when\n10,000 Acadians were gathered and driven from their homeland. It\ntook six days to burn the village of Grand Pre, and families were\ndivided and put aboard 24 British vessels anchored in the Bay of\nThe Acadians were forcibly dispersed, nearly half of them dying\nbefore a year had passed. Survivors landed in Massachusetts, Maryland,\nthe Carolinas, Georgia (where some were sold into slavery), the\nFrench West Indies, Santo Domingo, Uruguay, Nicaragua, Honduras\nand the Falkland Islands. The main tragedy is that the men were\nexiled first, to destinations unknown, with the women and children\nfollowing later. As time passed, the struggle to reunite these families,\nin most cases, proved futile.\nA large contingency of Acadians returned to the coastal seaports\nof France, their initial homeland, and eventually came to South\nLouisiana. Some were sent to England while others made their way\nback to \"Acadie\" to Sainte-Marie and settled on the French\nshore. Word rang out across Europe, Canada and South America that\nreunion with their husbands and fathers could be possible in the\nbayous of South Louisiana.\nAs wave after wave of the bedraggled refugees found their way to\nyet another land, the Acadians were reborn. In Louisiana, they were\nfree to speak their language, believe as they pleased and make a\nlife for themselves in the swamps and bayous of the French Triangle\nof South Louisiana. They were among friends, friends who enjoyed\nthe same \"joie de vivre\" or joy of living.\nJust as they had become such close friends with the Micmac Indians\nwhen they were isolated in the woodlands of Canada, so they befriended\nthe native Indians here in South Louisiana. Friends were quickly\nmade with the Spanish and Germans as well.\nThe original Acadian immigrants had come to Nova Scotia from France\nbeginning in 1620. They were primarily from Brittany, Normandy,\nPicardy and Poitou. These fishermen and farmers had learned how\nto adjust, survive and make a life for themselves in Acadie. Once\nagain, they were faced with the task of survival. Rugged as they\nwere, the Acadians learned to adapt to their new surroundings. Armed\nwith their black iron pots, the Cajuns, as they had come to be known,\nutilized what was indigenous to the area. No attempt was made to\nrecreate the classical cuisine of Europe. None of the exotic spices\nand ingredients available to the Creoles were to be found by the\nCajuns in Bayou country. They were happy to live off the land, a\nland abundant with fish, shellfish and wild game.\nThe Cajuns cooked with joy and love as their most precious ingredients,\na joy brought about by reunion, in spite of the tragedy that befell\nthem. To cook Cajun is to discover the love and experience the joy\nof the most unique American cuisine ever developed.\nCajun cuisine is characterized by the use of wild game, seafoods,\nwild vegetation and herbs. From their association with the Indians,\nthe Cajuns learned techniques to best utilize the local products\nfrom the swamps, bayous, lakes, rivers and woods. Truly remarkable\nare the variations that have resulted from similar ingredients carefully\ncombined in the black iron pots of the Cajuns.\nJambalaya, grillades, stews, fricassees, soups, gumbos, sauce piquantes\nand a host of stuffed vegetable dishes are all characteristic of\nthese new Cajun \"one pot meals.\"\nFrom the Germans, the Cajuns were reintroduced to charcuterie and\ntoday make andouille, smoked sausage, boudin, chaudin, tasso and\nchaurice, unparalleled in the world of sausage making.\nCajun cuisine is a \"table in the wilderness,\" a creative\nadaptation of indigenous Louisiana foods. It is a cuisine forged\nout of a land that opened its arms to a weary traveler, the Acadian.\nAnd so, South Louisiana has two rich histories and two unique cuisines:\nthe Creole cuisine with its rich array of courses indicating its\nclose tie to European aristocracy; and Cajun cuisine with its one\npot meals, pungent with the flavor of seafood and game.\nNo wonder you want to cook Cajun and Creole!\nChef John D. Folse CEC, AAC\n\"We may live without poetry, music and art;\nWe may live without conscience and live without heart;\nWe may live without friends, we may live without books;\nBut civilized man cannot live without cooks.\nHe may live without books, what is knowledge but grieving?\nHe may live without hope, what is hope but deceiving?\nHe may live without love, what is passion but pining?\nBut where is that man who can live without dining?\"","Perhaps the most difficult aspect of studying Louisiana folklife is defining it. The Louisiana Folklife Program describes folklife as “living traditions currently practiced and passed along by word of mouth, imitation, and observation over time and space within groups, such as family, ethnic, social class, regional, and others.” Key to this definition is the idea that folklife is passed from one generation to the next. Folklife takes many forms—from songs to quilts, healing rituals to legends, recipes to hunting strategies—but almost always expresses a culture’s traditional values or beliefs. Since everyone belongs to some kind of group (and usually more than one), everyone has folklife. Like fish unaware of water, people sometimes have trouble identifying folklife because they are immersed in it.\nDespite the diversity of forms, scholars who study folklife generally agree that folklife has five characteristics. (1) It is shared by a group of people who have something in common. This “something” might be ethnicity, religion, region, occupation, age, gender, or a other factors. (2) Folklife is passed from one generation to the next. Children generally learn folk traditions from their parents or other adults in their community. Many people learn to cook, for example, by watching relatives. (3) Folklife is primarily learned informally by observation, verbal instruction, or imitation. A young person might learn how to carve wood or make a fishing net by observing a relative rather than at school or from a book. (4) Somewhat paradoxically, folklife is both static or unchanging and dynamic. While certain elements of folk traditions stay the same over time, other aspects change with each transmission. Quilt patterns, for example, may be repeated over and over again, yet each quilt is unique because of the fabrics used and the skill of the quilter. Similarly, a folktale changes slightly with each new teller. (5) Folklife is usually anonymous in origin. By definition, it is generally created by a group rather than an individual.\nAnother way to think about folklife is to consider it within the context of culture. Scholars sometimes divide culture into three categories—elite, popular, and folk—each of which is learned in a different way. Forms of elite culture, such as sculpture, opera, easel painting, and theater, are generally learned and enjoyed in formal social institutions such as museums, concert halls, and universities. Popular culture includes things like television programs, comic strips, popular music, and movies, generally available through the mass media. Folk culture, on the other hand, is learned by word of mouth, observation, and imitation, and practiced in informal settings such as the family, the club, or a peer group. There is, of course, overlap among these categories. Cajun music—a traditional music genre perpetuated largely though folk cultures—has crossed over into popular culture. Though this cultural model is overly simplistic, it helps illuminate the role folklife plays in our society.\nLouisiana Folk Groups\nThe diversity of the state’s culture makes it difficult to study Louisiana folklife as such. Instead, folklorists generally study specific folk groups in the state. These groups may be defined by any number of factors, including region, ethnicity, class, religion, occupation, age, and gender. Many folkloristsdivide the state into three folk regions—northern Louisiana, southern Louisiana, and the New Orleans metropolitan area—each of which is populated by a unique folk group. These regions can, of course, be divided almost endlessly into various subregions. Shreveport and Ruston are both in northern Louisiana, for example, but they are quite different culturally. Similarly, the “Neutral Strip” on the Louisiana-Texas border could be considered a separate folk region, as could Acadiana in southwestern Louisiana.\nFolk regions reflect the ethnic and religious heritage of their residents. While French-speaking Catholics helped settle New Orleans and much of southern Louisiana, the northern part of the state was settled primarily by Protestants, often of British descent. As a result, Mardi Gras celebrations tend to be more elaborate and central in southern Louisiana, whose population includes many Catholics. In contrast, dinner on the ground, a Protestant tradition, continues to be more prevalent in northern Louisiana. Not all Louisianans are Protestant or Catholic, of course. Hindu immigrants from India introduced the celebration of Navarati, a nine-day commemoration of the Divine Mother, to Baton Rouge, while Vietnamese Buddhists celebrate Tet, the Vietnamese New Year.\nAs the above suggests, religion and ethnicity are often inextricably intertwined. Within predominately Catholic southern Louisiana, for example, the food traditions of Cajuns are distinct from those known as Creoles. Creole foodways tend to echo the traditions of French immigrants and their descendents, using sometimes expensive ingredients and complicated cooking procedures. In contrast, Cajun foodways reflect the modest economic means of the Acadians, French Canadians who immigrated to the region in the mid-to late eighteenth century. As a result, Cajun food tends to be somewhat less expensive and simpler to prepare.\nThe list of ethnic groups who contributed to Louisiana’s folklife is long. To name just a few, German immigrants brought and maintain a distinctive Christmas tradition—the St. Nicholas celebration—when they settled near Robert’s Cove in southwestern Louisiana. Celebrated on December 5, St. Nichols Eve, the tradition involves a parade of costumed characters accompanied by a choir. Italian immigrants introduced the celebration of St. Joseph’s Day in Louisiana, while the Irish helped popularize and propagate St. Patrick’s Day parade traditions in New Orleans. While these the celebrations have changed over time, they continue to serve as reminders of the region’s distinctive ethnic heritage.\nLouisiana’s African American population also added a wealth of traditions to the state’s folklife. Much of the Louisiana’s musical heritage, particularly the genres of jazz, rhythm and blues, and gospel, utilize distinctly African rhythms, call and response patterns, and performance techniques. African American oral traditions like toasting and “playing the dozens”—exercises in verbal wit—have shaped the language of Louisianans, black and white. African oral, musical, costuming, and dance traditions come together in the performances of New Orleans’s Mardi Gras Indians. Dressed in elaborate, handmade costumes, the Mardi Gras Indians lead unofficial parades on the back streets of New Orleans, enacting a carefully choreographed ritual when they encounter another tribe.\nNative Americans themselves, of course, began contributing to Louisiana folklife long before the arrival of other ethnic groups. Members of several tribes—including the Chitimacha and the Choctaw—continue a cane basketry tradition going back hundreds of years, while members of the Coushatta tribe are known for their carefully crafted pinestraw baskets. The intricate designs commonly found on Chitamacha basketry in particular have earned praised and attention around the globe. Native American folklife, including storytelling, dance, and food traditions, also survive, though they are often modified for contemporary audiences.\nWhile groups defined by region, religion, and ethnicity are perhaps the most frequently studied, there are many others. Occupational folk groups such as ranchers, midwives, shrimpers, and trappers often have rich folk traditions. Riverboat workers, for example, develop their own language, lore, and rituals, as they work together in close quarters. Age can also define a folk group. Children’s folklife, including handmade toys, jump rope rhymes, and clap games, reveals much about the values of the broader folk group. Gender, social class, and a host of other shared interests may also define folk groups.\nAnother way of organizing Louisiana’s folklife is by genre or type. Rather than examining the folklife of a specific folk group, folklorists working with this model explore categories or types of folklife. Though their exact terminology varies, folklorists often divide Louisiana folklife into the following genres: oral traditions, folk music and dance, material culture, and rituals and beliefs.\nOral traditions include the jokes, proverbs, stories, anecdotes, and other narratives that members of a folk group exchange verbally. One of the best known Louisiana legends is the legend of Evangeline, a young Acadian woman separated from her lover when the British evicted French Canadians from what is now Nova Scotia. Though based on a fictional poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Evangeline’s story has taken on a reality of its own, inspiring a statute in St. Martinsville as well as the names of nearby businesses and public facilities. While Louisiana folktales resemble those told in other cultures, they often exhibit a regionally specific twist. Animal trickster tales are common in many cultures, for example, but few other cultures feature the alligator as prominently. Similarly, while stories of evil spirits are widespread, Louisiana’s cauchemar tales—stories of a witch, devil, or other evil spirit riding an individual in his or her sleep—are particularly common among African Americans of French descent.\nFolk music and dance traditions consist of the traditional songs and styles of music and dance within a community. As opposed to commercial music, which tends to come into communities from other places, folk music develops within a community. The brass band music featured in New Orleans’ jazz funerals and second line parades, though increasingly popular outside the region, represents the perpetuation of long-standing musical and social traditions. It is music from the community for the community and makes sense within the context of a larger folk ritual. Similarly, the Cajun two-step represents a regional variation of a dance style associated with country western music in general.\nThe term material culture refers to the traditional artifacts and objects within a community. Often the creator of these artifacts, the folk artist, learned his or her craft from a family member or mentor in the community, and passes this skill on to his or her children. Quilting, a popular activity throughout the state, has been documented more frequently in northern Louisiana. While allowing for innovation, quilters perpetuate specific quilting techniques and patterns over time. In the southern part of the state, where contemporary versions of the traditional pirogue can be seen, there is a strong boat-building tradition. Instead of simply buying a commercially made boat, traditional boat builders construct vessels specifically designed for use in their community. Another important type of material culture is foodways, a group’s traditional ways of obtaining, preparing, serving, and consuming food. Traditional dishes, like the gumbo, the Natchitoches meat pie, reveal much about a region’s ethnic heritage—in the latter case Spanish—agricultural economy, and social values.\nThe genre of folk rituals and customs includes traditional activities or practices within a folk group, often based on a shared set of beliefs. These rituals may include religious ceremonies, holiday celebrations, superstitions, and rites of passage (e.g., birth, marriage). Near the northeastern Louisiana town of Winnsboro, African Americans gather at the True Light Baptist Church to participate in an Easter eve ceremony called Easter Rock, which dates to the antebellum era. As participants sing, they “rock” by taking rhythmic steps from side to side, while simultaneously circling a table decorated with lamps, cake, and punch. In Marksville, Easter marks the recurrence of a very different ritual: an egg knocking contest to determine who has the “hardest” hard-boiled and decorated egg. Though often religious in nature, folk rituals may be secular as well. Tailgating before a sporting event, singing Happy Birthday, and gardening are common nonreligious rituals throughout the state.\nWhether studied by folk group, genre, or some combination thereof, Louisiana’s folklife is worth exploring. It has become a cliché to describe Louisiana’s culture in general and folklife in particular as a gumbo in which the individual elements enrich the whole while maintaining their unique identities. Though overused, the metaphor remains apt. Only by studying Louisiana’s unique folk groups can scholars begin to understand the culture as a whole. Organizations like the Louisiana Folklife Program, the Louisiana Folklife Center (LFC) at Northwestern State University, the Louisiana Folklife Society, and the program in Folklore Studies at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette, continue to encourage the study of this important cultural resource."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:705477d5-7615-4754-b860-cd563d8f997a>","<urn:uuid:68327b39-4605-40e6-94bd-5f7a6c67a857>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the preparation methods and nutritional benefits compare between pipérade, a traditional Basque dish, and winter root vegetables when it comes to making healthy, versatile meals?","answer":"Both pipérade and winter root vegetables offer versatile and nutritious meal options. Pipérade is made by sautéing green bell peppers, garlic, onion, and tomatoes together, and can be enjoyed any time of day as a way to increase daily vegetable servings. It's flexible in preparation, allowing for different colored bell peppers and even canned San Marzano tomatoes when fresh ones aren't available. Similarly, winter root vegetables can be prepared through various methods, with oven roasting being particularly effective at drawing out rich, deep flavors. Both types of dishes are adaptable - pipérade can be frozen for later use, while winter vegetables store well in the refrigerator for long periods. Nutritionally, winter vegetables offer low-fat, low-calorie benefits along with complex carbohydrates for sustained energy, while pipérade provides a colorful mix of vegetables similar to ratatouille.","context":["Pipérade (French) or piperrada (Spanish) is a French Basque dish made from green bell pepper, garlic, onion and tomato, sautéd together and seasoned with red espelette pepper.\nThe word derives from piper, the Basque word for pepper. The colors—red, white and green—are those of the Basque flag (said to be a coincidence).\nBasque Country straddles the border between France and Spain on the Atlantic coast, Pyrénées-Atlantiques north and south of the Pyrenees Mountains.\nPipérade is a dish from the Northern Basque Country (French Basque Country), which lies entirely within France and known as Pays Basque Français in French.\nPipérade is related to the Provençal ratatouille, which adds zucchini and eggplant to the mix. Both are colorful and versatile dishes that can be enjoyed any time of the day (and are a delicious way to add to your daily vegetable servings).\nWAYS TO SERVE PIPERADE\nWhile many of these applications may not be traditional Basque, they show the flexibility of piperade.\nWhen bell peppers are on sale, we load up and make a batch of pipérade (it can be frozen). We’re flexible on the color of the bell peppers (in fact, we prefer a mix of colors ).\nWhile waiting for summer tomatoes (and after they’re gone), we use whole canned San Marzano† tomatoes instead of the bland plum tomatoes in the market. Drain them, but save the juice and drink it, plain or with a splash of gin.\nWe adapted this recipe from one by Chef Aida Mollenkamp. She peels the tomatoes. We’re lazy and often skip this step (and usually use use the peeled, canned San Marzano tomatoes, anyway).\n†The San Marzano is an heirloom variety of plum tomato, originally planted in the town of the same name at the base of Mount Vesuvius, near Naples. The volcanic soil and sunny climate grow tomatoes that are among the most sought-after on earth, with remarkable, sweet, intense tomato flavor. The canned variety are also delicious.\n‡Bayonne ham is a cured ham from the French Basque country. If you can’t find it, substitute prosciutto or other ham.\n1. PEEL the fresh tomatoes. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil over high heat. Prepare an ice water bath by filling a medium bowl halfway with ice and water. Using the tip of a knife, remove the stem and cut a shallow X-shape into the bottom of each tomato. Place the tomatoes in the boiling water and blanch until the skin just starts to pucker and loosen, about 10 seconds. Drain and immediately immerse the tomatoes in the ice water bath. Using a small knife, peel the loosened skin and cut each tomato in half. With a small spoon, scrape out any seeds, then core and coarsely chop the remaining flesh. Set aside.\n2. PLACE a large Dutch oven or other heavy-bottomed pot with a tigh-fitting lid over medium heat, and add 1 tablespoon of the oil. When the oil shimmers, add the ham and cook, stirring occasionally, until it’s golden brown, about 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the ham to a plate and set aside.\n3. RETURN the pan to the heat, add the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil, and, once heated, add the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring a few times, until soft and beginning to color, about 8 minutes. Stir in the herbs and bell pepper slices and season well with salt. Cover and cook, stirring a few times, until the peppers are slightly softened, about 10 minutes.\n4. STIR in the diced tomatoes, browned ham, and piment d’Espelette, and season with salt to taste. Cook uncovered until the mixture melds and the juices have slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and serve.\nChiles, which are native to Central and South America, were brought to France in the 16th century. It is believed that the chiles were introduced into the Basque Nive Valley in 1523 by Gonzalo Percaztegi, a navigator who voyaged with Christopher Columbus (who brought chiles to Spain in 1494). It became popular as a condiment and is now a staple of Basque cuisine, where it has gradually replaced black pepper.\nEspelette pepper can be purchased as fresh or dried whole peppers (photo #5), as ground pepper (photo #6), as purée in jars or pickled in jars. For fresh espelette, look for non-AOC espelette peppers grown in California.\nGrowing in French soil, its unique qualities have earned it AOC and APO classifications. An annual pepper festival organized by Confrérie du Piment d’Espelette, held the last weekend in October since 1968, attracts some 20,000 tourists [source].\nIf you can’t find it, substitute hot paprika or cayenne.\nSee the different types of chiles in our Chile Glossary.","Winter Vegetable Recipes\nWinter vegetable recipes make the most of those veggies that are either fresh or in season during the chillier months of the year. These vegetables include common faces, like potatoes and onions, along with the less familiar celeriac and parsnip. Whether or not you recognize the names of these cool-season veggies, you’ll definitely want to learn how to showcase them for the dinner table. Discover some ideas for winter vegetable recipes that you can put to work this week.\nWinter vegetable recipes include root crops that star in everyday fare, like carrot, potato, onion and sweet potato. They also embrace a few of the perhaps less popular root crops, such as beets, parsnip, turnip and rutabaga. Winter vegetables also include broccoli family members: broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and broccoli raabe. Several greens come into their own during winter, including endive, escarole, chicory and kale.\nThe great thing about winter vegetables is that they’re wonderfully affordable in season and—at times—even downright cheap. Many also store well in the refrigerator for long periods, so you can stock up when prices are good without fear of spoiled produce.\nOn the whole, winter veggies also boast outstanding nutrition. The root crops and different types of winter squash offer low-fat, low-calorie benefits teamed up with complex carbohydrates, which provide sustained energy and fullness. The broccoli cousins serve cancer-fighting compounds in every bite, and winter greens bring vitamins, fiber and antioxidants to the dinner table.\nBesides offering all kinds of health benefits, when you dig into winter vegetable recipes, you’ll discover easy-to-please foods that can help rekindle family mealtime. Many winter vegetables can slip into traditional menus incognito, delivering a hidden punch of high nutrition. For instance, who doesn’t like macaroni and cheese? Pureed winter squash transforms this homey fare into a super-food feast. Mashed potatoes provide the perfect hiding place for steamed, mashed rutabagas, and alphabet vegetable soup can easily host roasted, chopped Brussels sprouts as an alternative to cabbage.\nA stock pot simmering with stew offers the perfect place to stash all kinds of winter vegetables, including turnips, roasted parsnips, carrots and cubed winter squash. Best of all, hearty winter vegetable stew stretches to cover many meals and even freezes easily for later use. Stews pair smartly with a salad of winter greens and fresh fruit, making mealtime a snap to prepare.\nConsider oven roasted winter vegetables to add flavor to dishes. Oven roasting winter vegetables draws forth rich, deep flavors from these simple foods. You can serve roasted veggies solo as side dishes or incorporate into existing recipes. For instance, a mix of roasted winter vegetables tastes great over rice or whole grain pasta and also works well as a pizza topping. Or try roasted veggies in scrambled eggs, blended into stews or tossed with salad greens.\nWinter vegetable recipes feature simple preparation techniques, but yield fabulous flavor. Whether they steal the spotlight as an entrée or fill a supporting role as a side, they’ll bring outstanding nutrition to mealtime menus, every time."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4ec9eaba-5b07-431b-ae89-92850d1827ad>","<urn:uuid:a8e1f795-14cf-4062-ae12-36d6c7cd4aa8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What was unique about the Persian writing system between 200-1000 CE?","answer":"The Persian writing system between 200-1000 CE had a unique feature where it combined phonetic writing of Persian words with about 1000 Aramaic logograms. These logograms were three-letter Aramaic words that appeared within Persian sentences but were meant to be pronounced as Persian words. To read these Zoroastrian Persian texts, one had to learn both the Aramaic alphabet and memorize all these Aramaic logograms with their Persian pronunciations.","context":["Between the late 1800s and early 1900s, Germany sent numerous archaeological expeditions to a number of areas within the former Persian Empire. One area they explored were some ruins on the far eastern edge of the Persian Empire, near Turfan in Chinese Turkestan. There they found a large amount of writings in Middle Persian, from around the 13th century CE and earlier. What was special about these writings, is that they were written with a unique version of the Aramaic (Syriac) alphabet, which preserved a clearer pronunciation of original Persian words than the traditional writing system used by the Persian Empire (see notes below). The writings were taken back to Germany, and published in numerous books. It was the practice of German scholars to use Hebrew letters when publishing anything which used an Aramaic alphabet. So, up until 1933, German scholars published hundreds of pages of these Persian writings using Hebrew letters. It should be noted that it was common, acceptable practice in pre-Nazi Germany for scholars of early Middle Eastern languages - Aramaic (as well as other Semitic languages) and Persian, to be completely familiar with reading and writing Hebrew letters, and Hebrew letters were almost always used when publishing texts such as these.\nAs these religious texts discovered were usually translated from Aramaic sources, original Aramaic names of divine beings often appear in the Persian texts.\nMiddle Persian writings published with Hebrew Letters in Berlin\nDie Stellung Jesu im Manichäismus (Berlin, 1926)\nAlthough the Persian Empire at one time ruled the entire Middle East - from the Mediterranean in the west to China in the east, the Persian language (an Iranian language) used borrowed languages and writing systems to conduct the affairs of the Iranian peoples (Iranian, from Sanskrit-Iranian Aryan). Persian was first written in around 500 BCE using about 30 cuneiform signs, which were borrowed from the preceding Babylonian Empire cuneiform system (which contained about 1000 cuneiform characters). At the same time, Aramaic (Imperial Aramaic), was used as the administrative language to unite the Persian Empire. (This was done with a system of native-Aramaic speaking scribes, who would write down in an Aramaic message what was dictated to them in Persian. When the message reached its destination, another Aramaic scribe would then read it and deliver the message back in the local language). The Persian Empire was, at this time in history, the largest empire the world has ever had, containing over 40% of the world's population. In the Hebrew bible as well, portions of the book of Daniel and the book of Ezra were written in Aramaic, and discussed the transition from the Babylonian Empire to the Persian Empire. There are numerous Persian words (about twenty), as well as names of Persian kings, in these Aramaic sections in the Hebrew bible. (Likewise, the Hebrew book of Esther, which also deals with Persia, contains numerous Persian words and names).\nAfter attempting to write the Persian language with cuneiform for a few hundred years, the Persians switched to writing Persian with a modified version of the Aramaic alphabet. (They had already been using the Aramaic language for administration throughout the Persian Empire). So between about 200 CE through 1000 CE, a large body of uniquely Persian literature was written, using the new Persian (Aramaic) alphabet. The religion of the Iranians, and of the Persian Empire, was Zoroastrianism (founded by the ancient Iranian prophet Zoroaster), and the Persian writings which were written were all writings of the Zoroastrian religion.\nOne unique feature of this writing system is that, while most of the Persian words were written phonetically (as they were pronounced), there were a number of Aramaic words (about 1000), which were used as logograms, which means that a three-letter Aramaic word might appear in the midst of a Persian sentence, and the Aramaic word would be read as a sign (logogram) that was to be pronounced as a Persian word. In other words, to learn to read the Zoroastrian Persian texts, not only did the Aramaic alphabet have to be learned, but also the 1000 or so Aramaic logograms, and their Persian pronounced equivalents, had to be memorized. (The Persian writings discovered by the German archeologists - which we are dealing with in this section - did not use a system of logograms. They were all read phonetically, as written)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:80c69639-40c0-4635-80a3-495c8c149d2f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Por favor, explique brevemente qué es el GRC y cuál es el valor agregado del cumplimiento normativo para las empresas.","answer":"GRC stands for Governance, Risk, and Compliance, with governance being defined as the system by which companies are directed and managed. As for compliance, it should not be viewed merely as a business cost but rather as an added value because it increases public trust in corporations. Compliance demonstrates that companies are 'doing the right thing' and brings several benefits, including reduced risk of heavy fines, lower legal fees, protection of company reputation, and reduced opportunity costs in dealings with regulators. Effective compliance requires commitment to ethical values and corporate social responsibilities throughout the organization.","context":["Although risk is the often the most discussed element of GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance), it is important to understand all aspects. Let's start with Governance.\nIn my last article, I talked about “What is GRC?” and recommended the Open Compliance and Ethics Group’s (OCEG) definition. The next step is to address its first element – Governance; again, there are multiple definitions.\nThe Many Ways to Define Governance in GRC\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says Governance involves:\n“A set of relationships between a company's management, its board, its shareholders and other stakeholder. Corporate governance also provides the structure through which the objectives of the company are set, and the means of attaining those objectives and monitoring performance are determined.”\nThe Cadbury Committee (the governance source for UK listed companies) has a simpler definition:\n“The system by which companies are directed and controlled. Boards of directors are responsible for the governance of their companies.”\n“The shareholders' role in governance is to appoint the directors and the auditors and to satisfy themselves that an appropriate governance structure is in place. The responsibilities of the board include setting the company's strategic aims, providing the leadership to put them into effect, supervising the management of the business, and reporting to the shareholders on their stewardship.”\nThe Corporate Governance Committee of Japan has this:\n“Corporate governance is a scheme for ensuring that the executive managers, who have been placed in charge of the company, fulfill their duties.”\nForrester Research, an analyst firm, defines Governance as:\n“The culture, policies, processes, laws, and institutions that define the structure by which companies are directed and managed. Corporate governance includes the relationships among stakeholders and the goals for which the corporation is governed.”\nI like the one from the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX):\n“The system by which companies are directed and managed. It influences how the objectives of the company are set and achieved, how risk is monitored and assessed, and how performance is optimized.”\nThe Institute of Internal Auditors’ (IIA) definition is:\n“The combination of processes and structures implemented by the board in order to inform, direct, manage and monitor the activities of the organization toward the achievement of its objectives.”\n“Governance is the culture, values, mission, structure and layers of policies, processes and measures by which organizations are directed and controlled. Governance, in this context, includes but is not limited to the activities of the Board, for governance bodies at various levels of the organization also play a critical role. The tone that is set, followed and communicated at the top is critical to success.”\nDifferences in Governance Definitions\nWhat do we make of all these?\n- Some limit Governance to the activities of the Board:\n- Others include management as well as the board (by talking about directing (board) and managing or controlling (management):\n- Forrester Research\n- Australian Stock Exchange\n- That leaves OECD, which I find ambiguous and therefore not very useful.\n- All pretty much talk about:\n- Setting the objectives (strategy) of the company\n- Appointing leadership\n- Ensuring appropriate tone at the top (culture and values)\n- Managing risks (implicit if not stated)\n- Monitoring and optimizing performance\nEach of us can determine whether we define Governance as including only board processes or also those of management.\nBut in the GRC model, it has to include how management ensures the directives of the board are achieved. Personally, I use either the OCEG or ASX definition. You can see my blog on the elements included in Governance here.","Does your company regard compliance as an added value to your business or as a business cost? Bill Dee, Director, Compliance and Complaints Advisory Services Pty Ltd, Australia, and Angus Young, Assistant Professor, Hang Seng Management College, Hong Kong, give some tips on how to establish a culture of compliance in your company.\nEveryone thinks they know what compliance means – it is assumed that compliance is just about companies meeting their legal obligations. Compliance professionals are very aware that compliance is more than having a tick list of ‘things to do’ to ensure compliance with relevant laws. This approach does not create good corporate citizens or governance.\nCompliance should entail a commitment to ethical values and corporate social responsibilities throughout the organisation. Also compliance should not be thought of as business cost or simply a reduction of legal risk – it is an added value because it increases the public’s trust of corporations – it demonstrates that they are ‘doing the right thing’. To achieve this it has to come from the top, but also staff at all levels have to embrace compliance as part of corporate culture and the way companies do business. The first step therefore is to educate the board and the second is to train staff.\nWhy establish a culture of compliance?\nThere are a number of compelling reasons why business executives and corporations should be concerned with compliance. These include:\n• it is the law and conforming to the law is very much part and parcel of good corporate governance\n• courts take into account whether there is a culture of compliance when assessing penalties\n• it reduces the risk of heavy fines, high legal fees and, most importantly, damage to reputation caused by engaging in conduct that society deems to be unacceptable, and\n• it reduces the risk of incurring opportunity costs in dealings with regulators.\nIn a nutshell, a culture of compliance with legislation and regulation is not an optional extra, but an essential element of doing business.\nHow to establish a culture of compliance\nThere are two critical aspects of how to establish a culture of compliance: attitude and infrastructure. Both are required to establish and maintain such a culture.\nThe first thing to bear in mind is that a compliance culture can’t be bought ‘off the shelf’, it has to be nurtured. Commentators agree that culture is all about the shared values, beliefs and attitudes within an organisation. You need to consider how your corporation embraces and applies the concept of compliance to its total business strategy and implementation. The basic test of whether a corporation has an effective compliance culture is whether or not compliance is accepted as a business added value rather than a business cost.\nFor a culture of compliance to be successful it has to be top driven and have the right ‘tone at the top’. The expression ‘tone at the top’ has become a compliance mantra and rallying call for industry\nand regulators in recognition of the significant influence that organisational leaders such as the board and senior management exert on employee attitudes and, as a consequence, on the entire range of organisational behaviours. A culture of compliance occurs when the whole organisation has a low tolerance to breaking the law.\nSome top managers may profess fake support for compliance but, at the same time, send signals (by wilful omission or otherwise) that they are actually indifferent to it. Such wilful and deliberate blindness by top management can totally negate a ‘professed’ culture of compliance. The executive and senior management must visibly and actively ‘own’ compliance. They are specifically tasked with ensuring that compliance is adequately resourced, is given a place at management meetings and in reporting, and most importantly will foster transparency of compliance reporting.\nTone at the top is undoubtedly critical for a healthy culture of corporate compliance. The chief executive officer, the board chairman and the directors must be clearly seen by both word and practical example to set a culture of compliance within the organisation. But these behaviours alone won’t result in a compliant organisation. A good compliance culture links specific people, to specific documents, control points and risks, and ultimately to a specific goal. In a good culture of compliance, this will be a seamless web. In the words of the now Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, then a Federal Court judge: ‘Broadly speaking it may be said that the clearest indicator of a corporate culture of compliance is the existence within a corporation of effective compliance programmes.’\nAn unambiguous commitment at the top of the corporate heirarchy to effective compliance must be backed up by a comprehensive compliance management system including supporting internal practices and procedures.\nThe board/ top management must:\n• have serious compliance breaches and especially regulator concerns escalated to them\n• ensure reporting systems to the board are in place and that reporting is timely (reporting involves not only reporting of non-compliance but reporting back against strategies to improve or rectify compliance)\n• understand compliance (education may be needed)\n• appoint a senior manager with sufficient authority as a compliance manager/ officer\n• ensure the compliance manager\nhas access to all relevant board committees and the board if needed\n• resource and empower compliance – that is, put board authority behind it\n• receive and act upon incisive reporting (not just ‘noting’ it)\n• ask probing questions, and\n• have access to and use actual compliance expertise.\nThere should be adequate resources for the compliance function including:\n• a compliance manager or officer\n• access to expert advice\n• a committee that covers compliance matters\n• annual training, and\n• policies and practices.\nRegulatory risk assessment\nRisk assessment is about assessing the likelihood and the consequences of breaches of applicable laws. This means that companies need to determine which regulatory risks are most likely to occur and then identify which ones would have the greatest impact. This involves undertaking an analysis of the nature of the company’s operations, what type of market it operates in, what guidelines the regulators have published that are relevant to the firm and the results of any enforcement activity regulators have taken in the industry that the firm operates in. Once risks have been identified controls/ procedures/ practices need to be developed to manage those risks.\nOperational compliance covers the day-to-day processes and systems for compliance. These could include:\n- procedural work instructions\n- systems and exception reports\n- segregation of duties\n- mandatory face-to-face annual training of high- and medium-risk staff, including scenario-based training and role playing\n- annual completion of online training\n- six-monthly completion of compliance questionnaires and certificates\n- communications to staff on relevant issues on an ongoing basis\n- channels for providing on-the-spot advice\n- visible and accessible means of reporting suspected breaches to the compliance manager, and\n- communication of the consequences of breaching competition legislation provisions to high-risk staff.\nRegular and documented monitoring to ensure adherence to procedures is an important due diligence feature. Where compliance is essentially behavioural (such as compliance with competition legislation) the reporting systems of complaints handling and whistleblowing systems are the most appropriate forms of monitoring.\nOther forms of monitoring could include:\n• the compliance manager undertaking unannounced spot checks to ensure procedures are being followed\n• ensuring mandatory attendance at training\n• ensuring completion of compliance certification and questionnaires, and\n• involving in-house auditors to undertake audits that procedures designed to control high-risk matters are being conformed to.\nEducation and training\nAnnual face-to-face training for at-risk staff should be implemented. The training should identify and deal with day-to-day, real-world risk situations and how to handle them – this can be done through hypothetical scenarios and role playing. New staff, particularly those who are classified as at risk, should be required to complete the online training and testing programme within a month and should attend face-to face training at quarterly catch-up sessions.\nBecause some training is conducted annually, a concern arises as to how to keep competition legislation compliance up to date, particularly for at-risk staff. In relation to this concern, an organisation may want to consider the following initiatives:\n• an online training and testing programme which is accessible 24/7 as a reference tool\n• circulation of the regulator’s media releases relevant to the company’s operations with a commentary about lessons for the company\n• regular update messages such as:\no the launch of the company’s updated compliance policy, and\no reminders of the ‘do’s and don’ts’\n• in-house legal staff can make presentations and be available to give advice at conferences\n• memos can be distributed to relevant staff regarding lessons learnt from the field\n• compliance questionnaires and certificates can be circulated every six months\n• lessons from the field can be discussed at team meetings, and\n• quarterly compliance committee meetings can serve as a reminder for communications.\nDirector, Compliance and Complaints Advisory Services Pty Ltd, Australia\nAssistant Professor, Hang Seng Management College and Adjunct Professor, Southwest University of Political Science & Law, PRC\nAngus Young presented a seminar ‘Establishing a corporate culture of compliance’ for the Institute’s ECPD programme on 17 June 2013 (see page 36 for\na review).

{"question":"Can you compare the actual shapes of the Ring Nebula and Trifid Nebula? I'm interested in their true structures!","answer":"The Ring Nebula is shaped like a distorted doughnut with a rugby ball-shaped structure of lower density material in its center, and we view it almost directly down one of its poles. The Trifid Nebula, on the other hand, is characterized by three huge intersecting dark lanes of interstellar dust, with dense pillars of gas and dust, one of which contains a protoplanetary disk and another features a jet of material extending three-quarters of a light-year from a young star.","context":["Three huge intersecting dark lanes of interstellar dust make the Trifid Nebula one of the most recognizable and striking star birth regions in the night sky. The dust, silhouetted against glowing gas and illuminated by starlight, cradles the bright stars at the heart of the Trifid Nebula. This nebula, also known as Messier 20 and NGC 6514, lies within our own Milky Way Galaxy about 9,000 light-years (2,700 parsecs) from Earth, in the constellation Sagittarius.\nThis new image from the Hubble Space Telescope offers a close-up view of the center of the Trifid Nebula, near the intersection of the dust bands, where a group of recently formed, massive, bright stars is easily visible. These stars, which astronomers classify as belonging to the hottest and bluest types of stars called type \"O,\" are releasing a flood of ultraviolet radiation that dramatically influences the structure and evolution of the surrounding nebula. Many astronomers studying nebulae like the Trifid are focusing their research on the ways that waves of star formation move through such regions.\nThe group of bright O-type stars at the center of the Trifid illuminates a dense pillar of gas and dust, seen to the right of the center of the image, producing a bright rim on the side facing the stars. At the upper left tip of this pillar, there is a complex filamentary structure. This wispy structure has a bluish color because it is made up of glowing oxygen gas that is evaporating into space.\nStar formation is no longer occurring in the immediate vicinity of the conspicuous group of bright O-type stars, because their intense radiation has blown away the gas and dust from which stars are made. However, not far away there are signs of interstellar material collapsing under its own gravity, leading to ongoing star formation. One such example is a very young star that is still surrounded by a ring of gas and dust left over from the star's formation. These circumstellar rings, called protoplanetary disks, or \"proplyds\" for short, are believed to be the locations where planetary systems are formed. A proplyd in the Trifid Nebula is visible near the lower right of the main Hubble image. An image enlargement of the proplyd is shown in the lower left box, where its elongated shape can be seen.\nIn the box at upper right, a jet of material is seen being ejected from a very young, low-mass star. The jet, extending to the lower right of the box, protrudes from the head of a dense pillar and extends three-quarters of a light-year out into the surrounding thin gas. The jet's source is a very young stellar object that lies buried within the pillar. Previous Hubble images of the Trifid Nebula, taken in 1997, show very small, but noticeable changes in the knotty material being ejected from this jet. Accompanying the jet is a nearby stalk that points directly toward the central stars in the Trifid Nebula. This finger-like stalk is similar to the large pillars of gas in the well-known Eagle Nebula, also imaged by Hubble.\nThe Hubble image of the Trifid Nebula has given astronomers insight into the nature of the interaction of gaseous, dusty and stellar material in an area where dust, gas clouds, and new and old stars coexist. The science team, composed of Farhad Yusef-Zadeh (Northwestern U.), John Biretta (STScI), Bob O'Dell (Vanderbilt U.), and Mark Wardle (Macquarie U.), took exposures in filters that transmit light emitted by oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur ions. The images were taken with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 onboard Hubble in mid-summer 2001 and 2002.

This image reveals intricate structure only hinted at in previous observations, and has allowed scientists to construct a model of the nebula in 3D - showing the true shape of this striking object.\nFormed by a star throwing off its outer layers as it runs out of fuel, the Ring Nebula is an archetypal planetary nebula . It is both relatively close to Earth and fairly bright, and so was first recorded in the late 18th century. As is common with astronomical objects, its precise distance is not known, but it is thought to lie just over 2000 light-years from Earth.\nFrom Earth’s perspective, the nebula looks roughly elliptical. However, astronomers have combined ground-based data with new observations using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to observe the nebula again, hunting for clues about its structure, evolution, physical conditions and motion.\nIt turns out that the nebula is shaped like a distorted doughnut. We are gazing almost directly down one of the poles of this structure, with a brightly coloured barrel of material stretching away from us. Although the centre of this doughnut may look empty, it is actually full of lower density material that stretches both towards and away from us, creating a shape similar to a rugby ball slotted into the doughnut’s central gap.\nThe brightest part of this nebula is what we see as the colourful main ring. This is composed of gas thrown off by a dying star at the centre of the nebula. This star is on its way to becoming a white dwarf — a very small, dense, and hot body that is the final evolutionary stage for a star like the Sun.\nThe Ring Nebula is one of the most notable objects in our skies. It was discovered in 1779 by astronomer Antoine Darquier de Pellepoix, and also observed later that same month by Charles Messier, and added to the Messier Catalogue. Both astronomers stumbled upon the nebula when trying to follow the path of a comet through the constellation of Lyra, passing very close to the Ring Nebula .\n Planetary nebulae take their name from their roughly circular appearance through low-magnification telescopes. The phenomenon has nothing to do with planets.\n Messier 57 was not the only object to be discovered during the tracking of this comet, named C/1779 A1. Messier and other astronomers added a handful of other nebulae to the catalogue during this observing period — Messiers 56, 58, 59, 60, and 61.\nThe Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between ESA and NASA.\nThe research on Messier 57 is described in a set of three papers, two published in The Astronomical Journal: \"Studies of NGC 6720 with Calibrated HST WFC3 Emission Line Filter Images — I: Structure and Evolution\" and \"Studies of NGC 6720 with Calibrated HST WFC3 Emission Line Filter Images — II: Physical Conditions\" and a third paper that has been accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal: \"Studies of NGC 6720 with Calibrated HST WFC3 Emission Line Filter Images — III: Tangential Motions using AstroDrizzle Images\".\nThe NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope observations used in this image were led by C.

{"question":"How does accelerated bridge construction work and why it helps reduce traffic problems? Pls explain step by step","answer":"Accelerated bridge construction (ABC) works by building as much of the new bridge as possible off-site and then installing it in place of the old bridge. The process involves using prefabricated/precast bridge elements that can be quickly assembled on-site. This method reduces mobility impacts and user costs because it significantly shortens the construction time on the actual road. The benefits include faster delivery time, improved work-zone safety for both the traveling public and project crews, minimized traffic impacts, and a shortened window of disruption to the local community in terms of noise, detours, and traffic. While ABC requires ample space for project staging and laydown, it is particularly valuable in densely populated, congested areas where minimal disruptions to traffic and transit are vital.","context":["How a rising tactic in bridge design and construction is bringing welcome relief to drivers and communities alike\nThere’s a necessary evil in our work upgrading bridge infrastructure—managing traffic and vehicle congestion. Bridge construction can force commuters into frustratingly long detours, block homeowners from convenient access to their homes, and, at worst, even impact emergency services.\nThis congestion can be especially maddening for drivers who are regularly navigating through a job site that has encroached upon the road or highway by restricting lanes for what seems to be a slow-moving construction project, oftentimes for highly complex and necessary infrastructure upgrades like bridge replacements. In my years overseeing the design and construction of bridges and roadways throughout New England, particularly along the bustling expressways in Greater Boston, balancing a project timeline while minimizing impact on local traffic patterns has always been a highly complicated endeavor.\nLuckily, in recent years there’s been some relief with new methods and tactics designed to help mitigate the downtime of roadways and highways during construction.\nThe River Street Bridge project in Boston involved the replacement of a busy multi-modal crossing for pedestrians, daily vehicle traffic, and a bus route, which was also located above a railroad.\nThe ABCs of accelerated bridge construction\nLike many states across the US, Massachusetts state officials have embraced a new approach. In 2008, the Massachusetts Legislature established Accelerated Bridge Program legislation to launch this concept with the goal of reducing the number of structurally deficient bridges in the state system and (arguably most importantly) doing this work in a way that causes the least amount of disruption to the traveling public.\nBy using prefabricated/precast bridge elements or constructing as much of the new bridge as possible off-site and then installing the new bridge in place of the old, accelerated bridge construction (ABC) can speed replacement or rehabilitation of workhorse bridges to reduce mobility impacts and user costs. Benefits of this practice include faster delivery time, improved work-zone safety for the traveling public and project crews, minimized traffic impacts, and a shortened window of disruption to the local community in terms of noise, detours, and traffic. With about one-quarter of the nation's 600,000 bridges needing rehabilitation, repair, or replacement, ABC can serve as a valuable tool.\nABC can come with its own unique challenges—namely the need for ample space for project staging and laydown. However, I’ve found that these techniques can be especially valuable in densely populated, congested areas where minimal disruptions to traffic and transit are vital, including bicyclist and pedestrian traffic.\n_q_tweetable:With about one-quarter of the nation's 600,000 bridges needing rehabilitation, repair, or replacement, accelerated bridge construction can serve as a valuable tool._q_\nManaging multi-modal needs\nOur team at Stantec has been at the forefront of utilizing ABC in New England, and we’ve had great success employing ABC in areas like Boston, where the needs of local drivers, pedestrians, and public transit must be considered. Most recently, we designed two bridge replacements in Boston’s thriving Dorchester neighborhood that both illustrate how effective collaboration and planning can help minimize disruptions to the local community.\nThe River Street Bridge and Morton Street Bridge replacements posed a unique challenge, with both projects occurring on a bus route, as well as over a railroad used by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) and CSX freight railroad. As a result, construction phasing required close coordination with MBTA’s commuter rail operators, CSX freight operators, and bus route operators to detour traffic while also maintaining vehicular and pedestrian access to all local streets and businesses.\nThrough proactive collaboration and construction planning, each bridge was replaced in a 55-hour window, only impacting vehicular and rail traffic for two separate weekends.\nPreserving accessibility in a city’s center\nOur team also developed plans for the rehabilitation of Massachusetts Avenue bridge over Commonwealth Avenue in the heart of Boston’s bustling Back Bay neighborhood. This work was essential to improving the condition of the bridge—originally built in 1937—and enhancing safety conditions. In this case, a conventional replacement would require up to three years for construction, resulting in ongoing disruptions to Massachusetts Avenue as well as Commonwealth Avenue crossing underneath.\nAccelerated bridge construction helped ensure limited disruption during the rehabilitation of Boston’s Massachusetts Avenue over Commonwealth Avenue, which sees an average of 22,000 daily drivers.\nAs a key artery in Boston with a 22,000 average daily traffic estimate, the team was challenged with maintaining traffic (for vehicles, buses, bicyclists, and pedestrians) and utilities during construction. As a result, we utilized ABC to ensure accessible traffic lanes on Massachusetts Avenue and limited public disruption. A unique aspect to this project involved the relocation of all utilities away from the bridge before demolition and replacement could occur. Once complete, work was accomplished over Mother’s Day weekend, with the contractor ultimately being able to open Massachusetts Avenue to traffic one day ahead of schedule.\nWhile the concept of ABC is easy—build a bridge off-site in the biggest pieces possible to allow you to assemble it on-site in the shortest amount of time—the condensed timeframe requires a very experienced engineered approach to coordinating all pieces in a temporary bridge closure. Done well, this results in satisfied drivers, rail commuters, bicyclists, and walkers, who experience minimal disruptions to their daily lives.\nAbout the AuthorMore Content by Walter Heller"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c1ad4a02-d63c-4af8-af90-3513a0cd1484>"],"error":null}

Flowers are borne on a panicle 1 m long, rising from the base of the leaves. Flowers resemble elongated broccoli and there can be 3 or 4 per plant. Individual flowers are green, sessile, densely packed, apetalous and only 1 mm long. A plant can produce hundreds of drupes which are reddish, oblong, 1.5 to 2 mm long, each containing a single ovoid seed of approximately 1.2 mm by 1.5 mm and weighing about 4 mg.\nIn which habitats\nThe plant is found on coastal cliffs, riparian zones, forests and wetlands as well as in areas that have been transformed by human activity such as former agricultural fields, quarries and road sides. According to the Corine Land Cover nomenclature, the following habitats are invaded: mixed forests, broad-leaved forests; inland wetlands (marshes, peat bogs); coastal wetlands; banks of continental water, riverbanks/canalsides (dry river beds); road and rail networks and associated land; other artificial surfaces (wastelands); green urban areas, including parks, gardens, sport and leisure facilities.\nBiology and ecology\nG. tinctoria is a geophyte that grows in temperate areas with high rainfall. It can occupy a variety of habitats but prefers moist soils (it establishes less often on well drained sandy or stony soils), and tolerates seasonally water logged wet soils. It also tolerates salt spray and can grow at the high tide mark in coastal areas. The plant also forms a symbiosis with nitrogen fixing Cyanobacteria (genus Nostoc) present inside its cells.\nThe plant is perennial but it is deciduous or semi-deciduous under harsh winter conditions. During winter, it may die back but new leaves are produced in spring. Growth starts in early spring (e.g. in March in Ireland), prior to the emergence of native species. Under cold conditions, the plant may take 3 years to reach its maximum height, and flowers only after 3 to 5 years. The plant blooms early in spring and flowers last at least for a month. It is wind pollinated, although hymenopterans, in particular bees, are reported to pollinate the plant in New Zealand. Fruits mature in late summer-early autumn. A single plant can produce 250 000 seeds per year. Seeds have a very high germination rate, but are not expected to have a very long viability although the plant is reported to be able to form a large and persistent soil seed bank. The species can also grow from stem fragments or from rhizomes. These rhizomes can increase by 15 cm annually when established. Seed germination occurs from spring through summer.\nThe plant is used as an ornamental waterside plant. The thousands of seeds produced are naturally dispersed by water and birds. Anthropogenic activities such as clearing ditches, road building and movement of soil may also spread the plant.\nThe huge leaves of G. tinctoria which grows in colonies shade out any plant or animal present beneath. The formation of almost monospecific stands of G. tinctoria leads to changes in plant communities in Western Ireland, and the species-rich native grasslands are replaced by a sparse cover of dicotyledonous plants (which are not found in uninfested grasslands). G. tinctoria also replaces Salix cinerea (Salicaceae) in Great Britain, thus altering the process of natural vegetation succession. In New Zealand, G. tinctoria is reported to affect nationally threatened plant species or uncommon species on coastal cliffs. Furthermore, it colonizes habitats of high ecological importance. In the United Kingdom it indeed occurs in mires, heaths, wet grasslands and along watercourses, including habitats which are of patrimonial value. In the Azores, it is found in nature reserves and colonizes conservation habitats: the Macaronesian laurel forest and the endemic forests with Juniperus spp. However, the species exhibits different invasiveness behaviour across these different countries and in different situations.\nThe species can also block drains and streams and obstruct access to natural and recreational areas. It may cause erosion when colonizing steep areas, and increase the risk of flooding. The species is also reported to create a negative visual impact on the landscape.\nG. tinctoria is difficult to control as the environments in which it grows may be difficult to access (e.g. steep slopes).\nFlower heads should be removed and destroyed as soon as possible, in particular near streams or sites of high conservation value. Concerning chemical treatments, the highest efficacy was obtained when herbicides were sprayed early in the growing season before seed could mature. Satisfactory results have been obtained in New Zealand with triclopyr 600 EC as it had fewer impacts on adjacent desirable plants. Cutting the leaves and flower stalks at the base and applying manually 25% glyphosate has also shown satisfactory results. The plant can be controlled by mechanical means, but it is imperative to remove the entire rhizome as small pieces of it can re-sprout. Monitoring of management actions should be undertaken within a year to ensure that the population is diminishing.\nGioria M & Osborne BA (2013) Biological of the British Isles: Gunnera tinctoria.

A very typical candelabra Primula it has stunning whorled tiers of beautiful white flowers standing majestically above striking mid-green luxuriant foliage.\nThis hardy, long-lived plant will become enormous in rich moist soil, producing golden-eyed ivory white flowers on thick, strong stems, and is almost certainly the most impressive of all of the tall white primulas.\nPrimula japonica is beautiful plant for a mixed border and good choice for a woodland garden. It enjoys moist, acidic to neutral soil in a partially shaded spot and is is very tolerant of the wettest heavy soils, in fact it will thrive under such conditions.\nFlowering time is May and height at its peak is 60cm (24in). Primula japonica forms a large clump which is easily divided and will self seed if given damp dappled conditions. It will grow in full light in the bog garden but given some dappled shade will grow in most situations where the soil remains moist at all times.\nPrimula japonica 'Postford White' has been awarded the prestigious RHS Award of Garden Merit (AGM).\nSowing: Sow seeds in late spring/early summer or late summer/autumn.\nPrimula seeds need a period of cold and damp to enable them to germinate. Sow on the surface of seed compost, cover with grit and keep in a shaded cold-frame or cool glasshouse.\nSow seed 2.5cm (1in) apart in trays or cells containing seed compost. Sow the seeds on the surface of the compost, (Do not cover - they need light to germinate) and place in a light position at a regular temperature of around 16°C (60°F) Germination should take place between 21 and 40 days.\nPrimula seeds can also be sown during warmer times of the year, but it would be necessary to artificially simulate “winter” using the following method of “stratification”:\nPlace the seeds between two pieces of damp filter paper or folded kitchen roll then put into a polythene bag and place this into the fridge at 4°C (39°F) which is the temperature that most fridges are set at. Inspect the seeds after two weeks and remove as the seedlings appear, returning the ungerminated seeds to the fridge.\nAlthough most seeds should germinate in 4 to 5 weeks, germination can be erratic, it is not unknown for seeds still to be germinating up to two years after sowing. Remove the seedlings and place the pot in a shaded corner of the garden….just in case!\nWhen seedlings have their first pair of true leaves and are large enough to handle, transplant into 7.5cm (3in) pots containing peaty compost. Grow on then gradually acclimatise to outdoor conditions for 10 to 15 days before planting out. Plant them in a humus-rich, moisture retentive soil and in partial shade. Tolerates full sun if soil remains moist at all times.\nThe important factor is that the roots should not dry out, so incorporate plenty of organic matter when you plant, mulch well in autumn and spring and water regularly if they are in the open.\nCut back after flowering. Once established, they benefit from being lifted and divided every two years in early spring.\nAllow this Primula to seed down and you will get a colourful array of seedlings to carpet the moist area.\nShade and Woodland Gardens. Bog, ponds and streams. Wildlife and Pollinators.\nPrimulas are one of the most popular species of plants which are seen in gardens. There are at least 425 species with over 300 of them found in Asia. 33 more are found in Europe and 20 found in North America.\nThe genus Primrose is ultimately derived from Old French primerose or medieval Latin prima rosa, meaning “first rose\".( Latin primus - meaning ‘first’ and Rosa for Rose). Primroses flowers in early spring, one of the earliest spring flowers in much of Europe.\nThe species name japonica simply means that it originates from Japan.\nPrimula japonica is a 'proliferae' type of primula, the word derives from 'proliferate', meaning to increase in number rapidly, which refers to the whorls of flowers. They are also commonly called Candelabra section primulas.\nCandelabra primulas take their name from the fact that the flowers on the plants in this group are arranged in whorls set at intervals up an otherwise bare stem. The general effect is like a candelabrum.\nPrimrose and Polyanthus are a diverse group of the Primulaceae, the Primula family. There are societies dedicated to single species that are centuries old and many other societies which have their roots in the Victorian era where several species where highly desirable for collections and collectors.\n- Additional Information\nPacket Size 20mg Average Seed Count 50 Seeds Seed Form Natural Seeds per gram 3,000 / gram Family Primulaceae Genus Primula Species japonica Cultivar Postford White Common Name Candelabra Primrose Other Common Names Japanese Candelabra Primrose Hardiness Hardy Perennial Flowers White Natural Flower Time April to July Foliage Mid green, oval, velvety, scalloped Height 45 to 60cm (18 to 24in) Spread 30-38cm (12 to 15in) Position Light Shade Soil Moist, fertile, humus rich soil"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:09508565-ff65-45b1-9137-ba78d45b6cca>","<urn:uuid:7e95c160-7d01-4f34-b9cd-231a338bc688>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do modern building practices address both energy efficiency and stormwater management requirements in urban developments?","answer":"Modern building practices address energy efficiency through multiple strategies including highly efficient mechanical systems, energy-efficient interior and exterior lighting, high-performance roof and wall insulation, and low-e coated windows. These measures can achieve energy use reductions of around 12.83%. Additionally, buildings can utilize green power through Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) to offset non-renewable energy use. For stormwater management, developments must comply with MS4 Permits, which require water quality treatment facilities and flow control facilities before discharging runoff. Green infrastructure solutions are increasingly being implemented, as they can manage the first inch of rainfall and remove up to 80% of total suspended solids. These systems are designed to complement existing gray infrastructure while reducing the volume of stormwater runoff and preventing pollutants from reaching downstream water bodies.","context":["Integrated design process. The Beck Group is a cross-discipline, integrated delivery firm that provided Architecture, Construction, and LEED management services for the CAMLS project. From the very beginning of the design process, the Beck team, the Owner, MEP engineers, and other key team members worked together on the building’s design and provided immediate feedback to each other on the full range of design and construction issues, including those related to sustainability and LEED certification. This helped to ensure that sustainable design considerations were included across the entire project, and that each team member had a stake in reaching the project’s certification goal.\nAlternative transportation. This facility is located within an existing urban fabric, surrounded by the dense Central Business District and within walking distance of numerous community services. A City parking garage is adjacent to the building’s entrance and provides bike storage that can accommodate those traveling to the building on bicycles. Reserved parking spaces for fuel-efficient vehicles and electric charging stations are also located in the parking garage. The city’s trolley system has a convenient stop in front of the building and there are numerous bus stops within ¼ mile walking distance connecting students, visitors and staff to the facility. Using public transportation reduces pollution and land development impacts from automobile use.\nLandscape. The site which was formally a paved parking lot has been restored to include green space, exceeding the local code requirements by more than 50%. Green space helps reduce heat island effect and promotes biodiversity. The native plants are drought tolerant and therefore do not require as much irrigation. Drip irrigation was utilized to reduce potable water use by 52%.\nUrban heat island effect. In addition to green space, the project team also reduced the urban heat island by installing reflective roofing materials and landscape paving. This strategy not only minimizes impacts on microclimates, it greatly reduces the heat gain on the building, thereby saving energy.\nStormwater Control. On-site management of storm water run-off is controlled by an underground chamber detention system, which allows slow percolation into the soil rather than into the city storm water treatment system. The run-off was reduced by 54% in the post development condition.\nWater conservation. By installing high efficiency toilets and urinals, low flow faucets, and low flow showerheads, we greatly reduced water consumption by 35%.\nCommissioning. The commissioning process includes all energy consuming systems in the building. As buildings become more complex and the desire for maximum efficiencies increase, it is critical that all integrated building components work seamlessly together to achieve the optimal performance of the design intent. This approach is the foundation of the commissioning process and ensures the building operates the way the Owner intended.\nBuilding’s energy use. A highly efficient mechanical system was installed and energy performance was improved further with energy saving strategies such as energy efficient interior and exterior lighting which are one of the biggest impacts of energy use in a building. Other building components that provide energy savings are high performance roof & wall insulation and high performance, low-e coated windows. A computer simulated model was used to determine potential energy savings, showing 12.83% in energy use reduction. These strategies help reduce the environmental and economic impacts associated with excessive energy use.\nGreen Power. 76% percent of the building’s electricity use is provided by green power through the purchase of Green-e Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). This not only offsets the non-renewable energy used by the building but it also encourages the development and use of grid-source, renewable energy technologies.\nRecycling centers. To facilitate the reduction of waste generated by the building occupants, recycling stations are conveniently located on all floors of the building for use by students, visitors, and staff.\nConstruction Methods. By utilizing best practices for construction methods, the construction team limited disturbance to the site and the surrounding occupied buildings. A comprehensive Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan was put in place for the site and a stringent Indoor Air Quality Plan for the building enclosure for all activities during construction.\nConstruction Waste. The design and construction team sought to minimize the use of materials and create attractive, low-maintenance spaces. The commitment to minimizing materials extended to minimizing waste, as approximately 55% of all construction waste was recycled, diverting the waste from the landfill, mitigating the detrimental effects of new construction.\nLow-impact finishes. All materials in the building include the installation of products with low volatile organic compound (VOC) content levels and formaldehyde-free materials. This was important to the Owner and design team because a building committed to health and education should include healthy indoor air quality.\nNatural daylighting, controllability. Abundant daylight is provided in all public areas and rooms that daylight would not interfere with medical research and training. Occupants have also been given individual control over lighting, further enhancing their comfort and well-being.\nRegional and recycled materials. This project used a total of 20% recycled materials. In addition, the project also used over 13% of materials extracted, processed and manufactured within 500 miles of the project. This not only helps support the regional economy but reduces the environmental impacts resulting from transportation.\nIndoor air quality. To reduce outdoor contaminants being introduced into the building, permanent walk-off mats have been installed at all main entrances of the building keeping the quality of the indoor environment as clean as possible. Facility cleaning and maintenance procedures often expose building occupants to toxic, potentially hazardous particulates and chemical pollutants. A comprehensive Green Housekeeping Policy is in place that includes requirements for Green Seal Certified cleaning materials and extensive training for personnel.","A city’s stormwater management goals are generally rooted in regulatory requirements for water quality under the Clean Water Act. City objectives and strategies vary based on the type and capacity of the sewer system, the risk of local flooding, and the need to comply with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits.\nSome cities discharge their stormwater into pipes that also receive and convey wastewater or sanitary sewer flows. These types of systems are called combined sewer systems and are most commonly found in older cities; new developments do not build combined sewer systems.\nCombined sewer systems are typically connected to wastewater treatment plants that then discharge treated water into a receiving water body. However, during heavy rains, water flows can overwhelm the infrastructure capacity. When pipes and treatment plants are unable to manage the flows, water is discharged directly into receiving water bodies without being treated, in an event called a Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO).\nDepending upon an agency’s permit requirements with EPA, the number of CSO events that can occur at each overflow point varies. Many agencies that have CSOs exceeding EPA’s overflow thresholds are utilizing bioretention facilities and other green stormwater infrastructure (with and without gray storage facilities) to come into regulatory compliance by reducing the volume of stormwater runoff that reaches the combined system, and therefore reducing the frequency and volume of CSO events.\nCurrent gray stormwater infrastructure guidelines require that stormwater runoff be collected and conveyed separately from sanitary sewer lines. In municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s), stormwater runoff is often discharged into receiving water bodies with limited or no water quality treatment.\nMost cities have MS4 Permits which require new development and redevelopment projects to install water quality treatment facilities and/or flow control facilities prior to discharging runoff into receiving water bodies. The permits may also require retrofits to existing sites or streets to treat and reduce runoff.\nGreen stormwater infrastructure is a cost-effective way to come into compliance with regulatory requirements, as well as creating other ecological and social benefits. EPA strongly encourages the use of green infrastructure to manage stormwater and meet federal water quality requirements.1 Green infrastructure projects are generally designed to complement gray infrastructure systems performing a combination of volume management, water quality improvement, and flood control.\nSince the volume of stormwater runoff increases as impervious surface area increases, the two major strategies related to volume management are to increase pervious area or to divert runoff into the green infrastructure system. Green stormwater infrastructure systems are designed to convert surface area from impervious to permeable, and reduce the volume of runoff that reaches the sewer system or downstream water bodies, reducing the burden on gray infrastructure systems and infiltrating stormwater runoff directly back into the soil. Green infrastructure projects and programs set specific stormwater volume management goals, such as the first inch of rainfall on a given area.\nStormwater runoff from streets carries sediment, debris, chemicals, and pollutants (such as heavy metals from brake pads, oil dripping from engines, and grit from tires). Green stormwater infrastructure projects are designed to capture pollutants in runoff and prevent them from reaching downstream water bodies. Water quality treatment requirements vary based on the type of receiving water body (ocean, salt water bay, river, stream, wetland, or lake) as well as its existing condition. Green infrastructure projects often set a specific water quality goal, such as removing 80% of total suspended solids (TSS).\nEspecially heavy rainstorms can cause combined sewer overflow events as well as flooded streets, parking lots, private property, and basements. Green stormwater infrastructure programs aim to reduce peak flow rates and mitigate flooding. Cities may design to accommodate the high runoff flows and flood risks of a given peak storm event, such as a ten-year storm (a storm that has a 10% chance of occurring in any given year)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b93ed527-f0d5-4a85-86b4-4f96b390d3aa>","<urn:uuid:10175a4b-564b-49ad-be9e-f7aad535ddef>"],"error":null}

The route is approximately two kilometers long and takes about twenty-five minutes to walk. It features natural visual clues that indicate remaining distance and meeting time, and participants can start their walking meetings at various meeting points located at different buildings.","context":["The challenges addressed in this theme are complex and extensive: Can we assess and model the impact of technology on urban planning to enable scenario studies? How can we embed technological innovations such as sensor networks, big data, mobile devices and apps, internet and social media in the design of physical spaces, and what functionality should they enable? How can smart city technologies contribute to solving pressing societal urban agenda’s? Think for example of redesigning often obsolete recreational peoples parks to promote physical activity and counter the 21st epidemics of wealth: obesity, burn-outs and dementia.\nTo complete the scientific cycle of observation, hypothesis, experiment, analysis and conclusion in the field of urban spaces, it is crucial to have access to a city or a campus that can act as a living lab.

While smart cycling innovations promise to increase cycling’s modal share in the (peri-)urban transport system even further, little is understood of their impact or cost and benefit. The Smart Cycling Futures program investigates how smart cycling innovations including ICT-enabled cycling innovations, infrastructures, and social innovations like new business models, contribute to more resilient and livable Dutch urban regions.\nCycling innovations benefit urban regions in terms of accessibility, equality, health, livability, and decreasing CO2-emissions. To facilitate a transition to a sustainable future that responds to pressing issues, the SCF research project runs urban living labs in close collaboration with key stakeholders to develop transdisciplinary insights in the conditions needed for upscaling smart-cycling initiatives.\nThe research program brings together four Dutch regions through academic institutions, governmental authorities on an urban and regional level, and market players. Together, they answer practice-based questions in a transdisciplinary and problem-oriented fashion. In Eindhoven, one PhD tries to answer the question how urban design can contribute to a delightful biking experience. The other PhD student focuses on the role users can play in the governance system controlling bicycle infrastructure and policy.\nVitality of office workers\nIntegrate daily exercise in your work\nProlonged sitting time in adults has become a major societal issue with far-reaching health, economic, and social consequences.

{"question":"How do CLARITY and C2c2 compare as revolutionary tools for studying biological systems - what are their key capabilities in manipulating tissue and RNA respectively?","answer":"CLARITY and C2c2 represent different but groundbreaking approaches for studying biological systems. CLARITY transforms intact tissue into an optically transparent and permeable hydrogel-hybridized form that can undergo immunostaining and high-resolution 3-D imaging without damage. It allows visualization of long-range projections and subcellular structures while maintaining the global perspective necessary to understand system function. Meanwhile, C2c2 is a CRISPR-Cas system that selectively targets and cuts up RNA, allowing gene silencing and potentially RNA tracking in cells. C2c2 can be modified to bind to RNA without cutting it, enabling the tracking of RNA movement in cells to study how alterations affect the cell or organism as a whole. Both tools have opened new possibilities in their respective areas - CLARITY in tissue visualization and C2c2 in RNA manipulation and study.","context":["Karl Deisseroth, MD PhD, D.H. Chen Professor of Bioengineering and Psychiatry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\nResearch Description: Dr. Deisseroth is Professor of Bioengineering with a joint appointment in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. His group is renowned for development and application of applied high-resolution tools for controlling (e.g. optogenetics) and observing (e.g. CLARITY, next-generation fiber photometry, next-generation light sheet microscopy) specific elements of intact biological systems. His group has developed and applied these and other tools for the study of physiology and behavior in health and disease, and supported researchers at Stanford and around the world by disseminating the reagents and techniques. These optical methodologies have greatly advanced the exchange of high-resolution information with intact tissue, including from adult mammalian brains and human pancreas. For example, CLARITY is a technique developed in his lab that transforms intact tissue into an optically transparent and permeable hydrogel-hybridized form, that can undergo immunostaining and high-resolution 3-D imaging without damage to the sample. This process allows for marking and visualization of long-range projections and subcellular structures, multiple rounds of molecular phenotyping, and is applicable to multiple tissue types and sizes with no disruption or thin sectioning required to visualize whole intact tissue samples. By clearing while preserving fine structural details, CLARITY provides a technique now in wide use, with many papers already published from other labs, for obtaining high-resolution information from complex systems while maintaining the global perspective necessary to understand system function. They have also developed advanced light-sheet and computational methodologies to collect and analyze these new kinds of intact-system data.

Submitted","Move over DNA, its RNA’s time to shine. A revolutionary RNA-editing tool promises to transform our understanding of RNA’s role in our growth and development, and provide a new avenue for treating infectious diseases and cancer.\nRNA was once thought to be a mere middleman, carrying genetic messages from the DNA in the nucleus out to cellular structures called ribosomes, where it directs the production of proteins. In recent decades we have learned that it does much more, from controlling what form a protein will take to influencing whether a particular gene is able to generate a protein.\nIn other words, although we might think that we are governed by our DNA, it is really RNA that pulls the strings. So people are understandably keen to develop tools to study, track and even manipulate RNA inside living cells.\nIn 2013, a team led by Feng Zhang at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard – and another team working independently – figured out how to manipulate a genetic bacterial immune system that can identify and attack an invading pathogen by snipping up sections of its DNA. This CRISPR-Cas system from the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes is now being used to target and cut up DNA sequences – including those in human cells.\nNow Zhang’s team has discovered another version of the CRISPR-Cas system in a bacterium called Leptotrichia shahii. Only this one, called C2c2, selectively cuts up RNA.\nTo show its promise, Zhang’s team inserted C2c2 into E. coli bacteria, where it silenced a gene by cutting up a form of RNA that carries the gene’s information to the ribosomes.\nSilencing genes with C2c2 could make pathogens harmless, says John Rossi at City of Hope medical centre in Duarte, California, who is leading efforts to use RNA molecular tools to fight HIV.\nC2c2 should be able to do more than silence genes. It can also be modified so it binds to RNA but doesn’t cut it up, says Zhang. This means that it could conceivably form part of an editing system to tag RNA so that its movement in the cell can be tracked. This would allow us to alter RNA in a living system and track what effect those alterations are having on the cell or animal as a whole.\n“RNA is the blueprint through which genes regulate cellular processes,” says Oliver Rackham at the University of Western Australia. “The exciting thing about this study is that it now opens up the RNA world to the ease of experimental design afforded by CRISPR.”\nRackham is interested in how using C2c2 to target a specific E. coli RNA led to “collateral damage” – RNAs that looked a little like the target molecule were attacked too. Although it might be useful to reduce that collateral damage for some applications, he says it could prove beneficial in others – in a cancer treatment, for example, wiping out “bystander” RNA as well as target RNA might offer a more effective way to fight a tumour.\nThe tool shop\nThere is such a hunger for RNA tools that earlier this year, Gene Yeo at the University of California, San Diego, and Jennifer Doudna at the University of California, Berkeley, used some hefty synthetic modifications on the existing CRISPR-Cas system to make it target RNA rather than DNA.\nDoudna and Yeo’s tool can already track RNA in mammalian cells, whereas the C2c2 system has so far only been tested in bacteria. But Zhang is confident that with further development C2c2 will be able to bind to mammalian RNAs without cleaving them too.\nBoth RNA editing tools will be useful, but C2c2 might be more versatile because it is based on a natural RNA targeting system rather than an engineered one.\nOne thing is clear, says Yeo. “This is the decade where RNA rears its head as being very important for understanding cellular behaviour and disease.”\nJournal reference: Science, DOI: 10.1126/science.aaf5573\nMore on these topics:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ac3a011b-d1a4-40fb-9cb8-06879657df6d>","<urn:uuid:12bf92e8-47a0-449b-a0d8-3a3b53c34383>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the Porter Diamond Model's concept of clusters compare with the economic concept of agglomeration economies? Please explain the key similarities in how they view business concentration.","answer":"The Porter Diamond Model's clusters and agglomeration economies both emphasize the benefits of business concentration, but describe them differently. In Porter's model, clusters of similar businesses stimulate each other to increase productivity, foster innovation, and improve business results, with examples like the Swiss watch industry. Similarly, agglomeration economies describe benefits of concentration through multiple mechanisms, including Marshall labor pooling (where workers with industry-specific skills are attracted to locations with greater concentration), shopping benefits (where multiple sellers attract more customers), and specialization advantages. Both concepts recognize that geographical concentration of related businesses creates competitive advantages through shared resources and knowledge.","context":["This article explains the Porter Diamond Model, developed by strategy guru Michael Porter in a practical way, including an example and a free downloadable template. After reading you will understand the basics of this powerful strategy and competitive advantage analysis tool.\nWhat is the Porter Diamond Model?\nThe American strategy professor Michael Porter developed an economic diamond model for (small-sized) businesses to help them understand their competitive position in global markets. This Porter Diamond Model, also known as the Porter Diamond theory of National Advantage or Porters double diamond model, has been given this name because all factors that are important in global business competition resemble the points of a diamond. Michael Porter assumes that the competitiveness of businesses is related to the performance of other businesses. Furthermore, other factors are tied together in the value-added chain in a long distance relation or a local or regional context.\nPorter Diamond Model clusters\nMichael Porter uses the concept of clusters of identical product groups in which there is considerable competitive pressure. Businesses within clusters usually stimulate each other to increase productivity, foster innovation and improve business results. Companies operating in such clusters work according to Porter Diamond Model.\nIn addition, they have the advantage that they can move very well on the international market and that they can maintain their presence and handle international competition. Examples of large clusters are the Swiss watch industry and the Hollywood film industry.\nOrganisations can use the Porter’s Diamond Model to establish how they can translate national advantages into international advantages. The Porter Diamond Model suggests that the national home base of an organization plays an important role in the creation of advantages on a global scale. This home base provides basic factors that support an organization, including government support but they can also hinder it from building advantages in global competition. The determinants that Michael Porter distinguishes are:\n1. Factor Conditions\nThis is the situation in a country relating to production factors like knowledge and infrastructure. These are relevant factors for competitiveness in particular industries. These factors can be grouped into material resources- human resources (labour costs, qualifications and commitment) – knowledge resources and infrastructure. But they also include factors like quality of research or liquidity on stock markets and natural resources like climate, minerals, oil and these could be reasons for creating an international competitive position.\n2. Related and supporting Industries\nThe success of a market also depends on the presence of suppliers and related industries within a region. Competitive suppliers reinforce innovation and internationalization. Besides suppliers, related organizations are of importance too. If an organization is successful this could be beneficial for related or supporting organizations. They can benefit from each other’s know-how and encourage each other by producing complementary products.\n3. Home Demand Conditions\nIn this determinant the key question is: What reasons are there for a successful market? What is the nature of the market and what is the market size? There always exists an interaction between economies of scale, transportation costs and the size of the home market. If a producer can realize sufficient economies of scale, this will offer advantages to other companies to service the market from a single location. In addition the question can be asked: what impact does this have on the pace and direction of innovation and product development?\n4. Strategy, Structure and Rivalry\nThis factor is related to the way in which an organization is organized and managed, its corporate objectives and the measure of rivalry within its own organizational culture. The Furthermore, it focuses on the conditions in a country that determine where a company will be established. Cultural aspects play an important role in this. Regions, provinces and countries may differ greatly from one another and factors like management, working morale and interactions between companies are shaped differently in different cultures. This could provide both advantages and disadvantages for companies in a certain situation when setting up a company in another country. According to Michael Porter domestic rivalry and the continuous search for competitive advantage within a nation can help organizations achieve advantages on an international scale. In addition to the above-mentioned determinants Michael Porter also mentions factors like Government and chance events that influence competition between companies.\nGovernments can play a powerful role in encouraging the development of industries and companies both at home and abroad. Governments finance and construct infrastructure (roads, airports) and invest in education and healthcare. Moreover, they can encourage companies to use alternative energy or alternative environmental systems that affect production. This can be effected by granting subsidies or other financial incentives.\n6. Chance events\nMichael Porter also indicates that in most markets chance plays an important role. This provides opportunities for innovative companies that are not afraid to start up new operations. Entrepreneurs usually start their companies in their homeland, without this having any economic advantages, whereas a similar start abroad would provide more opportunities.\nPorter Diamond Model example\nA few business analysts set-up a case about Mobile telecommunication.\n- Evolving mobile possibilities in relation with Internet.\n- Growing number of mobile owners. Mobile usage becomes cheaper and cheaper so it accessible for everybody.\n- Upcoming online businesses including App builders.\n- Government of county x stimulates Mobile Market regulation.\n- Government of county x puts continuous efforts in IT policies.\n- IT Workforce is developing and growing.\n- Level of Education on mobile and Internet technology is high.\n- County x has geographical IT advantages.\nRelated and supporting industry\n- This country is leading in the microchip market.\n- There are two countries that are trading partners.\n- The government is planning to invest in Mobile R&D and IT development.\n- County x is leading in all Mobile & IT related production.\nFirm strategy and structure\n- Venture firms with high IT technology.\n- Firm and small and medium size IT business companies.\n- Market competition in Mobile telecommunication.\n- Target niche market by continuous development and improvement of Mobile technology.\nBy using the Porter Diamond Model, an organization may identify what factors can build advantages at a national level. The Porter Diamond Model is therefore often used during internationalisation efforts. Michael Porter is of the opinion that all factors are decisive for the competitiveness of a company with respect to their foreign competitors. By considering these factors a company will be better able to formulate a strategic goal.\nPorter Diamond Model template\nIt’s Your Turn\nWhat do you think?

A nice definition is via Tim Chapin:\nThe economic base technique is grounded in the assumption that the local economy can be divided into two very general sectors: 1) a basic (or non-local) sector or 2) a non-basic (or local) sector.\nBasic Sector: This sector is made up of local businesses (firms) that are entirely dependent upon external factors. For example, Boeing builds and sells large airplanes to companies and countries located throughout the world. Their business is dependent almost entirely upon non-local firms. Boeing does not sell planes to families or households locally, so their business is very much dependent upon exporting their goods. Manufacturing and local resource-oriented firms (like logging or mining) are usually considered to be basic sector firms because their fortunes depend largely upon non-local factors, they usually export their goods.\nNon-basic Sector:The non-basic sector, in contrast, is composed of those firms that depend largely upon local business conditions. For example, a local grocery store sells its goods to local households, businesses, and individuals. Its clientele is locally based and, therefore, its products are consumed locally. Almost all local services (like drycleaners, restaurants, and drug stores) are identified as non-basic because they depend almost entirely on local factors.\nEconomic development practice is to entice/enhance “basic” industry. The example of Boeing is especially timely, given the recent issue of Boeing potentially moving airframe production if it didn’t get labor givebacks. I don’t imagine most of the places that Boeing was considering moving to have an airframe sector, or upstream or downstream vendors or customers, or a workforce skilled in airframe manufacturing, which would generate benefits beyond “jobs, jobs, jobs”. Similarly, ED advocates often argue for new infrastructure , despite at best weak evidence that in a mature (road, rail, transit) network there will be much accessibility gain, and thus little resulting economic development.\nBut the key point to remember from welfare economics is that everything is non-basic at a global level, and everything is basic at the household level. While it might be locally preferred to have more basic employment (we get money in exchange for stuff), that makes no difference on the global scale. Economic development practice is parochial (which is no surprise as it is funded by place-based local and state governments).\nYet that is not to say that local development is neither good nor bad. The reason it might actually be better to have local concentrations is because of various types of economies: in particular economies of scale of various kinds (including economies of agglomeration, which in places with very large employers, may all be internalized), and network economies. These economies produce spillovers, not just for the firm, but also for upstream and downstream supplies and customers, and potentially for competitors as well. I will call these Spillover Sectors.\nEconomies of scale mean that the cost goes down the more that is produced, (economies of scale are within firm, economies of agglomeration are within place, but between firms), so we can lower global costs if we specialize. The core reasons for this include large fixed costs associated with plants.\nReasons for Economies of agglomeration are also plentiful (from the Transportation Economics Wikibook):\n|Type of scale economy||Example|\n|Internal||1. Pecuniary||Being able to purchase intermediate inputs at volume discounts|\n|Technological||2. Static technological||Falling average costs because of fixed costs of operating a plant|\n|3. Dynamic technological||Learning to operate a plant more efficiently over time|\n|External or Agglomeration||Localization||Static||4. Shopping||Shoppers are attracted to places where there are many sellers|\n|5. Adam Smith Specialization||Outsourcing allows both the upstream input suppliers and downstream firms to profit from productivity gains because of specialization|\n|6. Marshall labor pooling||Workers with industry-specific skills are attracted to a location where there is a greater concentration.a|\n|Dynamic||7. Marshall-Arrow-Romer Learning-by-doing||Reductions in costs that arise from repeated and continuous production activity over time and which spill over between firms in the same place|\n|Urbanization||Static||8. Jane Jacobs innovation||The more that different things are done locally, the more opportunity there is for observing and adapting ideas from others|\n|9. Marshall labor pooling||Workers in an industry bring innovations to firms in other industries; similar to no. 6 above, but the benefit arises from the diversity of industries in one location.|\n|10. Adam Smith division of labor||Similar to no. 5 above, the main difference being that the division of labor is made possible by the existence of many different buying industries in the same place|\n|Dynamic||11. Romer endogenous growth.||The larger the market, the higher the profit; the more attractive the location to firms, the more jobs there are; the more labor pools there, the larger the market—and so on|\n|12. Pure agglomeration||Spreading fixed costs of infrastructure over more taxpayers; diseconomies arise from congestion and pollution|\nSource: World development report 2009: reshaping economic geography By World Bank, Adapted from Kilkenny, Maureen (1998) “Economies of Scale” Lecture for Economics 376, Rural, Urban, and Regional Economics, Iowa State University, Ames Iowa\nEconomies of scale are so pervasive we don’t notice them. Every road is an instance of economies of scale, we walk/ride/drive along roads because it is faster than going across unimproved space, even though it is less direct, but we individually could not afford to build the road, so we share the fixed costs with lots of people. The cost per person for roads is lower the more persons we spread the cost over. Economies of scale may also be played out (exhausted) at the margins we observe. Just because we had economies of scale in the roads we have built to date does not mean there are still economies of scale waiting to be picked up off the street like the proverbial $10 bill.\nTwo economists are walking down the street when one points to the ground and says, “Look, a ten dollar bill!”\nThe second economist replies, “That’s crazy. If that was a ten dollar bill someone would have picked it up already.”\nIn fact, most of the easy things have been done. Not to be as pessimistic as Tyler Cowan, but it is true that we pick the the projects with the highest Benefit/Cost ratios (low-hanging fruit) first, and work our way down-the list (up the tree), until the cost of building the project outweighs the benefits (the cost of getting the fruit outweighs the pleasures of consuming it). Clearly new projects are often on the low B/C side of the equation.\nNetwork economies mean that the value of something increases the more people who use it. These are also so pervasive we don’t always notice them. The more people who use MSP airport, the better the airport is for me, because it will have more flights. Roads are also examples of network economies, as the more people who use the road, the higher quality road we will build and the more accessibility (by auto) I will have. Thus we have interstate highways because we have hundreds of millions of drivers. If there were only one driver, even Bill Gates, we would not have an interstate system.\nSo to get back to types of employment. When doing economic development we should not be thinking about Basic vs. Non-basic. We should be thinking about employment that has benefits from concentration, either economies of scale and agglomeration, or network externalities, or both, and then working toward establishing concentrations of those sectors to maximize the benefits to society. This usually means considering where local strengths already are, rather than starting from scratch. Complement the existing rather than dropping in an alien business. The job multiplier from two jobs paying $75,000 may be the same, but the one in a spillover sector will lower costs for others in the sector and/or improve benefits. It means not going after projects just because they generate jobs, but encouraging firms to relocate into specialist concentrations where there are spillover benefits from those concentrations.\nIn contrast, sectors which have losses with concentration (think natural monopolies, where competitors split the market so that no firm can recover fixed costs), should be encouraged to remain dispersed."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:87450481-4bad-4ea8-85d9-57d30a4b3304>","<urn:uuid:a6065e4f-1e4f-4a71-8bfb-284a5dc07f7c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the traditional benefits of arbitration for businesses, and how are modern technologies transforming this dispute resolution method?","answer":"Arbitration traditionally offers businesses several key benefits: it allows disputes to be handled discreetly, helps avoid litigation expenses, provides swift resolution, ensures privacy, and gives parties control over the proceedings through negotiable clauses. Both parties can share their narratives, and the process is overseen by neutral arbitrators who follow a code of ethics. As for technological transformation, recent developments include AI integration in arbitration proceedings, with systems that can improve dispute resolution efficiency by nearly four times. These AI assistants can perform tasks like intelligent case acceptance, multilingual real-time translation, and blockchain recognition of evidence, as demonstrated by innovations like those at the Guangzhou Arbitration Commission.","context":["Internal disputes should be ideally dealt with in the most discreet manner. This is to avoid creating unnecessary disruptions in the workplace. Businesses can look into alternative dispute resolution to dodge litigation expenses while preventing the release of sensitive information externally. One type of alternative dispute resolution is arbitration.\nWhat is Arbitration?\nArbitration is an alternative to court, where a neutral third party can resolve disputes between parties. Instead of a costly lawsuit, it is typically used to settle issues discreetly and swiftly. Aside from privacy, it also offers both parties to share their narratives regarding the conflict. An arbitrator will decide, based on the information that is shared during arbitration, as to who will receive an arbitration award, which is similar to a ruling in court. This is because an arbitrator is analogous to a judge in court.\nWho are Arbitrators?\nAn arbitrator is appointed by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) so long as they follow the code of ethics of an arbitrator. This means that they have to be able to provide an unbiased decision based on their knowledge of the rules and language of arbitration and that they are able to provide sufficient time to see an arbitration through. They are to keep the privacy of the proceedings for the confidentiality of all the parties involved.\nArbitration in Business\nIt is important for any business, especially large ones, to consider including an arbitration clause in their contracts with other businesses, their employees, and their consumers. Technically, all disputes can be resolved through arbitration unless it is otherwise specified in a public policy.\nArbitration is a prominent aspect of the legalities in business, and that is why there are arbitrators who specialize in corporate law. These days, people can reach seasoned arbitrators on reputable law websites, such as duxtonhill.net. The prior experience of these experts in the different documents about arbitration will help create a sense of protection for all parties signatory to an arbitration clause. This is crucial, as hiring a third party to conduct the proceeding is one of the ways that neutrality is observed. There is no security risk involved since, as mentioned earlier, they adhere to a code of ethics that outlines the importance of being discreet and providing their clients with sought-out privacy.\nThe other aspect of arbitration that makes it favorable to both parties is that they have party control. That means the terms of a clause regarding arbitration can be discussed and negotiated. Revisions can be made until both parties are amenable to the clauses on the proceeding. Moreover, this will allow better transparency in any legal process that might occur through an arbitration. In instances where there is a breach of an agreement regarding the proceedings, both parties are to appear in front of a court where a stay of proceedings can be ruled. That means that the trial can be halted or suspended indefinitely.\nInternal problems in the workplace are unavoidable. The good thing is that arbitration will provide companies with discretion and resolution to keep the peace. Arbitration issues in a business can vary from assault to complaints issued by a consumer. As businesses aim to reduce costs, this method of alternative dispute resolution is a common practice due to its previously discussed effectiveness in terms of costs, time, and the nature of negotiating arbitration clauses.\nWorld-Class Arbitration in Singapore\nAs Singapore is an international business hub, it is an ideal location for resolving disputes due to its comprehensive legal framework and its political neutrality. The advancements on the island provide clients with facilities and technology that create an environment adaptive to arbitration. It can also issue arbitration awards in over 150 countries. The aforementioned advantages of arbitration are heightened in Singapore for all of these reasons.\nOverall, there are numerous advantages to incorporating arbitration as a method of alternative dispute resolution. It is a substitute to a strenuous legal process by giving everyone a means to be heard in a timely manner for fewer costs. Conflicts in businesses are just one aspect among many that proper arbitration can resolve. It is a means by which other fixes between family members or even communities can be sorted out.\nArbitration is one level below litigation on the spectrum of alternative dispute resolution. This is one of the reasons why it is preferred among other processes. Each conflict is subject to different methods. Depending on the situation, other forms of alternative dispute resolution may be needed. That is why there is a need to seek the services of experienced arbitrators.","Submissions are due March 15 for the 24th International ODR Forum.

{"question":"How do soluble and insoluble fibers differ in their effects on digestion, and what role does fiber timing play in weight management for combat sports athletes?","answer":"Soluble fibers dissolve in water and form a gel-like substance that slows digestion, increases transit time, and can help regulate blood glucose. Insoluble fibers don't dissolve but act like a sponge for water, increasing fecal bulk and reducing transit time through the intestinal tract. For combat sports athletes managing weight, fiber timing becomes crucial - high fiber intake close to competition can interfere with the replenishment process after weigh-ins. Athletes need to focus on quick-absorbing carbohydrates post weigh-in rather than high-fiber foods, as fiber can slow down nutrient absorption and cause gastrointestinal discomfort that could impair performance.","context":["FIBER - A DELICATE BALANCE FOR ATHLETES\nUpdated: Feb 2\nBy Annie Bothma, November 2022\nFibre intake is associated with many health benefits, but too much of a good thing can actually cause a lot of negative health consequences like GI upset, low-energy availability, reduced absorption and even micronutrient deficiencies. Therefore, the total and timing of dietary fibre intake for athletes becomes a delicate balance.\nWHAT IS HEALTHY FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION IS NOT ALWAYS HEALTHY FOR ATHLETES\nGovernmental guidelines recommend that, generally, a healthy, balanced diet to the general public is one that should remain low in sodium and refined sugar and rich in fibre to reduce the risk of weight gain, developing chronic metabolic, cardiovascular diseases and cancer (Public HealthEngland, 2016).\nHowever, these same recommendations may negatively impact the performance and health of an athlete by not meeting the metabolic and physiological demands of high-training loads and competition (Burke et al. 2019). What is “healthy” for the general public may not be healthy or appropriate for optimal performance in athletes in the context of an athlete’s current training schedule, goals and general health.\nFor example, a salad may be perfectly fine for inactive people who is trying to lose a bit of weight, but an athlete with a high-energy demand will not be able to meet their energy or carbohydrate requirements if they have a salad for a meal.\nWHAT EXACTLY IS FIBRE?\nFibre refers to non-digestible carbohydrates that are intrinsic and intact within plant-based sources, but can also be isolated naturally from plant and animal sources or synthetically manufactured.\nA fibre is determined as “good” and “excellent” if it contains 2.5g or 5g, respectively, when listed on the Nutrition Facts panel of a food product. Non-digestible carbohydrates vary in their chemical composition and physiological actions on the body and remain diverse within food supply. With nutrition labelling becoming standardized throughout the world, in 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) proposed the following definitions for fibre to clear up any confusion with what can and cannot be deemed a fibre:\nDietary fibre: Non-digestible carbohydrate and lignin that are intrinsic and intact in plants.\nFunctional fibre: Isolated, non-digestible carbohydrates that have beneficial effects in humans.\nTotal fibre: The sum of dietary fibre and functional fibre.\nSimilar to starch, polysaccharide fibres (primary source of dietary fibres) exhibit long-chains of monosaccharide residues linked together by glycosidic bonds. Whereas starch is linked by alpha-bonds, fibre is linked by beta-bonds. This subtle difference in the chemical structure of glycosidic bonds poses a challenge for the human digestive system. The chemical composition of fibre, once digested, is left intact, with no human digestive enzymes capable of hydrolyzing beta-bonds.\nTherefore, the sugars resist absorption in the small intestine with some fibre (insoluble), delivering no nutrients and next to nothing calories. The undigested fibre enters the large intestine and may be completely or partially fermented by gut microbiota; whereby a small amount contributes energy to the body (non-digestible oligosaccharides yielding a calorie value of 1-2 kcal/g) (Livesey, 1992).\nThis means eating high-fibre carbohydrate foods like bran muffins, cereals or wholewheat grains, will not give you the same amount of carbohydrates like low-fibre carbohydrates such as white rice, pasta or bread.\nDIFFERENT TYPES OF FIBRE\nFibres are by no means an independent thing; instead, they vary in their physiochemical properties: water-holding capacity, viscosity, binding ability, bulking ability, and fermentability. However, for simplicity, fibres are broadly characterized and distinguished by their capacity to dissolve in water.\nFibres are classified as soluble or insoluble fibre.\nSoluble fibers dissolve in water, whereas insoluble fibres do not. Soluble fibre bypasses the digestion process of the small intestine, undergoing fermentation by microflora in the large intestine. Soluble fibre can be further distinguished by its viscosity, with some forming agelatinous, viscous substance whereas others remain non-viscous. Viscous refers to its fibre thickening effects and increased resistance transit through the digestive tract.\nSOURCES OF SOLUBLE FIBRE INCLUDE:\nViscous fibres increase the transit time through the human digestive tract, causing a delay in gastric emptying, resulting in a sensation of fullness (Slavin & Green, 2007). A delay in gastric emptying may also reduce a rise in blood glucose after a meal and potentially have beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity (Slavin, 2013). Furthermore, viscous fibres can impinge on the absorption of dietary fat and cholesterol, along with the hepatic metabolism of cholesterol and bile acids, leading to a reduction in plasma cholesterol concentrations (Samaan, 2017).\nInsoluble fibres do not form gel-like substances, but they can act as a sponge for water. Insoluble fibres are less prone to fermentation in the large intestine compared to soluble fibres. Insoluble fibres are distinguished by their low density and high porosity. These properties increase fecal bulk, the excretion of bile acids and softening of stool, reducing the transit time through the intestinal tract. The fermentable properties indicates the extent at which dietary fibre is degraded by gut microbiota within the colon into short-chain fatty acids.\nSOURCES OF INSOLUBLE FIBRE:\nWhole-grains and Whole-wheat flour\nCereals such as Fiber One and All-Bran\nWheat bran rusks\nVegetables, such as cauliflower, green beans and potatoes\nHOW MUCH FIBRE DO YOU NEED PER DAY?\nFibre is commonly regarded as an overlooked nutrient, due to no deficiency state being determined. At present, the Adequate Intake (AI) level for dietary fibre of 14g of fibre per 1000 calories of energy consumed or 25 g for adult women and 38 g for adult men is based on the median amount shown to achieve the lowest risk to coronary heart disease (Dahl & Stewart, 2015).\nAs athletes, if you consume mostly homemade whole-foods instead of packaged and highly processed take-outs you will likely meet your daily fibre requirements. That is why it is fine for athletes to sometimes eat refined carbohydrates - you don't always have to pick the whole grain option!\nIn fact, most athletes do not have to go out of their way to try consume more fibrous foods; simply by consuming adequate calories to meet your daily energy-requirements will allow you to meet your daily dietary fiber intake.\nTHE FIBRE PARADOX\nThe health benefits of a diet rich in fibre transcend beyond its role in easing digestion through increased laxation. Additionally, it is associated with a reduction in the risk to cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, improved glucose management, body weight regulation, immune function and improved gut microflora (Slavin 2013). However, at certain times fibre may be detrimental to an athlete's performance and even health.\nAthletes who consume a high-fibre diet in close-proximity to training or competition may impair sports performance through:\nAccelerated Fluid Losses due to increased bowel movements.\nGastrointestinal Discomfort such as increased gas production, cramping and bloating.\nReduced Energy Availability due to insufficient calorie intake.\nLower carbohydrate Intake which may lead to reduced muscle glycogen re-synthesis and delayed recovery.\nInhibit the absorption of minerals (such as iron, calcium, magnesium and zinc), which can each independently impact the performance and health status of an athlete.\nTotal fibre intake and fibre timing is something that all athletes need to consider, but those on a plant-based diet that are consuming high volumes of fibrous foods, may be at an increased risk of excessive fibre intake.\nDespite the far-reaching beneficial health effects of fibre, diets containing large amounts may provide gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating and flatulence (in particular, non-digestible oligosaccharides and resistant starch), increase fluid losses due to increased bowel regularity, reduce the energy density of a diet leading to low energy availability and inhibit the absorption of minerals (iron, calcium, magnesium and zinc); which can each independently impact the performance and health status of an athlete during competition or phases of a macrocycle with high training loads.\nNutrition plays a decisive role in determining the health status of an athlete. The maintenance of a well-functioning immune system, avoiding illness, injury, and fatigue are all by-products of a well-tailored nutrition plan which support the maintenance of athletic performance. This is why athletes should consider working with a sports nutritionist who can help them strategically periodize their fibre intake in accordance with the demands of their sport event.\nRemember, you can get too much of a good thing!\nSport Nutrition, Third Edition. (2019) by Asker Jeukendrup, Micheal Gleeson","Wrestlers and fighters lower weight for competitors to allow them to have a bonus in fight. Whether or not you are a youth, highschool, school or skilled athlete, being the most important competitor in your weight class could make all of the distinction in profitable or shedding the match. This typically entails speedy weight slicing for the weigh-in, adopted by replenishing the physique again to its regular weight or ideally even heavier, hopefully providing you with a dimension and power benefit. Whereas slicing weight will get you into the match, the replenishment course of is equally as necessary as it’ll positively affect your efficiency. Consuming junk meals or quick meals straight after laborious weight-reduction plan or fasting is like emptying your automotive’s engine after which refilling it with sand or contaminated fuel. The primary gas you place in your physique after emptying will probably be precisely what’s used for its first run; the meals decisions you make will decide whether or not you shine or fuel on the mat.\nWith regards to efficiency vitamin, timing is equally necessary as what you eat. Athletes who get to weigh within the day earlier than their competitors have an incredible benefit over those that should compete an hour or two later. Relying on how extreme the burden lower, it may possibly take as much as 12 hours (or longer) to get fully replenished again as much as a desired physique weight. With the proper meals, technique and planning, this course of could be carried out successfully a lot sooner, nonetheless the longer it’s important to get better from a tough weight lower the higher. It’s normal for highschool wrestlers to weigh in Friday afternoon to compete on Friday evening, need to make weight once more Saturday morning for an additional match all day Saturday. Usually when that is the case, the athlete is given an allowance of 1-Three lbs. for the Saturday meet, nonetheless it is a state of affairs that have to be managed rigorously. Replenishment for the Friday competitors have to be managed so it is efficient however not sufficient to throw off their weight lower for the subsequent day.\nAfter weighing in, select meals that shall be absorbed rapidly and supply the most effective gas on your upcoming efficiency. Whereas protein is extraordinarily mandatory throughout the weight lower to forestall the lack of muscle mass, it has little place within the replenishment course of. Protein is not going to provide the vitality you must carry out on the mat and can solely take up room in your abdomen. Carbohydrates are the most effective forms of meals to eat for an upcoming competitors after a weight lower. Nonetheless keep away from easy sugars which can be overly processed like sweet, cookies, snack truffles, Little Debbies, and so forth. Meals like this gives you an uncontrolled quick spike of vitality adopted by a crash of sleepiness and lethargy. Select carbohydrates from two completely different classes to replenish the physique with good weight and the most effective, most usable gas. Clear, starchy carbs comparable to candy potatoes and rice are glorious for filling the muscular tissues with glycogen for even launched vitality for use within the subsequent few hours of the meet. Breads and bagels are secondary decisions nonetheless are candy and filling and in addition work properly.\nFor sooner vitality, contemporary, juicy fruit is nice and really rejuvenating to the wrestler who’s survived an arduous weight lower. Apples, grapes and oranges are candy, scrumptious and satisfying when in season. Bananas and prunes are additionally full of potassium and pure sugar for use for vitality within the subsequent hour of efficiency. Different meals which can be good fast vitality decisions for replenishing the physique are graham crackers, animal crackers and even yogurt nonetheless these are secondary and shouldn’t be crammed up on. Whereas fat are filling and satisfying to eat, they need to be eaten in very small quantities and even prevented as they are going to decelerate the absorption of sugars wanted for vitality. Too many will even give the wrestler a heavy, sluggish feeling of their intestine. Wrestlers consuming peanut butter sandwiches on white bread is a typical sight at many tournaments, nonetheless that is an error. Whereas this meals is good, filling and straightforward to repair, peanut butter can sit heavy in a wrestler’s abdomen whereas the gluten within the white bread slows the motility of the intestine to a standstill.\nFor the quickest and most full replenishment after a weight lower, divide your carbs into quite a lot of small meals and check out to withstand gorging your self. Forcing an excessive amount of meals into the intestine at one time will give it greater than it may possibly deal with and trigger a brief blockage, slowing down absorption and making the athlete sick, generally feeling heavy, torpid and even nauseous. If the athlete needed to prohibit water to make his weight, the very first thing in his mouth must be at the least 16 oz. of water, then he can begin consuming. A fantastic technique is to mix each easy and complicated carbs in a managed quantity over a time frame. For instance, after consuming water the primary meal could be 1½ – 2 cups of white rice with honey and a bit of contemporary fruit. Sixty to ninety minutes later, eat one other 1½ cups of white rice + honey, some graham crackers and extra water. For a 3rd meal, eat extra carbs primarily nonetheless go forward and add some protein as properly. An instance could be one other 1½ cups white rice + honey, a tangerine and Three-Four oz. of lean turkey breast.\nFeeding the physique small meals of dry carbs mixed with consuming water like it will shuttle glycogen and fluid into the muscular tissues rapidly and successfully. After the physique has gone with out meals and/or water for Eight-12 hours (frequent follow for slicing weight), the gas we put into it straight after will decide its upcoming efficiency. Replenishing with this technique leaves athletes energized and able to go after the primary 1-2 meals; they really feel alert and light-weight, not slowed down by a bunch of heavy meals laden with fats and preservatives of their intestine. Including a little bit of protein to the third meal helps to decelerate the absorption of the carbs after the muscular tissues have been replenished from the primary two. This may enable gas for later in addition to a extra full feeling that lasts a bit longer. After not consuming protein for this lengthy, it is also necessary to begin feeding the physique amino acids once more to assist muscular tissues get better after competing. The third meal also can include some fat if you’d like nonetheless higher with or without little or no as they’ve little to do with instant efficiency and solely act to sluggish you down.\nWhereas slicing weight could also be what will get you into the competitors, if you do not have a method of replenishment, you may be weak, drained and unable to carry out at your finest.\nUtilizing a method just like the one famous above will guarantee you’re absolutely replenished, feeling nice and able to go on your first match. Concentrate on a mix of quick appearing starchy carbohydrates mixed with pure easy carbs and eat this in quite a lot of small meals to make sure the physique fully absorbs each. Drink loads of water so the muscular tissues will shuttle each fluids and glycogen into storage for fast motion and instant efficiency. Do that repetitively 2-Three occasions based mostly on fullness, vitality ranges and your competitors schedule. Keep away from fat to forestall slowing down absorption of vitamins and that heavy, sluggish feeling frequent to these kinds of meals. After 2-Three carb solely meals, add some protein to a later meal to help in restoration after competing and supply a barely slower digestion of carbs for vitality later within the day."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:797ffb5a-9c39-45f6-b668-7bf1dcf6e7d6>","<urn:uuid:3cf2776a-4ac1-42b4-86de-486b843ea921>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do microbes in soil and the foxtail pine's growth conditions demonstrate adaptation to challenging environments?","answer":"Both soil microbes and foxtail pines have adapted to challenging environments in specific ways. Soil microbes require precise ratios of nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, oxygen, and hydrogen) to effectively build organic matter and thrive. When given these nutrients in the right proportions, they experience a population explosion and create rich humus. Similarly, foxtail pines have adapted to harsh alpine environments, growing on barren substrates and steep slopes at elevations of 2,750 to 3,650 m in the southern Sierra Nevada. They survive despite threats from lightning, avalanches, and rockfall, with most large trees showing evidence of at least one lightning strike. Both organisms show remarkable resilience - soil microbes can transform plant residue into stable carbon when properly nourished, while foxtail pines can achieve ages of over 2,000 years despite their challenging habitat.","context":["The secret to richer, carbon-capturing soil? Treat your microbes well\nImagine if someone invented machines to suck carbon out of the atmosphere — machines that were absurdly cheap, autonomous, and solar powered, too. Wouldn’t that be great? But we already have these gadgets! They’re called plants.\nThe problem is, plants die. So there’s one hurdle remaining: We have to figure out how to lock away the carbon in dead plants so that it doesn’t just return to the atmosphere. The obvious place to put that carbon is into the ground. And so, for years, scientists and governments have been urging farmers to leave their crop residue — the stalks and leaves — on the ground, so it would be incorporated into the soil. The trouble is, sometimes this doesn’t work: Farmers will leave residues on a field and they won’t turn into carbon-rich soil — they’ll just sit there. Sometimes, the whole process ends up releasing more greenhouse gasses than it locks away.\nThis has left people scratching their heads. But now a simple idea is spreading that could allow farmers to begin reliably pulling carbon out of the atmosphere and into their soil.\nClive Kirkby was one of those government agents urging farmers to leave dead plant residues in their fields. He was working in New South Wales, Australia, where farmers traditionally have burnt off their wheat stubble after harvest. Kirkby implored farmers to stop. Instead of torching all that plant residue and releasing the carbon into the air, he told them, let it stay on the ground. It seemed like a win-win: The carbon was harmful in the air, where it contributed to the greenhouse effect, and beneficial in the ground, where it made the soil rich.\nAs he was proselytizing, Kirkby began to bump heads with an agronomist named John Kirkegaard. “Look, Clive,” Kirkegaard would say, “the best treatment here is burn and cultivate — that’s the one that’s growing the best crops.”\nThis made Kirkby crazy. Burning was bad enough, and cultivation, which essentially means plowing, was also exactly the opposite of what he wanted. When farmers break up the soil with cultivation it releases some of the carbon stored there, according to conventional wisdom. But Kirkby had to admit that Kirkegaard had data on his side. The agronomist would show him the numbers, and it was clear that the soil organic matter (which holds the carbon) wasn’t increasing. In some cases, it was decreasing.\n“I’ve been returning the stubble to the ground now for six years, and it’s just not going into the soil,” Kirkegaard told him.\nThe way that soil locks up greenhouse gas has been frustratingly mysterious, but the basics are clear: After plants suck up the carbon, the critters (microbes and fungi and insects) swarming in the topsoil chew up plant molecules, subjecting them to one chemical reaction after another as they pass through a fantastically complex food web. If everything goes right, the end result is microscopic bricks of stable carbon, which form the foundation of rich black soil.\nKirkby knew that there must be some mysterious quirk of this topsoil ecosystem that was thwarting him. But how do you investigate a complex, microscopic community that lives underground? There are just so many different organisms eating each other, and cooperating, and parasitizing one another, that we have no clue what’s going on there. People are studying it — but mostly they are reporting that the soil microbiome, as it’s called, is far more confusing than anyone suspected.\nKirkby, however, came up with an idea, that in theory, might allow farmers to manipulate the soil microbiome without having to understand everything that was going on in that black box. He pursued this idea for years, and though he was already nearing retirement age, went back to school and earned a PhD as he assembled evidence. If he’d simply tried to win his original confrontation with Kirkegaard, they’d have remained locked in a stalemate. Instead, because they allowed their minds to be shifted by the evidence, that adversarial relationship was tremendously productive. Kirkby came full circle when Kirkegaard took him on as a post-doctoral fellow (at the age of 66, Kirkby had to be one of the oldest postdocs ever).\nThe idea that drove Kirkby was elegant in its simplicity. “The way you get carbon into the ground,” he said, “is to take plant residue and turn it into microorganisms.” To grow microorganisms you have to feed them.\nThey will eat corn stalks and wheat straw, but that, alone, is not a balanced diet. That’s like giving people nothing to eat but a mountain of sugar. There are certain elements that all creatures on earth need to build the bodies of the next generation: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, oxygen, and hydrogen. These six elements are the basic ingredients of living organisms. By leaving stalks and stems on the fields they were providing a lot of carbon, and oxygen and hydrogen comes easily from the air, but the bugs were lacking in nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. Provide enough of these missing building blocks, Kirkby figured, and the soil microbes would finally be able to consume the plant residue. He tried it. It worked.\nOne lab test provides a dramatic visual of how this works. The scientists added wheat straw to two pans of sandy soil, and fertilized one with nutrients. That pan looks like rich compost. The untreated control looks as lifeless as the surface of Mars.\nI saw this picture recently when I met, via Skype, with Kirkby, Kirkegaard, and another collaborator named Alan Richardson. All work at the Australian government’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. They crowded together in front of the computer in Kirkegaard’s Canberra office.\n“That’s moist soil with chopped up wheat straw on the left,” Kirkegaard said. “There’s no reason why that shouldn’t have decomposed, except for the fact that nutrients are missing. When you give them the nutrients, all the wheat straw is gone, and you get the results of the microbial activity and their bodies and it creates a whole lot of…”\n“Humus!” cried Kirkby. He spoke with enthusiastic, rapid-fire intensity, his accent pinching the vowels through the nose: “With the right balance of nutrients you get a population explosion. And that’s what you want. The carbon is in the soil’s organic matter, and that’s essentially dead bug bits. And live bugs. Humus!”\nRichardson, who stood leaning against the far wall, chimed in, gruff and sedate compared to Kirkby. “Historically we’ve fertilized the crop,” he said. “We’ve been interested in the crop. The paradigm shift is in thinking that you have to fertilize the system, the microbes and all that. And through that you support the crop.”\nInstead of simply trying to optimize for the plants, they’ve realized, you can optimize soil along with the plant — you can optimize the whole system.\nThe three men explained that, when they looked at soil organic matter from around the world, the proportions of nutrients — the ratio of carbon atoms to nitrogen, for instance — are stunningly consistent. The organic matter is microbes. And if you want to build more of it, you have to give the microbes the right ratios of nutrients to build more tiny, cellular bodies.\nInstead of trying to identify every soil microbe and understand what it’s doing, they have hit upon a way of treating the whole mess like a super-organism that responds in predictable ways.\nThe scientist Richard Jefferson, who introduced me to this work, calls it breeding by feeding: We don’t actually know what these microbes are that we’re breeding; we only know that when we set out the right proportions of food, they click into high gear.\nAll this helps explain why organic farms often capture more carbon. In adding compost to amend the soil, organic farmers are adding the same ratios of nutrients. The organic claim that fertilizing with synthetic nitrogen kills off soil life actually makes sense, Kirkby said; it’s just that the problem has nothing to do with the nitrogen’s artificiality. The trouble is that farmers are applying the nitrogen without the other nutrients necessary to nurture the microbiome.\n“As agronomists, we talk about nutrient-use efficiency,” Kirkegaard said. “Now, the best way to have high nutrient-use efficiency is to mine the organic matter, because that comes to you for free. You’re wanting to put on juuuust enough nutrients to feed the crop and not have any left over. And that just means the other crop, under the soil, the microbial crop, misses out. As a result, we’ve lost about half the organic matter in land we’ve been using for agriculture.”\nI wanted to get a reality check from another scientist, because this all sounded almost too good to be true. So I got in touch with a true authority in the field, Rattan Lal, president elect of the International Union of Soil Sciences. Lal took a look at look some of the work and pronounced his judgment: “I agree,” he said. “This phenomenon is well understood.” A colleague of Lal’s was teaching students to apply exactly the same ratios of nutrients 50 years ago, he said.\nThis stopped me. If this is old news, why haven’t we been putting it to work? Why the confusion when no-till fails to capture carbon? Why the mystery surrounding the ability of organic farming to do so?\nSometimes good information simply doesn’t spread everywhere it should go, Lal said, with a note of weariness. This isn’t a exactly breakthrough, he said, but he welcomed the work and said he hoped people would pay attention this time. When he followed up with an email, he wrote: “The theme addressed is very important and it must be brought to the attention of general public and policy makers.”\nWhen I initially spoke with Kirkby, Kirkegaard, and Richardson, they had been forthright in telling me that we’ve known about this golden ratio of nutrients for a long time. They also noted that there were other scientists like Sébastien Fontaine publishing similar papers. In a follow-up email, Richardson wrote, “What we think is new is the direct connection between the soil microbiome and the [soil organic matter], which is mediated by [the ratio of nutrients]. We think that our set of recent papers provides some of the first real evidence that underpins this connection and shows evidence that the dynamics can in fact be changed.”\nJefferson says the Australians are being modest, and conservative with their claims. Connecting the well-known nutrient ratios with the microbiome truly is a breakthrough, he said.\n“Now they have a mechanism to explain how this works, which allows you to make predictions, so you can imagine experiments driving this forward. One of the things that’s exciting for me is that this really bridges empiricism and scholarly science nicely. There have been tens of thousands of anecdotes noted about the performance of small scale, traditional agriculture — empirical studies or stories of small farmers who do exciting things in terms of performance and resilience. It has been largely dismissed by the hard-core science community because it has not been scalable and replicable. We can’t take one farmer’s success and move it to the next farmer or the next ecosystem because we have no understanding of how it works — complex systems don’t extrapolate well, they don’t work out of context.”\nIn other words, when we see an organic farmer building up the soil and achieving amazing results, it’s hard to copy it because we don’t know what to imitate. What is it that makes this work? The type of fertilizer? The local microclimate? The prayer the farmer says before breakfast? The work coming out of Australia provides the traction to separate superstition from the stuff that gets results.\nBoth Lal and the Australian scientists agree that there’s still one more major hurdle, which may have kept this information from spreading: These nutrients cost money. If farmers were paid for locking up carbon, they would gladly buy the fertilizers, Lal said, but right now the reimbursements are far too low. Even at the high point of the carbon markets, when people were paying $30 per ton, it would not be enough to reimburse farmers. “It costs $800 a ton of CO2 to do geological sequestration, you know, pumping carbon underground,” he said. “If farmers could get even a tenth of that, $80 a ton, I know many soil-poor farmers would participate.”\nKirkby thinks that, by tinkering with the soil microbiome, farmers might see enough gains to pay for the extra inputs. There’s already evidence that the soil microbes can help suppress plant disease and improve dirt quality. Extending this concept of growing a healthy system, not just a healthy crop, could yield profits.\n“We’re probably not going to increase yields incredibly, but we might be able to improve incrementally,” Kirkby said. “In a sandy soil we might improve water-holding capacity. In a heavy clay soil we might reduce diseases a little bit — added together it might pay for the nutrients at the end of the day.”\nOne thing is certain: If agriculture were able to switch from an emitter of carbon to an absorber of carbon, the effect would be huge. Plants, those cheap carbon-removal machines that nature has given us, work well. If we can get them to make our dinner while they are also sucking up greenhouse gas, what a coup that would be.\nBut it would be an even greater coup if we could begin, as these scientists have done, to understand how to manipulate whole ecological systems — rather than just systems that have been simplified and stripped down to easily controllable parts.","Foxtail pine (Arno and Gyer 1973); the two subspecies are commonly called the \"northern\" and \"southern\" foxtail pines, though the southern trees, which are far more famous, are commonly just called \"foxtail pines.\"\nTwo subspecies, the type and P. balfouriana subsp. austrina R.

Mastrogiuseppe and J.D. Mastrogiuseppe (1980) could as well be used to indicate that P. balfouriana (with its two infraspecific taxa) and P. longaeva represent a single species of three subspecies or three varieties\" (Kral 1993).\n\"Trees to 22 m; trunk to 2.6 m diam., erect or leaning; crown broadly conic to irregular.

Seeds ellipsoid to narrowly obovoid; body to 10 mm, pale brown, mottled with deep red; wing 10-12 mm. 2n=24.\n\"Pinus balfouriana is the true \"foxtail pine.\" In leaf character it is hardly, if at all, distinguishable from P. longaeva, but its strongly conic-based cones with distinctly shorter-prickled, sunken-centered umbos at once distinguish it from that species\" (Kral 1993).\nUSA: California. See range map at left; see also Thompson et al. (1999). The two subspecies have a strongly disjunct distribution, with the two closest populations about 500 km apart. The type subspecies is found in the inner North Coast Ranges (Siskiyou, Scott, Salmon, Marble, Trinity, and Yolla Bolly Mountains) at elevations of 1,525 to 1,830 m, where it grows in open to closed-canopy pure to mixed stands (Kral 1993). In 2006 it was also reported to occur in Oregon on 2,026-meter Lake Peak, 1.5 km N of the California-Oregon border (Lanner 2007); however this report has not been corroborated or supported by a herbarium collection, and visitors to the site report no evidence of foxtail pines there. Hardy to Zone 5 (cold hardiness limit between -28.8°C and -23.3°C) (Bannister and Neuner 2001; variety not specified).\nSubspecies austrina only occurs in pure or nearly pure stands in the southern Sierra Nevada from 2,750 to 3,650 m elevation, around the headwaters of the Kings, Kern and Kaweah Rivers. It occurs only on the west slopes of the Sierra, except at Cottonwood Creek, at a very high altitude (Peattie 1950). Nearly all trees in the southern population occur within the bounds of Sequoia National Park. Both subspecies are relatively uncommon, so of conservation concern (Kral 1993).\nOline et al (2000) observe that the northern subspecies is growing near the tops of the very tallest peaks within its range, noting that \"in the north, the mountain ranges are not as high or as contiguous [as in the southern populations] -- there are only occasional isolated ridges or peaks that rise above 2000 m to provide potential P. balfouriana habitat, and the populations sizes on these ridges and peaks are small. In terms of elevation, all of the northern populations are at the extreme edge of the species' ecological limits.\" As a consequence, these populations have experienced isolation and genetic drift, and are now more distinct from each other than are different populations within the southern subspecies. Oline et al. (2000) also suggest that the differences between the northern populations are strong enough that they probably predated the geographic separation between the subspecies, which Eckert et al. (2008) suggest probably occurred in early to middle Pleistocene time.\nIt is possible that, since the northern subspecies trees have no higher elevation habitat within or near their current range, climatic warming could cause their extirpation.\nOline et al (2000) also note that some northern subspecies populations occur on serpentine-derived soils, occasionally forming pure closed-canopy stands. This is interesting because plants generally do poorly on serpentine soils, although adaptation to serpentines in northern California has also been observed for Pinus jeffreyi and Juniperus communis var. saxatilis (the form sometimes called J. communis var. jackii). Oline et al (2000) also found some evidence that the populations growing on serpentine have differentiated; this may reflect genetic adaptation to serpentine, but, since foliage from mature trees was sampled, it may only show that there is a selection pressure affecting the trees that establish on serpentine.\nI have observed the southern subspecies at the Timber Gap stand in Sequoia National Park. These trees, which include the largest trees in the southern subspecies, are growing at 3,000-3,300 m elevation on relatively deep soils derived from a calcareous schist. The closely related P. longaeva also grows best on calcareous parent materials and also grows fastest on deep soils, though both taxa can do quite well on barren talus fields. Even on good sites, growth is slow, with trees commonly taking several centuries to grow to maturity. Stands are usually pure, though at lower elevations they may also contain significant numbers of Pinus flexilis, Pinus monticola, Pinus contorta subsp. murrayana, or Abies magnifica. Stands are usually very open in structure, although a few closed-canopy stands have been described.\nOne consequence of the open stand structure and barren substrates is that these stands generally do not carry fire. The principal causes of tree death appear to be lightning, avalanche and rockfall. Most large trees show evidence of at least one lightning strike, and they commonly retain a strip-bark growth habit as a legacy of this misfortune. Sometimes the lightning strike ignites the tree, and the tree may be consumed if the fire is not quenched. Regeneration is common in avalanche tracks, where saplings may show evidence of repeated breakage by avalanche. The tree often grows on steep slopes beneath mountain precipices, so it is also common to see trees that have been scarred or broken by rockfall. Occasionally a tree shows scarring due to woodpecker activity, but in general, evidence of both insect and fungal attack is rare, and these are probably minor causes of mortality.\nThe largest is of the type subspecies. It is 23.0 m tall, dbh 255 cm, crown spread 10 m, and occurs near Eagle Peak in the Trinity National Forest (American Forests 1996). A tree near Telephone Lake in the Trinity Alps Wilderness holds the height record; it is 36.0 m tall, dbh 121 cm, (Robert Van Pelt [who measured the tree] e-mail 1998.03.18). The large Marble Mountains tree shown at left, located near lower Wright Lake, was in 2013 measured at 27.3 m tall and 182 cm dbh (Michael Kauffmann email 2013.09.24).\nThe largest trees of subspecies austrina occur in a stand near Timber Gap in southern Sequoia National Park (see photo this page), where the largest tree was 21.3 m tall and 261 cm dbh in 2005, and a nearby tree (probably the second-largest) was 23.8 m tall and 244 cm dbh. Some people who have seen these two trees suspect that they originated as multiple-stem trees that later fused.\nA crossdated age of 2110 years for sample SHP7 from a specimen of subspecies austrina, collected in the southern Sierra Nevada (CA) by Tony Caprio (Arno and Gyer 1973). This is an incidental measurement, and was not the product of a systematic effort to find exceptionally old trees. Most experts expect that the tree is capable of achieving ages of 2,500 to 3,000 years, perhaps more; Pinus longaeva, a very similar species growing in a similar environment, has attained ages of nearly 5,000 years.\nI have no data on longevity of the type (northern) subspecies.\nBecause it lives in harsh alpine environments and achieves great age, subspecies austrina has been the subject of considerable dendrochronological research, chiefly by L.A. Scuderi and by Lisa Graumlich and her students, notably Andi Lloyd, since the mid-1980s (Scuderi 1993, Lloyd 1997).\nI have found no records of aboriginal uses. Moreover, it has never achieved popularity in horticulture, and is quite rarely seen in botanical gardens. Its principal value to humans is thus aesthetic; the alpine groves of this ancient tree, juxtaposing its brick-red bark and vivid green foliage against blue skies and the white Sierra granite, are exceptionally beautiful even in comparison with other timberline forests.\nThe type variety can be seen to advantage at the Mount Eddy Research Natural Area in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest at 41.333°N, 122.500°W (Google Map). The stand is approached via Forest Road 17 and the Pacific Crest Trail to Deadfall Lakes. The area has about 97 ha of foxtail pine forest at elevations of about 2377-2438 m. It is almost a pure stand, with occasional individuals of Pinus albicaulis and Pinus monticola, but the trail approaching the site passes through a forest dominated by Abies concolor and Pinus monticola (Keeler-Wolf 1990).\nSubspecies austrina can be viewed relatively easily by visiting the Last Chance Meadow Research Natural Area in the Inyo National Forest. The site is at 36° 27' N, 118° 09' W (Google Map), and is approached via a paved road southwest of Lone Pine, California. Some trees in this large and impressive stand have attained ages of 1,000 to 1,500 years. It is found in pure stands, and in mixed stands, sometimes with limber pine (Pinus flexilis) and sometimes with lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta subsp. murrayana) (Keeler-Wolf 1990). The largest trees in the subspecies can be seen after a hike of about 4 km, to the Timber Gap area in Sequoia National Park. Access is from Mineral King, about two hours' drive east of Visalia; Google Map. Another fine stand, growing on granitic soils, can be found on Alta Peak, reached from a 12-km trail starting at the Wolverton trailhead near Giant Forest in Sequoia National Park. This trail climbs over 1,000 meters and makes for a beautiful but rather stiff day hike. Arno and Hammerly (1984) provide a good account of the Alta Peak stand. I also have a report (Jack Huntamer, 2013.09.01) of a very large (unmeasured) tree in a fine, extensive stand at 3,220 m elevation just E of Kaweah Gap in Sequoia National Park; if someone were to find and measure this tree, they might find a new record.\n\"In the days when there were few roads of any sort in California, one region was as inaccessible as another, and botanical explorers, though few in number a century ago, expected nothing but hardships in the West, wherever they went. So that John Jeffrey, the Scottish explorer and first discoverer of this species, made his way to the stands of this tree on Scott Mountains, as early as 1852. Jeffrey was always a lonely man, collecting far out ahead of civilization, claiming few friends. Thus he was not quickly missed when he disappeared forever, having set out from San Diego to cross the Colorado Desert in search of new plants. He was either killed by Indians or died of thirst. No trace of his end has ever been found\" (Peattie 1950). A pretty story, but it is equally plausible that Jeffrey was murdered in San Francisco during the heyday of the gold rush; his story, as best it is now known, is told by Lang (2006). The tree was named for a patron of Jeffrey's, John Balfour (Lanner 2007).\nFoxtail pines, like other species in section Balfourianae, are very ancient, with very similar fossil species known from Thunder Mountain, Idaho (46 million years), as well as locales in Nevada (42 million years), New Mexico (32 million years), and Colorado (27 million years). During the glacial episodes of the Pleistocene epoch, P. balfouriana expanded its range to lower elevations, and macrofossils of the species have been found as far south as Clear Lake in northern California (Lanner 2007), but so far I have found no good evidence on how the southern populations responded to glaciation.\nWhite pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), an introduced fungal disease, has afflicted this and certain other white pines (Little 1980). The disease has not yet, however, affected populations of subsp. austrina (Maloney 2011).\nEckert, A. J., B. R. Tearse, and B. D. Hall. 2008.

{"question":"how earthquake insurance different for homes vs businesses? need to know main differences in coverage + cost pls","answer":"Homeowners and commercial earthquake insurance have several key differences in coverage and costs. For homes, earthquake insurance is available as a separate policy or add-on to homeowners insurance, with typically high deductibles. For businesses, commercial earthquake insurance covers structural damage, property damage including equipment and inventory, demolition costs, and possibly loss of income. Business policies have deductibles ranging from 2% to 20% of building value, based on location, age, and condition. While both types exclude man-made earthquakes and vehicle damage, commercial policies may offer additional protections like temporary relocation expenses. The cost for business coverage varies based on proximity to fault lines, seismic history, business size, and equipment type, while residential coverage is notably expensive with high deductibles.","context":["Understanding the Limitations of Homeowners InsuranceAs a homeowner, it is important to understand the limitations of your homeowners insurance policy. While it is designed to protect you from a range of potential risks and liabilities, there are some events and scenarios that are not covered under your policy. That’s why it’s crucial to read your policy carefully and understand what is and isn’t covered.\nThe Fine Print: What Homeowners Insurance Does Not CoverIt’s essential to read the fine print of your homeowners insurance policy to understand what is not covered. Some of the most notable exclusions include:\n- Natural disasters: As mentioned, homeowners insurance does not cover damage caused by earthquakes, floods, or landslides.\n- Home maintenance: If damage occurs due to wear and tear or lack of maintenance, it is not covered. For example, if a storm damages your roof, but it was already in poor condition, any repairs or replacements may not be covered by your policy.\n- Criminal activity: If damage occurs as a result of criminal activity such as theft or vandalism, it may not be covered.\n- Business activities: If your home is being used for business purposes and damage occurs, it may not be covered under your standard homeowners policy.\nWhy Natural Disasters Are Excluded from Homeowners InsuranceThe reason natural disasters are excluded from homeowners insurance policies is that they are considered high-risk events, and the potential insurance payouts can be significant. As a result, insurance companies typically require homeowners to purchase additional coverage or riders to protect against these types of events. Even with additional coverage, there may be exclusions and limitations based on the specific circumstances of the event. For example, earthquake insurance may not cover damage to your swimming pool, while flood insurance may not cover damage to your seawall.\nA Closer Look at Flood, Earthquake, and Landslide CoverageWhile standard homeowners insurance policies do not cover natural disasters, there are additional insurance policies available to help homeowners protect against specific risks. Flood insurance: Flood insurance is available through the National Flood Insurance Program and private insurance companies. It offers protection against damage caused by flooding, which is not covered under a standard homeowners policy. However, it’s essential to note that flood insurance typically has a waiting period of 30 days before coverage kicks in. Earthquake insurance: Earthquake insurance is available as a separate policy or as an add-on to your homeowners policy. It offers protection against damage caused by earthquakes, which are not covered under a standard policy. However, earthquake insurance can be expensive, and deductibles are often high. Landslide insurance: Landslide insurance is much more limited than flood and earthquake insurance and is only available in certain areas. It offers protection against damage caused by landslides or mudslides, but coverage is typically limited to damage to the structure of your home and not the land around it.\nWhat Homeowners Can Do to Protect Against Natural DisastersIn addition to purchasing additional insurance coverage, there are several steps homeowners can take to protect their homes against natural disasters.\n- Invest in home maintenance: By keeping your home in good condition, you can reduce the risk of damage from natural disasters and increase the chances of coverage from your insurance policy.\n- Prepare for disasters: By having an emergency plan in place, you can minimize the risk of damage and make the claims process smoother if there is damage.\n- Consider home improvements: Installing features such as a sump pump or reinforced roofing can help protect against damage from floods or high winds.","Does my business need commercial earthquake insurance? This type of business insurance policy offers coverage beyond your basic property policy by covering earthquake damage to your building and your business contents like computers, furniture and inventory.\nCommercial Earthquake Insurance\nMother Nature is a powerful and uncontrollable force. Of all the natural events that occur, earthquakes are among the most destructive.\nWhile commercial property insurance will cover several types of natural events, it doesn't offer protection against earthquakes - in fact - policies specifically exclude them.\nIf your business is located in an area that is prone to earthquakes, it's vital that you shield yourself from the damage that this natural phenomenon can cause by purchasing a commercial earthquake insurance policy.\nWhat Does Commercial Earthquake Insurance Cover?\nCommercial earthquake insurance is a specialized policy that covers the damage associated with ground movement caused by earthquakes. Generally, these policies will cover the following:\n- Structural damage caused by seismic activity.\n- Property damage caused by an earthquake, such as commercial equipment and machinery, as well as inventory.\n- Demolition costs.\n- Depending on the insurance provider, a commercial earthquake insurance policy may also cover loss of income that an earthquake can cause.\nCoverage begins when the damage has exceeded your policy's deductible. Business earthquake insurance policies often have high deductibles, which typically range anywhere from 2% to as high as 20% of the value of your building - based on its location, age and condition. It's important to check with your insurance broker to find out exactly what your policy will cover.\nWhat Commercial Earthquake Insurance Doesn't Cover\nWhile earthquake insurance does cover a wide range of damages that are associated with seismic activity, it doesn't cover everything. Some things that your policy won't protect include:\n- Vehicles that are damaged by an earthquake. Find out if your commercial auto insurance policy will offer coverage for earthquake damage, or if you can add extended coverage for earthquake damage.\n- Earthquakes that are made by humans are not covered by commercial earthquake insurance. Fracking is an activity that is often leads to movement in the earth. Since this earth movement is man-made, your commercial earthquake insurance policy will not cover it.\nFollowing is some example language from a real commercial property policy for earth movement including the earthquake exclusion: Earth Movement - (1) Earthquake, including any earth sinking, rising or shifting related to such event; But if Earth Movement, as described in Paragraphs (1) above, results in fire or explosion, we will pay for the loss or damage caused by that fire or explosion.\nWhy Should You Invest In Commercial Earthquake Insurance?\nFor business owners who operate in areas that are prone to seismic activity, commercial earthquake insurance is a wise investment for the following reasons:\n- A standard commercial property insurance policy will not cover the damage caused by an earthquake. Even if your property insurance policy offers coverage for fire damage, and you also purchased a commercial flood insurance policy - they will not pay for damage caused by fires or floods that are associated with earthquakes.\n- Earthquakes can cause severe damage. This damage can span far away from the epicenter of the quake. That means that even if your company isn't situated near a fault line, a major earthquake can still do significant destruction.\nWho Should Buy Commercial Earthquake Insurance?\nThe US Geological Survey reports that earthquakes have occurred throughout 39 states since the year 1900. Though earthquakes may not be common in certain areas, fault lines are located everywhere, which means that seismic activity can happen any place and at any time. This means that if one does occur and your business is damaged as a result, you could be looking at serious losses.\nFollowing are some basic questions to ask yourself about your business to determine if you need commercial earthquake insurance:\n- Can your business replace your business property like inventory, computers etc... if they are damaged or destroyed?\n- Can your business afford to pay for temporary relocation and other expenses if structural damage makes your business location uninhabitable?\n- If you own your building, can your business afford the cost of rebuilding or repairing it if it damaged or destroyed?\nWith all of that being said, commercial earthquake insurance is something that all business owners - no matter where they operate - should consider. However, organizations that are located in areas that are particularly prone to earthquakes, such as California and Oklahoma, should definitely invest in this type of insurance coverage.\nHow Much Does Commercial Earthquake Insurance Cost?\nThe cost of commercial earthquake insurance varies. Different insurance providers offer different prices and coverage options. Furthermore, there are several factors that will impact the cost of this type of policy, such as how close your business is to a fault line, the history of seismic activity in your area, the size of your business, and the type of equipment and machinery used in your operation. To find out how much a commercial earthquake insurance policy will cost, speak to a broker who works with a reputable insurance company that offers this type of coverage.\nFurther Reading On Business Property Insurance\n- Commercial Flood Insurance\n- Commercial Property And Business Interruption Insurance\n- Commercial Property Insurance Basics\n- Commercial Earthquake Insurance\n- Flood Insurance Requirements For Commercial Property\n- How To Calculate Commercial Property Insurance Rates\n- Landlord Insurance\n- Types Of Insurance For Landlords\nCommercial Earthquake Insurance - The Bottom Line\nWe hope this article on commercial earthquake insurance was informative. If you are trying to determine if business earthquake insurance is something that your company needs, ask yourself if you have access to the financial resources that may be necessary in order to make repairs to your business should an earthquake occur? If your answer is 'no' or you aren't sure, then you should seriously consider investing in this type of coverage. It's far better to have the protection available because there is no way to accurately predict when and where an earthquake will occur."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c687d6ff-a6de-4a40-b28e-d8a690c5b0ed>","<urn:uuid:f8f08690-6634-4459-8de1-90cb3abdee34>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which area is larger: Canada's Ramsar wetlands or Ngorongoro Conservation Area?","answer":"Canada's Ramsar wetlands are larger, covering over 130,000 km², while the Ngorongoro Conservation Area measures 8,300 square kilometers.","context":["The Ramsar Convention (The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitat) is an international treaty to protect wetlands. It is meant to stop the loss of wetland areas now and in the future. It recognizes that wetlands are an important ecosystem. It also recognizes that wetlands have economic, cultural, scientific, and recreational value. It is named after the town of Ramsar in Iran.\nConvention[change | change source]\nThe convention was developed and agreed to by 18 nations at a meeting in Ramsar on February 2, 1971.

The Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA), measuring 8,300 square kilometers, is also the only place on earth where mankind and wild animals coexist in harmony. The NCA became a Man and Biosphere Reserve in 1971 and was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. Originally part of the Serengeti National Park when the latter was established by the British in 1951, in 1959 the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA) was formed, separating NCA from Serengeti. Land within the area is multi-use, providing protection status for wildlife while also permitting human habitation. Its uniqueness lays in the fact that the NCA is where man, livestock and wild animals live in peace: Maasai cattle can sometimes be seen grazing alongside zebras on Ngorongoro's grassland.\nHad it not become the world's sixth-largest unbroken caldera, then what is now known as the Ngorongoro crater could have been a towering volcanic mountain, as high as Kilimanjaro.\nThe crater is the flagship tourism feature for the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. It is a large, unbroken, un-flooded caldera, formed when a giant volcano exploded and collapsed some three million years ago. The Ngorongoro crater sinks to a depth of 610 metres, with a base area covering 260 square kilometers. The height of the original volcano must have ranged between 4,500 to 5,800 metres high. Apart from the main caldera, Ngorongoro also has two other volcanic craters: Olmoti and Empakai, the former famous for its stunning waterfalls, and the latter holding a deep lake and lush, green walls.\nOn the leeward of the Ngorongoro highlands protrudes the iconic Oldonyo Lengai, an active volcano and Tanzania's third highest peak after Kilimanjaro and Meru . Known to local people as the Mountain of God, Mount Lengai's last major eruption occurred in 2007. At the mountain's foot is Lake Natron, East Africa's major breeding ground for flamingos.\nThe name Ngorongoro is derived from llkorongoro, a Maasai word given to the age group of Maasai warriors who defeated the previous occupants of the area, known as the Datong around the 1800s. The Datong had in turn taken them from their predecessors the Hadzabe (bushmen/hunter-gatherers). The name Ilkorongoro echoed sounds of the bells 'koh-rohng-roh' that the Maasai wore during the battle, and it is from this that the name Ngorongoro comes from. Furthermore the Maasai have also given names to the walls known as 'entiak' which defines as sheer drop, and the floor as 'ramat' meaning heath-land of the crater.\nFlora and Fauna\nA population of about 25,000 large animals, largely ungulates along with the highest density of mammalian predators in Africa, lives in the crater. These include black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis (CR), which have declined from about 108 in 1964-66 to between 11-14 in 1995, and hippopotamus Hippopotamus amphibius which are very uncommon in the area. There are also many other ungulates: wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus (7,000 estimated in 1994), zebraEquus burchelli (4,000), eland Taurotragus oryx, Grant's and Thomson's gazelles Gazella granti and G. thomsoni (3,000). The crater has the densest known population of lion Panthera leo (VU) numbering 62 in 2001. On the crater rim are leopard Panthera pardus, elephantLoxodonta africana (EN) numbering 42 in 1987 but only 29 in 1992, mountain reedbuckRedunca fulvorufula and buffalo Syncerus caffer (4,000 in 1994). However, since the 1980s the crater's wildebeest population has fallen by a quarter to about 19,000 and the numbers of eland and Thomson's gazelle have also declined while buffaloes increased greatly, probably due to the long prevention of fire which favors high fibrous grasses over shorter less fibrous types.\nIn summer enormous numbers of Serengeti migrants pass through the plains of the reserve, including 1.7 million wildebeest, 260,00 zebra and 470,000 gazelles. Waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus mainly occur mainly near Lerai Forest; serval Felis serval occur widely in the crater and on the plains to the west. Common in the reserve are lion, hartebeest Alcelaphus buselaphus, spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta and jackal Canis aureus. Cheetah Acinonyx jubatus (VU), though common in the reserve, are scarce in the crater itself. Wild dog Lycaon pictus (EN) has recently disappeared from the crater and may have declined elsewhere in the Conservation Area as well. Golden cat Felis aurata has recently been seen in the Ngorongoro forest.\nOver 500 species of bird have been recorded within the NCA. These include ostrich Struthio camelus, with white pelican Pelicanus onocrotalus, and greater and lesser flamingo Phoenicopterus ruber and P.minor on Lake Makat in Ngorongoro crater, Lake Ndutu and the Empakaai crater lake where over a million birds forgather. There are also lammergeier Gypaetus barbatus, Ruepell's griffon, Gyps ruepelli (110) Verreaux's eagle Aquila verreauxii, Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus, pallid harrier Circus macrourus, lesser falcon Falco naumanni (VU), Taita falcon F. fasciinucha, kori bustard Choriotis kori, Fischer's lovebird Agapornis fischeri, rosy-breasted longclaw Macronyx ameliae, Karamoja apalis Apalis karamojae (VU), redthroated tit Parus fringillinus and Jackson's whydah Euplectes jacksoni. Sunbirds in the highland forest include the golden winged sunbird Nectarinia reichenowi and eastern double collared sunbird N. mediocris. Other waterbirds found on Lake Eyasi include yellowbilled stork Mycteria ibis, African spoonbillPlatalea alba, avocet Recurvirostra avosetta and greyheaded gull Larus cirrocephalus. The butterfly Papilio sjoestedti, sometimes known as the Kilimanjaro swallowtail, flies in the montane forests. It has a very restricted range but is well protected in national parks.\nThe variations in climate, landforms and altitude have resulted in several overlapping ecosystems and distinct habitats. WithinTanzania the area is important for retaining uncultivated lowland vegetation, for the arid and semi-arid plant communities below 1,300 m, for its abundant shortgrass grazing and for the water catchment highland forests. Scrub heath, montane long grasslands, high open moorland and the remains of dense evergreen montane forests cover the steep slopes. Highland trees include peacock flower Albizzia gummifera, yellowwood Podocarpus latifolia, Hagenia abyssinica and sweet olive Olea chrysophylla. There is an extensive stand of pure bamboo Arundinaria alpina on Oldeani Mountain and pencil cedar Juniperus procera on Makarut Mountain in the west.Croton spp. dominate lower slopes. The upland woodlands containing red thorn Acacia lahai and gum acacia A. seyal are critical for protecting the watershed.\nThe crater floor is mainly open shortgrass plains with fresh and brackish water lakes, marshes, swamps and two patches of Acacia woodland: Lerai Forest, with codominants yellow fever tree Acacia xanthophloea and Rauvolfia caffra; and Laiyanai Forest with pillar wood Cassipourea malosana, Albizzia gummifera, and Acacia lahai. The undulating plains to the west are grass-covered with occasional umbrella acacia Acacia tortilis and Commiphora africana trees, which become almost desert during periods of severe drought.

{"question":"What are the positive and negative impacts of sea otters returning to Vancouver Island's ecosystem? I'm doing research for my marine biology class! 🌊","answer":"Sea otters have both positive and negative impacts on Vancouver Island's ecosystem. On the positive side, they enable vast expansion of kelp forests by eating urchins and other kelp-eating invertebrates, triggering increased productivity and diversity. Kelp forests serve as important nursery habitats for fish and invertebrates, similar to tropical forests underwater. Additionally, sea otters can boost tourism as they are an attractive species. On the negative side, they have severely impacted shellfish populations in areas like Kyuquot Sound on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, affecting communities who depend on shellfish such as crabs, urchins, geoduck, and clams for their livelihoods.","context":["Sea otters: a conservation success story, or rats of the ocean?\nBy Raoul Wieland, Sarah Ravensbergen, Edward Gregr, and Kai Chan\nAfter being re-introduced to the north end of Vancouver Island in the 1970s, sea otters can once again be found in many areas from which they were extirpated in the fur trade of the 18th and 19th centuries. From a conservation perspective, this is an important success story, yet events are rarely as black and white as they might appear. How could an animal returning to its natural habitat—the epitome of ‘charismatic megafauna’—be grounds for concern?\nA sea otter floats with her pup off the West Coast of Vancouver Island\nIn short, species conservation is complicated. Although the return of the sea otter is good news for many, it’s especially complicated because otters have a disproportionately large effect on ecosystems relative to their abundance (so much so that biologists call them ‘keystone’ species). Throwing otters back into the mix has had a wide variety of impacts, both positive and negative, on both marine ecosystems and local communities.\nBy eating urchins and other kelp-eating invertebrates, sea otters enable the vast expansion of kelp forests, thereby triggering a trophic cascade leading to a system with increased productivity and diversity. See, kelp forests are the tropical forests of the undersea world, housing and feeding all manner of critters in a lush, multi-storey cathedral of life. Researchers at UBC and elsewhere have shown how kelp forests are important nursery habitats for fish and invertebrate species. So on the one hand, sea otters are a species at risk, an attractive and potentially lucrative one (for tourism), and they are instrumental in bringing back the vast kelp forests of centuries gone by.\nKelp forests like this one provide habitat for a great number of species, including birds, fish, invertebrates like snails and starfish, and even large mammals such as sea lions and grey whales\nOn the other hand, sea otters have decimated shellfish populations in many areas on the West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI), particularly in Kyuquot Sound. This causes real negative impacts on communities who rely on shellfish like crabs, urchins, geoduck, and clams, for their livelihoods. It is from the combination of these contrasting perspectives that the fierce tension in many coastal communities, particularly about otter management plans, ensues.\nEnter the BC Coastal Ecosystem Services Project (BCCES, pronounced “BC Seas”), with a hub at the CHANS Lab at IRES at UBC. This 5-year project brought together a team of researchers who care deeply and equally for the natural environment and the human communities of Vancouver Island. Long-time marine enthusiasts like Russ Markel (who first approached Kai Chan about a possible collaboration; now at OuterShores have gained great insight into how the distribution and abundance of rocky reef fish and shellfish are affected by sea otters.\nResearchers from UBC sample the kelp density, algae cover, and diversity of species in kelp beds near Bamfield, BC, as part of the BC Coastal Ecosystem Services project\nBut what do these biological changes mean for human communities on the west coast? To answer this, we first need to understand how various human uses (like fishing and tourism) are affected by the abundance of different plants and animals in different places. So, the four of us (in particular Raoul Wieland and Sarah Ravensbergen) are contacting experts to check our assumptions about shellfish harvesting, recreational fishing, and tourism. Once we can represent how various kinds of fishing and tourism are affected by these changing abundances in different places (near, far, accessible, and less so), we can determine the suite of impacts sea otters have on people. In some places, like Kyuoquot Sound and the rest of northern WCVI, this is a matter of what sea otters have already changed; in other places, like Barkley Sound and southern WCVI, it’s what otters could change when they arrive en masse. We’re interested in both material goods (e.g. consuming or selling fish) and non-material experiences (e.g. leisure, education, culture).\nThe dialogue around the return of otters has centered around negative fisheries experiences vs. positive impacts on tourism. Our hope is that this research will broaden the dialogue to include other benefits and costs (like indirect boosts to some fisheries, for organisms who rely on kelp forests), and improve our understanding of how and where different groups of people (such as local fishers, harvesters, and tourists) are using, and getting the most out of, the ecosystem around them. Incorporating such findings into management strategies is one step towards finding fair solutions, and possibly even elusive ‘win-wins’.\nSo, conservation poster-child or rat of the ocean?

{"question":"hi! looking to understand difference between bottle n cup feeding for premies... how they affect breastfeeding success?? plz explain!","answer":"While both bottle and cup feeding are used in neonatal units for preterm infants, they may affect breastfeeding differently. Cup feeding is considered better than bottle feeding when supplementing a baby who is not yet breastfeeding, as it helps avoid artificial nipples that could interfere with proper breast latching. A clinical trial is currently studying the effects of both methods on breast sucking patterns in very low birth weight infants, looking at outcomes like weight gain, time to achieve full oral feeding, hospital stay duration, and breastfeeding success rates. However, if a baby is already successfully latching and breastfeeding but needs supplementation, neither cup nor bottle feeding should be used - instead, a lactation aid at the breast is recommended.","context":["Finger feeding is a technique the main purpose of which is to prepare the baby to take the breast when the baby is reluctant or refuses to latch on. See the information sheet The Baby Who Does Not Yet Latch. Though finger feeding can be used to feed a baby and thus avoid artificial nipples, this is not what it is meant to do really. Furthermore, if the baby is actually taking the breast (latching on) and requires supplementation, this supplementation should be given with a lactation aid at the breast not by finger feeding. See the information sheet Lactation Aid and the video clips. Too often finger feeding is used to feed the baby when a mother has sore nipples and the baby is taken off the breast. This is seen as not interfering with breastfeeding while, at the same time, the “nipples are given a rest”. Taking a baby off the breast for any reason, including sore nipples, should be a last resort only. See the information sheets When Latching, Sore Nipples, APNO (“all purpose nipple ointment”), Candida Protocol, Gentian Violet, Fluconazole and video clips showing how to latch a baby on.\nFinger feeding may be used if:\n- The baby refuses the breast for whatever reason, or if the baby is too sleepy at the breast to breastfeed well. It is also a very good way to wake up a sleepy baby during the first few days of life and there are concerns about intake.\n- The baby does not seem to be able to latch on to the breast properly, and thus does not get milk well. (However, if the baby is latching on, even not well, then it is better to use a lactation aid at the breast to give extra milk).\n- The baby is separated from the mother, for whatever reason. However, in such a situation, a cup is probably a better method of feeding the baby. Since finger feeding should be used primarily to help a baby take the breast when he is reluctant or temporarily unable, the best technique is not finger feeding if the mother is not present to breastfeed him.\n- Breastfeeding is stopped temporarily (there are very few legitimate reasons to stop breastfeeding. See the information sheets Medication and Breastfeeding and Illness and Breastfeeding.\n- Your nipples are so sore that you cannot put the baby to the breast. Finger feeding for several days may allow your nipples to heal without causing more problems by getting the baby used to an artificial nipple. However, see the first paragraph about taking the baby off the breast. Cup feeding is also more appropriate in this situation and takes less time. Taking a baby off the breast should be a last resort only but too often is done as a first resort. Proper positioning and a good latch help sore nipples far more than finger feeding (see the information sheet Sore Nipples). And a good “all purpose nipple ointment” will help as well. This so called “nipple holiday” is not advisable and if suggested within the first few days of life may be a terrible mistake. Taking the baby off the breast does not always result in painless feedings once you start again and sometimes the baby will refuse to latch on.\nFinger feeding is much more similar to breastfeeding than is bottle feeding. In order to finger feed, the baby must keep his tongue down and forward over the gums, his mouth wide (the larger the finger used, the better so using a baby finger to do finger feeding is not a good idea), and his jaw forward. Furthermore, the motion of the tongue and jaw is similar to what the baby does while feeding at the breast. Finger feeding is best used to prepare the baby who is refusing to latch on to take the breast. It needs to be done only for a minute or two, at the most, just before trying the baby on the breast if the baby is refusing to latch on. See video clip Finger feed to latch. If the mother is not present to feed the baby or if the baby still doesn’t latch on after the finger feeding is attempted, then feeding the baby with a cup is better than finger feeding which can be slow.\nPlease Note: If the baby is taking the breast, it is far better to use the lactation aid tube at the breast, if supplementation is truly necessary (See information sheet Protocol to Increase Breastmilk Intake and Lactation Aid). Again, finger feeding is not a good method of supplementation in the latching baby.\nFinger feeding (best learned by watching and doing).\nSee also the video clip Not Yet Latching; Finger feed to Latch\n- Wash your hands. It is better if the fingernail on the finger you will use has been cut short, but this is not necessary.\n- It is best to position yourself and the baby comfortably. The baby’s head should be supported with one hand behind his shoulders and neck; the baby should be on your lap, half seated. It may be easiest if he is facing you. However, any position which is comfortable for you and the baby and which allows you to keep your finger flat in the baby’s mouth will do. See the video clip Finger feed to latch.\n- You will need a lactation aid, made up of a feeding tube (#5French, 93 cm or 36 inches long), and a feeding bottle with an enlarged nipple hole, filled with expressed breast milk or supplement. The feeding tube is passed through the enlarged nipple hole into the fluid.\n- Line up the tube so that it sits on the soft part of your index, thumb, or middle finger. The end of the tube should line up no further than the end of your finger. It is easiest to grip the tube, about where it makes a gentle curve, between your thumb and middle finger and then position your index finger under the tube. If this is done properly, there is no need to tape the tube to your finger.\n- Using your finger with the tube, tickle the baby’s upper lip lightly until the baby opens up his mouth enough to allow your finger to enter. If the baby is very sleepy, but needs to be fed, the finger may be gently insinuated into his mouth. Pull the baby’s lower lip out if necessary by exerting some downward pressure on the baby’s chin. Generally, the baby will begin to suck even if asleep and as he receives liquids he will then wake up.\n- Insert your finger with the tube so that the soft part of your finger remains upwards. Keep your finger as flat as possible, thus keeping the baby’s tongue flat and forward. Usually the baby will begin sucking on the finger, and allow the finger to enter quite far. The baby will not usually gag on your finger even if it is in his mouth quite far, unless the baby is not hungry or he is very used to bottles.\n- Gently pull down the baby’s chin, if his lower lip is sucked in.\n- The technique is working if the baby is drinking. If feeding is very slow, you may raise the bottle above the baby’s head, but usually this should not be necessary. Try to keep your finger straight, flattening the baby’s tongue. Try not to point your finger up, but keep it flat. Do not apply pressure to the roof of baby’s mouth.\n- The use of finger feeding with a syringe to push milk into the baby’s mouth is, in my opinion, too difficult for the mother to do alone and definitely not more effective than simply using a bottle with the nipple hole enlarged and the tube coming from it. The idea of finger feeding is not to feed the baby! The idea is to train the baby to suck properly so that pushing milk into his mouth defeats the whole purpose of finger feeding.\nIf you are having trouble getting the baby to latch on to or to suckle at the breast, remember that a ravenous baby can make the going very difficult. Take the edge off his hunger by using the finger feeding technique for a minute or so. Once the baby has settled a little, and sucks well on your finger (usually only a minute or so), try offering the breast again. If you still encounter difficulty, do not be discouraged. Go back to finger feeding and try again later in the feed or next feeding. This technique usually works. Sometimes several days, or on occasion a week or more, of finger feeding are necessary, however.\n(best learned by watching and doing)\nCup feeding (and similar vessels like spoon, etc) is a method of feeding baby that has been around for a very long period of time. It should be used to feed a baby who is not yet taking the breast and is better than a bottle. This should not be used to supplement a baby who is taking the breast (see the information sheets Lactation Aid and The Baby Who Does Not Yet Latch).\n- Sit baby upright on your lap with baby’s head supported while you have one hand behind his shoulders and neck\n- Use a small medicine cup or shot glass when first learning how to cup feed\n- Place the edge of the cup gently on baby’s lower lip\n- Bring the liquid to baby’s lower lip so baby will lap it up like a pussycat. Do not pour the liquid in baby’s mouth\n- It is important to maintain the level of the liquid as best as possible so baby can continually lap it up.\n- Go slowly as the two of you learn how to do this. Eventually, this can become a very fast and efficient way of feeding until baby learns to take the breast, and this is a good method to use to avoid artificial nipples and teats.\nIf you are leaving the hospital finger or cup feeding the baby, make an appointment with the clinic within a day or so of discharge, or get other good hands-on help quickly. The earlier the better. Once the baby is taking the breast, he may still require the lactation aid to supplement for a period of time; because although the baby may take the breast, the latch can still be less than ideal, and the suck may still not be efficient enough to ensure adequate intake.\nThe information presented here is general and not a substitute for personalized treatment from an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) or other qualified medical professionals.\nThis information sheet may be copied and distributed without further permission on the condition that it is not used in any context that violates the WHO International Code on the Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes (1981) and subsequent World Health Assembly resolutions.

It will be a randomized blind study. One group will be randomized to use bottle to feed and another one to use a cup to feed. As secondary endpoints, weight gain, days of life to begin full oral feeding, length of hospital stay and breast feeding rates will be observed.\nBreastfeeding is the better method to promote adequate growth and development in preterm infants. However, sometimes preterm infants needs to be supplemented with the own mother milk or formula using another methods.\nThe cup and the bottle have been used in neonatal units, however there is still no evidence to determine the best feeding method, which must be safe, efficient and not jeopardize breast feeding.\nThe aim of this study is evaluates the effect of the use of bottle and cup in breast sucking patterns. The intervention will be the use of bottle or cup to feed preterm infants before or to supplement breastfeeding after randomization. Nowadays, bottle feeding is the conventional method and we wish to compare sucking patterns after use of bottle or cup. As secondary endpoints, weight gain, days of life to begin full oral feeding, length of hospital stay and breast feeding rates will be observed. In order to achieve this aim, a blind randomized clinical trial will be done with 96 very low birth weight infants, in which a group is randomly selected to be breast fed and get supplementary food using a cup and another to get supplementary food using a bottle.\nThe trial's inclusion criteria are: birth weight < 1500 g (very low birth weight infants), gestational age from 26 to 32 full weeks, absence of congenital anomalies in the face, head and neck, without severe asphyxia (Apgar < 5 on the 5th minute), negative tests for AIDS, absence of pulmonary chronic disease, mothers willing to breastfeed. Exclusion criteria are: intraventricular hemorrhage (degree III or IV), necrotizing enterocolitis, infection after the beginning of the trial.\nOnce all newborns in the trial were clinically stable (normal blood pressure without needs of oxygen) and with a volume intake of at least 100 ml/Kg/day of milk through the orogastric tube, they will receive oral-motor stimulation through a stimulation program previously published (2002). Once the newborn meets the criteria to begin oral feeding, an instrumental assessment of non-nutritive sucking and nutritive sucking will be carried out. Intra-oral pressure is assessed in non-nutritive sucking using a pressure monitoring device in a gloved finger: intra-oral negative pressure will be registered using a pressure transducer inserted through a catheter to the tip of the gloved little finger. This catheter will be connected to a second pressure transducer. Simultaneously, breathing (respiratory flow) will be measured using a pneumotachograph coupled to a nasal Prong. Two minutes of sucking will be collected from the moment the newborn responds to the search reflex and grabs the finger. During nutritive sucking assessment, respiration (respiratory flow) will be measured using a pneumotachograph coupled to a nasal Prong. At the same time intra-oral sucking pressure will be recorded by a pressure transducer connected to a catheter located on the mother's breast. Nutritive sucking will take place in the first 5 minutes of breastfeeding. After the first assessment has been concluded, the newborn will be randomly assigned either to the group that will use a cup or a bottle for supplementary feeding using randomized block design. Assessments will be repeated at discharge from the hospital.\nThe study is taking place at Fernandes Figueira Institute and was approved by the Institutional Review Board.\nAllocation: Randomized, Control: Active Control, Endpoint Classification: Safety/Efficacy Study, Intervention Model: Single Group Assignment, Masking: Single Blind (Caregiver), Primary Purpose: Supportive Care\nInfant, Very Low Birth Weight\ncup feeding, bottle feeding\nInstituto Fernandes Figueira\nRio de Janeiro\nInstituto Fernandes Figueira\nResults (where available)\n- Source: http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00703950\n- Information obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov on July 15, 2010\nThe overall purpose of this research is to test whether adding a supplement to the feeding of extremely low birth weight infant (infants weighing less than 2 pound 2 oz at birth) will help...\nIn this study, we want to see how feeding affects breathing in small premature babies.

{"question":"How do pygmy goats and wind turbines affect animal welfare - what's needed for safe goat weaning and how many birds get hurt by wind farms each year?","answer":"For pygmy goats, proper weaning requires 8-12 weeks of nursing or bottle feeding before weaning can begin, as they are born with underdeveloped rumens. The process needs patience and careful monitoring to avoid issues like weight loss and diarrhea. As for wind turbines' impact on birds, they kill between 100,000-440,000 birds annually according to estimates. By 2030, with over 100,000 wind turbines expected in the U.S., at least one million birds per year are projected to die from turbine collisions, possibly more. This affects various species including eagles, songbirds, and endangered species.","context":["How to wean a pygmy goat\nThomas Northcut/Digital Vision/Getty Images\nWeaning a pygmy goat properly requires patience and attention to detail. Like standard-sized goats, pygmy goats are born without functioning rumens, which simply means that you need to give that part of their stomachs time to mature and operate properly before attempting to wean the kids.\nTrying to wean pygmy goat kids without allowing them enough time to adapt to eating a forage-based diet could lead to dietary issues, including poor weight gain, diarrhoea, starvation and parasite problems. As a rule, allow your pygmy goat kids to nurse or bottle feed for approximately eight to 12 weeks before weaning them.\nGive 24-hour access to hay and grass starting sometime during the first week following the birth of your pygmy goat kids. Opt for high-quality alfalfa hay, if possible, which helps ensure that the pygmy kids get plenty of protein, especially as they get closer to weaning age. If the kids nurse, release them out into your goat pasture alongside their mothers. If you bottle feed and raise the kids separately from their mothers, make sure they have a secure fenced-in area that contains plenty of mixed forage, including grass and weeds.\n- Weaning a pygmy goat properly requires patience and attention to detail.\n- Like standard-sized goats, pygmy goats are born without functioning rumens, which simply means that you need to give that part of their stomachs time to mature and operate properly before attempting to wean the kids.\nKeep a water-filled bucket within easy reach of the pygmy kids at all times. Position the bucket on the outside edge of the pen to minimise the chances of accidental drowning and soiled water.\nFeed each female pygmy goat kid a small amount of goat grain once daily when they reach three to four weeks of age. Sprinkle a small handful of the grain into a small feed bucket or bowl. Separate the female pygmy goat kids one at a time from the rest of the goat herd and give each one access to the goat grain for a few minutes. Although the kids will only sniff the grain at first, they should start nibbling on it within a few days.\nDecrease milk availability when the pygmy kids reach eight to 12 weeks of age, at which point they should be drinking water and consuming plenty of grass and hay on a daily basis. Separate nursing kids from their mothers for 12 hours of each 24-hour period for one week, then separate them completely. If you bottle feed, substitute water for 1/2 cup of milk each feeding for several days; gradually increase the amount of water (and decrease the amount of milk) each feeding until the pygmy kids are consuming nothing but water.\n- Keep a water-filled bucket within easy reach of the pygmy kids at all times.\n- Separate the female pygmy goat kids one at a time from the rest of the goat herd and give each one access to the goat grain for a few minutes.\nMonitor the pygmy kids closely during the first two weeks following the weaning process. Keep the water bucket filled with clean water and make sure the hay rack contains plenty of unsoiled hay at all times. If your pygmy kids nursed, be prepared for loud bleating from both the mother and the kids during this post-weaning time period; in most cases, they should calm down within two or three weeks.

By 2030, there will likely be more than 100,000 wind turbines in the U.S., and these are expected to kill at least one million birds each year—probably significantly more. Wind farms are also expected to impact almost 20,000 square miles of terrestrial habitat, and over 4,000 square miles of marine habitat by 2030, some of it critical to threatened species.\nTo be a truly green source of energy, wind power needs to be Bird-smart and that means wind power employs careful siting, operation and construction mitigation, monitoring, and compensation to reduce and redress any unavoidable bird mortality and habitat loss from wind energy development. These are issues that should be included in mandatory federal wind standards. All wind farms should employ bird-smart principles and comply with relevant state and federal wildlife protection laws.\nWhat is bird-smart wind energy?\nBird-smart wind power implements careful siting considerations, operation and construction mitigation, bird monitoring, and compensation to reduce and redress unavoidable bird mortality and habitat loss. These are issues that the federal government should include in mandatory wind standards. For terrestrial wind farms, bird-smart wind should address:\n- Siting: Bird-smart wind power (including wind farms and associated infrastructure) is sited to prevent harm to birds, ideally in already altered habitats such as farmland, and avoids sensitive areas. Examples of such areas may include migratory bottlenecks, wetlands, raptor concentration and key nesting areas, the edges of ridges used by migrants, key habitat or flight paths for endangered or declining species, breeding concentrations of species that avoid tall structures (such as some grouse species), and in or adjacent to Important Bird Areas. Maps with detailed data on wildlife are currently being developed by conservation groups for use by the wind industry. Pre-construction assessments should always be conducted to confirm whether a particular site presents an especially high risk to birds. Some areas are not going to be suitable for wind development.\n- Operation and Construction Mitigation: Bird-smart wind power uses the best technology and management practices to avoid and minimize harm to birds, such as by burying transmission lines in high risk areas, following Avian Power Line Interaction Committee standards for above-ground transmission lines, using lighting that minimizes nighttime migratory bird collision mortality (such as strobe lights), using unguyed rather than guyed meteorological towers, and restoring habitat disturbed by construction, e.g., re-compacting soils disturbed by construction and replanting native vegetation (or restoring the site if the wind farm is decommissioned).\n- Monitoring: Bird-smart wind power conducts effective, federally reviewed and approved, site-specific, pre- and post-construction studies/assessments to assist with improved siting and operation, and to properly quantify impacts. Pre-construction assessments must provide sufficient data to assist with micro-siting (e.g., by use of radar to detect local bird movements), create an annual baseline against which post-construction studies can be evaluated, use all existing available bird study data, and be conducted during months when bird use can be expected to be at its peak at the selected site. Post-construction studies must employ mathematical models that best account for variations in local conditions and the relative difficulty of locating bird carcasses in different habitats, as well as any scavenging by predators that may reduce the number of carcasses found, and run for at least two years (and long enough to determine the efficacy of, and make needed revisions to, operational mitigation measures).\n- Compensation: Bird-smart wind power redresses the loss of any birds or habitat unavoidably harmed by construction and operation to a net benefit standard. This includes bird deaths caused by collisions with turbines and their associated power lines, and lost or degraded habitat (e.g., areas of abandoned habitat) Such compensation could include acquiring additional land for the National Wildlife Refuge system or other off-site habitat conservation projects.\nAlthough offshore wind power is not yet operational in the U.S., an analogous set of siting, operating, and compensatory measures need to be developed to make it bird-smart.\nAll wind farms should have an Avian Protection Plan which includes American Bird Conservancy’s bird-smart principles, and a means of implementing them and tracking and reporting on this implementation. Wind farms should also comply with relevant state and federal wildlife protection laws such as the Endangered Species Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, and National Environmental Policy Act.\nHow would you know if a potential wind farm site will have large or small impacts to birds?\nSee section above on pre-construction monitoring and post-construction monitoring.\nIsn’t the Federal Government developing wind energy regulations?\nNo, the Federal Government has released draft, voluntary wind-energy guidelines that were produced from recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior by a Federal Advisory Committee. During the public comment period on those proposed voluntary guidelines, ABC will urge that that the Department of the Interior enact mandatory standards that the industry must follow. We do not believe that energy industries should be able to choose whether or not to consider bird impacts.\nA recent lawsuit regarding the Altamont Pass Wind Farm in California illustrates that getting the right thing done voluntarily is anything but a sure thing. Recent studies say that approximately 7,600-9,300 birds were killed there each year, including 55-94 Golden Eagles, 475-477 American Kestrels, 253-433 Red-tailed Hawks, and 714-718 Burrowing Owls. After seven years of being challenged by various conservation groups, it finally took a lawsuit to get changes made at Altamont Pass. NextEra Energy Resources has only recently agreed to replace 2,400 of its old wind turbines at Altamont Pass with fewer, larger models that produce the same amount of total power. They also agreed to place the new turbines in “more environmentally friendly” locations, and to pay $2.5 million for research and raptor habitat improvement.\nWhat kinds of birds are impacted by wind farms?\nPotentially all night-migrating songbirds are at risk of colliding with wind turbines, as are raptors and other birds when wind farms are sited in areas they frequent. Habitat loss is also an issue as wind farms can degrade bird habitat or cause birds to abandon habitat.\nGolden Eagles will be especially impacted because much of the additional wind build-out planned for the western U.S. is expected to occur in areas they inhabit. The endangered Whooping Crane will be exposed to additional risk from collision with new power lines erected to service wind farms along their migratory pathways.\nTo a Greater Sage-Grouse and some other birds, any tall structure such as a wind turbine is a threat because it is a potential perch for a predatory bird. A wind turbine standing a considerable distance away has much the same effect as a small tree at a few hundred yards, causing sage-grouse to abandon traditional lekking grounds up to three miles away from a wind farm. Unfortunately for the Sage-Grouse, Wyoming, one of this bird’s last remaining strongholds, is slated for significant wind farm build-out. It is very important for the future of the Greater Sage-Grouse that this development is appropriately sited\nHow many birds are killed by wind farms each year?\nNo one knows for sure. Recent estimates of the number of birds killed by wind turbines ranges from a low of 100,000 birds/year to 440,000 birds/year (calculated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service). If 20% of the nation’s electricity comes from wind power by 2030, ABC estimates that at least one million birds per year will be killed by wind turbines, probably significantly more.\nAren’t there laws that protect birds from being killed by wind farms?\nWhooping Cranes and some other birds are protected under the Endangered Species Act. Golden Eagles are protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BAGEPA), and most migratory birds are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). Unfortunately, both the BAGEPA and MBTA are not currently sufficiently enforced to prevent predicted mortality resulting from wind development. However, in 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to begin issuing permits for wind farms that expect to kill Golden Eagles, contingent on the wind farms taking tangible steps to protect eagles. The Greater Sage-Grouse, meanwhile, currently receives no federal legal protection, though several states have stepped up to protect remaining core breeding areas.\nRead full ABC Policy Statement on Wind Energy"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3b219a84-924d-4aa7-baf8-625ec6ec07f7>","<urn:uuid:ad348f5b-9b9c-419d-9045-9be2eb6e06f6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do regular artificial insemination and timed artificial insemination compare in terms of their procedures and requirements?","answer":"Regular artificial insemination needs to be performed within 12-18 hours of excitement and requires careful detection of the proper excitement time in cows. In contrast, timed artificial insemination involves synchronizing ovulation in females through a pre-synchronization program. In timed AI, particularly when using sexed semen, heifers need to be worked through the chute an extra time (about a week before the typical schedule) to ensure they all ovulate at a more concentrated time. This pre-synchronization is similar to what's done in dairy operations and helps achieve better results, especially with sexed semen which requires more precise timing than conventional semen.","context":["Utilizing sexed semen can increase productivity in beef cattle operations\nArtificial insemination and embryo transfer programs are one way to have access to the best genetics. By adding sexed semen into the equation, producers have an array of options to improve the genetics within their herd.\nDuring a recent University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) Beefwatch podcast, Texas A&M’s Dr. Cliff Lamb dives in to discuss how to utilize sexed semen to its fullest potential.\nGenetics and biosecurity\nThe ability to freeze a bull’s semen and ship it all over the world has made a tremendous impact on the beef industry’s genetics.\n“First, we started by collecting a bull and distributing semen,” shares Lamb. “The progress from before we could freeze and ship chilled semen, to where we are today has probably enhanced genetic progress almost more than any other single technology.”\nIn the U.S., only 10 to 12 percent of beef cattle females are inseminated, which does not seem great like a great amount, but this practice has given a lot of access to genetics.\n“Not only do we see an improvement in genetics, but we can do it in a fairly herd health safe way. When semen is shipped, producers can stay away from many of the transmittable diseases,” notes Lamb.\nUse of technology\n“In the last 30 years, the understanding of how to separate male and female sperm has had a huge impact on the industries,” Lamb shares.\nAccording to Lamb, the only way to sex semen is through flow cytometry. This method can distinguish the size between male and female sperm, as female-bearing sperm tends to be greater in size.\nLamb explains the sperm is put under an extreme amount of pressure, making each one into a droplet, which is measured in size using laser technology and given a dye. The female sperm is larger in size, giving it more of a charge coming through the machine which separate it from male-bearing sperm.\n“Under conventional semen, there is generally a 50/50 mix of Y (male) or X (female) sperm, but when we sex the semen, we end up with greater than 90 percent accuracy of getting the desired sex,” explains Lamb.\nSexing the semen also gives the producer a cleaner sample of sperm. In conventional semen, there can be other cells present. These unwanted cells get cleaned out in the processing procedure before sexing.\nApplying sexed semen in timed AI\nAccording to Lamb, current technology allows producers to breed their genetically superior animals to sexed semen to create heifer calves. These heifers enter into the herd, providing desired genetics.\nThis does not mean the producer has to select all their females to be sexed semen. Sexed semen tends to be more expensive than conventional semen, but can also result in a five to 10 percent lower pregnancy rate.\n“Sexed semen must be timed with ovulation more closely than how producers would time with conventional semen,” Lamb says, explaining sexed semen is more grouped than convention semen, which limits the capacity to spread.\nWith timed artificial insemination (AI), synchronizing ovulation of the females is key to getting the best results for sexed semen. Lamb shares this means females will need to be worked more often to benefit from the use of sexed semen.\n“We’ve started utilizing a pre-synchronization program, like one would see in a dairy,” he says. “We run heifers through the chute an extra time, a week before we typically would if we weren’t using sexed semen.”\nHe continues, “This allows us to pre-synchronize the heifers so they’re all at a more concentrated time of ovulation than the current systems of conventional semen.”\nThere is a lot of time put into economic analyses on sexed semen, so producers can break down their options and determine which will benefit them most. In the past three years, Lamb has worked on a project involving sexed semen, where 3,000 heifers were bred on 25 different operations.\n“We used their actual data to come up with a model to determine some of the key things producers need to understand if they’re considering using sexed semen,” says Lamb, noting this model allows producers to decide if adding sexed semen into their program will hold value.\nLamb explains producers need to have a good idea on the expected premium for the desired sex. In addition, they need to know the size of the herd, anticipated weaning weights and the difference in weaning weights between desired and undesired sexes. Ultimately, sexed semen is more expensive, as producers are paying for the technology.\n“If producers are selecting to create females over conventional semen, we realized the premium, or the perceived premium of the heifer, would have to be $154 more per heifer than if she had a male of the same sex,” states Lamb.\nEach herd and management system are different, but creating this model has provided more information for producers to use in deciding if sexed semen will benefit their operation.\nDelcy Graham is a corresponding writer for the Wyoming Livestock Roundup.

The calf produced in this method contain 50% suchness of hybrid ox. By artificially inseminating of this new cow it will produce a new calf which contain 75% suchness of ox. It takes 8-9 years to produce fully hybrid cow through artificial insemination. The cow containing 75% suchness of hybrid cow is suitable for rearing according to the weather condition and management system of our country.\nUsefulness of Artificial Insemination\n- We can get hybrid calf within short time.\n- Produce more meat and milk.\n- We can get strong and operative cows.\n- We can increase our income.\n- Unemployment problem can be eradicated.\n- We can increase the production of protein.\nPurpose of Artificial Insemination\n- Producing hybrid cow in low cost and short time.\n- Making source of employment.\n- Meet up the demand of meat and milk.\n- Produce strong cow for cultivation.\n- For increasing the production of protein.\n- Facing the insemination lacking and many diseases.\n- Produce calf according to our choice.\n- Advantages of Artificial Insemination.\n- Up to 300-400 cows can be inseminated by collecting semen from ox once.\n- We can get high productive cows by using the semen of hybrid ox.\n- The semen can preserved for many years.\n- Artificial insemination helps to prevent different types of disease.\n- No need to raise so many ox, as a result rearing cost of ox get reduced.\n- Increases the probability and rate of pregnancy.\n- No risk of accident.\n- The semen can transported anywhere throughout the world.\n- High productive cow can produce by mixing various species together.\n- Artificial process takes less time to inseminate the cow.\n- Productivity of local species can be developed by artificial insemination.\nDifficulty of Artificial Insemination\n- Expert person needed for inseminating and collecting semen.\n- Requires physical cleanliness.\n- It will be best if insemination process done within 12-18 hours of excitement.

{"question":"What role does stress play in the development of parasitic infections across both marine and freshwater aquatic systems?","answer":"In freshwater systems, stress is a major factor in Saprolegnia infections, with stressors including overcrowding, handling, poor water quality, spawning, and temperature changes. These conditions reduce the fish's natural defenses, particularly the protective mucous layer. Similarly, in marine environments, stress can make fish more susceptible to Marine Ich infections, leading to behavioral changes such as lethargy and abnormal swimming. In both environments, maintaining optimal conditions and minimizing stress is crucial for preventing outbreaks, as the parasites can spread quickly throughout the tank or pond when fish are compromised.","context":["Email Me This Post as a PDF Document, PleaseYour Email Address Address\nSaprolegnia – Water Fungus – by R.E. Carlson\nLike all fresh water environments, koi and goldfish ponds are living ecosystems. They contain plants, algae, invertebrates, protozoa, bacteria and molds or fungi. Many of the life forms in our ponds are dependent upon each other. This is known as symbiosis (living together). An extreme form of symbiosis is parasitism, where one life form lives at the expense of another. One of the more common forms of parasitism in our ponds is saprolegnia or water fungus. For the average ponder, great zoological detail about saprolegnia is not required to understand what it is, what it does and how to treat the pond and fish if it becomes a problem, therefore not much detail on the zoology of saprolegnia is offered here: just good-to-know information on how to identify and treat it as well as some tips to help prevent it from affecting your fish.\nWhat It Is\nSaprolegnia (or sap) is a freshwater fungus which simply means it lives in fresh water environments and needs water to grow and reproduce. Sap can also be found in brackish water and moist soil. It is often referred to as a “cold water” fungus as it flourishes in colder water, but it lives well in a wide range of water temperatures extending from 37 deg F to 91 deg F (3 to 31 deg C). While it has been described also as a “mold”, sap is a genus of fungus, with the difference being a “mold” is a mass of fungi.\nUnder the microscope, sap is composed of filaments that tend to have spherical ends. It is these spherical ends that house the zoospores, or the “seeds” of sap, that allow it to proliferate and spread. The filaments are called hyphae and give sap its cotton-like appearance. It is the hyphae, or more exactly, the hooked, foot-end of the hyphae, which penetrate the tissue of the fish as they seek nutrients. In the lower-power micrograph below, you can see the hyphae with the spherical ends. With a 400x microscope, the structure will look basically the same.\nIn the water, sap looks like fluffy cotton; however, out of the water it appears to be a matted mess of slime. Sap starts out either white or grey in color. The grey appearance also may indicate the presence of bacteria growing with sap’s structure. Over a short period of time, sap may turn brown or green as organic particles in the water (such as algae) adhere to the filaments. Note the picture below. This is a classic presentation of sap that has invaded a bacterial infection of the dorsal fin area of a koi. The green color is actually embedded algae particles within the sap’s filaments.\nBy appearance, sap can be easily confused with epistylus, a freshwater parasite that presents as a white cottony substance growing on the skin of the fish. Epistylus does not gather organic particles and will remain white. Confirmation of epistylus versus sap should be done with a microscope. The following is a microscope shot of epistylus at 400x:\nThe favorite food of sap is dead organic tissue. We can usually see evidence of sap on dead and dying fish, live and dead fish eggs and even food left in the water so long that it has begun to rot. Typically we see infertile koi eggs being infected first with the fungus then it spreads to kill live, fertile eggs. Infected eggs have a typical fluffy cotton wool-like covering. Sap also likes to feast on exposed and decaying tissue caused by bacterial infections, such as ulcers. It is most prevalent on the head and fins of the fish as these are the areas that offer the least amount of natural resistance provided by the mucous coat.\nPrimary and Secondary Invader\nTypically we think of sap as a “secondary” invader. This means that something else has violated the integrity of the fish’s skin allowing bacteria to enter and provide direct tissue access for the sap hyphae to embed themselves. In treating sap, it is imperative to treat BOTH the sap and the underlying primary cause. This will be discussed in more detail in the treatment section below.\nHowever, sap can also be a primary invader under the right conditions and this is where it gets the reputation as a “cold water” fungus. We all know that cold water conditions, including dramatic temperature changes, cause great stress on the fish and suppress the fish’s natural immune system. As stated above, sap flourishes in colder water by producing and releasing increased zoospore counts into the water. The combination of stress, suppressed immune systems, and increased spore counts give sap the ability to cause major problems in colder water. Sap infections are commonly the cause of “winter kill.”\nThe following is a list of conditions that support the spread of sap:\n- Overcrowding – stress and too many organics in too little water\n- Handling – stress and removal of the mucous coat on the fish\n- Epidermal integrity – open wounds that provide direct access to tissue\n- Parasites and pathogens – parasites cause wounds that allow pathogens (like bacteria) to enter the tissue thus giving sap a change to take hold and stress\n- Pollution – stress and reduced water quality\n- Spawning – stress and physical damage\n- Water quality – stress and reduced physiological conditions\n- Water temperature changes – stress.\nObviously the underlying theme in the above list is “stress” and this is the one thing that we need to guard against first and foremost to keep our fish healthy. In healthy conditions, our fish have some natural protection against sap with the mucous layer being the most effective first line of defense. The mucous layer provides the ability to reject a sap attack by sloughing off a layer of mucous and sending the sap with it. The mucous coat also provides a natural fungicide at the cell-level. So you can see that improper handling or any activity that reduces the mucous coat offers an increased opportunity for sap to take hold.\nDeath by SAP\nAn increased morbidity of fish caused by sap can be traced to three major things:\n- Low water temperatures\n- High concentrations of sap zoospores\n- Mechanical stress\nWe know that sap attacks fish weakened by any of the above and the suppressed nature of the immune system under cold water or high stress conditions leaves the fish mostly defenseless. However, what kills the fish in a sap attack is a condition known as hemodilution. By definition, hemodilution is “a decreased concentration (as after hemorrhage) of cells and solids in the blood resulting from gain of fluid from the tissues.” … this causes the blood to loose electrolytes (blood salts) and make it less than life-supporting. Then as the sap hyphae penetrate the tissue layers of the skin, water begins to enter the fish thereby further diluting the fish’s blood salts. This explains why fish grossly affected by sap appear lethargic and often lose their equilibrium.\nOnce it has (literally!) taken root, sap can spread rapidly over the surface tissue of the fish. While it is rare that sap will penetrate deep into tissue layers, even superficial damage to the fish’s initial tissue layers (and particularly the gills) can be deadly. Obviously, the more wide-spread the sap infection becomes, the higher the rate of hemodilution and greater chance that the fish will not recover. Therefore, managing the sap infection quickly becomes the key to saving the fish.\nProtection and Treatment\nObviously, the best “cure” for sap is prevention. As mentioned, sap is present in every pond and has its place in the order of life in the pond’s ecology. It really only becomes a problem when something has gone wrong with the fish and/or the pond or a condition such as cold water suppresses the fish’s immune system.\nSome of the steps we can take to reduce sap’s effectiveness include:\n- Providing a stress-free environment (which starts with excellent water quality)\n- The active reduction of organics in the pond (good mechanical filtration and a balanced ecology).\n- This also will reduce natural aeromonas bacteria counts\n- The quick removal of dead and dying fish and excess food\n- Proper handling (which starts with as little handling as possible)\n- Elimination of parasites\n- Increased water flow during warmer conditions\nBut no matter how hard we try, and especially for those ponds located in areas subject to cold water situations and/or rapid water temperature changes, sap is always a possibility. Except as noted above, there are no reasonable preventive measures, including the use of anti-fungal products as they just do not work effectively against sap. Therefore, we must be prepared to diagnose and treat sap as soon as we see it and here are some treatment recommendations:\nMalachite Green (MG):\nHands down, this is the best treatment for all fungal problems, including sap. (Get Malachite Green) MG baths and dips work_ exceptionally well and one treatment will usually solve the problem (assuming any contributing causes are corrected as well). There are certain cautions that go with using MG, such as use only in cooler, well aerated water, so read the label carefully for instructions and precautions. MG is not recommended as a pond-wide treatment for sap as the concentration levels needed to kill off sap are too high for a pond-wide treatment to be effective. Such products as ProForm C, a Malachite Green-formalin combination can help reduce the incidence of sap and parasites in the water, but because the sap hyphae may be deeply embedded, the stronger dip or bath method is recommended. Caution: Malachite green is carcinogenic and has been banned for use on food fish. Use MG with great care.\nThis is a distant “second best” treatment to MG. Salt in the 0.6 to 1.0% range for 30 minutes or less can help eliminate sap. The caution with this approach is that the higher the salt level, the more stress the fish will endure so check carefully on the stability of your fish prior to performing a high-level salt bath.\nFormalin is mentioned as a treatment for sap however, generally speaking, formalin is ineffective against most molds and fungi. Like MG and salt, formalin comes with its own precautions, including limiting its use in warm water, where low oxygen situations may develop. Handle formalin with care, its toxicity is well known. Diluted versions of formalin products, such ProForm C offer a nice one-two punch where MG takes out the sap and formalin gets the parasites. It is not recommended to use formalin against open wounds because of the harmful effect of formalin on exposed tissue and cell structures.\nIn the right hands, PP is one of the better treatments for sap. PP treatments at 4PPM (4g/1000 litres) will eliminate most of the sap but for deeply embedded sap hyphae, further surface treatments using a PP paste may be required. The down side of PP, of course, is the inherent danger of using it at all. It is not recommended for those inexperienced with its use.\nTreating a sap-affected fish requires that the wound site be tended completely. As mentioned, sap is generally a secondary invader; this means something else went wrong to allow the sap to take hold, like a parasite attack or another wound that opened the tissue. So, when treating a sap-affected fish, first eliminate the sap from the surface of the fish and then treat the actual wound site, which is most likely starting to look like an ulcer. For the latter, Tri-Cide Neo, iodine, PP paste and/or Debride topical ointment are good choices. Depending on the extent of the underlying wound, injectable medications may be required and the assistance of a veterinarian sought. If you suspect that cold water has allowed sap to become a primary invader, attention to the surface tissue of the affected fish is still required as the sap hyphae penetrates the tissue and can allow bacteria to enter the wound site.\nMuch has been said regarding the importance of using a microscope in the koi hobby. A microscope with a range up to 400x (eg 40X objective and 10X eyepiece) is an invaluable tool for diagnosing problems with our fish as well as viewing almost the entire spectrum of the ecology of our ponds from algae to parasites to the larvae of insects. At 200x, the filament structure of sap is easily to see and at 400x, the hyphae and spherical ends of sap are clearly discernible. Also, at 200x the movement of most parasites can be easily seen and at 400x, virtually all of the parasites that routinely inhabit our ponds can be detected and identified.\nAs you can see, sap is one of the major potential problems that we have to be prepared to deal with. Since sap is always present in our ponds, it is imperative to take as many preventative measures as possible to keep it from affecting the fish. But even the best pond keepers will eventually get a sap outbreak and when this happens, treatment must be quick and complete as this is not a problem that will just go away all by itself.\nImages provided by Mr. Richard Carlson and used with permission.","HOW TO DEAL WITH MARINE ICH IN THE SALTWATER AQUARIUM\nMarine Ich is a common disease affecting saltwater aquarium fish and, unless you know how to deal with it, it can spread quickly throughout your tank.\nMarine Ich is one of the most common diseases affecting saltwater aquarium fish and if you are not properly equipped with the knowledge to deal with an outbreak, the disease can spread quickly, infecting the other fish in your tank. Not only is Ich a quick-spreading disease but it can also be fatal if left untreated. If you want to keep your fish as healthy as possible you should take the time to learn the basics about what marine Ich is, how to treat it and how to prevent it. Prevention is infinitely more effective than treatment in terms of keeping your fish healthy.\nWhat is Marine Ich?\nMarine Ich is a disease affecting saltwater aquarium fish that is caused by the parasite Cryptocaryon irritans. This disease is also called Marine White Spot disease because it typically manifests in the form of small white spots on the gills, bodies and fins of marine fish. Marine Ich is very similar to freshwater Ich, or Ichthyophthirius, a disease caused by the parasite Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. Both parasites go through a similar life cycle beginning with the feeding and growing stage during which the parasite attaches itself to the host as a trophont, having the appearance of a small white spot. Once the trophont matures, it leaves the host and becomes a tomont which becomes encysted upon attaching to aquarium substrate or other tank surfaces. In cyst form, the tomont divides to produce up to 3,000 tomites which break out of the cyst wall and spread throughout the tank to seek a host body. The main way in which Marine Ich differs from freshwater Ich is that the Cryptocaryon irritans parasite stays encysted for a much longer period of time – up to one month. Once the cyst breaks open, however, both parasites spread rapidly throughout the tank, infecting whatever tank inhabitants they come into contact with.\nSymptoms of Marine Ich\nThe most common symptom of Marine Ich is the appearance of small white spots on the gills, body and fins of infected fish. You should be aware that while all species of saltwater aquarium fish are capable of contracting the disease, some species are more susceptible than others. Surgeonfish, for example, are highly likely to contract the disease while sharks and rays have a lower susceptibility to Marine Ich. In addition to white spots, infected fish may also develop ragged fins, cloudy eyes or pale gills. Some fish experience an increase in mucus production or changes in skin or scale color. In some cases, infected fish may exhibit behavioral changes, becoming lethargic, swimming abnormally, rubbing against tank objects or breathing more quickly than usual.\nTreating Marine Ich\nUnfortunately, there are many misconceptions regarding the treatment of Marine Ich which leads many aquarium hobbyists to go through ineffective treatment regimens. Unlike freshwater Ich, Marine Ich is not sensitive to temperature changes so increasing the temperature in your saltwater tank will not help to speed up the lifecycle of the parasite. Neither will the addition of cleaner shrimp or fish to the tank be beneficial in removing the parasite from the skin of infected fish because the parasite will eventually burrow into the skin below the mucus layer where cleaner shrimp and fish cannot reach it. One of the most common treatments for Marine Ich in the saltwater tank is the addition of copper to the tank water at a rate of 0.15 to 0.24 mg/liter. This treatment is typically effective within 2 to 4 weeks but you should be aware that prolonged exposure to copper can be dangerous for fish and it may lead to increased stress. Another option is to increase the salinity of your tank to 11 or 12 ppt and to keep it at that level for 4 weeks after the symptoms have gone away. If you are able to catch the disease before it spreads to other fish in the tank, you might also try moving the infected fish to a hospital tank to administer your treatment.\nMarine Ich can be incredibly tricky to treat because the cysts can remain dormant for such a long period of time. If you do not follow through with the proper treatment protocol, your tank could become re-infected as soon as the cysts break open and you will have to restart the entire treatment process. Your best bet is to keep the tank clean and to quarantine new fish to prevent an outbreak from happening in the first place but, if your fish do contract Marine Ich, it is important that you take action to begin a treatment regimen as soon as possible.\nMOST RECENT ARTICLES\nNothing makes an aquarium stand out like a large shoal of colorful fish.\nIf you want to select a high-quality commercial food for your aquarium fish you should understand how to interpret a fish food label.\nAlso known as the mystery snail, apple snails are a popular addition to the freshwater tank."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5606676c-9cad-477e-9b99-6fc12448d66c>","<urn:uuid:559cfc23-a41e-4cb4-8635-6c728ca926d3>"],"error":null}
