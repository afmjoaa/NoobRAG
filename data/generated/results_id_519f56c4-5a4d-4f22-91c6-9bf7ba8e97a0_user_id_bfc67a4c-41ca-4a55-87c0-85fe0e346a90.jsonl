The name of his blockbuster movie is Hatari!, starring John Wayne. Hawks increased his knowledge on animal catching from the humane work of Dr.Player. In 1952 South Africa was disastrously embarked to eliminate all large wild animals to protect livestock, and only 300 white rhinos survived. Player then started his famed rhino catching technique to relocate and save the white rhinos. Player’s humane project was called Operation Rhino and the renowned film documentary named Operation Rhino was produced. Hawks studied this film documentary repeatedly to help incorporate aspects of it into his film Hatari!.\nIn June 1964, Player appeared on the panel show To Tell the Truth as himself, highlighting his role as warden of Hluhluwe–Imfolozi Park and his work protecting white rhinos. Host Bud Collyer noted that scenes of white rhinos shown at the beginning of the episode were from Ivan Tors' movie Rhino!, released a few weeks earlier, and for which Player acted as a technical advisor.\n- Men, Rivers and Canoes – 1964 - Reissued 2007 - ISBN 978-0-9802501-2-1\n- White Rhino Saga – 1972 - ISBN 978-0-00-211938-2\n- Big Game – 1972 - ASIN: B0007BO5E4\n- Man and the Wilderness – 1986 - ASIN: B0007BQ0FG\n- Zululand Wilderness: Shadow and Soul – 1997 - ISBN 978-0-86486-340-9 - \n- Ian Player Perspective, stories by and about Dr. Ian Player\n- Walters, Paul (2003). \"CITATION by the Rhodes University Public Orator, Professor Paul Walters\" (doc).

Marra Lab research uses birds to help us define and understand broad environmental issues, tackling contemporary conservation challenges by addressing fundamental knowledge gaps at the intersection of ornithology, ecology and conservation biology.\nMigratory connectivity is the geographic and temporal linking of individuals and populations between one life cycle stage and another, such as between breeding and wintering locations for a migratory bird. The Marra Lab has completed or is working on or contributing to many range-wide tracking studies.\nThe full annual cycle describes a bird’s ecology across the year. The Marra Lab evaluates the impacts of climate on migratory birds in the different stages of their annual cycle in order to assess future effects of climate change on species’ vulnerability and the biology of birds.\nUrbanization has altered habitats, restructured avian communities, and influenced the range sizes and population dynamics of animal species. The Marra Lab researches how different anthropogenic changes to the natural world affect population trajectories of birds.\nAs of October 2019, the Kirtland Warbler’s successful recovery has lead to its removal from the endangered species list. The Marra Lab conducted a 4-year adaptive management experiment to reduce the Warbler’s reliance on conservation efforts.\nAlthough general threats to birds are well known (e.g., habitat loss, anthropogenic causes of mortality), we still cannot point to the specific limiting factors or causes of declines for most bird species. The Marra Lab investigates species- and population-specific limiting factors so conservation resources can be implemented in the highest-priority places\nThe Migratory Connectivity Project is working on two volume book entitled “Discovering Unknown Migrations: The Atlas of Migratory Connectivity for the Birds of North America.” This book will fill knowledge gap about the migratory connectivity for the birds of North America\nLaudato Si’ Professor of Biology and the Environment Professor, McCourt School of Public Policy Director, Georgetown University’s Earth Commons Emeritus Senior Scientist, Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center\nPete comes to Georgetown University after a 20-year career at the Smithsonian Institution, most recently as Director of the Migratory Bird Center. He has a Ph.D. from Dartmouth College and has authored over 225 papers published in journals such as Science, Nature and Conservation Biology on various aspects of the biology and conservation of birds and other animals, as well as on topics as broad as urban disease ecology. He co-edited the frequently cited book – Birds of Two Worlds and recently published a second book – Cat Wars: The Devastating Consequences of Cuddly Killer. Pete lives in Takoma Park with his wife and two kids, is an avid fisherman, a gardener and cook.\nScientist Nathan Cooper detangles and endangered Kirtland’s Warbler from the mist net. Nathan Cooper at the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center is doing research on federally endangered Kirtland’s warblers — tagging 100 of them with highly miniaturized nanotags in the Bahamas, and then using automated receiver towers that will monitor the entire breeding range in Michigan to relocate them. It is the first time anyone has been able to study the same individual birds on both the wintering and breeding grounds—their behavior, nesting success, physical condition, even changes in their internal and external micro-biome from one site to the other. This should be a gold mine of information on what biologists call carryover effects — the way conditions on the wintering grounds, which have long been ignored by migratory ecologists, impact the breeding success of birds thousands of miles to the north and many months (even years) later. Scientists are finding that winter conditions, not the quality of breeding habitat in the north, is the single biggest determinant for nesting success and the rapid rate of climate change in Central America and the Caribbean, especially persistent drought, makes this a critical issue for migratory bird conservation. More and more birds are facing poor conditions in the tropics, and paying a price in fewer eggs and chicks, and higher mortality.\nBryant is trained as a behavioral and population ecologist. His research interests primarily focus on the linkages between animal movement and population ecology with special interests dealing with populations of migratory land birds. His work on the ecology of migratory birds began with his work on differential migration in a population of Savanna Sparrows at Bowdoin College under Nat Wheelwright. Since then he has undertaken numerous field research positions working with the Black-throated Blue warblers at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, the stopover ecology of passerine migrants on the Gulf Coast with the University of Southern Mississippi, to the winter ecology of American redstarts in Jamaica with the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center. His MSc focused on the stopover ecology of migratory warblers in the Great Lakes. By utilizing an automated radio telemetry array, he was able to determine the factors that influence migratory movement dynamics across western Lake Erie and Southern Ontario with implications on wind energy development throughout the Great Lakes. Bryant is currently pursuing his PhD at Cornell University’s Department of Natural Resources, and Cornell Lab of Ornithology, where he has returned to work in Jamaica on American Redstarts (advisors: Peter Marra & Amanda Rodewald) looking to develop upon his interests in the movement, behavioral, and population ecology of migratory birds.\nBrian is a quantitative ecologist and data scientist specializing in the ecology of birds in human-dominated landscapes. Brian earned a B.S. in Ecology from the University of North Carolina at Asheville in 2006 and a PhD in Quantitative Ecology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2015. Brian’s work utilizes mark-recapture, point count, radio and GPS tracking, citizen science, and GIS data to assess landscape and regional predictors of bird population dynamics, movement ecology, and community composition. As an expert-level computer programmer, he assists colleagues in quantifying field data and teaches professional workshops and graduate classes on Program R and data science. Currently, Brian is creating a data management system for storing and accessing field data and developing unique citizen science and education programs that engage the public in the ecology and conservation of urban systems.\nAmy earned her B.S. in Ecology and Systematic Biology from California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo in 2003, and her M.S. in Natural Resources/Wildlife Biology, studying the spatial ecology of Common Ravens, from Humboldt State University in 2011. Amy is mapping the Bird Banding Laboratory’s database of band recoveries, which includes over 5 million recoveries spanning over one hundred years. This information, along with all of the tracking data for all avian species in North America, will be synthesized and compiled into the Atlas of Migratory Connectivity for North American birds. Amy is part of the Migratory Connectivity Project, which works to improve the understanding of migratory connectivity, to promote full annual and life cycle biology research, and to advance the technological tools needed to track birds.\nCalandra is interested in the behavioral ecology and conservation of migratory birds. Her research aims to understanding how migratory birds interact with their environment throughout their annual cycle using both laboratory and field studies. For her postdoctoral research she is using satellite transmitters to track Yellow-billed cuckoos in order to study their movement ecology and identify spatiotemporal patterns of mortality. Stanley earned her bachelor’s and master’s of science in biology from York University, Canada, and her Ph.D. in biological sciences at the University of Maryland under the supervision of Dr. Peter Marra and Dr. Michele Dudash.\nHenry graduated from Tufts University (Roll ‘Bos) in 2019 with a joint BS in Biology and Environmental Science. He grew up in Exeter, NH, where he discovered his passion for ornithology. He LOVES birds, and his desire to understand their ecology is what gets him out of bed in the morning (#ForTheBirds). Henry’s research interests lie at the intersection of conservation ornithology and tropical ecology, and his past research has focused on the breeding biology and dispersal of Gray Vireos (Vireo vicinior) in New Mexico, the use of remote audio recorders for surveying cryptic species in the Amazon, improving the conservation site network for migratory shorebirds in the Americas, and uncovering the life histories of Andean Cock-of-the-rocks (Rupicola peruvianus) and other understudied species in the cloud forests of Ecuador. At Georgetown, Henry plans to study the full annual cycle of Neotropical migratory wood-warblers, and use integrated population models to pinpoint factors driving their declines. With over 3.2 billion individual birds lost in North America since 1970, understanding and addressing the threats faced by these species is paramount for mitigating further declines.\nEmily is an avian ecologist that has been working with birds for the last ten years. She comes to the Marra lab from working for the National Park Service in Alaska, where she studied the movements, ecology, and behavior of Denali’s resident and migratory birds. Prior to working at Denali National Park and Preserve, Emily completed her MSc at Kansas State University investigating the patterns and mechanisms to within-season breeding dispersal in grassland sparrows. Emily received her BSc in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation and BA degree in English literature from the University of Florida. Emily’s research interests center in migration ecology, with a particular interest in the evolutionary and ecological processes that give rise to variation in migratory behavior. Emily’s PhD research will focus on understanding the drivers that lead to different migratory strategies between palearctic and Nearctic migratory birds. Beyond her academic interests, Emily is passionate about outreach and the accessibility of science, and never foregoes an opportunity to get people excited about birds."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e3d491de-bcad-4cb0-83d6-100a98698acb>","<urn:uuid:f5c5ea18-4555-4985-a531-d679bd3d007f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the diagnostic methods and surgical treatments available for hip injuries, particularly focusing on both internal and external damage?","answer":"Hip injuries are diagnosed through several methods, including physical examination, X-rays, and MRI scans. X-rays evaluate bony structures, while MRI is particularly useful for examining soft tissue structures like cartilage, labrum, and tendons. For treatment, hip arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgical option that uses tiny cameras and instruments to address issues within the joint, such as removing loose cartilage pieces and treating labral tears. The surgery is performed under general anesthesia using a special table for joint distraction. For external hip injuries like hip pointers, treatment is usually less invasive, typically involving crutches, pain medication, and home care methods like rest, ice, and compression. Surgery for hip pointers is rare and only necessary if there's internal damage revealed by CT scans or MRI.","context":["Lisa finally got the chance to start for the varsity volleyball team, and she really wanted to impress the coach. But on one play she got overeager and collided with a teammate while going for a spike. She landed flat on her side on the hard gym floor. Lisa felt a sharp, strong pain in her hip and had to be helped off the floor.\nAfter being taken out of the game, Lisa iced her hip and took some acetaminophen. But the next day her hip still hurt and was swollen and bruised. Her mother took her to see the doctor. It turned out Lisa had a hip pointer, a bruise to one of the bones of her hip.\nYour hip joint involves two bones. Your hipbone is called the iliac (pronounced: ILL-ee-ack) crest and the top of your leg bone (femur) is called the greater trochanter (pronounced: troe-KAN-tuhr). A hip pointer is a bruise to one of these bones or to the surrounding soft tissue (muscles, cartilage, tendons, etc.).\nIn rare cases, a hip pointer can also cause what's known as an avulsion fracture, where part of the bone is pulled away by the attached muscle.\nSince the bones in your hips don't have a lot of muscle and fat for padding, they're more susceptible to bone bruises. Bone bruises can be painful and take a while to fully heal.\nHip pointers are caused by a sudden impact that's hard enough to bruise your iliac crest or greater trochanter or cause damage to the soft tissue of your hip.\nSome of the more common causes of hip pointers include:\nAs with most sports injuries, how painful a hip pointer is or how long it takes to heal depends on the severity of the injury. Most hip pointers will be only a minor inconvenience and can be hard to see. But if you have a serious hip pointer, you'll know it.\nLook for these symptoms:\nIf you see a doctor about a hip pointer injury, he or she will examine the area for swelling and bruising. That might include pressing on your hip to see how tender the area is. The doctor will ask questions about how the injury happened.\nIn some cases, the doctor may call for X-rays or an MRI scan to see if there is a bone fracture or damage to the surrounding tissue. A doctor might also order an MRI or a computerized tomography (CT) scan to rule out any damage to internal organs.\nDoctors don't need to do a lot for most hip pointers. Your doctor will most likely recommend crutches. He or she may also prescribe medication to ease the pain.\nSome of the things you can do at home to treat a hip pointer include:\nSevere hip pointers can result in a hematoma or fracture, or in damage to internal organs like the spleen. These types of more serious hip pointer injuries might require a doctor's help. If you have a hematoma and get fluid buildup in your hip, a doctor may need to drain it.\nSurgery for hip pointers is rare. Most can be easily treated and heal in their own time. But if a hip pointer doesn't respond to other treatments (or if a CT scan or MRI reveals internal damage), surgery may be necessary to correct the condition.\nIt can be hard to prevent a hip pointer. They happen suddenly and can be difficult to see coming. Still, you can help reduce your chances of getting one by following a few simple guidelines when you play sports or exercise:\nConditioning exercises that strengthen specific areas of the body are good ways to protect yourself from hip pointers.

Surgeons primarily use arthroscopic surgery (tiny camera and instruments inserted into the joint) to remove loose bodies, which are small pieces of cartilage (tissue that covers the ends of bones) that have broken off and then move around inside the hip joint. Surgeons also use this surgery to treat labral tears, injuries to the cartilage of both the femoral head (ball) and acetabulum (socket), and femoroacetabular impingement (Fig.1).\nThe hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint that connects the femur to the pelvis (Fig. 2). There are different elements in and around the hip joint that can be a source of pain, such as damaged cartilage and ligament (tissue connecting 2 bones) tears. When the physician evaluates a patient, it is critical to determine whether symptoms are intra-articular (coming from within the joint itself), or extra-articular (around the joint). For conditions that arise within the joint, hip arthroscopy can be a possible solution to address these problems.\nDiagnosing hip pain\nYour physician will complete a thorough physical exam, record your health history, and order x-rays to determine the cause of your hip pain. X-rays are a good tool for evaluating the bony structures around the hip joint. Most patients with suspected intra-articular disease who do not have obvious arthritis on x-rays will also undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. A MRI is especially useful to evaluate the soft tissue structures around the hip, such as the cartilage, labrum, and tendons, which may be injured.\nIf you have no mechanical symptoms, such as catching, popping, or a clicking sensation in your hip, your physician often begins with nonsurgical treatment. Nonoperative treatments can include resting the joint if you are involved in regular exercise or athletic activity, anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy, and steroid injections. If these treatments fail to alleviate your pain and you continue to have difficulty either walking or standing, your physician may recommend hip arthroscopy.\nYour physician will discuss arthroscopic surgery with you if nonsurgical treatments have failed and your symptoms disrupt your normal day-to-day activities. Surgeons perform hip arthroscopy under general anesthesia and routinely use a special table to allow distraction (a gentle separation) of the ball from the socket to access to the intra-articular structures. Two common hip injuries treated arthroscopically are femoroacetabular impingement and labral tears (Fig. 3).\nFemoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a disorder of the hip in which the femoral head and neck rubs or “impinges” on the acetabulum. There are 2 types of FAI: cam impingement refers to a femoral-based disorder and is often seen in young athletic males and pincer impingement refers to an acetabular or socket-based disorder usually seen in active, middle-aged women. For both of these impingements, pain results from the proximal, or top of the femur abutting the acetabulum during range of motion, especially while bending. Patients often present with symptoms that include activity-related groin pain, difficulty sitting, and mechanical symptoms that includes a catching, clicking, or popping sensation during movement. If your physician suspects FAI, he or she will order x-rays to determine the shape and contour of the femoral head and neck as well as look for any abnormalities of the acetabulum. Your physician will also order a MRI to evaluate further the soft tissue structures in and around the hip.\nAt the time of arthroscopic surgery, the surgeon introduces the arthroscope into the hip joint to perform an initial diagnostic examination. Once inside the joint, the surgeon will look for disease or damage, such as cartilage defects of the femoral head and socket, loose bodies, and tears of the labrum.\nThe labrum is a horseshoe shaped structure that lines the outer rim of the hip socket. It is made of fibrocartilage and dense connective tissue. Sometimes when femoroacetabular impingement occurs, the labrum is torn. This tear can lead to pain during movement and you may experience catching, snapping, or locking. You may also feel a vague pain in your groin. If your doctor suspects a labral tear, as with FAI, you will undergo a MRI of the hip for further evaluation to confirm the diagnosis.\nThere are 2 main treatments of labral tears in regards to hip arthroscopy, labral debridement and labral repair. Labral tears not amenable to fixation are usually debrided, or trimmed back, to a stable base to the point that the unstable piece of torn labrum no longer causes symptoms. Your surgeon will remove any inflamed tissue in the hip joint and address any other underlying problems during surgery as well. This usually involves shaving some bone off the femoral head-neck junction as well as the hip socket so the bones do not rub against one another.\nA labral repair often involves attaching the labrum back to its original site with the use of specialized anchors and sutures. Postoperatively, patients use crutches to aid in walking and are restricted to limited weightbearing and limited hip bending for approximately 4 to 6 weeks while the labrum heals.\nHip arthroscopy for either FAI or labral tears is not without complications, although the complication rate is low. Complications reported with hip arthroscopy occur at a rate between 1.3% and 6.4%. Most complications are minor and are often self-limiting, but there are several major complications that have been described in hip arthroscopy that the patient should be aware of. These include traction neurapraxia, where there is a temporary loss of motor and sensory function of nerves surrounding the hip. This occurs when traction is placed on the operative leg to help distract the hip joint in order to gain access for the arthroscope. This often resolves soon after surgery and most patients have a complete recovery. Damage to major nerves and blood vessel structures around the hip joint can also occur. Additionally, damage from instrumentation can happen; but with proper positioning and technique, the incidence of this complication is low.\nOn the mend\nAfter surgery, you will be given instructions to follow for the weeks and months following surgery, including returning to see your physician for follow-up to see how you are progressing. Some of these instructions will include how to care for your portal sites and when you can shower or submerge the incisions in water. Additionally, you will be give crutches to use. Depending on the extent and type of repair, you may be on crutches for days, weeks, or months. When the hip has begun healing and the time is appropriate, your physician will refer you to rehabilitation. You should follow your rehabilitation program as instructed at the physical therapist’s office and at home. Physical therapy is a part of your treatment; therefore, you should adhere to the rehabilitation regime to achieve your best possible range of motion and functional outcome.\nHip arthroscopy can be an effective procedure and the risk of complications is low, although they do occur. Most patients are pleased with their outcomes and have resolution of symptoms, which allows them to get back to a more active lifestyle.\nAuthor: Garland J.

{"question":"What is the main difference between the ceremonial elements of a funeral viewing and a celebration of life ceremony?","answer":"A funeral viewing, which occurs during the visitation period, involves guests paying their respects directly to the deceased's body, which may require preparation such as embalming for preservation and a more life-like appearance. In contrast, a celebration of life ceremony focuses on storytelling and shared activities, featuring video clips, personal stories, and interactive elements that memorialize the person's life. The viewing is more formal and traditional, while the celebration of life is designed to be more personal and interactive, emphasizing the sharing of memories rather than formal ceremonial elements.","context":["Who is responsible for arranging a funeral?\nThe Executor named in the Will is responsible for all the affairs of a person following death including funeral arrangements. However, any close relative or friend is able to look after the funeral arrangements. If there is any conflict the Executor will have the final say.\nWhen a person has no Will, a close relative or friend may take responsibility. If there is conflict a Court may need to appoint someone. Court action delays funeral arrangements considerably and is a last resort. If a person has no Will and no family or friends wishing to be responsible for funeral arrangements, the State will fund a simple burial within three months of death.\nIf there are family members who wish to be responsible, but neither they nor the deceased have assets, the State may fund a simple funeral through the Bereavement Assistance Program. Centrelink may also assist financially depending on individual circumstances.\nWhat type of funeral service should I arrange?\nFunerals are often held in a Church, Funeral Chapel or Crematorium Chapel. However they may be held in any meaningful place such as a park, sporting facility or civic building. Following the service there will need to be final disposition of the body of the deceased, either through burial or cremation. Religion, cultural tradition or personal preference may shape this decision.\nWhat is the difference between a funeral service and a memorial service?\nA memorial service is a type of funeral held without the deceased in attendance. A memorial service is usually held if a person dies away from home, if the body is not recoverable from the place of death or burial or cremation has already occurred.\nWhat happens when I choose a burial?\nA person may be buried in a re-opened grave or a new grave. Two to three people may be buried in one grave depending on the cemetery. The grave may be in a lawn cemetery or general cemetery. Lawn cemeteries allow a small monument at the head of the grave and no division of religious denomination. General cemeteries allow full monuments to cover the grave and are usually divided into religious denominations.\nAll cemeteries in WA are publicly-owned and run by the local government authority or a cemetery board. According to the Cemeteries Act 1986, all cemeteries require a current Grant of Right of Burial. This grant is issued when a grave is purchased and is valid for 25 years. The grant must be renewed each subsequent 25 years, to ensure cemetery upkeep. The person named on the grant is the only person that is able to authorise further burials in the grave or the erection of monuments. It may take between six months and one year for a monument to be erected, however, William Barrett and Sons can supply a temporary grave marker if required.\nWhat happens when I choose cremation?\nCremation is the burning of the body and coffin which results in only the ashes remaining. When a person is cremated the entire coffin is placed in the cremator. After the cremation process the person who applies for the cremation is responsible for the ashes.\nAshes may be left in the care of the crematorium for some time, placed in the grounds of a cemetery or crematorium, kept at home, scattered or distributed. The crematorium will supply a simple container for the ashes. Urns can be purchased through William Barrett and Sons or the crematorium office.\nWhat coffin or casket should I choose?\nWilliam Barrett and Sons offer an array of coffins and caskets to suit individual taste and budgets. They may be constructed of a variety of materials including custom-board, cardboard, wicker, solid timber and steel and come in a variety of designs, including our exclusive Nature Series with images by Christian Fletcher. View our coffins and caskets.\nShould I have a viewing?\nThe choice to see a loved one prior to a funeral is a personal decision. It is important for each individual to do as they wish and not be swayed by the decision of others. When we meet to discuss the funeral arrangements it is helpful to have clothing and make-up (if applicable) and also a recent photograph. This will assist us with preparation of your loved one.\nWe will prepare your loved one in a way that is acceptable for a viewing whether you choose to see them or not. The family may assist in dressing their loved one or do their hair or make-up if they wish.\nThe preparation of a deceased person is an honour and our mortuary staff have the highest regard for the dignity and confidentiality of the deceased.\nIs embalming necessary?\nWhen a person dies their body begins to break down. This can be delayed through refrigeration but the most effective way to delay the breakdown is by embalming. Embalming is a surgical procedure similar to a blood transfusion. A qualified embalmer injects a solution into the circulatory system which preserves and disinfects the body and gives a more life-like appearance.\nEmbalming is optional, however it would be recommended or required:\n- For interstate or international travel\n- If there is an extended period between death and funeral\n- If a family member or friend would like to assist in dressing\n- If someone is to be taken home overnight\n- If there has been some physical trauma\n- If there is an infectious disease present","1921 West Genesee Street | Syracuse, New York 13204\nHow Does a Celebration of Life Differ from a Funeral?\nWhen deciding how to memorialize their loved ones, families often find that the choice of memorial event opens two options: celebrations of life and funerals. For those not experienced in the funeral industry, it can be challenging to make the distinction between the two options. And so within this blog, our team will highlight the main differences between funerals and celebrations of life.\nFirst, the Commonalities\nBefore deciding between a funeral and a celebration of life for a loved one, it’s important to recognize the elements that both types of event have in common. These include the following:\n- They’re designed to provide social support to the grieving family\n- They help friends and family acknowledge the death of a loved one\n- They provide an official means of recognizing a person’s death\nFunerals are the traditional form of remembrance for a loved one. Historically, they have comprised three specific elements as a means to provide order to the proceedings: the visitation, the funeral service, and the committal service.\n- The Visitation\nVisitations are held in the immediate time before the funeral and act as a way to support the family in recognizing the death of their loved one while paying respects. As part of the visitation process, a viewing may also take place where guests step up to the decedent’s body and pay their respects directly.\n- The Funeral Service\nThe funeral service is usually held at a church and led by a church officiant. There is a traditional order for funeral ceremonies, and this order includes the singing of hymns, Bible recitations and the reading of prayers, as well as speeches by family members and close friends.\n- The Committal Service\nThe committal service takes place at the decedent’s gravesite, and may involve the reading of further Bible passages as well as final prayers. The service ends with the casket being lowered into the ground.\n- Celebration of Life Events\nCelebration of life events are becoming more common and are designed to help friends and families share memories of the decedent while mourning their loss. They are deeply personal and can be organized according to the wishes of the decedent’s family. A celebration of life event will include the following elements:\n- A Short Ceremony\nRather than a deeply spiritual service, a celebration of life event is catered towards telling the story of the individual. It may include loved ones telling stories of the person, as well as the showing of video clips to highlight the person’s unique personality.\n- Post-Ceremony Activities\nThe celebration of life event is built around activities to memorialize the person. For example, loved ones might play a game that reminds them of the decedent. Or they might simply have a catered event at which all guests are welcome to share their stories.\n- A Release Activity\nTo conclude the celebration of life, many families have a release activity to symbolize the person being released into the spiritual world. They may choose to release balloons into the sky or release a bottled memory into the sea.\nBoth funeral events and celebrations of life hold a range of benefits for those remembering their loved ones. It’s important to consider both options carefully before making a selection and to speak with an industry specialist to determine the right option for your loved ones.

{"question":"What is the recommended DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) relatedness value for defining bacterial species?","answer":"If a strain belongs to a species, it should show 70% or higher DDH relatedness value to the type strain of that species.","context":["A species is often defined as a group of individuals that can actually or potentially interbreed in nature. In practice, this concept cannot be easily applied to any species. For example, you may not know with confidence if two insects that you encountered in a rain forest belong to the same species, as it can only be confirmed by breeding them under natural conditions (and you observe it!). Getting into the species concept of animals is this difficult. What would that be like for our invisible, but intimate strangers, Bacteria?\nIt would be best if I gave you an example to explain how we actually recognize bacterial species.\nThe pictures below show individuals belonging to two different species:\nYou do not need to be a taxonomist to classify them into two different species (..at least I hope not!)\nWe will not try to confirm this classification by interbreeding them, but our visual observation provides sufficient evidence for such a task (e.g. presence of extensive facial hair and jaw shape, etc.).\nNow, let’s try to classify bacteria depicted in the following pictures using your expertise:\nCan you tell me how many species are there in the above figure? Probably not. Even a king of bacterial taxonomy, if there is such a thing, could not classify these correctly just by observing the external shape of cells. This is why bacterial classification is a difficult task. And, the way we classify depends on how we define the species in bacterial world. So, the question remains, “how can we define bacterial species?”\nMany people think that science is ruled by some sort of governing body. This is partly true for bacterial taxonomy. There is a body called “International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes (ICSP)” which plays a role similar to the United Nations in international politics. Even though ICSP provides recommendation reports from time to time, it cannot formally setup the definition of bacterial species. It is rather decided by community efforts or consensus. At present, the most widely accepted species concept is called “Phylo-phenetic species concept” (Rosselló-Mora & Amann, 2001).\n“A monophyletic and genomically coherent cluster of individual organisms that show a high degree of overall similarity in many independent characteristics, and is diagnosable by a discriminative phenotypic property.”\nThere are several terms that I need to explain further:\nThe Practical Bacterial Species Concept\n“Phylo-phenetic species concept” sounds very solid. However, its application can be very tricky. Again, let me explain by some examples.\nIn the above figure, you can see 3 clearly differentiated clusters that can be confidently called species A, B and C. How about the below case?\nWell to me, the clear divisions of clusters are not apparent. However, we still need to classify and name the species (as we want to call them by names not bacteria X or 110982). To achieve this, bacterial taxonomists have introduced a concept of “type strain”. A type strain is a live strain that can serve the center of a species and regarded as the representative of a species. When multiple strains are discovered for a single species, we can choose a likely representative strain as the type strain. In practice, most of bacteria species are described with only one or two strains, the type strain of a species is often the strain which was first discovered. What I am trying to say is that “type strain” may not be very “typical” for a given species! For example, the type strain of Escherichia coli does not kill you, but other strains, such as O157 strains, can kill you easily.\nOnce the type strain is decided and deposited to the institutions called culture collections, it cannot be easily changed to other strain since the stability is very important virtue of taxonomy!\nLet’s assume that a team of taxonomists carried out research to classify the strains in the previous figure and come up with the following result:\nHere, the team found 3 species and designated 3 type strains for each. As a species is a coherent group of bacterial strains, we should employ the same measure of “coherence” or “similarity” for all 3 species. We need to define the followings to be “objective” for this classification process.\nDefining the above two criteria has been major challenge for modern bacterial taxonomy. In 1987, major players in the field of bacterial taxonomy have gathered in Paris to try to come up with an objective and stable criteria for future classification and identification of Bacteria. They foresaw that genome data (genotypic) are superior to phenotypic data (physiology and biochemisty), but sequencing of genome was not readily available until 1995. However, at that time, there were other molecular method, called DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH), to measure the degree of hybridization of genomes in solutions. If two genomes hybridize well, they should share similar nucleotide sequences.\nDDH provides overall, albeit indirect, measure of genomic similarity between two strains, and serves well as a surrogate for genome sequence comparison. In a seminal paper, Wayne and other taxonomists recommend DDH as the method for defining bacterial species and 70% relatedness as cutoff for the species boundary (Wayne et al., 1987). This Wyane et al. paper has been cited over 4,000 times which means that this proposal was well received. In conclusion, if a strain belongs to a species, it should show 70% or higher DDH relatedness value to the type strain of that species.\nThanks to the introduction of next generation sequencing (NGS), bacterial sequencing is now cheap enough and readily available to many researchers. I believe that genome sequence information is the best you can get for any taxonomic work that can eliminate the needs for many tedious and unreliable experimental taxonomic methods. Of course, it can replace the notoriously erroneous DDH in the definition of bacterial species. “Overall Genome Related Index (OGRI)” is a term for any computational method to calculate similarity between two genome sequences, first coined by Fred Rainey and myself in 2014. There are many different algorithms that can be used for comparing two strains, Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) has been most widely accepted. The generally accepted cutoff value for the species boundary is about 95~96% ANI. Here I recommend you the OrthoANI algorithm, an improved version of ANI, instead of the original ANI. (More about OrthoANI).\nFor both ANI and OrthoANI, about 95~96% is the cutoff. Does this mean this cutoff is really a clear and sharp one that can be used without exception? Let’s consider the following case:\nTwo strains show 95.1 and 94.9% OrthoANI, respectively, to the type strain of “species X”. Does this mean that strain A belongs to “species X” and stain B does not? You may think that I made this case up and it is not a probable case? The below is the real case of Vibrio vulnificus, a notorious pathogen from sea water.\nHere is a chart in which 31 V. vulnificus strains were examined for OrthoANI against to the type strain of the species. Many strains show OrthoANI values around 95%.\nWhen we look at the above dendrogram explaining overall taxonomic structure within the V. vulnificus , these strains may belong to the different species. However, OrthoANI values between the authentic V. vulnificus group (containing type strain) and the outlier group are around the proposed cutoff, i.e. 95%, therefore the decision is not a straight-forward one. In my opinion, two groups can be either different species or at least different subspecies. Anyhow, it is up to taxonomists who will work on the further evidence and draw the final conclusion. Meanwhile, I can only tell you that V. vulnificus is not a really one genomically coherent group.\nBy Jon Jongsik Chun (CEO of ChunLab, Inc. & Professor at Seoul National Univ.)\nJon is a scientist & entrepreneur dedicated to developing bioinformatics related to bacterial systematics, genomics, and microbiome.

{"question":"What are the key design features and limitations of eco-friendly food preservation systems?","answer":"Key design features include using natural cooling methods without electricity - the Solar Dryer Dome uses polycarbonate sheets and fans for air circulation, while modern evaporative coolers use filler materials like coconut husk and gunny bags that can retain water for over a day and create temperature differences of 6-7 degrees Celsius. However, these systems have limitations - evaporative coolers perform poorly in high humidity conditions since water cannot evaporate effectively. Other challenges include difficulty in packing filler materials if cylinders are too long, and water stagnation issues. The Solar Dryer Dome helps overcome traditional drying limitations, reducing drying time for products like bananas from 7 days to 3-4 days.","context":["Jakarta, 31 March 2017 – Impack Pratama and Covestro (formerly Bayer Material Science) signed a collaboration agreement – Inclusive Business Collaboration, on tackling the challenges of post-harvest management in underserved communities at the headquarters of Impack Pratama at Altira Tower, Jakarta, Indonesia, on March 31.\nHelping farmers to improve their livelihood\nThe inclusive business collaboration aims to improve the existing post-harvest management by disseminating Solar Dryer Domes to benefit small-holder farmers and agricultural cooperatives in underserved communities. This enables farmers to dry their agricultural products, such as bananas, tomatoes, chili, cocoa, coffee, herbs as well as fisheries products for fishing communities under more hygienic circumstances, while at the same time improving the quality and the output.\nHaryanto Tjiptodihardjo, President Director of Impack Pratama: “Impack Pratama as an Indonesian company would like to contribute to our countries underserved communities, especially to small-holder farmers and fishermen. We hope they will benefit by using the Solar Dryer Dome to improve the harvested products and income accordingly. We have been in business with Covestro (previously “Bayer MaterialScience”) for over 25 years. Over time we have built a strong relationship and trust. We believe this collaboration will contribute to the underserved communities in Indonesia and beyond to improve their livelihood. This will benefit many, as Indonesia is basically still an agrarian country with the majority of the population depending on agriculture and fisheries for their livelihood.”\nIncreasing productivity by up to 45 %\nWith traditional drying methods, such as road side drying, small-holder farmers often face the challenge of contamination of their harvest by dust, insects, rain water and UV light. Due to various factors 30 – 50 % of the products do not reach the market and are not turned into economic value.\nWith the Solar Dryer Dome, invented by Prof. Dr. Serm Janjai and his team at Silpakorn University in Thailand, the output of farmers can be increased by up to 45 %, improving the livelihood of farmers significantly.\nInnovative greenhouse solution\nThe dome works like a greenhouse. Due to the construction with polycarbonate sheets, the temperature inside the dome can be increased by up to 200 % compared to the outside temperature. The small fans enable the air to circulate and remove moisture from the dryer. Also, the sheets protect the products from UV light. The increase in temperature shortens the drying process significantly. E.g. bananas can be dried within 3-4 days instead of 7 days with conventional methods.\nRichard Northcote, Chief Sustainability Officer at Covestro: “Covestro has been working on food security solutions for several years, with projects already on the way in Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar as well as Indonesia. It is an integral part of our sustainable business targets to reach and economically benefit 10,000,000 people in underserved markets by 2025. The collaboration with our customer Impack Pratama will help us to get closer to achieving this goal, by providing their know-how, access to the market and last but not least their passion to move this forward together.”\nApart from the conventional sales channels, the two partners are planning to bring the solution to the market by collaborating with e.g. social enterprises, NGOs, the government and micro-finance institutions.\nImpack Pratama and Covestro are confident that with this partnership, they will enable the farming communities to build a more sustainable business and thus contribute to the development of the agricultural sector in Indonesia and beyond.","India is a developing country with an agro-based economy. Around 70% of the Indian population lives in villages, which still lack basic facilities such as clean water, electricity, sanitation, etc. Another critical problem seen in rural areas is the problem of staying healthy, which depends on the quality of food consumed. Since rural areas cannot afford sophisticated methods of food preservation, other sustainable ways need to be thought of. Fortunately, there are innovative devices such as “Food Preservator” that can minimize the difficulty faced by rural folk in storing edible, perishable items.\nIn ancient times, earthenware pots were used to preserve food and cool water during the Indus valley civilization. This earthen food preservator named ‘Zeer’ works under the principle of evaporative cooling refrigeration that does not require any external energy. A Zeer is constructed by placing a clay pot within a larger clay pot with a layer of wet sand in between the pots and a wet cloth on top. Evaporation of water from the outer pot draws heat from the inner pot; thus, the device cools as the water evaporates, allowing refrigeration even in hot, dry climate. It must be placed in a dry, ventilated space for the water to evaporate effectively toward the outside.\nA few Biotechnology students from R.V. College of Engineering, Bangalore (RVCE) were interested to design an apparatus that is innovative, eco-friendly and more importantly something that would help the rural folks to preserve food for longer time. Their project was one of the 35 shortlisted projects for the All India Young Engineers Humanitarian Challenge (IEEE AIYEHUM 2011).\nInspired by the age-old techniques such as Zeer, RVCE students created a modern food preservator that works with the principle of evaporative cooling refrigeration. The preservator does not use any electricity, uses water as a coolant and is made up of non-polluting materials that are easily available to rural folk. The preservator is of 43cms height and has a base width of 31cms. The outer cylinder has pores of diameter 1.6cm and the inner cylinder has pores of diameter 0.6 cm. The space between the two cylinders is 5 cm. The skeleton of the entire device is made of aluminum.\nThe main challenge in designing such a preservator was choosing the right filler layer for efficient cooling. The various filler materials used and the results obtained are mentioned below:\n|Filler material||Temperature difference||Shelf life of material||Water retaining capacity|\n|Coconut husk||6 degrees||Long||More than a day|\n|Wheat and ragi straw||4 degrees||Medium||4-5 hours|\n|Layers of straw and earthen pot||4-5 degrees||Long||7-8 hours|\n|Layers of coconut husk and earthen pot||6-7 degrees||Long||More than a day|\n|Layers of coconut husk and pieces of earthen pot||5 degrees||Long||More than a day|\n|Layers of coconut husk and gunny bag||6 degrees||Long||More than a day|\nThese trials were conducted at atmospheric temperature of 29-30 degrees Celsius. The experiments indicated that a layer of gunny bag attached to the inner cylinder and a thick layer of coconut husk are the most suitable fillers for food preservation. Reasons for choosing the filler materials of gunny bag and coconut husk:\n- Higher capacity to hold water of up to 2 days\n- Temperature difference of more than 5 degree Celsius\n- Materials have antimicrobial activity\n- Higher shelf life\n- Easily available for rural people\nDemerits observed during trials\nAs the cylinders are too long, there is difficulty in packing filler materials. If the temperature is high outside, we can bring about a maximum difference, but if the outside temperature is cool, very less temperature difference is seen. Water could stagnate inside the inner cylinder. Suggested solution was to reduce the length of the two cylinders by 8cms, so that the height and base width will be proportional and also help in easy packing of filler material. Perforations can be made at the base of the cylinders to allow water evaporation. However, such evaporative coolers tend to perform poorly or not at all in climates with high ambient humidity, since the water is not able to evaporate well under these conditions.\nThis preservator can be improvised by using other filler materials for checking other factors such as water retaining capacity, antimicrobial activity to prevent decaying of vegetables and fruits. Few bryophytes (mosses) can be used as a filler material to provide antimicrobial activity. Using recycled materials for skeleton of the preservator would bring down the cost too, as the target audience belongs to lower middle class.\nThus, this preservator has multiple positive impacts beyond the simple ability to keep food fresh for longer periods of time and reduce the instances of food-related diseases. Farmers will be able to sell their produce on demand and can command higher prices, women can sell food directly from their homes, rural employment opportunities can be created as people can start producing this preservator in bulk too.\nFact file –\nLead Image source – http://practicalaction.org/"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4bdcd352-0d8b-4886-9e69-417607cd662f>","<urn:uuid:0a41b26f-383c-4f9c-988f-d6f04dffc70d>"],"error":null}

They are often but not exclusively palpable as tiny nodules in and near muscle, in areas of muscle tightness (\"taut bands\"). They are also detectable with electrical devices ranging from electrodes placed on the skin, to needle electromyography. But they are difficult or impossible to detect in biopsy.\nTrigger points are often associated with muscular pain in adjacent, and sometimes remote, areas. Resolving the trigger point will often alleviate the associated pain. This is usually done either through direct pressure on the trigger point, or mechanically by contacting the trigger point with a fine needle, or through electrical stimulation or pharmacological means such as direct injection of local anesthetics. Thus the discovery and resolution of trigger points is often a goal of therapy for muscular-skeletal pain.\nThere are other kinds of \"points\" as well. For example, there are \"tender points\", \"acupressure points\" and \"acupuncture points\" from traditional Chinese medicine, and \"polarity points\". These are distinct from \"trigger points\".\nThe underlying physiology of trigger points is not necessarily fully understood. The best explanation may be that trigger points are caused by intrafusal contractions (localized muscle contractions) caused by a sympathetic nervous system. The physiological function that trigger points serve has not been positively determined.\nIn summary, trigger points are small (a few millimeters or less) nodules within a tight band of muscle that are tender to the touch and cause a characteristic pattern of pain, tingling, or numbness when subjected to sustained pressure. They have also been documented in skin, ligament, tendon, scar and breast tissue and periostenen. The trigger point is often associated with referred pain, usually locally (in the same muscle), but sometimes surprisingly remote. Inactivation of the trigger point reduces or resolves the associated pain.\nDiscovery and Resolution through Electrical Stimulation\nResolving the trigger point will often alleviate the associated pain. This may be done through myofascial electrical stimulation of the trigger point. An electrical wand or probe (an electrode) is moved over the skin in the suspect area for the trigger point. When the precise area for the trigger point is discovered, a ripple effect or a tingling sensation may be felt in the associated muscle which when continued for a while alleviates the associated pain and resolves the trigger point in a few, if not one, treatment(s) of several minutes each. The electrical stimulation relaxes muscle spasms and increases localized circulation to fix the source of the trigger point.\nThe wand, more or less in the shape of a pencil or flashlight, is formed at one end with a thin, flat, spatula-like or rectangular, flat blade extension, the outer edge of which is run over a patient's skin to discover the trigger point causing the pain. Sometimes an outer corner of the extension is utilized to locate more precisely the trigger point and apply even more localized electrical stimulation. Efforts to improve the electrical connection between the extension and the patient's skin have included coating the extension with a conductive gel.\nMachine for Source of Electrical Stimulation\nA machine for the source of electrical stimulation of trigger points, is manufactured by the Rich-Mar Corporation; Rt. 2, Box 879; Inola, Okla. 74036-0879; as Model HV 2000, a high voltage pulsed Current (HVPC) device. It provides a suitable pulsed high voltage at an appropriate frequency and micro-amperage to the probe or wand. The wand, more or less in the shape of a pencil or flashlight, is used by therapists to locate precisely and treat the trigger points . This works fine in the hands of a therapist, but a pencil- or flashlight shaped wand is ill suited for an individual to move across his back to locate precisely therein a trigger point and to thereafter hold the wand in place and continuously apply electrical stimulation to the trigger point.\nAccordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide an instrument which will enable an individual himself or herself to discover and to treat trigger points located on his back.\nA more particular object of the invention is to provide a specially-shaped instrument which can function as an electrical wand in association with a machine such as the Rich-Marr Model HV 2200 mentioned above, and enable an individual himself or herself to discover and to treat trigger points located on his back.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide such a specially-shaped electrical wand which is simple and easy to use.\nYet another object of the invention is to provide such a specially-shaped electrical wand which is inexpensive of construction and easy of manufacture.\nThe objects of the invention are achieved through the use of an arcuate wand or probe which is formed at one end with an electrically-conductive spade-like extension having a rounded point on its free end and bearing on its free end a sponge which may be soaked in water by the patient just before use. Preferrably the rounded point on the free end of the extension is formed at the juncture of two tapering straight edges. After wetting the sponge, the patient grasps the other end of the arcuate wand with one or both hands and positions its spade-like-extension free end over a suspected trigger point area on his or her back so that one of its tapering straight edges or rounded point touches the associated skin. He or she then slides the straight edge or rounded point of the spade-like extension back and forth over the skin of the suspected area until the trigger point is discovered, and then places the point there for several minutes. The wet sponge will enhance the electrical conductivity between the arcuate-wand spade-like extension and the skin overlying the trigger point area.\nAn advantage of the invention is that the patient can utilize the procedure whenever a tissue pain arises. No longer must he or she await the availability of a physical therapist to alleviate the pain.\nA feature of the invention is that the patient can apply the electrical stimulation as long as it seems beneficial. No longer is the patient's treatment dependent on the time slot available to him in the physical therapist's office.\nThese and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from a reading of the following description of a preferred embodiment of the invention when considered with the accompanying drawings wherein:\nFIG. 1 is a diagrammatic view in perspective of a system embodying the invention;\nFIG. 2 is an enlarged front view of the wand spade-like extension of FIG. 1;\nFIG. 3 is a another view of the spade-like extension of FIG. 2 but bearing a sponge; and\nFIG. 4 is a left-hand side view of the sponge-covered spade-like extension of FIG. 3.\nReferring now more particularly to FIG. 1 of the drawings, the wand or probe, generally indicated by the numeral 8, is shown as being in the shape of an arcuate handle or bow generally indicated by the numeral 10. The handle or bow 10 may be an arm's length or less in length. Its curve allows one to readily reach behind one's back to engage the skin thereon. It is preferrably made of a rigid electrically-conductive rod 11 (FIGS. 2-4) of a material such as stainless steel, and covered with a suitable insulating plastic 13. One end of the handle 10 may mount an electrically-insulating grip 12 for facilitating moving the wand 8.\nThe other end of the handle 10 mounts an electrically-conductive, flat and thin spade-like extension 14 of stainless steel or the like. The spade-like extension 14 is attached to the stainless steel rod 11 of the handle 10 as by welding. The spade 14 is formed at its free end with tapering straight edges 15 which meet in a rounded point 16.\nThe spade 14, via the stainless steel rod 11, is electrically connected to a suitable source 17 of pulsed voltage, e.g. the Rich-Mar Model HV 2000 mentioned above, through a suitably insulated electrical cable 18. A cable 19 extending from the source 17, and having a spring clamp at the free end of it, completes the circuit for the electric current to follow.\nAttached to the spade-like extension 14 is a sponge 20. The sponge 20 is generally shaped like the spade-like extension 14. It is formed with an internal pocket 21 (FIGS. 3 and 4)) so as to be received on the free end of the spade-like extension 14. It may be secured thereon by a snap consisting of male device 22 (FIG. 2) formed on the surface of the extension 14 and a coacting female device 24 (FIGS. 3 and 4) mounted on the sponge 20. A moist sponge 20 enhances the electrical connection of the spade-like extension 14 with the patient's skin in the area of the trigger point.\nThe grip 12 may mount internally a rheostat 26 in circuit with the cable 18, which rheostat may be adjusted by rotating an external knob 28 on the grip 12 to regulate further the current applied by the spade-like extension 14.\nThe grip 12 may also mount internally in circuit with the cable 18, an on/off switch 30 controlled by an external push button 32, to cut off the power applied to the spade-like extension 14 independently of a control switch (not shown) on the electrical source 17.\nIn use, the patient would grasp the wand handle 10 as by its grip 12, and connect the electrical cord 18 to the source 17 of pulsed voltage if not already so connected. Next he or she would dip the sponge 20 into some water to moisten it. Then, after moving the grip on/off switch button 32, the patient would move a straight edge 15 or rounded point 16 or the spade 14 to the pain-affected area of his or her back to endeavor to locate the trigger point. Then he or she would place the rounded point 16 over the the trigger point, and experience a ripple effect or tingling sensation in the associated muscle or other affected tissue. The electrical stimulation shortly alleviates the associated pain and resolves the trigger point in a few, if not one, treatment(s) of several minutes each.\nThe insulated nature of the handle 10 prevents the application of unwanted electrical stimulation elsewhere.\nWhile there has been described a preferred embodiment of the invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that other embodiments utilizing the principles of the invention may be readily created. It is therefore intended to be limited only by the spirit or scope of the appended claims."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ec9ed957-0a20-4295-91dd-82a0f1010fb8>","<urn:uuid:0a1ca816-3af6-4391-9ad3-991c7efa0120>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do African musical elements manifest differently in zouk versus traditional salsa rhythms?","answer":"Both zouk and salsa show African influences, but they manifest differently. Zouk appears in a mix of African-influenced styles, often performed alongside Afrobeat and other Caribbean genres, as evidenced by performances featuring 'Afro-housers' and various fusion styles. Salsa's African influence is more specifically documented through its use of the clave rhythm, which evolved from West African bell patterns brought by 700,000 African slaves to Cuba in the 1770s. The clave rhythm serves as a fundamental organizing principle in salsa, functioning similarly to the continuous bell patterns found in West African musical traditions.","context":["One of the mysteries of the English language finally explained.\nAn exuberant style of popular music combining Caribbean and Western elements and having a fast heavy beat.\n- ‘Workey Workey, Burning Flames: The Flames, Arrow's former backup band, blended soca with a touch of zouk to create Antigua's 1989 Road March.’\n- ‘Two other musical styles - zouk and cadance - are heard on French-influenced islands like St. Lucia.’\n- ‘Combette's music is hard to describe concisely, but there's Haitian compas, zouk, folk, jazz, bossa nova, soca and reggae in the mix.’\n- ‘To keep the cultural spirits flying high, music adds to the Creole flavour - folk music, cadence, zouk and Kassav.’\n- ‘Its African hosts offer tips on gigs, clips of their favourite CDs, news from the studio and gossip from the dance floor, covering styles from Afrobeat to zouk and from laid-back mbira to full-on hip-hop.’\n- ‘The Caribbean has given the world a remarkable potpourri of popular music - everything from calypso to salsa, from ska to zouk, from meringue to soca.’\n- ‘Compas, reggae, zouk and American pop all colour their clever, energetic tunes at one point or another - no surprise that they'll be backing up a wide variety of talent at the Gala du Monde this Friday.’\n- ‘Over three days and nights, popular Creole musical forms such as cadence-lypso, compass, zouk, soukous, and bouyon ring out alongside Creole-influenced reggae and soca.’\n- ‘Actually, Ménard throws the lineup by being Antillean, so expect a blend of zouk, soca, compas and merengue from him and Jab Jab, backing him up for the night.’\n- ‘Haitian sensation Black Parents will also be performing, bringing some zouk and kompas with the holiday vibes.’\n- ‘At 7: 50 p.m., Koffi Koffiento shakes you awake with a fine blend of rumba, zouk and salsa, Congolese style..’\n- ‘For openers, there was the French ensemble Les Alizes, playing zouk on steel.’\n- ‘Hints of zouk, samba and electroclash rear their groovy heads through a parade of infectious Afro-housers.’\n- ‘Funk, soul, hip hop, brokenbeat, jazz, dancehall, roots, old-school, deep house, zouk and konpa can be found here every week, so check it out.’\n- ‘Hundreds of visitors and locals sip on Carib and Piton, munch on all the various fish and chicken sold, and between mixes enjoy salsa, reggae, calypso, cadence, zouk, and hip-hop.’\n- ‘Growing up, he listened to the up-tempo sounds of calypso, soca, and zouk, before moving to St Maarten and discovering reggae.’\n- ‘In other recorded examples the music most closely approaches early predecessors of reggae and zouk.’\n- ‘They've been gigging downtown with their mix of funk, zouk and reggae for a while, so don't miss them on the big stage.’\n- ‘A delightful fusion of zouk, reggae, Afro-Beat and salsa, the multi-cultural personnel of the Bristol-based six-piece band, provide the ingredients to a very agreeable recipe.’\n- ‘Many have concluded that the work that community radio stations like CHRY, CKLN and CRIT do in showcasing soca, calypso and reggae, zouk and other musical expressions are contributing factors to this new awareness in the Canadian media.’\n1970s: Guadeloupian Creole, literally ‘to party’.\nTop tips for CV writingRead more\nIn this article we explore how to impress employers with a spot-on CV.","by Dr. Christopher Washburne\nIn many musical discussions, styles of music found in the Americas and the Caribbean are often referred to as African-derived. Salsa is no exception and the following discussion explores what is particularly African about the music: clave, a rhythmic concept found in a variety of Latin-American styles. Similarities in sound and function to African bell patterns provide evidence towards a theory of clave’s origins and an evolutionary link between African music and salsa.\nSYOTOS band at the Nuyorican Poets’ Cafe, with bandleader Dr. Chris Washburne on trombone and Bobby Sanabria on drums.Salsa is a Latin musical style that incorporates a variety of influences. Originating in Cuba and Puerto Rico and emerging from the musical climate of New York City in the 1950s, it has found popularity throughout the Americas and the other Caribbean islands, as well as in Europe and Japan. Salsa has its roots in Cuban popular and folkloric music and is enhanced by jazz textures. The name salsa, literally meaning “sauce,” has been in use since the late 1960s, popularized by New York’s Fania Records as a “catchy” marketing label. Salsa is often thought of as Latin essence, as the word “soul” has been a description for black American essence (Baron 1977 : 217).\nIn Spanish, clave literally means key, clef, code, or keystone. Fernando Ortiz believes that it is derived from “clavija,” meaning wooden peg, reflecting the appearance of the instrument which plays the clave rhythm, called claves (Ortiz, 1935: 9). Claves are two wooden sticks hit together to produce a high piercing sound. If no clave player is present in a salsa band, timbale players will often attach a hollowed-out, hard plastic, open-ended box to their cowbell stand and strike it with their sticks to produce a clave sound.\nIn Latin music terminology, the word clave refers not only to these instruments but also to the specific rhythmic patterns they play and the underlying rules which govern these patterns. Concerning these rules, Steve Cornelius chooses the analogy of a “keystone, the wedge shaped stone placed at the top of an arch which locks all the other stones in place” to describe the function of the clave in relation to all of the other parts in the music (Cornelius, 1991: 15). All musical and dance components in salsa performance are governed by the clave rhythm. In some way they must correspond at all times to the clave rhythmic pattern.\nThe clave pattern is two measures in length “in which each measure is diametrically opposed. The two measures are not at odds, but rather, they are balanced opposites, like positive and negative, expansive and contractive, or the poles of a magnet. As the full pattern is repeated, an alteration from one polarity to the other takes place creating pulse and rhythmic drive. Were the pattern to suddenly be reversed, the momentum within the rhythm would be destroyed…” (Cornelius, 1991: 15-6). The clave found in salsa, also known as son clave is notated in example 4. How a song begins determines which measure of the clave will be played first. The phrasing of the melody is the determining factor (e.g. where the accented rhythms of melody occur). This is referred to as either 3-2 or 2-3, meaning either the measure with the three strokes is played first with the two stroke measure following, or the two stroke is played first followed by the three stroke measure. According to tradition once a song begins the clave does not change its measure order. For instance there could never be a 3-2-2-3 clave sequence. Once the song has begun it functions similarly to the continuous bell patterns found in West African musical traditions by providing a rhythmic formula which serves as the foundation. As Roberta Singer states “Clave is a rhythmic time line that… functions as a rhythmic organizing principle for the entire ensemble” (Singer, 1982: 168). The rhythm may be overtly played, or implied. Competent musicians in salsa must develop a “clave sense” similar to what Richard Waterman labels a “metronome sense” where a subjective pulse is felt by the participants which may not be overtly heard and which functions as an ordering principle (Waterman 1952).\nThe clave concept reaches far beyond the musical context as demonstrated by the following excerpt from the inscription found on the inside cover of the first issue of New York’s Clave magazine, published throughout the 1970s:\nClave. …To us the word goes beyond explanations and definitions. It means life, salsa, the food of our leisure time, the motion of intense rhythm, the emotion of 20,000 people simultaneously grooving to the natural sounds of life. It’s being in beat, on key, on clave… It means to be on top of things, to be playing it right… “Clave is history, it’s culture. African drums from far off places like Nigeria, Dahomey, and Ghana married the Spanish guitar to bring us clave. The seeds were planted in the Caribbean and now their grandchild is Salsa…\nThis declaration effectively illustrates the broad range of the clave concept and some of its descriptive uses. More importantly it reaffirms the African roots of the rhythm.\nThe following evolutionary theory concerning the clave rhythm’s origins, which may explain why Africa and its hereditary nature are mentioned in the Clave publication, is based on three assumptions. First, when the 700,000 African slaves arrived in Cuba during the 1770s they did not forget the bell patterns from the traditional music of their past but rather incorporated them into music making in their new surroundings. Secondly, this particular pan-West African bell pattern (example 1) or something similar existed during the 1700s. This assumption is based on the pattern’s prevalence today among many different African peoples covering an expansive area. Thirdly, as new practices emerged from the combining of various African peoples in the New World, new performance styles arose. As the above inscription suggests, the performance of clave is a living and breathing tradition shaped by the performance practice of individuals. Each musician contributes to the proliferation and evolution of the tradition by their own subtle variations of feel and nuance. Over time, a subtle peculiarity or feel may become the standard replacing an older practice.\nRumba is a style of music originating from African slaves and their descendants living in Cuba. Some of oldest recorded Cuban rumba styles, such as rumba Columbia originating from the small towns of the island’s interior, are performed with a 12/8 feel, similar to musics where the bell pattern in example 1 is performed. However, in rumba Columbia the bell pattern or clave is slightly different from the one notated in this example. Instead of consisting of seven strokes, two of the them are omitted while the others remain intact (example 2). In some Haitian musical styles the same two strokes are omitted but the pattern is started on the third stroke instead. The reason for this omission may never be known since it occurred before recording technology was available. It may have started with an individual variation, or, was the result of the fusing of two or more African styles.\nAnother later style of rumba emerged from urban areas in a quasi-4/4 feel instead of 12/8 , called Guaguancó. The duple meter feel may have been the result of the influence of marching bands and other Spanish styles often heard in the larger cities throughout the 1700s. The clave used in Guaguancó appears to be an adaptation of the clave rhythm found in rumba Columbia to fit the new metric feel (example 3). This is most often referred to as rumba clave.\nThe next step of the evolution came from a simplification of styles. The son clave, used in salsa, displaces the final stroke of the 3 part of the rumba clave by one eighth note (example 4). This, consequently, as with all of the other adaptations, changed the musical parts. The name “son clave” was coined because of its use in son , a Spanish-influenced musical style originating in the rural areas of Cuba in the early 1900s. The rhythm of son tends to be much less complex, less syncopated and polyrhythmic, than the rumba styles requiring the modification of the clave rhythm.\nAnother factor that led to this simplification was the growing popularity of Latin music in countries other than Cuba. The foreign dancers were not always able to assimilate the complex rumba dance styles, therefore changes were made to accommodate the new audience.\nThe rumba tradition has continually been a stylistic influence on salsa music and performance, but the predominance of this new expanding market required change. The result was the preference of the son clave over the rumba clave to facilitate learning of the new dance styles. This theory can be tested with any newcomer to Latin music. The son clave will be inevitably easier to clap than the rumba clave. The son clave grew to prominence during the mambo dance craze of the 1950s in the United States and Puerto Rico and has remained in use in salsa performance today. Occasionally, salsa arrangements will have short rumba sections, or interludes, but will invariably resume the son clave for the body of the arrangement.\nCurrent drumming styles in Ghana also suggest that a similar process of rhythmic adaptation has occurred. Patterns resembling rumba and son clave in both rhythmic construction and function are occasionally found. For instance, in David Locke’s book Drum Gahu there is a description of a “gankogui” pattern (example 5) that “establishes the overall rhythm of Gahu” and when playing this music one should “always try to establish your feeling for timing and groove by concentrating on this sounded phrase” (Locke, 1987: 16-19). This is precisely how salsa musicians use the clave rhythm. Notice that the gankogui has five strokes and only differs by one stroke from the son clave. How long this style of music has been performed in Ghana is not clear. This pattern may have been in existence during the slave trade era.\nThe search for Africanisms in the music of the Americas has been one approach scholars have taken throughout the last fifty years to understand the roots of black music. It is a quest that is wrought with difficulties because of the degree of generalization and speculation required due to the lack of objective documentation in written or recorded form. The processes of acculturation provide a complex of issues that are too vast to address in this short discussion. However, the similarities of the clave rhythm and its function to African bell patterns is worthy of note and may demonstrate the origins of the clave concept found in salsa today. Throughout this constantly evolving and changing process there appears to be a process of simplification occurring, if omitting strokes from the pan-African bell pattern can be equated with simplifying, as less rhythmically complex styles are fused and merge with the African roots. This is not to say that new types of complexities are not formed with the newer styles but simply that music change is constantly in motion. This one evolutionary possibility is presented above in hopes to stimulate future inquiries.\nDr. Christopher Washburne\nProfessor, Columbia University\nCopyright 1999-2002 © C.Washburne"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3934821a-8a77-43b5-a694-38e1f7ac0464>","<urn:uuid:14f6b0fc-7e30-4cf4-8627-356842520c90>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the earliest signs of agriculture in ancient Egypt, and how did music influence its early civilization?","answer":"The earliest agricultural settlement in Egypt was discovered in the Faiyum depression, dating back to around 5200 B.C. The site revealed evidence of domesticated animals (sheep, goats, and pigs) and crops (six-rowed barley and emmer wheat) imported from the Middle East. As for music, it played a significant role in ancient Egyptian civilization since antiquity. During the pharaonic period (around 3100 BCE), music became increasingly important and was present in many aspects of daily life, including religious ceremonies, workshops, palaces, farms, battlefields, and tombs. Ancient Egyptians credited the goddess Bat with the invention of music, and during prehistoric times, music and chanting were commonly used in magic and rituals.","context":["for National Geographic Magazine\nArchaeologists have uncovered the earliest known agricultural settlement from ancient Egypt, a new study says. (See photos of the site and artifacts.)\nThe 7,000-year-old farming-village site includes evidence of domesticated animals and crops—providing a major breakthrough in understanding the enigmatic people of the Neolithic, or late Stone Age, period and their lives long before the appearance of the Egyptian pharaohs.\nThe discoveries were made as a team of Dutch and U.S. archaeologists dug deeper into a previously excavated mound of sand concealing the ancient village in the Faiyum depression, a fertile oasis region about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Cairo.\nJust centimeters beneath the modern plowed surface, in an area that had been used until recently to grow grapes, the researchers discovered evidence of structures, such as clay floors, and hearths containing homegrown wheat grain and barley.\nAlso unearthed were the remains of sheep, goats, and pigs—which, along with the grains, were imported from the Middle East.\nThese finds could add a new chapter to the history of Egypt’s contact with foreign cultures in pre-pharaonic times.\nEvidence of agriculture in Egypt’s Faiyum depression had been discovered at the same site by British archaeologist Gertrude Caton Thompson in the 1920s.\nThompson found a series of Neolithic-era granaries and farming tools—including a wooden sickle with its serrated flint blade still attached—on a nearby ridge.\nRadiocarbon dating places the occupation of the site to around 5200 B.C. But details about the lifestyle of the farmers who used those granaries and tools remained a mystery until now.\nThe Faiyum “is important because it provides the first evidence of farming that we have in Egypt,” said the excavation’s co-director Willeke Wendrich, an associate professor of Egyptian archaeology at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n“For the first time, we have domesticated wheat and barley in a domestic context.”\nArchaeologists revisited the site in recent years because it was threatened by modern agricultural expansion.\nThe volume of undiscovered antiquities artifacts and new revelations came as a surprise.\nThe latest phase of work was funded by a grant from the National Geographic Society’sCommittee for Research and Exploration. (The National Geographic Society owns both National Geographic News and National Geographic magazine.)\n“A Pretty Good Life”\nMagnetic surveys followed by extensive excavations revealed approximately one meter’s (one yard’s) depth of undisturbed habitation layers—meaning different generations of the settlement are buried on top of one another.\nWithin those layers are numerous hearths containing carbonized grain, postholes and clay floors for structures, and the remains of domesticated animals.\nBecause the site is stratified, experts say, the find offers a rare opportunity to track changes in the settlement over time.\n“Rather than seeing the Neolithic as one period [about 8500 B.C. to 4000 B.C.], we can begin to understand its time depth and discern different periods and developments,” Wendrich said.\nThe discovered grains are mostly six-rowed barley and emmer wheat.\nThey match the cereals that Caton Thompson found in the storage pits and are the first evidence of how those crops were incorporated into the lives of Neolithic farmers.\n“Now we have information from the [animal] bones and from the seeds, and you can produce a kind of [Neolithic era] diet, which was not possible before,” said René Cappers, a professor of paleobotany at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and co-director of the project with Wendrich.\nThe ancient structural foundations are the first discovered in Faiyum and also fill in a major piece of the Neolithic puzzle, according to Melinda Zeder, director of the Archaeobiology Program at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.\n“It was a big mystery where these people were actually living,” said Zeder, a member of National Geographic’s Committee for Research and Exploration.\n“We knew they were doing a bunch of stuff there and storing grain, but households we just didn’t have.”\nFurther excavations could help experts determine whether the farmers lived at the site permanently, as in other ancient farming cultures, or only during the growing season.\nSo far, the newly discovered postholes have not fallen into a pattern, and the number of people who lived in the settlement remains undetermined.\nSkeletal remains of sheep and goats were also strewn about the site, but the discovery of pig bones has intrigued the experts the most.\nPigs “are not an animal that is all that conducive to nomadic movement, so having a quantity of pigs may also speak to whether these people are moving in and out in the Faiyum or whether they are there year-round,” Zeder said.\nThe excavators also uncovered beads made of ostrich shell, a bangle cut from a Red Sea shell, a finger ring, and a slew of pendants—all of which suggest personal adornment figured prominently in this Neolithic culture.\nLarge quantities of pottery, flint, grinding stones, and other tools were also discovered, along with an unfired clay vessel—the first known to have survived from the era.\nThe wealth of new evidence will finally bring into focus how Neolithic society fit into the larger mosaic of Egyptian history, according to Bruce Smith, an archaeobiologist and also a member of National Geographic’s Committee for Research and Exploration.\n“It’s a missing link filling in a very important and poorly known phase of the development of agricultural systems, which led to the pyramids and later civilizations,” Smith said.\nStudy co-author Wendrich agreed, adding that the discovery could alter the prevailing notion that the Neolithic period was primitive and disconnected from later and more sophisticated stages of ancient Egypt.\n“The most important thing is that we don’t look at this very early period of Egyptian history as something foreign to what happens later in the pharaonic period,” she said.\n“It’s clear that this was not a bare existence that people had here. They made a pretty good life for themselves.”\nThe discovery also adds to the narrative of Egypt’s early contact with neighboring cultures.\nThe crops and animals—and techniques for raising them—were all introduced to Egypt from the ancient Middle East, where domestication of plants and animals is known to have existed as far back as 9000 B.C. It came together as a “package” around 7000 B.C., according to Zeder, an expert in Middle East domestication.\n“An increasing area of study is looking at how this package diffused out of its homeland into other areas,” Zeder said. We now have “really good prima facie evidence of some of the earliest movement of that technology into Egypt.”\nIt’s not clear whether the crops and animals were brought to Egypt by ancient mariners on the Mediterranean Sea or overland through the rugged Sinai desert or both. The presence of Red Sea shells at the site could indicate that the trading routes cut through the Sinai Peninsula.\nAs the new evidence is studied further, it could help experts iron out those details and also map the initial spread of farming across the African continent.\nFaiyum “really is the beachhead front now in the movement of agriculture and the increase in trade into Africa,” said Zeder, who added that the movement of agriculture may be the first example of globalization.\n“It certainly is a major seismic shift in how cultures operated.”","Music has been an integral part of Egyptian culture since antiquity. The Bible documents the instruments played by the ancient Hebrews, all of which are correlated in Egyptian archaeology. Egyptian music probably had a significant impact on the development of ancient Greek music, and via the Greeks was important to early European music well into the Middle Ages. The modern music of Egypt is considered Arabic music as it has been a source for or influence on other regional styles. The tonal structure of Arabic music is defined by the maqamat, loosely similar to Western modes, while the rhythm of Arabic music is governed by the iqa'at, standard rhythmic modes formed by combinations of accented and unaccented beats and rests.e your paragraph here.\nMusic was as important to the ancient Egyptians as it is in our modern society. Although it is thought\nthat music played a role throughout the history of Egypt, those that study the Egyptian writings have\ndiscovered that music seemed to become more important in what is called the ‘pharaonic’ period of\ntheir history. This was the time when the Egyptian dynasties of the pharaohs were\nestablished (around 3100 BCE) and music was found in many parts of every day Egyptian life.\nAncient Egyptians had a number of professional musicians that performed for many occasions.\nSince their society was set up with social levels, this meant that different musicians could play only\nfor specific events. A musician with a high status could play for religious ceremonies at the temples,\nwhere a lower class musician might only be able to play for regular community members.\nThe highest honor to achieve was the status of ‘shemayet’, which gave these musicians the\nability to play for a particular god or goddess and these musicians were mostly women.\nThe ancient Egyptians were very organized and this included how they organized and arranged music\nand musicians. They brought music to their religious ceremonies, but it was also played and\nperformed in workshops, palaces, the farms, on the battlefield and even in their tombs.\nThe Egyptian gods Hathor and Bes were their gods of music and they had many ceremonies\ndevoted to them that involved song and dance to accompany the playing of musical instruments\nThe ancient Egyptians credited the goddess Bat with the invention of music. The cult of Bat was eventually syncretised into that of Hathor because both were depicted as cows. Hathor's music was believed to have been used by Osiris as part of his effort to civilize the world. The lion-goddess Bastet was also considered a goddess of music.\nIn prehistoric Egypt, music and chanting were commonly used in magic and rituals. Rhythms during this time were ovular and music served to create rhythm. Small shells were used as whistles.(pp26–30)\nDuring the predynastic period of Egyptian history, funerary chants continued to play an important role in Egyptian religion and were accompanied by clappers or a flute. Despite the lack of physical evidence in some cases, Egyptologists theorize that the development of certain instruments known of the Old Kingdom period, such as the end-blown flute, took place during this time.(pp33–34)\nThe evidence is for instruments played more securely attested in the Old Kingdom when harps, flutes and double clarinets were played. Percussion instruments and lutes were added to orchestras by the Middle Kingdom. Cymbals frequently accompanied music and dance, much as they still do in Egypt today.\nTypically ancient Egyptian music was composed from the phrygian dominant scale, phrygian scale, double harmonic scale (Arabic scale) or lydian scale. The phrygian dominant scale may often feature an altered note or two in parts to create tension. For instance the music could typically be in the key of E phrygian dominant using the notes E, F, G sharp, A, B, C, D and then have an A sharp, B, A sharp, G natural and E to create tension.\nArabic music is usually said to have begun in the 7th century in Syria during the Umayyad dynasty. Early Arabic music was influenced by Byzantine, Indian and Persian forms, which were themselves heavily influenced by earlier Greek, Semitic, and ancient Egyptian music.\nEgyptians in Medieval Cairo believed that music exercised \"too powerful an effect upon the passions, and leading men into gaiety, dissipation and vice.\" However, Egyptians generally were very fond of music. Though, according to E.W. Lane, no \"man of sense\" would ever become a musician, music was a key part of society. Tradesmen of every occupation used music during work and schools taught the Quran by chanting.(p359)\nThe music of Medieval Egypt was derived from Greek, Persian and Indian traditions. Lane said that \"the most remarkable peculiarity of the Arab system of music is the division of tones into thirds,\" although today Western musicologists prefer to say that Arabic music's tones are divided into quarters. The songs of this period were similar in sound and simple, within a small range of tones. Egyptian song, though simple in form, is embellished by the singer. Distinct enunciation and a quavering voice are also characteristics of Egyptian singing.(pp360–361)\nMale professional musicians during this period were called Alateeyeh (plural), or Alatee (singular), which means \"a player upon an instrument\". However, this name applies to both vocalists as well as instrumentalists. This position was considered disreputable and lowly. However, musicians found work singing or playing at parties to entertain the company. They generally made three shillings a night, but earned more by the guests giving more.\nFemale professional musicians were called Awalim (pl) or Al’meh, which means a learned female. These singers were often hired on the occasion of a celebration in the harem of a wealthy person. They were not with the harem, but in an elevated room that was concealed by a screen so as not to be seen by either the harem or the master of the house. The female Awalim were more highly paid than male performers and more highly regarded than the Alateeyeh as well. Lane relates an instance of a female performer who so enraptured her audience that she earned to fifty guineas for one night's performance from the guests and host, who were not considered wealthy.\nModern Egyptian classical and pop music\nEgyptian music began to be recorded in the 1910s, when Egypt was still part of the Ottoman Empire. The cosmopolitan Ottomans encouraged the development of the arts, encouraging women and minorities to develop their musical abilities. By the fall of the Empire, Egypt's classical musical tradition was already thriving, centered on the city of Cairo. In general, modern Egyptian music blends its indigenous traditions with Turkish, Arabic, and Western elements.\nSince the end of World War I, some of the Middle East's biggest musical stars have been Egyptian. Contemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of luminaries such as Abdu-l Hamuli, Almaz and Mahmud Osman, who were all patronized by the Ottoman Khedive Ismail, and who influenced the later work of the 20th century's most important Egyptian composers: Sayed Darwish, Umm Kulthum, Mohammed Abdel Wahab, Abdel Halim Hafez, and Zakariyya Ahmad. Most of these stars, including Umm Kulthum and Najat Al Saghira, were part of the classical\nReligious music in Egypt\nReligious music remains an essential part of traditional Muslim and Coptic celebrations called mulids. Mulids are held in Egypt to celebrate the saint of a particular church. Muslimmulids are related to the Sufi zikr ritual. The Egyptian flute, called the ney, is commonly played at mulids. The liturgical music of the Alexandrian Rite also constitutes an important element of Egyptian music and is said to have preserved many features of ancient Egyptian music.\nLute and double pipe players from a painting found in the Theban tomb of Nebamun, a nobleman of the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom, c. 1350 BC\nEgyptian folk music, including the traditional Sufi dhikr rituals, are the closest contemporary music genre to ancient Egyptian music, having preserved many of its features, rhythms and instruments.\nFolk and roots revival\nThe Egyptians even used their own teeth as instruments they would make tapping noises and would use special plucks to make interesting noises with their teeth. The 20th century has seen Cairo become associated with a roots revival. Musicians from across Egypt are keeping folk traditions alive, such as those of rural Egyptians (fellahin), the Nubians, the Arabs, the Berbers, the Gypsiesand the Bedouins. Mixtures of folk and pop have also risen from the Cairo hit factory.\nSince the Nasser era, Egyptian pop music has become increasingly important in Egyptian culture, particularly among the large youth population of Egypt. Egyptian folk music continues to be played during weddings and other traditional festivities. In the last quarter of the 20th century, Egyptian music was a way to communicate social and class issues. Among some of the most popular Egyptian pop singers today are Mohamed Mounir and Amr Diab.\nSawahli (coastal) music is a type of popular music from the northern coast, and is based around the simsimiyya, an indigenous stringed instrument. Well-known singers include Abdo'l Iskandrani and Aid el-Gannirni.\nSaidi (Upper Egyptian)\nEgyptian musicians from Upper Egypt play a form of folk music called Ṣa‘īdi (Upper Egyptian). Metqal Qenawi's Les Musiciens du Nil are the most popular saidi group, and were chosen by the government to represent Egyptian folk music abroad. Other performers include Shoukoukou, Ahmad Ismail, Omar Gharzawi, Sohar Magdy and Ahmed Mougahid.\nNubians are native to the south of Egypt and northern Sudan, though many live in Cairo and other cities. Nubian folk music can still be heard, but migration and intercultural contact with Egyptian and other musical genres have produced new innovations. Ali Hassan Kuban's efforts had made him a regular on the world music scene, while Mohamed Mounir's social criticism and sophisticated pop have made him a star among Nubians, Egyptians, and other people worldwide. Ahmed Mounib, Mohamed Mounir's mentor, was by far the most notable Nubian singer to hit the Egyptian music scene, singing in both Egyptian Arabic his native Nobiin. Hamza El Din is another popular Nubian artist, well-known on the world music scene and has collaborated with the Kronos Quartet.\nWestern classical music\nWestern classical music was introduced to Egypt, and, in the middle of the 18th century, instruments such as the piano and violin were gradually adopted by Egyptians. Opera also became increasingly popular during the 18th century, and Giuseppe Verdi's Egyptian-themed Aida was premiered in Cairo on December 24, 1871.\nBy the early 20th century, the first generation of Egyptian composers, including Yusef Greiss, Abu Bakr Khairat, and Hasan Rashid, began writing for Western instruments. The second generation of Egyptian composers included notable artists such as Gamal Abdelrahim. Representative composers of the third generation are Ahmed El-Saedi and Rageh Daoud. In the early 21st century, even fourth generation composers such as Mohamed Abdelwahab Abdelfattah (of the Cairo Conservatory) have gained international attention.\nAncient Egyptians Music"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:27af813e-8069-4430-a48e-18675e048c8b>","<urn:uuid:865ceb5b-33d9-4021-ae3d-e88a53e20ffb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does digital technology enable creative expression, and what cybersecurity risks do digital artists face?","answer":"Digital technology enables creative expression through techniques like spontaneous rearrangement of digital and physical elements, as seen in projects that combine algorithms with physical media like printed animation cards and tape recordings. However, digital artists face cybersecurity risks including potential copyright infringement lawsuits, trademark disputes, and reputational damage from cyber attacks. For example, a bookseller was sued for $60,000 for copyright infringement after posting book passages on their website, while businesses using digital assets need protection against both cyber vandalism and potential lawsuits over intellectual property.","context":["In our series Input/Output, we pull up a stool in the studios of producers from the Ableton Community, inviting them to shed light on the inspirations, techniques and technologies that feed into their production process, and the latest music to come out of it.\nSculpture is the London-based duo of animator/visual artist Reuben Sutherland and musician/producer Dan Hayhurst. Embracing digital and analog media, tactile and virtual approaches in equal measure, Sculpture’s immersively psychedelic audio-visual output over the past six years has lost none of the joyful ‘let’s-just-see-what-happens’ spirit with which the project began. Check out the video below to get a sense of Sculpture’s truly unique modus operandi, then read our interview with Dan Hayhurst on the occasion of the release of Membrane Pop, via Oneohtrix Point Never's Brooklyn-based Software label.\nScultpure play a live show at Frankfurt’s saasfee* pavillion\nYou call Sculpture an “opto-musical agglomerate”, please explain.\nWe could refer to it as an AV project but I feel the world needs more romance. It's a multi-sensory investigation into perceptual/emotional stimulation – the visible and the audible are of equal importance and each informs the other. 'Agglomerate' makes me think of an entity – something with a life that's more than the sum of it's parts. It could be manufactured, like a polymer or robot, it could be organic. Also, maybe it's a temporary state/arrangement, like it might disperse again or reconfigure.\nHow did the two of you happen to come together?\nWe were neighbours in a big warehouse in London – the kind that is just barely converted into habitable space; paper thin walls, freezing in winter, a greenhouse in summer. Reuben was working with this animation technique using discs like a phenakistoscope and a video camera, and I was contributing to the warped local conditions with this kind of odd music that I like to make... it might have been influencing his brain patterns early on in some way, leaking through the wall. Mind you, he was pretty far into the wormhole already. We knew each other for maybe a year before we started to work together. There was obvious common ground and we thought we'd test the potential of a collaboration by staging a performance. We didn't work together in advance, we just performed simultaneously without knowing exactly what the other would do. So the material itself is sort of leading the way in terms of connections being formed, juxtapositions and frames of association and reference – the interaction of different sensory elements.\nOne of Sculpture’s zoetropic picture disc vinyls as designed by Reuben\nWhat are the commonalities of your approaches to the media you each work in?\nThere's a conversation between digital and physical; algorithms/processes manifesting themselves in the physical world in some way. We use techniques of spontaneous rearrangement, in Reuben's case he literally has a 'library' of hundreds of animations on printed cards – more than he can reasonably keep under control, and it's growing all the time like a nervous system. They're being generated in Photoshop and After Effects and transferred to this tactile medium. I'm combining physical cut-ups with analogue tape and hardware instrumentation (samplers / CDJ deck) with digital techniques for disintegrating and reconfiguring audio, for which I'm using Live pretty much entirely.\nThe 'conversation between digital and physical' that you mention – how does that become part of the production process? For instance, in the making of the new album?\nI tend to work on elements of things that can be recombined in different permutations, rather than discrete 'tracks'. So, building up a library of rhythms, sounds, harmonic elements, tones, percussion etc. Things from completely different times like 'found material' recorded in 1955 but also stuff I make myself. There are things from five years ago, last week, this afternoon – stuff I've completely forgotten ever making. This 'library' is then also expanded out across various reels of tape, tape loops and samplers in the physical world. It's pretty chaotic to be honest! These sources tend to get recorded into Live at some point, and then also I'm recording Live's output back to various tape recorders (often making tape loops) and samplers like a Korg ES1 or Teenage Engineering OP1.\nI'll do stuff like record an old bit of tape with some random recording from the the ‘60s on it into Live, convert that to MIDI data and use that to fire off samples in Drum Racks. These could be 'hits', but are just as likely to be longer recording like a few meters of tape. Each chain of devices would typically be Pitch > Arpeggiator > Random > Scale > Simpler. And I'll use macros to control stuff like chance of pitch randomisation, sample start point, arp rate, sample length etc. I use an APC 40 as a control surface. I'll use clip automation on the macros too. You can very quickly atomise and rearrange all kinds of material this way.\nWhat I end up with is a collection of re-combinable elements spread across different media; Live Clips/Sessions/Arrangements, tape loops, reels of tape, cassettes, CDRs, hardware samplers. Through continually trying out different permutations both in the studio and live, routines eventually coalesce into 'finished tracks'. At that point I'm recording things back into Live and using it to edit and arrange.\nSometimes it’s layering things semi-randomly. So, for instance with the new LP, the thing that 'finished' it off was dropping a recording of a gig into the final arrangement at random and several things along the timeline just clicking with each other in just the right way. I'm really into the idea of unplanned simultaneity creating new connections/associations…\nA video for Sculpture’s ‘Plastic Infinite’ release, featuring the animated picture disc on which it\nWhat's your setup for playing live? Is there much direct interaction between you and Reuben? Or is it more a case of going down parallel roads to the same destination?\nWe both have a setup with enough flexibility to be able to respond to what the other is doing in the same way that two musicians would. Similarly with the way some of the music has already become 'fixed' in a repeatable routine, whereas some of it is still in an exploratory stage (and some of it is improv). Reuben has his unruly library of animation cards which he plays on a record player with a video camera suspended above it. It's visual turntablism.\nHe has some animations up his sleeve that he knows he wants to use when he hears certain sounds – but much of the time it's more about unplanned simultaneity. Your brain finds connections and associations in the perceptual information its receiving. And, we're generating a lot of information very quickly.... it's a high energy event. That said, we've been working together for 6 years so we know what kind of thing is going to work... it's not like it's completely random.\nI don't use a computer live. I always transfer computer generated material to other media. The reason is that I find a computer/screen occupies too much attention in this context. So I have a collection of devices that act like a modular instrument. I can play it pretty well but not perfectly, so there are plenty of surprises and unplanned diversions. Reel to reel tape recorder (for tape loops), CDJ deck, a couple of hardware samplers (Korg ES1/ Teenage Engineering OP1), walkman, and effects (ring mod, echo, distortion).\nPlaying live, it all gets a bit out of control – we're both sort of chasing this thing that's just balanced between organisation and chaos. The way that I throw material into Live and use it to try and generate new forms in an unplanned way, that's reflected in the way I use found tape. You're looking for things that trigger emotional/aesthetic responses and sort of lead you to places you wouldn't find otherwise. From a purely 'music production' point of view, you end up with a mixture of things with different tonal qualities that combine together in a really pleasing way. It's also scrambling temporal signifiers – sounds/aesthetics that you associate with different eras. We live in a time when these kind of distinctions are being broken down by the internet and by the enormous amount of information crowding into our sensoria. We're all constantly editing, processing and organising information – our perception of reality is made up of this stuff, and it's quite enjoyable to play with.\nSculpture’s Membrane Pop is out on Software Recording Co\nSee and hear more of Sculpture.","What is Cyber Risk?\nCyber Risk is first and third-party risk associated with e-business, the Internet, networks and informational assets.\nWho is at risk?\n- Business Owners who operate a website.\n- Business Owners who are concerned with their clients’ and employee’s information being compromised.\n- Business Owners who are concerned about copyright/trademark infringement.\n- Business Owners who are aware of the risks associated with computer hackers, viruses and other damaging computer programs.\n- Business Owners who understand the importance of upholding and preserving their professional reputation should an incident occur.\n- Business Owners who keep electronic records of clients names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, credit card numbers and other sensitive information.\n- Business Owners who accept credit card payments.\n- Business Owners who may have employees that could compromise sensitive customer information or do something illegal to make some money.\n- Business Owners who use laptops, Blackberries or other portable devices that store client information.\nThird Party Liability\n- Disclosure Injury - Including lawsuits alleging unauthorized access to or dissemination of the plaintiff’s private information.

Its consistency alone makes it a great choice.\n- Cherry — Known for its durability and strength, cherry can stand up to most normal household abuse. It’s also a really pretty colour, light red or brown, though it tends to darken over time.\n- Ash — Often known as the material used for baseball bats and tool handles, ash has a clean, even look and can provide a unique, modern look.\n- Pine — This is a softwood, so it isn’t as durable, and you will be able to see the knots in the wood. However, you may choose it because of the distinctive, old-fashioned look.\n- Birch — Extremely durable and beautiful, birch is smooth and if you stain it right, it looks really expensive.\n- Oak — White oak is stronger and more old-fashioned looking, while red oak is more versatile and traditional looking.\nThis kind of material can be made from cedar, spruce, fir, pine, or redwood, so there is potentially a wide variety to choose from. It can be thick, thin, flexible, and can even vary as far as the kinds of adhesives used, some of which have different properties like a greater resistance to heat and humidity.\nPlywood is a popular choice because of its low cost, but it has several other natural advantages too. The material is naturally resistant to moisture and has greater stability than some other kinds of wood. Plywood is actually made of multiple layers of wood veneer glued and pressed together. Plywood is often more stable because of its ability to hold fasteners, like screws and bolts.\nWhile its layered design gives plywood a surprising amount of strength and flexibility, it does have its disadvantages. The layers can make it difficult to cut, and the edges can get splinters. Plywood can get heavy when exposed to moisture, especially when the exposure happens over time like with a leak. That can lead to permanent damage.\nMedium Density Fiberboard\nMade by breaking down hardwood or softwood residuals into wood fibres, Medium Density Fiberboard is then combined with wax and a resin binder to make the final product. This is formed into panels which can then be used for your construction projects. If it was low density it would be particle board, which shouldn’t be used for the main parts of the cabinets because it isn’t very strong but can be used for the outsides to save money. High density is strong but can be expensive.\nMedium Density Fiberboard often referred to as MDF, is dense and heavy. MDF is often used in popular products like IKEA furniture because it is smoother than plywood and resistant to cracking and peeling. That means you can paint over the colour easily when you want to update your kitchen. MDF won’t expand and contract with heat because it’s not made of solid wood.\nMDF can be hard to repair, even if you are just dealing with something small like a chip or crack. Water can make MDF swell, and kitchens are places with lots of exposures to water. There is no grain on MDF because of the way it is made, but you can cover it with veneer to get the texture and look you need.\nMost people don’t think of stainless steel first when designing new kitchen cabinets, but it is a popular option for people who want the kitchen to have a modern, contemporary look. You’ve probably seen this style on television if you watch cooking shows because some professionals choose stainless steel for their cabinets.\nThe most obvious reason to build stainless steel cabinets is that you can match them to your appliances. It would also be hard to find another material stronger than stainless steel, making them more durable than other materials. If you use it just in certain places, you can take advantage of its properties; for instance, stainless steel countertops will be durable and heat resistant. You can take a pot off the stove and place it directly on the stainless steel countertop without harming it.\nWith the great look and shiny surfaces comes the obvious problem of fingerprints and smudges. If you want an immaculate kitchen, you will find yourself constantly wiping down the surfaces. Also on the cosmetic side, if you overuse the stainless steel, your kitchen will look more like a factory than a home kitchen. The surface itself can be noisy and easy to scratch, and the material itself may be costly.\nThe Choice is Yours\nWhen it comes to building your own custom cabinets, you don’t just have a lot of choices; you can make multiple choices. You can choose the material you think is the prettiest, or the least expensive, or the strongest, and you can use different kinds of materials for different parts of the project. And to make it even harder to choose, you can always replace all or part of it later."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c01c79ad-475b-41cf-b465-196043104224>"],"error":null}

It consists of a chain of barrier islands that shelter an area of extensive intertidal flats and salt marshes, dissected by tidal channels and creeks. No rivers debouch into the basins of this coastal zone. All sediment that settles into the channels and onto the intertidal flats is imported from the North Sea. The accretion of the intertidal flats under sea-level rise, therefore, also depends on the import from the North Sea. If this import is insufficient, the intertidal flats may not keep up with sea-level rise at some point in the future, and drown.\nThe ecological value of the Wadden Sea is high. Especially the intertidal flats support a wide range of wildlife. If these flats would drown under sea-level rise, a most valuable nature reserve would be lost.\nThe impact of accelerated sea-level rise and soil subsidence\nIt is the relative sea-level rise that is important for the Wadden Sea’s future: the combination of absolute sea-level rise and the subsidence of the intertidal flats. A projection of possible future developments of this area is presented in a recent study that includes state of the art understanding of sea-level rise, soil subsidence, and sediment flows. The study focuses on the years 2030, 2050 and 2100.\nProjected mean sea-level rise between now (2018) and 2100 is 0.41 m, 0.52 m and 0.76 m, under a low, intermediate and high-end scenario of climate change, respectively. The subsidence results from the extraction of gas and salt in the area, and from natural processes (compaction of sediments, postglacial adjustment of the earth’s crust). The estimated effect of gas and salt extraction on subsidence in future decades varies locally, from zero to 1.6 mm per year. Natural subsidence is less than 1 mm per year.\nThe Wadden Sea in 2100\nUnder the low-end scenario, projected sea-level rise will not exceed the critical rate for drowning of the intertidal flats this century. Under the intermediate scenario this critical rate will be exceeded in one part of the Wadden Sea in 2030, whilst under the high-end scenario this rate will be exceeded in more parts from 2030 onwards. However, even under this high-end scenario the intertidal flats will not disappear on short notice. Drowning of the intertidal flats results from a gradual erosion of the flats. This process will take several centuries.\nThus, for the near future (up to 2030), the effect of sea-level rise on the Wadden Sea will be hardly noticeable. Over the long term, up to 2100, the projected changes largely depend on the scenarios of climate change. There will be hardly any effect under the low-end scenario, whereas effects will be noticeable already in 2050 under the high-end scenario.\nWhat if sea level rises much faster?\nRecently, an assessment has been carried out of possible upper limits of sea-level rise near the Dutch coast, based on recent studies that indicate that ice melt of Antarctica proceeds much faster than has been assumed so far1. The assessment indicates that sea-level rise may be up to 2-3 metres in 2100. This would agree with a rate of sea-level rise of 14 mm per year in 2050, and possibly increasing up to 60 mm per year in 2100. Under these extreme scenarios, the Wadden Sea will be practically drowned before 2100.\nSource: Van der Spek (2018).

{"question":"Explain how both Wardrop's System Optimality principle and the ULEZ/CAZ zones address traffic inefficiency - what different approaches do they take to manage congestion?","answer":"Wardrop's System Optimality principle and ULEZ/CAZ zones take different approaches to managing traffic inefficiency. Wardrop's principle focuses on minimizing total system travel time by trying to get travelers to consider the congestion costs they impose on others, potentially through mechanisms like Pigouvian taxes. In contrast, ULEZ and CAZ zones focus on reducing vehicle emissions and improving air quality by charging fees to non-compliant, higher-polluting vehicles. While Wardrop's approach aims to optimize route choices and travel times, the emission zones primarily target environmental impacts by encouraging the use of cleaner vehicles or alternative transportation modes.","context":["At the beginning of this series, we described Wardrop’s First Principle, of User Equilibrium. He also had a second principle, of System Optimality, which says: “At equilibrium the average journey time is minimum.” To achieve this requires every traveler to act in accordance with society’s best interest, which as we noted in part 2, is not generally calculable by an individual. This ratio of the total system travel time associated with a user equilibrium traffic pattern and the system optimal travel pattern has been dubbed “The Price of Anarchy” by Tim Roughgarden, who has applied this to computer networks. This number indicates the inefficiency of autonomous (or selfish) control in a system, compared to a theoretically best central control.\nWhen choosing a route, selfish users see the costs they incur, but not the costs they impose on others. This is analogous to the difference between average and social marginal costs in economics. If we somehow persuaded travelers to make route decisions considering the cost they impose on others, their marginal cost, we could achieve a minimal total cost for the system. In economics, the classic theoretical mechanism for this is called a Pigouvian Tax, which charges the polluter for the negative externalities imposed on the pollutee (the difference between the social marginal cost and social average cost). In this case the externality is congestion, or travel time imposed by a vehicle on all other vehicles in excess of what would be borne in the vehicle’s absence. The Pigouvian Tax gains its name from Arthur Pigou, a British economist from the 1920s, who discusses the idea in his text The Economics of Welfare.\nTravelers facing travel times and a Pigouvian Tax might choose a route that satisfies both of Wardrop’s Principles. The User Equilibrium (UE) solution would equal the Social Optimal (SO).\nUsing traffic assignment models we compared system optimal and user equilibrium flows and travel times for the Minneapolis – Saint Paul regional planning network, assuming total traffic flow between origins and destinations were fixed (i.e. unaffected by our distortion of route prices). We found the SO assignment had a 1.7% overall time savings, and a slightly higher average speed (63.2 km/h vs. 61.8 km/h). Perhaps surprisingly, it also had somewhat more total vehicle kilometers traveled (9.37M vs. 9.33M), as drivers had to take longer routes to avoid imposing congestion on others.\nWhile the SO result is better than the UE (it cannot be worse), we might ask “SO What?”. The price of anarchy, letting drivers choose their own routes rather than being centrally directed, is relatively small, under 2 percent. It turns out it is much more important to get people to choose an efficient time of day than to worry about micro-managing which route they select.\nWe could post time-varying prices (just like the HOT lanes of Part 3, or many transit systems which have peak and off-peak fares) to discourage demand when it is highest, and encourage demand at off-peak periods. This is done on some toll facilities now, and other schemes, like the London Congestion Charge, have two prices: free or tolled, depending on time of day. But this can be as refined as we want it, with prices changing every hour, every five minutes, or even continuously. The prices might change in real-time, or change according to a fixed and posted schedule.\nNobel-winning Economist William Vickery developed the first version of the bottleneck model, which showed how varying prices would allow people to trade-off being on-time (at a higher toll) or being early or late (at a lower toll, but a higher cost in what transportation researchers call “schedule delay”).\nThe simplest version of this has two players1. Imagine two boats racing for a canal lock, or, as in the image, two weightlifters trying to get through a narrow door on the London Underground. When they arrive at the same time, only one can make it through first, the other has to wait. The one who makes it through imposed schedule delay on the one who waited. But if they arrived at different times, there would be no direct schedule delay, though one might not get into the canal (or through the door) at their preferred time. If we appropriately price simultaneous arrivals, we will discourage them. While with two players this may be feasible to coordinate with direct communication by saying don’t arrive when the other guy arrives, and negotiating, for 2000 people instead of 2, coordination is better through posted price signals than conversation and negotiation. Prices varying by time-of-day is what congestion pricing is about, putting a higher price on times which are most desired, and lower prices on the less desired times.\nThere are perhaps other ways to achieve this end. On most roads, it is assumed no one owns the travel time, and so we get congestion. If there were some kind of property in the right to travel at a given time, we could auction off this right to the highest bidder, and similarly avoid congestion. This would more closely follow a strategy of establishing property rights to avoid externalities, as suggested by British-American economist Ronald Coase (who is still talking about economics at the age of 102). In the transportation literature, this has come to be known as reservation pricing. Just as one does not expect to be seated when showing up unexpectedly at a popular restaurant that takes reservations, one should not expect to use a high-demand bottleneck facility on the transportation network without making arrangements in advance. Of course it is much more complicated with a real-time system like transportation, and to maximize throughput, it is likely that some queueing is required. This queue ensures there is someone waiting to take advantage of the next gap that opens. The alternative would be that the facility remains under-utilized for part of the time, which has its own costs. Even restaurants that reserve tables sometimes make you wait a little bit, for their immediate convenience, not yours, maximizing the productivity of their staff.\nUnfortunately congestion pricing in any form remains more in the realm of theory than practice. While there are a few Congestion Charging programs: notably Singapore, London, and Stockholm, they are not over a large enough area, or variable enough in prices, to produce an end to congestion. Once many of these are implemented, I expect many cities will look at their peers and copy them, and it will become standard in all large metropolitan areas. But to date, the cases are fairly exceptional: Central Singapore, a city-state governed by a strong Prime Minister, whose family has been in power for five decades; Central London, a city governed at the time by “Red Ken” Livingstone, a radical thinker who was willing to take the political heat for the decision; and Stockholm, which conducted a trial experiment before holding an election to allow residents to vote up or down. Technically the systems all work well, and certainly do reduce congestion compared to the unpriced alternative. Politically they have been difficult to emulate. New York City tried and failed2, and no other US city has been willing to do something quite so radical.\nAnother possible deployment path for congestion pricing is through what is variously called a Vehicle Mileage Tax, or a Mileage-based User Fee. Gas tax revenues, which provide a large share of road funding, have been declining for a long time in the US, both due to leveling off of demand for driving, as well as better fuel economy. The simplest solution is to raise the gas tax, which solves an immediate problem, but not the longer term one. While hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles (like the Toyota Prius) still pay some gas tax, plug-in electrics (like the Tesla, Chevy Volt, or Nissan Leaf) pay almost none. Yet they still use the roads. Although they are presently a small share of the market, that share is likely to grow. Some states are beginning to think about how to charge EVs for the use of roads, just as gasoline-powered vehicles are charged based on a gas tax. Once a device is placed in cars tracking miles traveled (basically just the odometer, though possibly with some locational data to allow prices to vary by location (urban vs. rural) (although it technically feasible to ensure privacy, by not tracking which specific miles are traveled, no one will believe government protestations isn’t tracking them anymore, anyway), that device can also track when those miles are traveled, and vary the rate by time-of-day. The State of Washington now taxes EVs $100 per year to offset the lack of gas tax revenue. Oregon is conducting a large scale test of the Vehicle Mileage Tax, allowing 5000 volunteers to pay by the mile and have their gas tax rebated.\nWe are getting to the point where we can provide incentives and disincentives to efficiently manage road use. The technology exists, it is probably accurate enough. The cost of collecting a new road fee is non-trivial (especially compared with the gas tax, which simply requires an annual check of refinery sales), but the costs should drop with widespread deployment. The benefits are a significant improvement in the management of road use, so that drivers who do not need to travel when roads are congested, will have incentives to avoid those times.\nIf applied correctly, the resulting changes in route choices it will reveal where roads are overbuilt, and where demand, even after pricing, is sufficient to justify new capacity. The most cost-effective thing we can do in transportation is to get the prices right, all else will follow. This requires above all else, field experiments where different strategies are tested and evaluated, and deployment by replicating the successful experiments.\n- Levinson, David (2005) Micro-foundations of Congestion and Pricing: A Game Theory Perspective.

However, understanding the differences between each zone and what they actually mean is a little more challenging.\nWe’re here to break it down and make understanding these abstract terms more palatable.\nCAZ, LEZ, and ULEZ are all abbreviations of the low and zero-emission zones that are in force around the UK.\nThe key aim of these zones is to improve the health and wellbeing of residents and workers in our cities, as they often suffer from poor air quality and above-average toxicity.\nMuch of the pollution comes from older cars, bikes, vans, and trucks that emit greater amounts of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), and Particulate Matter (PM) than their more eco-friendly alternatives.\nTherefore, to cut down on these particulates in the air from fossil fuel vehicles, councils have put in the aforementioned ‘green zones’ across the country in order to encourage walking, the use of push-bikes, public transport, or low and zero-emission vehicles.\nTo make matters slightly more confusing, the CAZ, LEZ, and ULEZ schemes are all different and, despite all being enforced by the government, do not always interlink. Each zone has its own rules that apply.\nKeep reading to find out what each zone means, where they’re located, and the restrictions that apply for personal and commercial vehicles.\nLocation: London (find map here)\nVehicles exempt: Euro 6 HGV’s, buses and coaches; Euro 6 diesel cars/vans; Euro 4 petrol cars and all hybrids, PHEVs and electric cars. As for LPG conversions, it depends on the individual model and engine, so it’s important to check with TfL first. These vehicles are allowed in the ULEZ zone without charge.\nHow does it work? Transport for London will enforce the ULEZ area with ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras.\nWhen any driver enters the ULEZ area, their number plate will be read upon entry and this will be cross-referenced with the system.\nHow much does it cost for non-exempt vehicles? For HGVs (over 3.5 tonnes) it costs £100 – £300 per day for a non-compliant truck to enter the ULEZ. For non-compliant cars, it costs £12. This is on top of the £15 congestion charge.\nHow do I pay? You can pay for the charges in advance (or within 72 hours) on the ‘Pay to Drive in London’ page on the Transport for London (TfL) website.\nThe page will look something like this:\nIf your vehicle is compliant, the ULEZ charge section will state ‘This vehicle meets or is exempt from the ULEZ standards’ and you won’t be able to select it.\nWhat is the penalty? If you don’t pay the ULEZ charges within 72 hours, you will receive a PCN for up to £160 for cars, or up to £1000 for a truck.\nULEZ stands for Ultra Low Emission Zone, which is situated in London.\nThe ULEZ came into force in April 2019 after a recognition that illegal levels of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Particulate Matter (PM) existed within the capital and contributed to the ill health of some of London’s most vulnerable people.\nA report four months after its introduction found that around 13,500 fewer polluting cars were being driven into central London every day, compared with six months earlier\nRecently, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has recommitted to expanding the capital’s ULEZ this month (25th of October 2021), as part of a wide-ranging new programme designed to make a ‘green recovery’ from the pandemic the centrepiece of his second term.\nThe ULEZ only currently covers the red area of this map, but as of the 25th of October, it will reach the whole of the blue area.\nFor specific locations, you can use the postcode tool on TfL’s website here: https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone/ulez-expansion.\nThe ULEZ operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, every day of the year (except Christmas day).\nLocation: Greater London (find map here)\nVehicles exempt: The LEZ applies to diesel HGVs, trucks, heavy vans, buses (including minibusses and coaches), and other specialist heavy vehicles. Some light 4x4s and pickups registered new before 1st January 2002 also have to pay the LEZ. Nearly all other vehicles are exempt, but you can double-check this on the TfL website here.\nHow does it work? There are no barriers or toll booths within the LEZ. Instead, cameras will read your number plate as you drive within the LEZ and check it against a database of registered vehicles.\nHow much does it cost for non-exempt vehicles? Between £100 – £300\nHow do I pay? The same way as you pay for ULEZ, via the ‘Pay to Drive in London’ page on the TfL website.\nWhat is the penalty? If you don’t pay the LEZ charges within 72 hours, you will receive a PCN between £500 – £2000 depending on the vehicle.\nThe Low Emission Zone (LEZ) operates to encourage the most polluting heavy diesel vehicles driving in London to become cleaner. The LEZ covers most of Greater London and is in operation 24 hours a day, every day of the year.\nThe LEZ is separate from the aforementioned Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) which is in place in central London.\nHow does it work? There are 4 types of Clean Air Zones, Class A to D. Please see the table below to find out which vehicles are affected by the CAZ.\n|A||Buses, coaches, taxis, private hire vehicles|\n|B||Buses, coaches, taxis, private hire vehicles, heavy goods vehicles|\n|C||Buses, coaches, taxis, private hire vehicles, heavy goods vehicles, vans, minibusses|\n|D||Buses, coaches, taxis, private hire vehicles, heavy goods vehicles, vans, minibusses, cars, the local authority has the option to include motorcycles|\nBath is in Class C, and Birmingham is in Class D.\nEach vehicle type has a minimum emission standard. You can find your vehicle’s emission standard in your vehicle logbook or from your vehicle manufacturer.\nTo avoid being charged in a Clean Air Zone, your vehicle must meet the following minimum standard:\n|Vehicle type||Clean Air Zone minimum standard|\n|Buses, coaches, heavy goods vehicles||Euro VI|\n|Vans, minibuses, taxis, private hire vehicles, cars||Euro 6 (diesel) and Euro 4 (petrol)|\nHow much does it cost for a non-exempt vehicle? The CAZ in Bath costs £9 for most vehicles and larger vehicles such as lorries or buses need to pay the higher charge of £100. The Birmingham CAZ is slightly cheaper, at £8 for cars and £50 for buses and lorries.\nHow do I pay?\nPayment must be made via the Government’s online payment system or by calling the National Contact Centre on 0300 029 8888 (8am to 4:30pm) either:\nWhat is the penalty?\nIf you do not pay during the allocated 13-day payment window you will be subject to a minimum PCN of £120.\nAs a continued part of the government plans to improve air quality in some of the UK’s busiest cities, the new Clean Air Zone was introduced in 2021.\nThe first two cities to introduce CAZs are Bath and Birmingham. However, other towns and cities in England, Wales, and Scotland are testing the idea, and Portsmouth will soon be joining the bandwagon.\nMuch like the ULEZ charge in London, the two cities that are introducing the CAZ charge plan to run these zone 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\nYou can find out more about the CAZ charge on our new CAZ Checker site and check your vehicle meets the CAZ requirements.\nYou may have also noticed ULEV signs in some of Nottingham’s bus lanes. This stands for Ultra Low Emission Vehicles, which are now allowed in these lanes any time of the day.\nCities planning on introducing CAZ or LEZ zones in 2022:\nThe COP26 is fast approaching, and after this meeting, we may well see a rise in clean air zones across the country. Therefore, it’s best to stay ahead of the game if possible.\nIf you are interested in learning more about how you can make your commercial vehicle fleet of trucks and vans low or zero-emission, please feel free to get in touch on firstname.lastname@example.org quoting “zero” and we will send you an information pack.

{"question":"As a crop scientist, I'm wondering which GMO innovation had more documented economic impact: ice-minus bacteria or European corn borer resistance?","answer":"The European corn borer resistance through Bt corn had a more documented economic impact. The documents state that corn borer caused losses exceeding $1 billion annually in the 1990s before Bt corn was introduced in 1996. While ice-minus bacteria showed promise in protecting crops from frost damage (which caused about $1 billion in annual crop damage), the documented results were limited and partially compromised by environmental activists who destroyed some test plants.","context":["To use all functions of this page, please activate cookies in your browser.\nWith an accout for my.bionity.com you can always see everything at a glance – and you can configure your own website and individual newsletter.\n- My watch list\n- My saved searches\n- My saved topics\n- My newsletter\nIce-minus bacteria is a nickname given to a variant of the common bacterium Pseudomonas syringae (P. syringae). This strain of P. syringae lacks the ability to produce a certain surface protein, usually found on wild-type \"ice-plus\" P. syringae. The \"ice-plus\" protein (Ina protein, \"Ice nucleation-active\" protein) found on the outer bacterial cell wall acts as the nucleating centers for ice crystals. This facilitates ice formation, hence the designation \"ice-plus.\" The ice-minus variant of P. syringae is a mutant, lacking the gene responsible for ice-nucleating surface protein production. This lack of surface protein provides a less favorable environment for ice formation. Both strains of P. syringae occur naturally, but recombinant DNA technology has allowed for the synthetic removal or alteration of specific genes, enabling the creation of the ice-minus strain.\nAdditional recommended knowledge\nTo systematically create the ice-minus strain of P. syringae, its ice-forming gene must be isolated, amplified, deactivated and reintroduced into P. syringae bacterium. The following steps are often used to isolate and generate ice-minus strains of P. syringae:\nThe success of the agricultural world is heavily dependent on the weather. Cold weather conditions are directly responsible for the appearance of frost on plants and most importantly, crops. In the United States alone, it has been estimated that frost accounts for approximately $1 billion in crop damage each year. As P. syringae commonly inhabits plant surfaces, its ice nucleating nature incites frost development, freezing the buds of the plant and destroying the occurring crop. The introduction of an ice-minus strain of P. syringae to the surface of plants would incur competition between the strains. Should the ice-minus strain win out, the ice nucleate provided by P. syringae would no longer be present, lowering the level of frost development on plant surfaces at normal water freezing temperature (0oC). Even if the ice-minus strain does not win out, the amount of ice nucleate present from ice-plus P. syringae would be reduced due to competition. Decreased levels of frost generation at normal water freezing temperature would translate into a lowered quantity of crops lost due to frost damage, rendering higher crop yields overall.\nDr. Hall Hoppe of the U.S. Department of Agriculture was the first to notice a connection between bacteria and frost damage. In 1961, Dr. Hoppe studied a corn fungus by grinding up infected leaves each season, then applying the powder to test corn for the following season to track the disease. A surprise frost occurred that year, leaving peculiar results. Only plants infected with the diseased powder incurred frost damage, leaving healthy plants unfrozen. This phenomenon would baffle scientists until graduate student Stephen Lindow of the University of Wisconsin-Madison found a bacterium in the dried leaf powder in the early 1970s. Dr. Lindow, now a plant pathologist at the University of California-Berkeley, found that when this particular bacterium was introduced to plants where it is originally absent, the plants became very vulnerable to frost damage. He would go on to identify the bacterium as P. syringae, investigate P. syringae's role in ice nucleation and in 1977, discover the mutant ice-minus strain. He was later successful at developing the ice-minus strain of P. syringae through recombinant DNA technology as well.\nIn 1983, Advanced Genetic Sciences (AGS) obtained U.S. government authorization to perform field tests with the ice-minus strain of P. syringae, but environmental groups and protestors delayed the field tests for four years with legal challenges. In 1987, the ice-minus strain of P. syringae became the first genetically modified organism (GMO) to be released into the environment. A strawberry field in California was spayed with the ice-minus strain of P. syringae just before a frost in 1987. The results were promising, showing lowered frost damage to the treated plants, but the data was in suspect as environment activists destroyed some of the plants. Dr. Lindow also conducted an experiment on a crop of potato seedlings sprayed with ice-minus P. syringae. He was successful in protecting the potato crop from frost damage with a strain of ice-minus P. syringae.\nAt the time of Dr. Lindow's work on ice-minus P. syringae, genetic engineering was considered to be very controversial. The controversy primarily revolved around fears of introducing new organisms that may permanently disrupt the ecosystem. The fear was that the introduction of ice-minus bacteria to the environment would eliminate bacterial and plant varieties. This was true in the case of the gypsy moth's accidental introduction into the U.S. Without a predator in the U.S., the gypsy moth is still causing overwhelming destruction to the hardwood forests of northeastern U.S.\n|This article is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.

A list of authors is available in Wikipedia.|","Outside of drought and hail, insects and weeds are the worst threats to agricultural crops, so it’s not surprising that those pests were the first to be attacked by genetic engineers.\nWeeds were the first targets. In the 1980s, Monsanto already produced the powerful herbicide Roundup. It works by disrupting the action of an enzyme that is found in almost all plants but not in humans. The problem was how to apply Roundup to the plants you don’t want and keep it off the plants you do – get it on the weeds while keeping it away from the crops. That’s tough to do, so farmers were using Roundup early in the growing season to kill weeds that sprouted before the crops, and then switching to less powerful herbicides after the crops germinated.\nGenetic engineers wondered if they could find a gene that would allow crops to survive and even thrive when they are exposed to Roundup. The reasoning was that the pesticide worked on enzymes, and enzymes are proteins that are produced by genes – therefore, there might be a gene that could protect the crop from the pesticide.\nProfessor Don Lee (right) says that the scientists found their resistant gene in an unusual source that was actually natural. “Monsanto, the company that developed Roundup resistance went looking for Roundup resistance in nature,” he says. “And guess where they found it? They went to bacteria that were in the waste water treatment facility of their one of their Roundup manufacturing plants!”\nIn the early 80s, workers at a Roundup manufacturing plant in Louisiana noticed that bacteria were breaking down the chemical residue left over. Scientists took 20 different bacteria from the waste facility and found one of that was totally immune to the effect of Roundup or other glyphosate pesticides.\nThe next task was to put the gene from the bacteria into crop plants.\nIn 1987, Monsanto started field trials with GMO biotech plants. It took until 1996 to complete the tests, get the regulators to approve of the new hybrids and introduce to the world “Roundup Ready Soybeans.” Farmers could now plant the soybeans, wait for the weeds and the crop to come up and spray once with Roundup. The weeds would die and the crops would grow without the pressure from competing weeds.\nIn 1997, Monsanto introduced GMO varieties of canola and cotton.\nOther companies used similar strategies. For example, the German firm AgrEvo had their own powerful herbicide named “Liberty,” that killed plants by disrupting their ability to use nitrates from the soil. In 1995, they introduced in Canada a genetically modified variety of canola that could resist the action of Liberty herbicide. In 1997, their GM corn variety was introduced in the U.S.\nThe European corn borer was the next pest to be attacked by GMOs in 1996 with the introduction of “Bt corn hybrids.” The corn borer is the most damaging insect pest of corn throughout the U.S. and Canada with losses exceeding $1 billion a year in the 1990s.\nFor decades, agricultural scientists have known that a common bacteria found in the soil can produce toxins that are deadly to insects but harmless to humans because they are destroyed within seconds by the acids in the human digestive tract. The bacteria are known as Bacillus thuringiensis and the toxins they produce – not surprisingly – are known as Bt toxins. There are thousands of different kinds of Bt bacteria and they produce different toxins that affect different insects. In fact, organic farmers have used these Bt microorganisms for decades since they produce natural insecticides.\nIn the early 90s, genetic engineers realized that the genes of Bacillus thuringiensis were what produced the Bt toxin, and they found a way to isolate those specific genes. They transferred those genes into a second bacteria – Agrobacterium – that has the ability to get into the nuclei of plants like corn and transfer genetic material to the corn. Then, they figured out how to find the specific plants that had been altered by including other genes that were resistant to chemicals like antibacterial drugs.\nMycogen and Ciba Seeds (now Novartis Seeds) first introduced Bt corn hybrids in 1996. Farmers found out that the corn borers died after eating only a few bites of the Bt corn plant. Monsanto was not far behind with its own Bt corn, and other companies like Pioneer have either developed their own strains or licensed the technology from other companies.\nBt technology has also been used to attack other insect pests in cotton, potatoes and soybeans.\nSince then, there have been a number of new genetic modifications to a wide variety of crops –\n- Sweet potatoes have been enhanced with more protein and other nutrients.\n- Golden rice has been modified by the International Rice Research Institute to provide a low level of Vitamin A. They spliced in genes from the daffodil plant that produce the vitamin, also known as beta carotene.\n- Carrots have been modified to provide at least a little calcium.\nAgricultural scientists are now taking genetic modification further by “stacking” two or more genetic traits in a single plant. In one variety, there eight different genetic modifications in a single hybrid of corn."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e6028c42-49c5-44cf-abea-7632a84478ad>","<urn:uuid:171a43c1-7a19-4f03-88bc-25bc4259d3b0>"],"error":null}

To minimize this harm, the University of Waterloo is taking a risk-based approach to laboratory safety. The process involves three steps:\n- Identifying all hazards associated with the processes or methods, materials, and equipment used to perform work.\n- Rating these hazards into categories of risk.\n- Implementing controls sufficient to eliminate or reduce risk to an acceptable level.\nHazards deemed high risk must be controlled immediately. Hazards identified to be of moderate risk should also be controlled immediately, but temporary controls (such as the use of PPE) can be used until a permanent solution is found. Finally, hazards identified to be of low risk should be monitored to ensure their risk does not increase.\nObjectives of the Laboratory Safety Program\nThe objective of this laboratory safety program is to eliminate or reduce the risk that laboratory work poses to researchers, workers, students, and any other person exposed to the hazards laboratory work creates.\nThe information provided on this pages applies to all laboratory activities that pose a potential for harm or injury to persons or infrastructures. Other health and safety programs at the University of Waterloo provide more detailed operating procedures and guidance for various activities. Examples of these include the Biosafety Program, the Laser Safety Program, the Nanosafety Program, etc...\nLinks to these programs can be found in the menu on the left of the screen or below in Table 1.\nThe primary responsibility for the safety of workers, students, and the public lies with the Principal Investigator. The principal investigator is considered a supervisor under the Occupational Health and Safety Act in Ontario. In this role they must ensure the following duties are met:\n- Hazards associated with the work being performed and the work environment have been identified\n- The risk associated with all identified hazards are eliminated or minimized\n- Work is performed and the work environment is kept within the scope of the governing legislation and applicable standards\n- Hazards associated with the work performed and the work environment are communicated to those performing it.\n- Workers and students are competent to perform the work they have been assigned\n- Report and investigate laboratory incidents\nWorkers and Students\nWorkers and students are expected to:\n- Report any hazards, incidents, or injuries to their direct supervisor\n- Follow all procedures as written or required for the work they are performing\n- Follow all legislative requirements as prescribed in Ontario, the Region of Waterloo and City of Waterloo\n- Attend any training sessions deemed necessary to complete their work in a competent manner\n- Wear any personnel protective equipment as required\nThe Safety Office\nThe Safety Office acts on behalf of the University of Waterloo to support legislative requirements, and the overall reduction of risk to workers, students, faculty and visitors. It is a resource that interprets legislation and standards, develops tools to assist PI’s, workers, and other individuals performing work on campus. Some of the resources the Safety Office provides includes:\n- Web-based and classroom training courses\n- Consultations on legislative requirements\n- Exposure assessments\n- Designated substance assessments\n- Assistance with accident and incident investigations\n- Much more…\nIn other words, the Safety Office is a resource for the University of Waterloo that recommends best practices and standards to minimize risk. We do not make things safe, we help you to assess the work you perform in order to control the risks you may face while working.\nLaboratory safety committee\nThe laboratory safety committee (LSC) is a volunteer group of individuals from various faculties at the University of Waterloo. It's main function is to monitor laboratory risk and act in a advisory role to the Vice-President, University Research, and the Safety Office. For more information on the committee please click here:\nHazard Identification and Risk Assessment\nWhen a research project is proposed it is expected that the Principle Investigator will analyze the methods, equipment, and materials being used in order to identify:\n- Potential or existing hazards,\n- The level of risk for each hazard; and,\n- The controls that will be implemented to either eliminate or minimize the risk of each hazard.\nThis process is called “Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment”. The purpose is to proactively identify and eliminate or reduce the risk of any hazard that may pose a significant potential for harm to individuals or the work environment. Completing this process before work is conducted allows one to implement and plan controls more efficiently and cost effectively. That does not mean the process should not be performed if work has already begun. A hazard and risk assessment can be performed at any time.\nRisk Assessment Tools\nEach research project is unique, or will have some unique element to it. That is why risk must be analyzed using tools appropriate to the work being conducted, and/or the materials/equipment being used.

{"question":"How do the festivals at Melukote and Thiruvenkadu temples commemorate their respective deities?","answer":"At Melukote, the main festival is the Vairamudi Brahmotsava, a 13-day celebration where Lord Cheluva Narayana is adorned with a diamond-studded crown and taken in procession with his consorts Sridevi and Bhudevi. Similarly, at Thiruvenkadu, a 13-day Brahmotsavam (Indra Vizha) is celebrated in the Tamil month of Masi. Both temples have strict ritual procedures - at Melukote, the priest must cover his eyes while fitting the Vairamudi crown, while at Thiruvenkadu, special midnight 'Agorapoojai' is performed on the third Sunday of Karthigai month. Both temples also celebrate their festivals with grand processions and draw large crowds of devotees.","context":["Here the presiding deity is Lord Cheluva-Narayana Swamy or Tirunarayana or Lord Krishna. In one of the annual report of Mysore Archeaelogical Department, it stated that people used to worship here even before Sri Ramanujacharya renovated this temple and offered prayer. From the records of that period there seems to Tamil influence and vaishnava worship in this area. Tamil influence one may argue from the name “Tirunarayanapuram”. The word “Thiru” is typically used in Tamil language. The Wodeyar kings of Mysore were special patrons of this temple and has bestowed special offers and protection. Raja Wodeyar in 1614 adopted vaishnava religion and offered a gold crown set with precious jewels known aas Raja mundi. Krishnaraja Wodeyar III also present one such crown known as Krishnaraja mundi. There is another crown — Vairamudi or Vajramukuta, which seems to be older than the other two crowns but no one knows where from it came. The annual festival of this temple is known as vairamudi festival and it draws lakshs of people.\nMelukote is a famous piligrimage center situated in Mandya district, Karnataka. This place is also known as Thirunarayanapuram, Yadavagiri or Yadugiri nestled in the Cauvery river valley. Two temples reside in this town, one on the foothills and the other on top of the hill. In the twelfth century the great Srivaishnava saint Ramanujacharya lived here for more than 14 years. These temples existed even before Sri Ramanujacharya came to this place.\nThe presiding deity of the temple on the foothills is Lord Vishnu known as Thirunarayana or Cheluvaraya installed by Lord Krishna. The utsavamurthy (small metal statue representing the main deity, that can be taken on a parade) is known as Cheluvapille Raya or Cheluvanarayana Swamy whose original name is Ramapriya. Legend narrates that Shri Rama and his son Kusha has worshipped this statue and hence the name Ramapriya. This utsavamurthy was lost when the moghuls invaded the place and it was recovered by Ramanujacharya from Bibi Nachiyaar the daughter of Mohammed Shah. Bibi Nachiyaar was given this idol as a toy to play with and instead of playing with the idol, she worshipped it and became a devotee. She was heartbroken when her dad without consulting her gave away the statue to Sri Ramanujacharya. In search of her Lord she came to Melukote from Delhi on horseback and saw the statue and collapsed in front of it. Her soul in the form of a jyothi (flame) merged into the idol. Hence in honor of her devotion, she is worshipped along with the lord and her idol can be seen at the feet of both the main deity and the utsavmurthy.\nThere are three ponds in the town, two on the foothills and another on top of the hill.

It is believed that Lord Krishna Himself presented this crown to Cheluva Narayana. The Lord is taken in procession on the golden Garuda with His divine consorts Sridevi & Bhudevi, around the main streets of the city.\nHistoryVairamudi, the diamond crown was stolen from Sriman Narayana, when he was asleep at his abode in the Ksheera Sagara (Milky Ocean), by Virochana. Virochana was the kind of demons and the son of Bhakta Prahlada. Garuda was asked by the lord’s devotees to bring back the crown.

The blue gem is believed to have fallen near Nachiar Koil, a temple town in Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu. The gem turned into a stream, called the Manimuttaru, which to this day flows in Thanjavur. On his way, he saw Bala Krishna playing with his friends in the mid day sun at Brindavana.

It is from here taken upto the temple with honors in a special palanquin. It reaches the temple by evening.\nThe crown is placed in front of sanctum of Sri Acharya Ramanuja and the head priest places the Vaira Mudi and fits it to the statue of the Lord Cheluva Narayana. It is tradition that even the head priest should not look at the Vaira Mudi in naked eyes till it is fitted to the Lord. Hence the priest covers his eyes with a silk cloth while fitting the crown.\nThis takes place in the night and then the Lord and his consorts are traditionally decorated and procession continues to the dawn of the next day.

{"question":"What are the key considerations for keeping backup media secure?","answer":"There are three fundamental elements for securing backup media: 1) Secure off-site storage to ensure system restoration in case of fire, flood, or theft, 2) Secure on-site storage in a fireproof safe for easy access to vital backed-up files, and 3) Write protection of backup media to prevent accidental overwriting, even when password-protected since passwords don't prevent media from being erased.","context":["by Ing. Roberto Grassi\nThe effectiveness of a good backup program depends on your approach to file backup\nmanagement. The following are key considerations:\nHow valuable are your files ?\nWhat would be the consequences of losing these files ?\nCould you replace them ? If so, what would be the time and cost required ?\nHow often do these files change ?\nDo you need to keep older versions of files ?\nDoes the device you use to back up files have any limitation of time, media capacity, or\nDo you need to transport or distribute your backed-up files ?\nOnce backed-up, how important is immediate access to these files ?\nThese issues can be divided into certain basic categories: value, change,\nperformance, media capacity, and portability.\nStrategies are frequently are based on a combination of these considerations and should\ndevelop a plan that lets you restore files easily should it become necessary.\nWhen you devise a strategy, consider your cost in time and money to replace lost files.\nFor example, if you work for an insurance company managing client information and claims,\nthen you would probably consider file loss disastrous. The consequence of losing\nirreplaceable files makes it desirable to back up your files every day to different media.\nHow often your files change is another key element to consider when planning an\neffective strategy. For example, losing even part of one day's input at a mail-order house\nwould result in many lost orders and lost revenues. Your strategy might be to backup only\nchanged files periodically throughout the day to ensure that a recent copy of all files\nMedia capacity and device performance\nYou should back up completely once a day but this is not always possible due to time,\nmedia, or device restrictions. You must assess your physical setup (for example, type and\nsize of the available backup device) to effectively plan a strategy. Your strategy depends\nupon the kind of backup device you use, just as you may choose a device in response to the\nkind of strategy you consider necessary.\nMedia portability may also influence the strategy you implement. For instance, in\nsituations where files must be circulated within your department or sent to another site,\nyou would want to use a backup device to physically transport your media. You must also\nchoose a device with media compatible with other devices and with the environments to\nwhich you send the data.\nUse only high-quality media for your backups. GRBackPro is careful to check that each\nmedia is reliable but you can increase your long term reliability of the backup when you\nuse high-quality media.\nUnsure that your hardware is fully operational? A backup program cannot operate\neffectively if the drive is not perfectly working. Faulty disk controllers and other\ncircuitry can also cause information to be written incorrectly to the media,\nClearly label all backup media. This will allows you to easily retrieve them when you\nhave lost a file.\nThere are two types of backups:\nA Full backup of your files requires mode time and media. A full backup however, should\nbe performed regularly (at least once a week, depending on your work volume).\nA modified backup saves time and media. Usually, only a few files on your hard disk are new\nor have been changed since each week. The Incremental mode backs up any files that have\nchanged or been created since the most recent Full or Incremental backup. The Differential\nmode backs up all files that have changed or been created since the most recent Full\nBasis of a Good Strategy.\nRegardless of which approach and media you choose, there are several elements\nfundamental to all good strategies.\nSecure Off-site storage If your business was\nstruck by fire, flood, or theft, you can ensure that your system can be restored by\nkeeping a recent copy of your files off-site.\nSecure On-site storage Store your media in\na fireproof safe to enhance security. Remember that you want to have easy access to your\nmost vital backed-up files.\nWrite protection Backup copies may be\nthe only way to re-create files in case of loss or damage. Write protecting your backup\nmedia ensures that they cannot be accidentally overwritten.\nNOTE: you should write-protect media even if\nit is password-protected since a password does not prevent media from being erased or\nTo minimize data loss and computer downtime when a hard disk crash occurs, you should\nfollow these rules when backing up your data:\nPerform a Full backup of your hard disk, and make sure that the option\nattribute bit on the source file\" on the Backup dialog is checked. Place this backup in a\nPerform Modified backups as a part of your future backup strategy rather than backing up\nyour entire system. This method saves time and media. When you select the Differential\nmode the backup program backs up only those files that have been modified or created since\nthe last Full backup.\nMaintain at least two sets of backups with Modified backups, and rotate these sets to be\nprepared for a system crash. Restoring the latest backup set updates your system to its\nlatest stable state.\nYou should consider how often you want to backup your files and which files you should\nback up. A regular Full Backup and Restore verification is recommended but whether you\nsupplement that with Incremental or Differential backups depends on your needs.\nThese questions may help clarify your situation:\nIf your files are damaged or deleted, how many days of work does it takes to re-create\nWhat is the oldest version of a file that you anticipate you may ever need ?\nRotate a minimum of three sets of media so that you always have a recent Full backup and two alternating\nsets of media which contain specified backed-up files. If either of these sets becomes\ndamaged, you have another recent copy on hand."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2f1cdb47-c8e7-43df-a10e-c4a8bab89ea1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Is Brazil open or closed economy and what makes US business friendly?","answer":"Brazil is one of the world's most closed economies, with the least imports globally relative to GDP. Trade flows (exports plus imports) average only 25% of GDP, making it one of the least open G20 countries. There are fewer than 20,000 exporters in Brazil, roughly the same as Norway. In contrast, the US is the second-least complex business environment because it has stable, clearly stated rules and regulations, only requires audits for publicly traded companies, offers streamlined tax and accounting administration, and provides ease in hiring and firing employees. The US system generally operates on the assumption that companies are complying with regulations.","context":["Does Brazil have any trade restrictions?\nDoes Brazil have any trade restrictions?\nBrazil – Trade BarriersBrazil-Trade-Barriers Brazil ranks 137 out of 138 economies for burden of regulation, ahead of only Venezuela. U.S. companies often mention duplicative, arbitrary, or sometimes discriminatory regulations as barriers to trade for U.S. products in Brazil.\nWhat is Brazil trade policy?\nBrazil’s main trade policy objective has been the implementation of the trade agreements negotiated at the beginning of the 1990s, namely the Uruguay Round and MERCOSUR. Better market access conditions for Brazilian products are also a key item on its trade agenda. Brazil is a founding member of the WTO.\nWho regulates trade in Brazil?\nThe Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is comprised of two elements: Export Administration (EA), which is responsible for processing license applications, counseling exporters, and drafting and publishing changes to the Export Administration Regulations; and Export Enforcement (EE), which is responsible for the …\nWhat are some trade barriers in Brazil?\nU.S. companies also cite high tariffs, an uncertain customs system, high and unpredictable tax burdens, and an overburdened legal system as major hurdles to doing business in Brazil.\nIs Brazil open for trade?\nBrazil has closed their door for trading with the world. As measured by the trade penetration with export plus imports, Brazil has a remarkably close economy. It has the least imports in the world. In Brazil, most good and services are made within the borders.\nWhat does the US trade with Brazil?\nBrazil’s main imports from the United States are aircraft, machinery, petroleum products, electronics, and optical and medical instruments. The United States is Brazil’s second-largest export market. The primary products are crude oil, aircraft, iron and steel, and machinery.\nHow does Brazil benefit from trade?\nCurrently, Brazil’s trade flows—exports plus imports—average a minimal 25 percent of its GDP—making the country one of the least open amongst G20 countries. Trade protection, such as imposing tariffs, helps countries to deter foreign competition and make domestic goods more appealing to domestic consumers.\nHow is Brazil involved in international trade?\nAccording to the latest available data from WTO, in 2020, Brazil imported USD 166 billion and exported USD 209 billion in goods, while in services the country imported USD 47 billion and exported USD 27 billion. As a result, trade balance of goods and services amounted to USD 11,7 billion.\nWhat is Brazil main export?\nIn 2019, Brazil most exported products were soybean and crude oil or bituminous mineral oils, reaching an export value of 26.1 billion U.S. dollars and 24.2 billion dollars, respectively. Iron ore and its concentrates was Brazil third most exported product, with 22.7 billion U.S. dollars worth of exports.\nWhy does Brazil have an advantage in trade?\nWhy is Brazil’s economy closed to trade?\nThe cause of Brazil’s closed economy is the lack of trade dynamism at a company level. The characteristic of exporting companies in Brazil makes the lack of trade more apparent. There are fewer than 20,000 exporters in Brazil, roughly same as Norway. In comparison to larger countries, Brazil is an outlier.\nIs Brazil a closed or open economy?\nBrazil imports the least amount of goods—when measured as a portion of the gross domestic product (GDP)—in the world and is the world’s most closed economy. In Brazil, only the largest and most efficient companies with significant economies of scale can overcome barriers to export.\nWhat are some examples of trade restrictions?\nSome examples of trade restrictions include tariffs, quotas and subsidies. Such restrictions serve economic and political purposes, but often have consequences as well.\nWhy do Nations impose trade restrictions?\nWhy nations impose trade restrictions. Sometimes the imports are used as raw materials or components by some domestic manufacturers who welcome them in order to reduce their own costs of production. Reduced costs of production result in manufacturing products which are competitive in foreign markets.\nWhat are the different types of trade restrictions?\nThe main types of trade restrictions are tariffs, quotas, embargoes, licensing requirements, standards, and subsidies. A tariff is a tax put on goods imported from abroad. The effect of a tariff is to raise the price of the imported product. It helps domestic producers of similar products to sell them at higher prices.\nWhat are examples of trade barriers?\nThe most common examples of a trade barrier are government imposed economic barriers such as tariffs or quotas. Depending on the type of trade barrier imposed, various industries may be discouraged from offering their goods and services for sale on international markets, or refrain from purchasing international products for sale within the country.","COVID-19 has added a new layer of complexity for businesses across the world. It has threatened our health and safety and our livelihoods, as companies plunged almost overnight into totally uncharted territory.\nThe crisis will likely affect all aspects of business from how and where goods are sourced, to where they are bought and sold, to where work gets done, and to how it gets done.\nGovernments have also have injected billions of dollars into their economies and temporarily relaxed rules to reduce the business burden. TMF Group, a leading provider of international business administration services, has found 1,114 COVID-related individual government support programs available to companies worldwide. This represents a vast range of possible help for multinational firms – but processing and dealing with such volume is a complicated task.\nAs the global economy begins to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis, there is evidence that many companies will respond with international expansion. In a recent survey conducted on U.S. business leaders, more than a third (36 percent) of respondents replied that the experience had accelerated their plans for international growth. And when firms move abroad, they again face complexity. No jurisdiction is alike, so multinationals need to master a complex web of regulations, processes, and conventions to succeed.\nTo help navigate a diverse and rapidly evolving global business environment, TMF Group has published a report on business complexity. The Global Business Complexity Index ranks 77 jurisdictions according to the ease of doing business. The ranking is based in part on in-depth interviews with TMF’s experts in each of the jurisdictions. The surveys focused on three areas of business operations: accounting and tax; rules, regulations and penalties; and human resources and payroll.\nWhile the consequences of COVID-19 for business rules and international trade are unclear, the report highlights issues that companies should consider when weighing foreign investments or allocating resources among global operations. Even before the pandemic, companies had their work cut out to operate safely within increasingly complex financial, regulatory, and employment rules for doing business.\nBusinesses must contend with both global and local forces while striving to be successful, and among the widespread and rapidly changing trends are the accelerating growth of technology and the focus on cross-border compliance. What’s more, individual jurisdictions have very particular ways of doing things that can be potentially costly — to multinational corporations.\nIndonesia emerged as the most complex jurisdiction. Businesses are attracted to the country’s large population of 260 million and abundant natural resources, but there are numerous barriers to doing business there. TMF Group found that restrictive laws limiting foreign ownership and protecting workers are the biggest obstacles. The government, though, is taking steps to liberalize its economy, including deregulation and tax incentives for investments in special economic zones.\nSimilar challenges arise in South America, five of the ten most complex countries: Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador. For example, Brazil has dozens of tax regimes spread over federal, state, and municipal layers of government, different rules for international versus local companies, and employment laws that can heavily favor the rights of employees compared with employers.\nAt the other end of the spectrum sits the United States, the second-least complex business environment for multinationals. TMF Group highlighted a few factors key to the U.S. business-friendly environment:\n● Its rules and regulations are stable and clearly stated, publicly available, and prone to sudden change or stringent check-ups. By and large, the U.S. economy operates on the assumption that companies are complying.\n● Audits of financial statements are only legally required relative to publicly traded companies — compared with China and many other large economies, which still place a heavy administrative burden on multinationals relative to verifying compliance.\n● It offers streamlined tax and accounting administration, as well as ease of hiring and firing employees.\nOffshore financial centers, such as Curacao, the Cayman Islands, and the British Virgin Islands, also fared well. But they are becoming more complicated for businesses as they respond to public pressure to enact stricter rules and supervision related to tax transparency, money laundering, and beneficial ownership\nAttractive destinations for foreign investment in Europe — Ireland and the Netherlands — also were among the least-complex jurisdictions.\nOverall, TMF Group found that a global outlook, alignment of international laws and regulations, and increasing deployment of technology have given rise to a greater synergy in international business. These factors have combined to make jurisdictions less complicated for multinational companies.\nThe report also underscores that nations that want to attract foreign investment and create business-friendly environments have to find the right balance between three significant, broad trends:\nInternationalism Vs. Localism\nExpanding operations into new territories around the world offers substantial commercial opportunities. Governments are continuing to open up to international business by improving the processes for assimilating them into their local economies, sometimes through offering incentives. However, jurisdictions vary in their success at creating a more comfortable environment for foreign direct investment.\nModernization Vs. Tradition\nModernization is, broadly, about demonstrating a commitment to international standards and practices, whereas tradition is reflected in localized barriers to smooth operation. Some governments hold on to many traditions, whether they are actual laws or only standard practices. Such traditions make it more difficult for companies to operate because:\n● they add to business complexity, as they are usually out of date and do not fit into the modern world, and\n● they embody idiosyncrasies, which can add to the costs of what legislation demands of companies.\nTechnology Vs. Simplification\nFor a new jurisdiction to appeal to international business, it has to adopt new technology. However, this can lead to an initial spike in complexity as jurisdictions struggle to adapt to new digitized systems while trying to bridge the gap between paper and online solutions.\nThe business environment increasingly relies on the latest technology to run full throttle in a global economy. The least complicated jurisdictions have used information and communications technology to enhance their compliance mechanisms so that setting up and operating a business becomes much more manageable. Unification, technology, modernization, and simplification will be drivers that can help set the post-pandemic global economy back on its feet, allowing businesses to act in response to complexity in their markets more effectively."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dbc9b23b-7ebd-4e05-8657-cff1b4cf960e>","<urn:uuid:6ef07572-47a1-4306-a1b0-b2c6eb1522da>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences in management between twin-twin transfusion syndrome and cervical insufficiency?","answer":"Twin-twin transfusion syndrome, occurring in monochorionic diamniotic twins, is treated with selective fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (SFLP), where a fetoscope locates and seals abnormal blood vessel connections in the placenta.

When fetal intervention is required, patients can come here with confidence knowing we are accustomed to treating the most complex fetal abnormalities and pregnancies.\nProcedures are performed in our state-of-the-art operating facilities at Texas Children’s Pavilion for Women, specially designed and equipped for fetal surgery and other interventions. If needed, your baby will have immediate access to Texas Children’s level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) – the highest level of care available for premature and critically-ill newborns.\nConditions treated include:\nOpen Fetal Surgery for Sacrococcygeal Teratoma and Vascular Tumors\nFor fetuses with sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) or large vascular tumors, the fetal heart may have to work harder to supply blood to the tumors and the rest of the body. Fetal surgery to remove the tumor(s) may be needed to prevent hydrops, or heart failure in the fetus.\nOpen Fetal Surgery for Lung Masses/CPAM\nWhile most fetuses with lung masses, known as congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAM), do not require treatment before birth, in rare cases, open fetal surgery may be required to remove the mass and prevent life-threatening complications.\nOpen and In-Utero Repair of Spina Bifida\nWe perform open fetal surgery and fetoscopic repair for select fetuses with severe spina bifida, for improved outcomes compared to after-birth repair. In 2014, Texas Children’s performed the nation’s first experimental fetoscopic closure of an open neural tube defect (NTD). As of December 2020, our Fetal Center has performed more than 85 successful fetoscopic repairs of NTD.\nFetal Cardiac Intervention\nFetal cardiac surgery is performed to repair a serious congenital heart defect before the baby is born, for improved outcomes at birth. These procedures are a coordinated effort involving a large team of specialists including maternal-fetal medicine experts, fetal cardiologists and congenital heart surgeons, among many others.\n- Balloon Atrial Septostomy for Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS)\n- Balloon Dilation of Aortic Valve for HLHS\nEx-Utero Intrapartum Treatment (EXIT)\nEx-utero intrapartum treatment, or the “EXIT procedure,” is performed at the time of delivery via a scheduled C-section. The procedure is used to deliver fetuses with conditions expected to cause severe breathing difficulties at birth, such as large lung masses that affect lung function or giant neck masses that block the fetal airway.\nSelective Fetoscopic Laser Photocoagulation (SFLP) for Twin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome\nThis procedure is used for the treatment of select, severe cases of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). A small camera, known as a fetoscope, is used to locate abnormal blood vessel connections in the placenta and seal those connections using laser energy, stopping the transfer of blood between fetuses.\nFetal Endoscopic Tracheal Occlusion (FETO) for Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia\nTexas Children’s is one of the few fetal centers in the nation to offer FETO, an experimental procedure used in severe cases of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) to improve lung growth before birth. The procedure involves inserting a tiny balloon into the fetal trachea to block the flow of fluid out of the fetal lungs, causing the fluid to accumulate and inflate the underdeveloped lungs.\nAmniotic Band Resection\nAmniotic band resection is a fetal surgery used to treat severe cases of amniotic band syndrome (ABS), where thin bands of tissue are wrapped around parts of the developing fetus, causing deformities and in some cases life-threatening complications. In this procedure, a laser is used to cut the bands that are endangering the fetus, freeing the constricted body part(s) and preventing further damage.\nFetal Shunt Placement\nIn this procedure, a hollow tube or “shunt” is inserted through the mother’s abdomen and uterus into the fetus to drain excess fluid from an area of the fetal body. It is most commonly used for fetuses with lower urinary tract obstructions (LUTO), with the shunt placed in the fetal bladder to drain blocked urine out into the amniotic cavity.\nIn severe cases of fetal anemia (low red blood cell count), this intervention is used to transfuse red blood cells from a donor to the fetus to prevent or treat fetal heart failure (hydrops). Guided by ultrasound, a needle is inserted through the mother’s abdomen and into the umbilical cord or the fetal abdomen where the red blood cells are injected.\nRadio Frequency Ablation (RFA) or Umbilical Coagulation for Complicated Monochorionic Pregnancies\nThis is a rare, highly selective fetal intervention that uses radio frequency waves or bipolar energy to interrupt blood flow to a severely abnormal twin (who has no chance of survival) to save the life of a coexisting normal twin. The procedure may be used, for example, in an extremely rare condition known as TRAP sequence, when the normal twin is in imminent danger.\nFor more information or to schedule an appointment,\ncall Texas Children’s Fetal Center at 832-822-2229 or 1-877-FetalRx (338-2579) toll-free.\nOur phones are answered 24/7.

{"question":"How do the treatment approaches differ between cancer-related fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness?","answer":"The treatment approaches for cancer-related fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness differ significantly. Cancer-related fatigue is treated through blood transfusions for anemia, infection treatment if applicable, nutritional advice and supplements, maintaining adequate fluid intake, counseling for depression and anxiety, and joining support groups. Management also includes lifestyle adjustments like taking short naps, keeping regular sleep patterns, and engaging in light exercise. For excessive daytime sleepiness, treatment focuses on stimulant medications like modafinil to increase alertness, sodium oxybate to improve sleep quality, and antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications to reduce sleep disruption. Lifestyle changes for EDS include regular exercise, reducing caffeine consumption, establishing consistent sleep schedules, avoiding alcohol and large meals before bedtime, and creating a comfortable sleep environment.","context":["Fatigue is not like ‘normal’ tiredness. It is extreme tiredness that does not go away when you rest or after sleep.\nWhat is fatigue?\nFatigue is not like ‘normal’ tiredness. It is extreme tiredness that does not go away when you rest or after sleep. People have described fatigue as ‘being drained of energy’ or that ‘sitting up was sometimes too much of an effort’. Fatigue is the most common symptom experienced by cancer patients. Many studies have found that most of the patient’s experience fatigue. It is one of the most overlooked and under-treated side effects of cancer.\nFatigue is a difficult thing to measure. Research suggests that up to 9 out of 10 people with cancer are affected. It is one of the most common symptoms that people with lymphoma report. Cancer-related fatigue can be mild, or it can be severe. It is not known why some people suffer from fatigue more than others.\nFatigue may be tied to several factors:\n- The lymphoma itself putting a strain on the body\n- Emotional impact of cancer diagnosis and treatment\n- Pain from the lymphoma or surgery\n- Anaemia (low red blood cells)\n- Changes in hormone levels and proteins that regulate inflammatory processes can lead to increased levels of fatigue\nWhat are the symptoms of fatigue?\nThere are many different symptoms that fatigue can cause that include:\n- Simple chores seem overwhelming\n- You feel as if you have no energy and could spend whole day in bed\n- Waking up tired after a full night’s sleep\n- Feeling sluggish or slow\n- Trouble thinking and making decisions\n- Impaired concentration\n- Mental fog\n- Breathless after only light activity\n- Loss of sex drive\n- You feel sad, frustrated, or upset\n- Feelings of isolation\n- Tiredness disrupts your work, social life, or daily routine\nHow to cope with fatigue?\nFatigue can affect many activities and daily living. There are some things that can help:\n- Take several short naps and breaks during the day\n- Try to keep a regular sleep pattern each night.

A Dietitian will give some advice to help with nutrition and calories. Iron and B12 supplements may also be given.\n- Maintaining adequate fluid intake to flush through toxins and waste products that can also cause fatigue\n- Counselling to help with depression and anxiety\n- Find a support group\nOlivia Warner, OT, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre","What is excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)?\nExcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common problem that affects both adults and children. It occurs when a person experiences an overwhelming urge to sleep during the day, despite having had a full night’s sleep. A variety of medical conditions can cause EDS, including sleep apnea, depression, narcolepsy, and sleep deprivation, as well as lifestyle choices such as alcohol or drug use. It can also be a side effect of certain medications.\nCauses of EDS\nDaytime sleepiness is a condition that can undermine a person’s quality of life. While occasional episodes of daytime sleepiness are normal, chronic EDS can have serious underlying causes.\nOne of the most common causes of excessive daytime sleepiness is not getting enough sleep at night. The average adult needs between 7-9 hours of sleep every night, but many people do not get enough. Sleep deprivation can cause a wide range of symptoms, including daytime sleepiness.\nAnother common cause of daytime sleepiness is sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a condition in which a person’s breathing is interrupted while they are sleeping. This can lead to poor quality sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness.\nPoor sleep hygiene can also lead to excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep hygiene refers to habits and activities that promote better sleep. Poor sleep hygiene can include things like drinking caffeine late in the day, using electronic devices in bed, and eating an enormous meal before bed.\nMedications can also cause excessive daytime sleepiness. Many medications, including sedatives and antihistamines, can cause drowsiness. It is important to talk to a doctor before taking any medication, as some medications can have serious side effects.\nNumerous medical conditions can cause excessive daytime sleepiness. Conditions such as narcolepsy, thyroid problems, and depression can all cause symptoms of daytime sleepiness.\nSymptoms of EDS\nThe most common symptom of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness is a powerful urge to sleep during the day, even when one has had enough sleep the night before. This can lead to difficulty in concentrating and an inability to focus on tasks.\nOther symptoms include:\n- difficulty in waking up in the morning,\n- feeling tired and sluggish throughout the day,\n- and difficulty in staying awake for extended periods of time.\nDaytime napping is another symptom of EDS, as well as having difficulty in waking up from naps. People with EDS may also experience feelings of irritability, depression, and anxiety because of their lack of sleep.\nLifestyle changes can be an efficient way to reduce excessive daytime sleepiness. These changes include getting regular exercise, reducing caffeine consumption, establishing regular sleep and wake times, avoiding alcohol and other drugs, and avoiding huge meals and arduous exercise close to bedtime. Creating a comfortable sleep environment, such as keeping the bedroom dark, cool and quiet, can help to promote a restful sleep. Medication can also treat EDS.\nStimulant medications, such as modafinil, are commonly prescribed to increase alertness and reduce fatigue. Other medications, such as sodium oxybate, are used to improve the quality of sleep. In addition, medications such as antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications can help to reduce sleep disruption and improve sleep quality.\nWhen treating excessive daytime sleepiness, it is important to talk to a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action. Depending on the severity of the condition, lifestyle changes and/or medication may be necessary. It is also important to note that lifestyle changes may take several weeks to take effect, while medications may take several days to become effective.\nWith the right combination of lifestyle changes and medication, we can manage excessive daytime sleepiness.\nExcessive daytime sleepiness can have serious implications for an individual’s physical, mental, and emotional well-being. It can lead to impaired concentration and memory, mood swings, and a decrease in productivity. It can also be a sign of an underlying sleep disorder or medical condition, so it’s important to address the issue and seek professional help as soon as possible. With proper diagnosis and treatment, EDSs can be managed and even eliminated.\n- NCBI – WWW Error Blocked Diagnostic. (n.d.). https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33840518/\n- Pacheco, D. (2022, June 10).

{"question":"How do X-rays compare to solar radiation in terms of their energy and health effects?","answer":"X-rays and solar radiation are both types of electromagnetic radiation, but with different properties. X-rays have much shorter wavelengths than visible light and are ionizing radiation that can be damaging, requiring protection for staff and patients in medical settings. The Sun is the most important source of electromagnetic waves on Earth and provides virtually all energy supporting life, though its radiation includes various types of waves across the electromagnetic spectrum. While X-rays can penetrate opaque materials and are used for medical imaging, precautions must be taken due to their ionizing properties.","context":["This GCSE Medical Physics quiz will challenge you on X-rays. X-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation. X-rays were discovered in 1895 by William Roentgen by accident whilst he was experimenting with vacuum tubes. He noticed that a screen he used for a different experiment was glowing, even though there was no visible light hitting it. He carried out some experiments over a period of several weeks, to find out more of the properties of the newly-discovered rays and to ensure that his results were reliable before finally announcing his discovery at the end of December. He used the term X-rays because he had no idea what they were and adopted the mathematical idea of using the letter 'x' to denote an unknown quantity. During the course of his experiments, he took the very first X-ray photograph - it shows the bones of his wife's hand who said 'I have seen my own death'. His work earned him the very first Nobel Prize in physics (1901).\nWithin a year of Roentgen's discovery, the Glasgow Royal Infirmary had set up a radiology department and was producing X-ray images of things like a penny stuck in a child's throat and kidney stones. X-rays were also used during the Boer War and First World War to locate exactly where bones had been broken and the site of embedded shrapnel and bullets. In the early 1900s, the damaging properties of X-rays were already being used to fight cancers and skin diseases but it was eventually realised that this was ionising radiation and precautions needed to be taken to protect staff and patients from receiving dangerously high doses.\nNow we have come to understand a lot about how X-rays work and how we can utilise them to our advantage. Protection for radiographers (the people who operate the X-ray machines), and allowed safe levels for patients, are well established. The invention of computers has enabled complex machines like Computer Axial Tomography (CAT) scanners to be built. These have an X-ray generator that is mounted in such a way that it can be moved right round the body. It takes X-ray images as it moves and a computer converts the data to three-dimensional images of the inside of the body. Roentgen had used a fluorescent screen in his first experiments which provided 'live' images rather than a photograph. This technique is still used and is now called 'fluoroscopy'. It is often used to examine patients with digestive system problems.\nX-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation that has a much shorter wavelength than visible light. They have the properties of being able to leave an image on photographic film, to be able to pass through opaque solids and they have a range of frequencies - the lower frequencies carry lower energies and are less ionising and less penetrating. More dense materials allow fewer X-rays to pass through so they appear lighter on images whereas less dense materials like skin allow almost all the X-rays through and appear darker.","In electromagnetic waves, the amplitude is the maximum field strength of the electric and magnetic fields ((Figure)). The wave energy is determined by the wave amplitude.

{"question":"What are the core capabilities of deep learning in processing unstructured data, and what risks does this create for generating deceptive content?","answer":"Deep learning excels at handling unstructured data like images, videos, and natural language, enabling applications in image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. These algorithms can autonomously learn to identify and extract features from large datasets to recognize complex patterns. However, this same capability has led to concerning applications in deepfake creation, where AI can generate highly realistic synthetic media that appears authentic but is fake. Through technologies like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), these systems can create lifelike images of non-existent people or manipulate existing media, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish real from artificial content. This has serious implications for spreading disinformation online and has already resulted in real-world impacts, such as when fake AI-generated images caused market fluctuations or went viral on social media.","context":["Deep learning is an advanced subset of machine learning, a current and ever-evolving field of technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with and understand the world around us. In recent years, deep learning has gained significant traction, becoming a widely discussed and utilized technology in a variety of industries and applications.\nAt its core, deep learning is a complex algorithmic approach to building and training artificial neural network architectures. These networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, with interconnected nodes, or neurons, that work together to process and interpret data patterns. Through the use of these neural networks, deep learning algorithms can autonomously learn to identify and extract features from large datasets, enabling them to recognize and understand complex patterns and make accurate predictions or decisions.\nOne of the key strengths of deep learning lies in its ability to handle unstructured data, such as images, videos, and natural language. This makes it particularly well-suited for applications like image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and even autonomous vehicles. For example, deep learning algorithms powering self-driving cars can process visual input from cameras and sensors to quickly and accurately identify objects, pedestrians, and potential hazards in real-time, enabling the vehicle to make split-second decisions to ensure safety.\nThe breadth of potential applications for deep learning is vast and diverse. In healthcare, deep learning algorithms can be used to analyze medical images, diagnose diseases, and predict patient outcomes. In finance, they can help detect fraudulent transactions and make investment recommendations. In marketing, they can analyze customer behavior and preferences to personalize product recommendations. In manufacturing, they can optimize production processes and predict equipment failures. The possibilities are virtually endless, and as the technology continues to mature, we can expect to see even more innovative and impactful applications emerge.\nOne of the most significant recent developments in the field of deep learning is the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs). GANs are a type of neural network architecture consisting of two networks – a generator and a discriminator – that work together to produce realistic synthetic data. This has huge implications for tasks like image and video synthesis, where GANs can be used to create lifelike images of non-existent people, places, or objects, or even produce deepfake videos that are nearly indistinguishable from real footage. While the ethical considerations of this technology are complex, it’s an exciting testament to the power and potential of deep learning.\nIn addition to its practical applications, deep learning also presents a number of challenges and considerations. One of the most significant challenges is the need for vast amounts of labeled training data to effectively train deep neural networks. As a result, sourcing and curating high-quality datasets is a critical step in the deep learning process. Additionally, deep learning models are often large and computationally intensive, requiring significant computational resources to train and deploy. This can be a barrier for smaller organizations or research groups with limited resources.\nPrivacy and security are also major concerns when it comes to the widespread adoption of deep learning. As deep learning algorithms become more adept at processing and interpreting personal data, there is an increased risk of privacy breaches and misuse. It’s essential for organizations to implement robust data protection measures and ensure transparency in their use of AI-driven technologies to maintain user trust and compliance with regulations.\nDespite these challenges, the continued growth and advancement of deep learning hold immense promise for the future of technology and society as a whole. With ongoing research and innovation, we can expect to see even more sophisticated deep learning models that push the boundaries of what is possible and drive new breakthroughs in fields like healthcare, finance, education, and beyond.\nIn conclusion, deep learning is a foundational technology with far-reaching implications. Its ability to process, analyze, and interpret complex data is driving significant advancements in a wide range of industries and applications. As the technology continues to evolve, it’s important for organizations and researchers to remain mindful of the ethical and practical considerations that come with harnessing the power of deep learning.\nRecent news in the field of deep learning includes the release of OpenAI’s GPT-3, the third generation of their groundbreaking language prediction model. GPT-3 represents a significant leap forward in natural language processing and understanding, with the ability to generate human-like text and perform a wide range of language-based tasks, such as writing essays, answering questions, and even writing code. While the technology has generated excitement and intrigue, it has also sparked discussions around responsible AI use and the potential consequences of highly advanced language models in the wrong hands.\nThis recent development serves as a testament to the rapid pace of advancement in deep learning and the potential for profound impacts on how we communicate and interact with technology. As deep learning continues to progress, it’s critical for researchers, developers, and policymakers to collaborate on establishing ethical guidelines and standards for the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies. By doing so, we can ensure that the potential of deep learning is harnessed for the collective benefit of society, while minimizing risks and vulnerabilities.","As the technology behind generative artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance, so too does the potential for its misuse. One particularly concerning application of this technology is the creation of deepfakes, which are increasingly being used to spread disinformation online.\nWith deepfakes becoming not only easier and cheaper to produce but more realistic and harder to determine if they’re fake, the potential for them to be used for malicious purposes is growing rapidly.\nIn recent months there have been a number of instances of deepfakes have been created using generative AI. Some are done for fun and others are created for more malicious purposes.\nFake news online is already a huge issue which has led to serious concerns about the authenticity of digital media and its impact on public discourse and democracy. With generative AI this trend will only worsen as new AI tools continue to develop and made available to anyone.\nThis should bring concerns about deepfakes to the forefront of public discussions, and raises serious questions: What is the impact of AI, deepfakes and disinformation, and what is the significance of deepening commercialisation in AI and deepfake technology? We already know that AI will impact PR significantly but as a net benefit and there is an increasing list of AI tools for PR but what about the tools that can be used to cause disinformation?\nIn this article, we will explore the ways in which generative AI technology is fueling the spread of deepfakes, causing harm to the public discourse and the potential consequences of this trend for our society.\nFirst, it’s best to clarify what generative AI and deepfakes are.\nWhat is Generative AI?\nGenerative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence, in which a machine is capable of creating new data or content, such as images, sound files, and even digital art. This kind of AI is referred to as “generative” because it can generate new data that is unique and original, as opposed to simply processing or analyzing existing data.\nGenerative AI systems are designed to learn from patterns and data sets, enabling them to make predictions and create new content that is similar to what they have learned.\nThis approach can be compared to the way humans learn and create, as it enables machines to work with creative uncertainty and come up with something new. Examples of applications for generative AI include creating unique artworks, generating realistic images and generating text and articles.\nThe two most popular generative AI models are:\n- Transformer-based models — AI such as GPT that uses information gathered from the internet to create text-based content from articles to press releases to whitepapers\n- Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs — AI that creates images and multimedia using input from both imagery and text\nGANs tend to pose the most risk when it comes to generating disinformation with deepfakes because they can create highly realistic images that can be difficult to tell they were created by an AI.\nAI tools used to generate deepfakes\nMidjourney is a GAN AI that has been developed for generating high-quality images. This AI algorithm employs a combination of neural networks to create realistic images of objects, people, and even landscapes.\nDall-e from OpenAI is a GAN that can generate unique images from textual inputs. It was named after the surrealist artist Salvador Dali and the movie character Wall-E. Dall-e is trained on a large dataset of images and can generate a wide range of images, from realistic to abstract, based on textual prompts.\nStable Diffusion is a GAN that has been developed to generate realistic images and videos. The key feature of Stable Diffusion is its ability to stabilize the transition between two different states of the image; for example, it can smoothly transition from an image of a person with their eyes closed to an image with their eyes open.\nWhat are deepfakes?\nDeepfakes are a form of digital forgery that use artificial intelligence and machine learning to generate realistic images, videos, or audio recordings that appear to be authentic but are actually fake. These manipulated media files are created by superimposing one person’s face onto another’s body or by altering the voice, facial expressions, and body movements of a person in a video.\nWith the advancements in deep learning algorithms, it has become easier to create deepfakes, which can be used to spread misinformation, propaganda, or to defame someone. Deepfakes can be created using open-source software or customised tools and can be easily spread due to the viral nature of social media.\nExamples of deep fakes created by generative AI\nIn recent months we’ve seen a number of deepfake examples created by generative AI going viral in social media. The imagery created by this technology is so realistic it’s fooled millions of people around the world. Some recent deepfake examples are listed below.\nThe pope in a Balenciaga-styled puffa jacket\nIn March 2023, a photo of Pope Francis looking ‘dripped out’ in a white puffer jacket went viral on social media. The 86-year-old sitting looked like he had been given a custom-made puffa jacket by Balenciaga. The image was shared far and wide and covered in numerous publications. But there was just one problem: The image was a deepfake created in Midjourney.\nA leaked photo of Julian Assage looking unwell in prison\nAgain in March 2023, an apparently leaked photo of Wikileaks founder, Julian Assage, was shared far and wide on social media. People who believe the photo was genuine posted their outrage but a German newspaper interviewed the person who created the image who claims he did it to protest how Assange has been treated. Although critics pointed out that creating fake news was not the appropriate method of doing so. Another deepfake example that transcended online to off.\nTrump getting arrested\nAgain in March 2023 (which, looking back, was a big month for deepfake examples), AI-generated images of Donald Trump being arrested were circulating online. This particular deepfake was created by not just one individual but many. This particular deepfake didn’t fool as many of the other two examples but some people were duped and shared them on social media believing they were real.\nThe Pentagon bombed\nIn May this year, an AI-generated deepfake image of a bomb at the Pentagon exploding went viral on Twitter and causes US markets to plummet. The S&P 500 stock index fell 30 points in minutes resulting in $500 billion wiped off its market cap. After the image was certified as fake the markets rebounded but it showed the impact that deepfakes can cause. Certified accounts on Twitter didn’t help the situation either as many of them shared the image as if it was real and were rightfully criticised for it.\nDeSantis campaign shares deepfakes of Trump\nExperts identified the use of AI-generated deepfakes in an attack ad against rival Donald Trump by the campaign endorsing Ron DeSantis as the Republican presidential nominee in 2024.\nOn June 5th, the “DeSantis War Room” Twitter account shared a video that highlighted Trump’s endorsement of Anthony Fauci, the former White House chief medical advisor and a key figure in the US response to COVID-19. In right-wing politics Fauci has garnered significant opposition, and the intention of the attack ad is to strengthen DeSantis’ support base by portraying Trump and Fauci as close collaborators.\nAn artist named Justin T. Brown who created AI-generated images of politicians cheating on their spouses to highlight the potential dangers of AI. Brown’s intention was to initiate a conversation about the misuse of AI technology. He shared the images on the Midjourney subreddit, but soon after, he was banned from the platform. Brown expressed conflicting feelings about the ban, acknowledging the need for accountability but questioning the effectiveness of regulating content.\nTo give you an idea of the incredible creativity in deepfakes, this TED discussion with AI developer, Tom Graham, provides an overview of the existing deepfake technology available and where it’s heading.\nTom’s company, Metaphysic, gained popularity with the release of a fake Tom Cruise video that received billions of views on TikTok and Instagram. They specialise in creating artificially generated content that looks and feels like reality by using real-world data and training neural nets. This is more accurate than VFX or CGI and helps create content that appears natural.\nOne of their examples includes transporting the singing voice of a woman singing in Spanish to Aloe Blacc’s face, making it look and sound as if he’s singing in Spanish. This technology could eventually allow anyone to speak any language naturally, and creating such content will become easier over time.\nMetaphysic is also capable of processing live video in real-time, which is at the cutting edge of AI technology. They demonstrate this by replacing the interviewers face with Chris’s in a live video, and even replicating the voice. They can apply this technology to anyone, as demonstrated with Sunny Bates in the audience.\nHow to combat AI-generated deepfakes\nEfforts are being made to develop technologies to detect and prevent deepfakes, but their effectiveness remains limited as the technology continues to evolve rapidly.\nOne way to combat AI-generated deepfakes is through the development of advanced detection technologies.

{"question":"How did historical immigration patterns influence the development of Louisiana's regional cuisines, and what role did spice blends play in shaping their distinctive characteristics?","answer":"Historical immigration significantly shaped Louisiana's regional cuisines through multiple waves of settlers. The Creoles emerged from European aristocrats in New Orleans in the 1690s, with influences from French, Spanish, German, Italian, African, and Native American cultures, each contributing unique ingredients and cooking methods. The Cajuns arrived as exiled French refugees from Nova Scotia in 1755, developing their cuisine based on local ingredients and survival techniques. These distinct historical paths are reflected in their seasoning traditions - Creole seasoning became associated specifically with New Orleans cuisine, incorporating various cultural influences, while Cajun cooking developed its own distinctive flavoring profiles through adaptation to local ingredients. The spice traditions continue to distinguish these cuisines, with Creole seasoning being more variable in composition while maintaining certain essential components that reflect its multicultural heritage.","context":["to beginning our adventure into the cuisines of South Louisiana, it\nis imperative that I begin by outlining the basic principles, procedures\nand terminologies that are unique to Cajun and Creole cookery.\nIt is important to realize that cultures and cuisines must constantly\nevolve. This evolution process is brought about when new ingredients\nand ideas are introduced into a region. Here in South Louisiana,\nthe evolution process may be witnessed at every turn. The Cajuns\ntoday have more access to the outside world because of increased\nmobility and as interstates began to cross the bayous, cities arose\nfrom our swamplands. An example of this process of change is the\nmerging of cultures in New Orleans.\nToday it is difficult even for the locals to tell the Cajuns from\nthe Creoles. However, we all agree that evolution is imperative,\nif our cultures and cuisines are to survive.\nThough we will look into this evolution of Louisiana cuisines,\nI feel it is necessary to first understand from whence it came.\nKnowing the foundation of Cajun and Creole cooking will ensure a\nclear understanding of the direction we have chosen to take.\nAs the young chefs of America travel into\nthe bayous of South Louisiana and walk the French Market area of\nNew Orleans, their creative juices cannot help but flow. The volumes\nof crawfish, crab, shrimp, oysters, wild game and other local ingredients\nlend themselves perfectly to the evolution process at the hands\nof these young masters. So for a moment, let's look into the past.\nThis certainly will place a bright spotlight on the future of our\nmagnificent cuisine, a cuisine constantly evolving for the better\nin South Louisiana.\nThe Cajun and Creole cultures are quite distinct\nand so are their cuisines. The Creoles were the offspring born in\nNew Orleans of the European aristocrats, wooed by the Spanish to\nestablish New Orleans in the early 1690s. Second-born sons, who\ncould not own land or titles in their native countries, were offered\nthe opportunity to live and prosper in their family traditions here\nin the New World. It is believed the word Creole can be traced to\none of two origins. First, the old Spanish word \"Criallo\"\nmeaning a mixture of cultures or color such as in the word Crayola.\nSecondly, from the Latin word \"Creare\" meaning to create\nas in creating a new race. Although the first Creoles were documented\nin Mobile, Alabama in 1702, Natchitoches and New Orleans followed\nin 1714 and 1718 respectively. Today, the term Creole in New Orleans\nrepresents the native born children of the intermarriage of the\nearly cultures settling the city. These include the Native American,\nFrench, Spanish, English, African, German and Italian and further\ndefines the cuisine that came from this intermarriage.\nThe influences of classical and regional French, Spanish, German\nand Italian cooking are readily apparent in Creole cuisine. The\nterminologies, precepts, sauces and major dishes were carried over,\nsome with more evolution than others, and provided a solid foundation\nfor Creole cooking.\nBouillabaisse is a soup that came from the Provence region of France\nin and around Marseilles. This dish is integral to the history of\nCreole food because of the part it played in the creation of gumbo.\nThe Spanish, who actually played host to this new adventure, gave\nCreole food its spice, many great cooks and paella, which was the\nforefather of Louisiana's jambalaya. Paella is the internationally\nfamous Spanish rice dish made with vegetables, meats and sausages.\nOn the coastline, seafoods were often substituted for meats. Jambalaya\nhas variations as well, according to the local ingredients available\nat different times of the year.\nThe Germans who arrived in Louisiana in 1725 were knowledgeable\nin all forms of charcuterie and helped establish the boucherie and\nfine sausage making in South Louisiana. They brought with them not\nonly pigs, but chicken and cattle as well. A good steady supply\nof milk and butter was seldom available in South Louisiana prior\nto the arrival of the Germans.\nThe Italians were famous for their culinary talents. They were\nsummoned to France by Catherine de Medicis to teach their pastry\nand ice cream making skills to Europeans. Many Creole dishes reflect\nthe Italian influence and their love of good cooking.\nFrom the West Indies and the smoke pots of Haiti came exotic vegetables\nand cooking methods. Braising, a slow-cooking technique, contributed\nto the development of our gumbos. Mirlitons, sauce piquantes and\nthe use of tomato rounded out the emerging Creole cuisine.\nNative Indians, the Choctaws, Chetimaches and Houmas, befriended\nthe new settlers and introduced them to local produce, wildlife\nand cooking methods. New ingredients, such as corn, ground sassafras\nleaves or filé powder and bay leaves from the laurel tree\nall contributed to the culinary melting pot.\nI would be remiss if I failed to mention the tremendous influence\nof \"the black hand in the pot\" in Creole cooking. The\nAfricans brought with them the \"kin gumbo\" or okra plant\nfrom their native soil which not only gave name to our premier soup,\nbut introduced a new vegetable to South Louisiana. Even more importantly,\nAfrican Americans have maintained a significant role in development\nof Creole cuisine in the home as well as the professional kitchen.\nCreole cuisine is indebted to many unique people and diverse cultures\nwho were willing to contribute and share their cooking styles, ingredients\nand talent. Obviously, Creole cuisine represents the history of\nsharing in South Louisiana. Early on in the history of New Orleans,\nthe Creole wives became frustrated, not being able to duplicate\ntheir old world dishes with new world products. Governor Bienville\nhelped to solve this problem by commissioning his housekeeper, Madame\nLanglois, to introduce them to local vegetables, meats and seafoods\nin what became the first cooking school in America. This school\naided them in developing their cuisine in a new and strange land.\nCreole cuisine, then, is that melange of artistry and talent, developed\nand made possible by the nations and cultures who settled in and\naround New Orleans. Those of us who know and love it, keep it alive\nby sharing it with the world.\nThe cuisine of the Cajuns is a mirror image of their unique history.\nIt is a cooking style which reflects their ingenuity, creativity,\nadaptability and survival.\nWhen the exiled French refugees began arriving in South Louisiana\nfrom Acadia in Nova Scotia, Canada in 1755, they were already well-versed\nin the art of survival. Their forefathers had made a home in the\nwilderness of southeast Canada in the land of \"Acadie.\"\nFollowing their exile, these French Catholics found a new home compatible\nwith their customs and religion in South Louisiana.\nThe story of \"Le Grand Derangement\" is memorialized in\nthe epic poem EVANGELINE by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. This love\nstory tells of Gabriel and Evangeline, tragically torn apart when\n10,000 Acadians were gathered and driven from their homeland. It\ntook six days to burn the village of Grand Pre, and families were\ndivided and put aboard 24 British vessels anchored in the Bay of\nThe Acadians were forcibly dispersed, nearly half of them dying\nbefore a year had passed. Survivors landed in Massachusetts, Maryland,\nthe Carolinas, Georgia (where some were sold into slavery), the\nFrench West Indies, Santo Domingo, Uruguay, Nicaragua, Honduras\nand the Falkland Islands. The main tragedy is that the men were\nexiled first, to destinations unknown, with the women and children\nfollowing later. As time passed, the struggle to reunite these families,\nin most cases, proved futile.\nA large contingency of Acadians returned to the coastal seaports\nof France, their initial homeland, and eventually came to South\nLouisiana. Some were sent to England while others made their way\nback to \"Acadie\" to Sainte-Marie and settled on the French\nshore. Word rang out across Europe, Canada and South America that\nreunion with their husbands and fathers could be possible in the\nbayous of South Louisiana.\nAs wave after wave of the bedraggled refugees found their way to\nyet another land, the Acadians were reborn. In Louisiana, they were\nfree to speak their language, believe as they pleased and make a\nlife for themselves in the swamps and bayous of the French Triangle\nof South Louisiana. They were among friends, friends who enjoyed\nthe same \"joie de vivre\" or joy of living.\nJust as they had become such close friends with the Micmac Indians\nwhen they were isolated in the woodlands of Canada, so they befriended\nthe native Indians here in South Louisiana. Friends were quickly\nmade with the Spanish and Germans as well.\nThe original Acadian immigrants had come to Nova Scotia from France\nbeginning in 1620. They were primarily from Brittany, Normandy,\nPicardy and Poitou. These fishermen and farmers had learned how\nto adjust, survive and make a life for themselves in Acadie. Once\nagain, they were faced with the task of survival. Rugged as they\nwere, the Acadians learned to adapt to their new surroundings. Armed\nwith their black iron pots, the Cajuns, as they had come to be known,\nutilized what was indigenous to the area. No attempt was made to\nrecreate the classical cuisine of Europe. None of the exotic spices\nand ingredients available to the Creoles were to be found by the\nCajuns in Bayou country. They were happy to live off the land, a\nland abundant with fish, shellfish and wild game.\nThe Cajuns cooked with joy and love as their most precious ingredients,\na joy brought about by reunion, in spite of the tragedy that befell\nthem. To cook Cajun is to discover the love and experience the joy\nof the most unique American cuisine ever developed.\nCajun cuisine is characterized by the use of wild game, seafoods,\nwild vegetation and herbs. From their association with the Indians,\nthe Cajuns learned techniques to best utilize the local products\nfrom the swamps, bayous, lakes, rivers and woods. Truly remarkable\nare the variations that have resulted from similar ingredients carefully\ncombined in the black iron pots of the Cajuns.\nJambalaya, grillades, stews, fricassees, soups, gumbos, sauce piquantes\nand a host of stuffed vegetable dishes are all characteristic of\nthese new Cajun \"one pot meals.\"\nFrom the Germans, the Cajuns were reintroduced to charcuterie and\ntoday make andouille, smoked sausage, boudin, chaudin, tasso and\nchaurice, unparalleled in the world of sausage making.\nCajun cuisine is a \"table in the wilderness,\" a creative\nadaptation of indigenous Louisiana foods. It is a cuisine forged\nout of a land that opened its arms to a weary traveler, the Acadian.\nAnd so, South Louisiana has two rich histories and two unique cuisines:\nthe Creole cuisine with its rich array of courses indicating its\nclose tie to European aristocracy; and Cajun cuisine with its one\npot meals, pungent with the flavor of seafood and game.\nNo wonder you want to cook Cajun and Creole!\nChef John D. Folse CEC, AAC\n\"We may live without poetry, music and art;\nWe may live without conscience and live without heart;\nWe may live without friends, we may live without books;\nBut civilized man cannot live without cooks.\nHe may live without books, what is knowledge but grieving?\nHe may live without hope, what is hope but deceiving?\nHe may live without love, what is passion but pining?\nBut where is that man who can live without dining?\"","When it comes to American spice blends, it is difficult to find any that have become more ingrained in the nation’s food culture than Old Bay seasoning and Creole seasoning. Despite being from very different parts of the US, these blends have a lot in common. The question that many cooks might have is how similar are they to each other? If you are thinking about using one or the other, consider their respective properties in this SPICEography Showdown.\nHow does Old Bay differ from Creole seasoning?\nNo discussion of the difference between Old Bay seasoning and Creole seasoning would be legitimate without pointing out the fact that these spice blends both have specific regional origins. Old Bay seasoning belongs to Maryland and is arguably the most distinctive component of that state’s cuisine. Creole seasoning is from New Orleans is one of Louisiana’s most important spice blends.\nOld Bay seasoning is a specific trademarked blend owned by McCormick. It is made according to a precise recipe. Creole seasoning is a more generic term. While certain key ingredients are essential for a spice blend to be regarded as Creole seasoning, the proportions of those ingredients along with additional herbs and spices can vary significantly from cook to cook.\nCan you use Old Bay as a substitute for Creole seasoning and vice versa?\nOld Bay seasoning has some of the same ingredients that you will see in many Creole seasoning blends. One of the distinctive features of Old Bay seasoning is that it has many ingredients. Because of this, you can use it as a starting point in many different cuisines with Creole cuisine being one of them. The spices that it has in common with Creole seasoning are a good starting point if you are trying to replicate Creole seasoning’s flavor. You can build upon Old Bay’s foundation since it includes the celery seed and paprika that you will find in most Creole seasoning blends. Unless you add more of the spices used in Creole seasoning blends — like the previously mentioned celery seed and paprika — Old Bay will not be ideal as a Creole seasoning substitute.\nSimilarly, Creole seasoning lacks Old Bay’s complexity if you use it as a 1:1 substitute. Consider the fact that the typical Creole seasoning blend contains far fewer spices than you will find in Old Bay seasoning. Creole seasoning blends also do not usually include spices like mace and cardamom.\nTheir respective ingredients lists aside, both Old Bay and Creole seasoning can be used interchangeably without causing major problems. The resulting dishes will have different flavor profiles depending on which spice blend you use but they won’t be dramatically different and should still be palatable.\nWhen should you use Old Bay and when should you use Creole seasoning?\nOld Bay seasoning advertises itself as being versatile enough to be used on seafood, poultry, and salads. While it is undoubtedly true that you can use it on all of those foods, it is only essential for the Maryland blue crab. If you want to enjoy this classic American crustacean in the most traditional way possible, you will need to invest in some Old Bay seasoning.\nUse Creole seasoning if you are making New Orleans staples like jambalaya. Jambalaya is an authentic Creole dish, and its origins are associated mainly with NOLA rather than with Louisiana as a whole. Better yet, make your own Creole seasoning by combining individual spices to taste. You are free to do this since there is no one set recipe for it the way there is with Old Bay seasoning."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:705477d5-7615-4754-b860-cd563d8f997a>","<urn:uuid:4950d965-97df-4e8e-a74e-5168b8c6d20b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What protection does Business Income coverage provide to hotel owners in case of a fire?","answer":"Business Income coverage provides payments to replace lost income during the time a hotel is unable to conduct typical business operations due to a covered cause of loss, such as a fire that makes the hotel unlivable. It can also include key employees' payroll if the business owner wants to keep important personnel on staff during the rebuilding period.","context":["6 Basic Insurance Coverages All Hotel Owners Should HaveMay 24, 2018\nHotel owners take on a lot of risk when they decide to open a business that provides a place for people and their personal belongings to stay for a short period of time. Aside from some of the obvious liability concerns, there are significant risks associated with losses to the business’s property assets. While the exposures and insurance needs of individual, specific hotels can’t be wholly addressed in one short article, there are several necessary coverages that are universal needs for all hotels. These are the basic insurance coverages all hotel owners should have:\n1. Building and Business Personal Property Coverage\nThis coverage insures the hotel business for physical losses sustained to the structure or the business’s contents within. Business Personal Property includes things such as supplies, furniture, and even some coverage for the personal property of others. Be aware of the limitations and the items that are excluded from this coverage form, however, and be sure to discuss with your agent the many available endorsements that serve to broaden or expand coverage.\n2. Equipment Breakdown\nThis coverage is sometimes referred to as boiler and machinery coverage, but the terminology that is more commonly used now is Equipment Breakdown. Equipment Breakdown coverage insures the business for losses to equipment due to the sudden and unexpected breakdown or tearing apart of the scheduled equipment. Equipment breakdown shouldn’t be confused with warranty coverage on heating and cooling components, but it can still be a valuable coverage to have, nonetheless.\nThere are three parts to the coverage – damage to the equipment as result of an accident, damage to other property as a result of the equipment breakdown, and loss of income arising from the damage to the covered equipment. If the hotel’s central heating or air conditioning system were to suddenly break down, for example, the loss of income due to the hotel being temporarily out of commission could be payable at claim time.\n3. Business Income and Extra Expense\nThis coverage might be listed as “BI/EE” and it provides coverage for a loss of income due to a covered cause of loss. For example, if the hotel was to have a fire, and become unlivable for an extended time period, Business Income coverage can provide the business owner with payments to replace their lost income during the time they are unable to conduct typical business operations.\nKey employees’ payroll can also be included if the business owner feels it is important to keep important personnel on staff by continuing to pay them during the rebuilding period. Extra expense coverage is fairly self-explanatory, as it provides payments for operational expenditures incurred after the loss that are above the standard costs associated with running the business. As mentioned above, if a hotel owner has elected to purchase Equipment Breakdown coverage, BI/EE claims can be triggered by an Equipment Breakdown loss.\n4. Commercial General Liability\nPerhaps even more important than Property Coverages is making sure you are insured with a Commercial General Liability policy, or CGL. Liability insurance is an important aspect of every business. With hotels and other habitational types of risks, there is a significant amount of exposure present, since the business is potentially responsible for bodily injury that is sustained by its guests. These claims could range from a guest slipping on an icy sidewalk to more tragic situations resulting from a structure fire.\nGeneral Liability insurance protects the business from these claims if the property damage or bodily injury sustained by a 3rd party is found to be as a result of the business’s negligence. The insurance company will also pay to defend the business in court, regardless of the claim’s legitimacy or frivolousness. Be aware of some of the exclusions on a General Liability coverage form and discuss the full range of your operations with an agent to ensure that you are correctly covered. For example, if the hotel establishment sells or serves alcoholic beverages, a Liquor Liability policy should be put in place, as claims arising from the sale or distribution of alcohol are excluded on a GL policy.\n5. Worker’s Compensation\nMost hotels have staff of some sort, whether it is housekeepers or office personnel. Although it varies, every state has some laws in place that compel business owners who employ workers to carry a Worker’s Compensation policy. Worker’s Compensation is the sole remedy for injured worker’s to collect benefits after they sustain an injury on the job. By carrying a Worker’s Compensation policy, the employer enjoys legal protections from employee lawsuits.\nAt the same time, if the business owner fails to carry Worker’s Compensation, the consequences can be severe. Business owners who are not in compliance with the Worker’s Compensation statutes forfeit their common law protections from employee lawsuits, and may incur extensive fines and, in the worst cases, even jail time.\n6. Umbrella Liability\nAn umbrella policy is an optional coverage that provides additional liability limits above what Commercial General Liability and Business Auto policies offer. For hotel owners, an umbrella policy shouldn’t be considered optional. The question is less of “Do I need an Umbrella?” and more “How much Umbrella coverage do I need?”\nDue to all of the premises and product liability exposures that are present when operating a hotel, and the large number of occupants that may be staying at the hotel at any given time, it is very important that a hotel protect its business and assets with adequate liability limits. Determining how much Umbrella Coverage to buy can be difficult. Umbrellas are sold in “layers” of $1,000,000 each. How many layers you should buy can be first determined by the value of the business’s assets; it is a good principle to purchase liability limits that at least match your property values.\nSecondly, the risks and exposures present at each specific hotel should be considered in order to determine if additional Umbrella layers should be purchased. If a hotel is engaged in providing food service via a restaurant, serving alcohol, has a swimming pool, or offers guests rides to and from a nearby airport, the establishment has taken on additional liability exposures and should consider purchasing higher umbrella limits.\nA comprehensive insurance portfolio for a hotel establishment will certainly include more coverages than listed above. Utility Services-Time Element Coverage, Business Income From Dependent Properties, Signs Coverage, Ordinance and Law, Cyber Liability, Business Auto, etc. are all coverages and policies that should be discussed with an agent who is licensed in your state of operation. The coverages outlined above are a starting point for discussion, and they can help hotel owners to begin to evaluate some coverages which address some of the most frequent loss situations experienced by their type of business.\nDisclaimer: Information and claims presented in this content are meant for informative, illustrative purposes and should not be considered legally binding."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d184151d-60cc-4bad-a7e2-362358a139c5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"For someone considering dental work, how does the replacement process compare between dental implant crowns and veneers in terms of complexity and pain management?","answer":"The replacement processes differ significantly. For veneers, replacement is straightforward - the dentist files away old bonding agent, takes new impressions, and bonds new veneers in a pain-free procedure under local anesthesia. For implant crowns, the process is more complex, involving removal of the existing crown, potential adjustment of the connector (abutment), and securing the new crown either with cement or screws. Both procedures aim to be comfortable for patients - veneer preparation may cause some sensitivity requiring numbing, while implant crown replacement works with mostly artificial components but still requires careful management of surrounding gum tissue.","context":["A Dental Implant Crown is a crown (or \"cap\") that replaces a missing tooth, and it is held in place by a dental implant that is buried under the gum.The crown is the visible \"tooth\" that you can see.\nIt is similar to a normal dental crown (or \"cap\"), except that it sits on a man-made dental implant, instead of a natural tooth root. So the main difference between a normal crown and an implant crown is the way it's held in place.\nA dental implant crown sits on a dental implant, which replaces the natural tooth root. A normal dental crown sits on a natural tooth where the visible part of the tooth has been drilled down to a stump.\nDental implant crowns are different in other ways too!\nALL crowns are like small thimbles. They are hollow on the inside.\nWith a normal dental crown, the top of the natural tooth will fit inside, after the tooth has been trimmed down a little by your dentist.\nBut with a dental implant crown, that hollow space inside the crown is taken up by a precision-machined connector (also called an \"abutment\") made out of a gold alloy (or sometimes a ceramic such as Zirconia). The other end of the connector fits down into the top of the implant (the artificial tooth root). So the connector (\"abutment\") is like a small rod or peg.\nFrom a technical point of view, a crown that is held in place by a dental implant should be easier to make than a normal dental crown. The dental laboratory technician can make the precision-machined connector (abutment) to the ideal size for the final crown.\nWith a natural tooth, the lab guy has to work with what the dentist sends him! The dentist can only grind down a natural tooth a certain amount, otherwise he may weaken it or damage the tooth nerve.\nThis means that the stump of natural tooth left may well be a bit bulky, or at an awkward angle for the laboratory technician to work with.\nSo, when the dental technician starts to build a normal crown to fit over the ground-down stump of a natural tooth, he may have to make some parts of the crown very thin, otherwise the crown will end up looking bulky or the wrong shape when it's fitted in the patient's mouth.\nThis can mean that the crown ends up not being as strong as it should be, and it may be difficult to get a natural appearance.\nON THE OTHER HAND . . .\nA crown on a dental implant does not have these restrictions. The technician gets a mould from the dentist showing just the top of the implant, which is just below the gum, or level with the gum. The technician can then make up the connector (abutment) any shape or size he wants.\nOf course, he will make it big enough to be very strong. But at the same time, he can also make it slender enough so that the sides of the final cap or crown that fits over it will be about 2 millimeters thick. (ideal for strength AND appearance). He can also angle it in any direction, if needed, to compensate for an implant that is not perfectly straight.\nThe precision connector is then fitted into the implant in the patient's mouth, and the connector is held in place inside the implant by a titanium screw that screws through a small hole down the middle of the connector into the middle of the implant itself.\nThe implant-supported crown can then fitted onto the top of the connector (\"abutment\"), and held in place either by a dental cement, or by a small screw.\nOne other important difference between a normal crown and a dental implant crown is that the implant crown frequently has it's edges buried several millimeters under the gum. This means that bacteria can collect under the gum more easily, too, leading to peri-implantitis. This is an inflammation of the gum around the edge of the crown, where it touches the gum.\nTo prevent this problem, I STRONGLY recommend an oral irrigator to keep the gum clean around any dental implant crown. In my experience over 30 years, I think the BEST one is the HydroFloss oral irrigator. Read more about this fantastic technology at Oral Irrigators.\nAlso, using dental floss to gently clean under the gum around the crown will help, AND you should also use a quality electric toothbrush to remove any plaque build-up. The one I recommend in this situation is the Cybersonic 3 toothbrush.\nAs you can see, a dental implant crown is usually a bit more complicated for the dental technician, but the final result should be as natural-looking as a normal or conventional cap or crown.","Replacing existing veneers is very straightforward. The dentist files down the bonding agent that glued the previous veneers, then take an impression of your teeth. Once the new veneers are ready, they will be applied to your teeth using the same method as before.\nIs replacing veneers difficult?\nReplacing the veneer is a very similar process to the initial installation. Your dentist will file away as much of the old bonding agent and then take a mold of your teeth. The new veneer will then be creating and bonded back to your teeth.\nIs it painful to replace veneers?\nEvery phase of the veneer procedure should be comfortable and pain-free. The removal of enamel can create sensitivity, so when the tooth is prepared, the area will be numbed, just like when having a cavity filled.\nHow much does it cost to get veneers replaced?\nHow much do veneers cost? Veneers aren’t often covered by insurance because they’re considered a cosmetic procedure. In general, you can expect to pay between $925 and $2,500 per tooth, according to the American Dental Association. Composite veneers cost around $400 to $2,000 per tooth and last between 5 to 7 years.\nDo your teeth rot under veneers?\nWhile the dental porcelain used in your veneers will not decay, it is possible for cavities to form behind your porcelain veneers. When this happens, the resulting tooth decay will threaten the long term health of your teeth and potentially shorten the lifespan of your restoration.\nHow many times can you redo veneers?\nVeneers Can Last for Decades and Rarely Fail All at Once\nIt’s usually 1-2 at a time. This means you can replace them as needed. Steve chose to redo all of his veneers because he wanted all of them even brighter than the first set. If the rest of the veneers are ok, there is no need to redo all of them.\nHow do you remove old veneers?\nPush the veneer gently using an excavator, but do not use force to avoid breakage. Alternate between laser ablation and gentle pressure on the veneer until it is removed. Repeat steps one to three for the remaining veneers (Figs.\nHow do dentists remove old veneers?\nThe Process for Replacing Porcelain Veneers\nWith the veneer removed, the dentist cleans the tooth and then preps it This may involve the removal of just a bit of tooth structure to accommodate the new veneer or to address underlying structural issues. An impression is then taken of the prepped tooth.\nCan I get my veneers removed?\nVeneers can be removed and leave the tooth somewhat intact depending on the skill of the dentist, but there should not be any reason to do this. If the consultation with your dentist was comprehensive and your veneers were high quality and properly fitted to begin with, they shouldn’t need to be removed anytime soon.\nWhat are disadvantages of veneers?\nThe downsides of veneers\nDental veneers are irreversible because a dentist must remove a thin layer of enamel before they fit veneers over teeth. Removing a layer of enamel can make a tooth more sensitive to heat and cold; a veneer is far too thin to act as a barrier between the tooth and hot and cold foods.\nWhat’s better Lumineers or veneers?\nDental lumineers are suitable to treat discolored and unusually shaped teeth. They are smooth and slick to touch. Lumineers are transparent than porcelain veneers. It is why they are a better solution if you have severely discolored teeth.\nHow much would 4 veneers cost?\nPorcelain veneers range in price from $925 to $2,500, but average around $1500 per tooth. The cost may be greater if dental contouring is required. The procedure generally requires several visits. If more visits are required, or several veneers have to be placed, your overall cost will may increase.\nWhy you should not get veneers?\nWhile veneers do have both cosmetic and restorative functions, they are not a substitute for healthy teeth and gums. Veneers should never be used to mask serious dental problems. Any underlying issues with tooth decay or periodontal disease should be corrected before veneers are considered.\nDo veneers last a lifetime?\nWith the proper care, veneers do have the potential to last a lifetime. Even if your veneer becomes damaged or worn, we can replace it.\nDo all celebrities have veneers?\nCelebrities seem to have it all, but sometimes, they spend a lot of time and money to look that way. While these celebs have perfect teeth now, that wasn’t always the case. Here are 10 celebrities you didn’t know got veneers, or other major cosmetic dentistry done."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:25dc5c9b-3df0-46f7-9731-3c6e2353deff>","<urn:uuid:009c37aa-f350-409a-a1fc-011027779ae6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What approaches are used to address food security in developing Asian economies versus urbanizing landscapes?","answer":"In northern Asian countries like South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and China, food security was addressed through an economic development approach involving land reform policies, creating affluent rural populations as domestic markets, implementing manufacturing and financial policies for export performance, and reducing dependence on food imports. In contrast, urbanizing landscapes address food security through an integrated spatial and food systems perspective, focusing on strengthening rural-urban linkages, creating structural collaboration between stakeholders, and developing city food agendas. This approach emphasizes addressing both urban and rural needs while managing competition for natural resources between urban expansion and food production.","context":["Delivering comprehensive solutions tailored to people and place\nIRRI works in almost every rice-growing country in the world where local agriculture needs vary greatly depending upon underlying investments in the system, such as irrigation; the educational status of farmers; their access to information, soils, and inputs; and socio-political dynamics. Based on our intimate knowledge of these geographies and available best practices, we will help our partners envision and develop complete solutions tailored to ensure that farmers can improve their income and stability.\n- Employ a “breeding for market” approach to encourage improvements in grain quality and address issues in yield gap and nutrition.\n- Work with our partners to build their capacity in implementing market-oriented approaches to breeding tailored to regional needs.\n- Tailor, package, and operationalize potential solutions based on the needs of specific groups and specific places.\n- Identify and resolve existing paradoxes in product marketing, such as improving yield at the expense of market access.\nConnecting global solutions to local needs\nThe emerging fourth industrial revolution will hasten the convergence of the “physical, digital, and biological worlds,” creating new technologies and platforms. Currently, information communication technology (ICT) innovations such as remote-sensing technology, geographic information systems (GIS), and high-resolution satellite images can monitor and evaluate agricultural systems to determine where and when rice is grown and whether crops are growing well or not. IRRI will speed up the adoption of these technologies to make rice farming more efficient and accessible.\n- Ensure that ICT management systems and tools are affordable and conducive to existing smallholder farmers and youth—the farmers of the future.\n- Help national systems develop their knowledge systems as knowledge banks that can be shared with other nations and systems on acceptable terms.\n- Engage partners and the private sector to resolve data ownership, privacy, and ethical and research-use questions to ensure widest impact of ICT.\nOffering solutions for rural and urban populations\nAs global rice demand grows by almost 13% in the next decade, an increasing number of urban middle-class rice consumers will have more diversified diets and be more environment and health conscious, fueling a desire for more choices of rice that are cleaner and more nutritious. For rice exporting countries, this presents an opportunity to sharpen their focus on high-quality rice varieties and products.\n- IRRI will draw on its expertise in product development for the rice sector to help rural and urban populations capitalize on this trend.\n- Develop production technologies to limit plant uptake of arsenic and cadmium in grain varieties and minimize potential consumer health threats in affected areas.\n- Ensure affordable access to quality, nutritious rice to alleviate the double-burden of malnutrition.\n- Work with the public and private sector to realize additional high-value markets such as meeting urban consumers’ requirements for rice products that are convenient, high-quality, nutritious, and affordable.\n- Promote production of specialty niche rice, such as heirloom or geographically unique rice, to increase livelihoods for marginalized and indigenous populations.\nEquipping people and institutions for tomorrow\nIRRI is committed to preparing the next generation of scientists, extension agents, value chain actors, farmers, and leaders to work effectively for positive change in the global rice sector. Capitalizing on the legacy of the institute’s training center, IRRI Education will provide the means to help individuals and organizations interpret and respond to the rapidly changing physical and political landscape of the global agricultural sector.\n- Provide a customer-focused and demand-driven suite of educational programs that capitalize on IRRI’s expertise in rice research, agricultural extension, and rice sector policy.\n- Work with IRRI and NARES scientists to make their scientific knowledge and expertise more widely accessible.\n- Build programs geared to the broader agricultural sector, including policymakers and regulators, professionals in the international development community, and industry leaders from around the world.\n- Partner with university agriculture programs to prepare the next generation of rice scientists at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral level.\nForging mission-critical private and public partnership\nIRRI’s revitalized partnership model will be one of ‘partnership for impact,’ focusing on quality, not quantity of partnerships and opportunities for complementarity in research and/or financial investment.

This outcome resulted from four parallel developments:\n- The adoption of land reform policies that provided farmers with incentives to reinvest in productivity enhancements and creation of a “level playing field” to compete for market access.\n- A more affluent rural population to serve as a domestic market for goods and services produced by emerging manufacturing and service sectors.\n- Manufacturing and financial policies that drove export performance at the expense of domestic land speculation and other activities that did not deliver on national development goals.\n- Reduction of any requirement to use scarce foreign exchange capacity to import staple foods such as rice.","What you'll learn\n- Key concepts and issues around food and nutrition in urbanizing landscapes\n- The role of rural-urban dynamics and how they manifest in the landscape\n- A variety of tools for a basic analysis of a city region food system\n- Inspiration for advanced tools for city region food system analysis\n- Guiding principles for good landscape governance and the role of food policy within\n- The importance rural-urban collaboration to achieve food and nutrition secure landscapes\n- Identify leverage entry points for sustainable change\n- How to mobilize key stakeholders towards a common vision\n- What your role as landscape professional can be to contribute to food and nutrition security in your urbanizing landscape\nAbout this course\nFood and nutrition insecurity in an urbanizing world\nOur landscapes are changing. As towns and megacities expand, they increasingly place claim on limited natural resources, such as water and land. In turn, this competition for resources places rural areas under pressure, further aggravated by climate change and rural-urban migration. Yet, these areas are essential for producing food for a growing population. These changes in the landscape have a serious impact on food and nutrition.\nOvernutrition is on the rise in one part of the landscape, resulting in lifestyle related diseases, such as obesity, type II diabetes and heart disease. At the same time undernutrition persist in other areas, causing a.o. increased mortality and poor childhood development. While some consumers are stuck in food deserts, with limited to no access to fresh produce, producers may have difficulty finding profitable markets. City governments and urban planners can play a key role in addressing these issues by putting food on the urban agenda, yet many cities lack a food agenda.\nStrengthen rural-urban linkages in your landscape\nAlthough urban, peri-urban and rural parts of the landscape are inextricably linked, urban development and rural development often occur in isolation of one another. During this course you will learn to look beyond the boundaries of your personal expertise and geographic location. Taking on an integrated spatial and food systems perspective opens up possibilities to bring about structural change.\nYou will become acquainted with a variety of tools to analyze food and nutrition issues and their relation to your rural-urban landscape, which can help you to:\n- Raise awareness on the importance of a systems approach to FNS in your landscape\n- Think of ways to strengthen or create structural collaboration between rural and urban stakeholders\n- Jointly work towards FNS\nYou will bring your learnings together in a compelling story to mobilize key stakeholders in your rural-urban landscape. You will also explore your role to contribute to breaking the rural-urban divide.\nSo, whether you are a researcher, an advisor working for an international NGO or multilateral agency (f.e. Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO)), a nutrition officer or an urban planner, a member of a farmer’s association or a policy maker, join this course – created in collaboration between GLF, WUR and UNEP – and start addressing food and nutrition insecurity in your urbanizing landscape."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0b2ba9fe-14ef-4d5f-8ae5-047057ad5b7b>","<urn:uuid:d83895d1-9fb2-4d19-a0a3-8dfb93d4e9bd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which poses a greater threat - antibiotic residues in meat or antimicrobial resistance development?","answer":"Antimicrobial resistance development poses a greater threat than antibiotic residues in meat. The documents explain that while activist groups focus on scaring people about residues, there are actually strict regulations and testing to ensure there are no antibiotic residues in meat products. The real concern is the development of antimicrobial resistance when bacteria are exposed to antibiotics used in food animals, particularly for growth promotion and disease prevention. This is why NARMS was established to monitor resistance in bacteria from humans, retail meats and food animals. The threat comes from resistant pathogens like Salmonella and Campylobacter that can spread from animals to humans through the food supply, not from consuming trace amounts of antibiotics in meat.","context":["A Case of Misguided Activism\nJust in time for fall, Starbucks announced a recipe change to their beloved Pumpkin Spice Latte recipe: it is removing the caramel coloring and adding real pumpkin.\nWhy? It’s the result of a misguided campaign, to make a 400-calorie beverage appear “healthier”, led by consumer groups, like the Center for Science in the Public Interest and self-proclaimed food activists like the “Food Babe” Vani Hari.\nThese groups have demonized the caramel coloring, which contains the chemical 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI). It is a natural byproduct of roasting coffee beans and other processes that involve high temperatures, including the production of certain caramel colors (see: Maillard reaction). The concern does not seem to be based on science. Regulatory authorities in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Hong Kong have determined that that there is no immediate or short-term risk from 4-MEI levels typically encountered in food as a result of the addition of caramel coloring.\nThese groups claim that 4-MEI is a known carcinogen, ignoring the fact that the dose required to cause cancer in lab mice is over 80 milligrams per kilogram of body weight everyday for 106 weeks. This means the average adult male in the U.S., weighing about 195.5 pounds, would need to consume over 7 grams of 4-MEI every day for over two years. They also don’t seem particularly concerned about “natural” 4-MEI in their coffee, soy sauce, beer or bread, but people are very worried about the exact same chemical when it is added in artificial coloring. Because PSLs are, for most people, not a dietary staple and only available for a short time of year, the amount of 4-MEI exposure from pumpkin spice lattes is likely a tiny fraction of one’s total exposure to 4-MEI.\nIs this decision designed to treat us to a safer beverage or trick us through marketing to make us think we are consuming a safer treat? I’m gonna go with trick and brilliant marketing.\nBecause the uproar is only about the artificial 4-MEI, and no one is talking about all the naturally formed 4-MEI we are exposed to (even in the same drink), all I can conclude is that Starbucks made these changes, not based on scientific evidence regarding potentially dangerous exposure limits and the toxicity of 4-MEI, but rather on market research in response to rising consumer fears propagated by so-called “food activists”.\nAs someone involved in toxicology research, I am all in favor of reducing toxic exposures. This is a noble goal. Unfortunately, targeting the food villain of the month is a largely ineffective way to accomplish this. Consumers and journalists have an important role to play, but that all depends on having access to accurate, current information and working with scientists and regulators to work towards this goal.\nThese campaigns against single chemicals lead companies like Starbucks to change their recipes not based on science, but because activists like Vani Hari and Michael Pollan, who won’t buy their food anyway, can’t pronounce their ingredients. These campaigns usually do not reduce toxic exposures overall and they do not educate or empower consumers.\nThe tale of the pumpkin spice latte is a perfect example of how these campaigns are based on fear and a fallacious appeal to Nature, with little regard for the scientific data. Even when there are data to suggest that there might be some toxicity, these campaigns are rarely evidence-based. There is a crying wolf factor as well; the scientific illiteracy of many of these activists makes it easier to dismiss all concerns about toxic exposures, even the valid ones, as unfounded chemophobia.\nThese misguided campaigns are often counterproductive for reducing toxic exposures and effecting positive change.\nBisphenol A and regrettable substitutions\nThe campaigns against specific chemicals often overlook the big picture resulting in what has been dubbed “regrettable substitutions”. This refers to the removal of a chemical without considering the alternatives that might replace it. A now classic example of regrettable substitutions concerns Bisphenol A (BPA). Bisphenol A is thought to be an endocrine disrupting chemical that scientists have studied and continue to study extensively. Although there is still disagreement about the effects of BPA in humans, for sake of argument, let’s assume there is no question about whether BPA is toxic at real life exposure levels.\nWhen consumer groups bypassed scientists and regulators and convinced companies to remove BPA, it was replaced with Bisphenol F and Bisphenol S. Their main virtue was that they had been studied far less than BPA and were not in the crosshairs of activists and so they were easily substitutable. But in fact studies show they have similar activity and potency as BPA in cellular and animal models and similar biological effects in humans as BPA. Thus, while these campaigns reduced exposure to BPA specifically, they did not reduce exposure overall to phenols, which have similar effects. They may even have made it more difficult to make regulatory changes since there is less research on BPF and BPS.\nThere is real science behind how to choose safe alternatives when phasing out a chemical. These campaigns bypass that process completely and would likely be better able to reduce toxic exposures by pushing for adoption of adequate chemical alternatives assessment.\nAntibiotic resistance and false evidence\nLast week, Subway announced that they will only be serving meat from animals that have never been treated with any antibiotics, even to treat a sick animal.\nThe brand recently communicated a commitment to transition to only serving chicken raised without antibiotics important to human medicine. Today, the brand confirmed that it is beginning to transition to serving only protein from animals that have never received antibiotics across all of its 27,000+ U.S. restaurants in early 2016.\nThis announcement came as an effort to address concerns by activists about antibiotic resistance. They motivated people to join the campaign by scaring them about toxic antibiotic residues in meat products. Food activists all over the Internet are commending Subway for this decision. Vani Hari gushed on her blog:\nI had my bags packed and ready to go to deliver over 250,000 petition signatures with several consumer advocacy groups to Subway headquarters this week but all my plans came to an abrupt halt.\nSubway just announced that they have committed to eliminating the use of antibiotics in ALL of their meat in the U.S. – and they also provided a timeline. It’s never felt so good to cancel my plans!\nFarmers, on the other hand, are dismayed that this policy did not even allow for treating sick animals even if the antibiotics are not used in human medicine and completely ignored that there are very strict regulations and testing to ensure that there are no antibiotic residues in dairy, meat, poultry and egg products. In other words, the campaign did more to fuel mistrust of farmers than educate the consumer.\nTo be clear, antibiotic resistance is a looming problem. However, antibiotic residues in our meat are not a factor in this. The actual concerns about antibiotic resistance have nothing to do with drug residues in your meat; they are less about the treatment of sick animals and more about the use of antibiotics for growth promotion and prevention of disease (prophylaxis). Subway’s marketing decision may make food activists happy. However, actual policy only requires farmers to follow existing laws and the new voluntary FDA regulations that were announced in June of this year, before these groups launched their campaigns against Subway. In reality, this ‘victory’ will accomplish little in the very important battle against antibiotic resistance.\nAntibiotic resistance is a serious enough problem we should all worry about that there is no need to make up problems about exposure to antibiotic residues to justify taking action. Activists are motivating by misleading people and, as a result, it makes it easier for people to dismiss all concerns, even the valid ones, about antibiotic resistance.\nThese examples demonstrate how chemophobic hysteria detracts from the message when there are actual issues of concern, making it more difficult for valid concerns to be taken seriously. Organizations like the Environmental Working Group, The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, and people like Vani Hari and Michael Pollan, seem to completely disregard the basic principles of toxicology and science to promote the idea that there is no acceptable level of any synthetic chemical, ever.\nMany scientists and skeptics remain doubtful about suspected endocrine disrupting chemicals and issues of antibiotic resistance, partly because the groups speaking out most loudly about these concerns have shown a lack of scientific credibility on other issues. For example, this past weekend, The Huffington Post ran an article about endocrine disrupting chemicals, but had to throw in some nonsense about glyphosate causing birth defects, even though it is neither teratogenic nor endocrine disrupting. Because they continue to misrepresent facts, to draw inflammatory conclusions, or to seemingly just make things up, these campaigns are, ironically, counterproductive in the long term for the goal of reducing toxic exposures.\nFor consumers who are concerned about chemicals, there is a lot of science-based information and it’s publicly available!\nNone of this is meant to say that toxic exposures aren’t an issue. But not all chemicals are toxic in the doses that we are typically exposed to. There is a lot of publicly available information about our exposures and the associated health effects. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Department of Health and Human Services, and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) all maintain databases and websites meant for the public to find the most up-to-date scientific information.\n- The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) at the CDC has collected enormous amount of demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related data about the U.S. population. Data from NHANES is used to generate the CDC growth charts for kids that many of us are familiar with. The data is also used to calculate the prevalence of diseases and risk factors for disease, in epidemiological studies and to identify areas of concern that need to be addressed by public health officials. Much of the data collected as a part of the survey and the analysis of this data is available on the CDC website. Data on chemical exposures is included in this survey and that data is compiled into tables that are published on the CDC website as well.\n- The National Biomonitoring Program, also run by the CDC, assesses over 300 environmental chemicals in human tissues and fluids and the nutritional measures in the US population. This data are used to figure out which chemicals get into our bodies and where they go within the body (blood, urine, saliva, breast milk), to monitor how many people are exposed above known toxicity levels and to track trends over time. The most recent assessment of exposures, the National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals, in the U.S. was published earlier this year. This document contains all the data about how much of each chemical was detected and links to summary information about what these numbers mean and a chemical fact sheet on each chemical. NBP also publishes the National Report on Biochemical Indicators of Diet and Nutrition in the U.S.\n- NIEHS also funds exposure assessments, especially as it relates to children’s health. They recently launched an expanded program, the Children’s Health Exposure Analysis Resource, to help researchers add or expand the environmental exposures studied.\n- NIEHS also publishes chemical fact sheets and information about current areas of concern in environmental health sciences.\n- The Household Products Database is maintained by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The database, which was started in 1995 and is updated twice a year, contains information about the most common non-food and non-pharmaceutical consumer products. It provides the ingredients for a huge number of products and links out to databases like ToxNet that contain the toxicology data on those ingredients. Information about food-related and pharmaceutical products are available on the FDA website.\n- Paula’s Choice maintains an ingredient dictionary that is much more in line with current toxicology data that EWG’s database. Their ratings take into account dose, mode of exposure and formulation; all things that EWG seems to ignore in their assessments.\nWhat are effective strategies for reducing toxic exposures at a public health level?\nFirst and foremost, be skeptical and apply reasoning and critical thinking when you read a claim. Educate yourself with accurate, science-based evidence. This means information from reputable, peer-reviewed scientific journals. If you are not familiar enough with a field to assess whether a journal is reputable, find science communicators with established reputations for reporting science accurately. Take advantage of the publicly available resources, including those listed above.\nRemember that no exposure occurs in isolation and that exposure to a chemical does not necessarily mean there is an ill effect. Even with these toxic exposures, toxicologists are often talking about small effects that can often be counteracted through positive exposures. Dr. Robin Whyatt, Deputy Director of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health said the following on an NIEHS podcast about phthalates that captures this idea (emphasis mine).\nPeople are exposed to a lot of different compounds but we know that eating a really good diet during pregnancy is absolutely critical and has enormous beneficial effects, that taking prenatal vitamins is very beneficial and probably the key thing in terms of a child’s development is stimulation of the child. Read to your child. Play with your child. Talk to your child. All those things are just incredibly important and probably have much more effect, positive effect than these chemicals are having negative effects. So it’s really important to keep this in perspective. This is one exposure. It’s worth trying to avoid, but you can do a whole lot to help your child by the way you eat and by how you play with your child.\nEncourage funding of research to fill the gaps in our knowledge. Toxicology and exposure science are making huge methodological and technical advances. Today, we can do so much more than screen just one compound at a time for mutagenicity and for whether it causes cancer. Regulators can only make decisions based on the evidence. Help them have more evidence by campaigning for increased funding for toxicology research. This funding must come from both public agencies and industry. Yes, I wrote industry. As those who stand to profit from this research, industry needs to bear some of the cost burden of this research, just as pharmaceutical companies contribute to clinical trials. Taxpayers should not bear this burden alone.\nLearn about the different regulatory mechanisms for different classes of chemicals. Chemicals are regulated based on how they are used. Pesticides are regulated differently than food additives, differently than cosmetics, differently than drugs, and differently than consumer products. Each class requires different levels of pre-market testing, different types of monitor and different procedures for handling violations. Multiple agencies play different roles in these regulatory processes. Without understanding how these processes work and how they are different, it is not possible to encourage effective reforms.\nAbove all, avoid inflammatory rhetoric and hysterical chemophobia; stick to the facts and the evidence.\nAlison Bernstein a neuroscientist studying the role of epigenetics in neurodegenerative diseases and toxic exposures.

Many factors contribute to the emergence of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, but the use of antimicrobials in medicine and agriculture is the most important factor. Antimicrobials are commonly used in food animals to prevent, control and treat infections and to promote the growth of food-producing animals. (Recently, FDA has implemented a process to eliminate the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion by December 2016). Of particular concern is the potential for pathogens such as Salmonella and Campylobacter, commonly present in the intestines of food producing animals, to develop resistance when exposed to antibiotics given to the animal. This raises the possibility that humans could become infected with these resistant organisms through exposure to infected livestock or contaminated food products.\nIncreasing antimicrobial resistance has prompted public health and regulatory officials to more closely examine the ways in which antibiotic use in food-producing animals may contribute to resistance in animal and zoonotic bacteria. The World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) have published recommendations that Member States implement monitoring programs for the use of antibiotics in animals, as well as for the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria from animals and from food of animal origin (AGISAR, 2013).\nThe National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System\nThe National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS), established in 1996, is a collaborative program of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), state and local health departments, and universities. NARMS monitors antimicrobial susceptibility in selected enteric bacteria from humans, retail meats and food-producing animals.\nIn addition to monitoring antimicrobial susceptibility, NARMS conducts epidemiologic investigations examining risk factors and clinical outcomes of infections with specific bacterial subtypes or subsets of bacteria that exhibit particular resistance patterns. NARMS scientists also perform microbiologic studies to determine the genetic traits conferring antimicrobial resistance and the mechanisms that mediate the transfer of resistance between bacteria. Other studies have been done to improve methods for isolation and typing, and to develop quality control parameters for antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods. Isolates in the NARMS collection also have been examined for relatedness using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). PFGE patterns are stored in CDC’s PulseNet database or USDA’s VetNet database where they serve as a point of reference for outbreak investigations. WGS data on NARMS isolates are publicly available via the National Institutes of Health NCBI web portal.\n- To monitor trends in antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacteria from humans, retail meats, and animals;\n- To disseminate timely information on antimicrobial resistance to promote interventions that reduce resistance among foodborne bacteria;\n- To conduct research to better understand the emergence, persistence, and spread of antimicrobial resistance; and\n- To provide data that assist the FDA in making decisions related to the approval of safe and effective antimicrobial drugs for animals.\nThe Components of NARMS\nThe NARMS program has three components, which are briefly described below.\nThe human component of NARMS was launched in 1996 within the framework of CDC’s Emerging Infections Program and the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet). Initially, it included non-Typhi Salmonella and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157 isolates from 14 state and local health departments. In 1999, Salmonella serotype Typhi and Shigella testing was added. By 2003, NARMS conducted nationwide surveillance of Salmonella, Shigella, and E. coli O157 from humans. Testing of Campylobacter from humans began in 5 FoodNet sites in 1997 and expanded to all 10 FoodNet sites by 2003. In 2009, NARMS began testing Vibrio species other than V. cholerae from all 50 states. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of NARMS human isolates is performed at CDC’s laboratories in the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases in Atlanta, Georgia.\nRetail Meat Component\nThe retail meat component of NARMS was launched in 2002. Retail meat surveillance is conducted through collaboration with 15 state and local departments of public health and 4 universities. Participating sites purchase chicken, ground turkey, ground beef, and pork chops at retail stores and culture them for Salmonella. Retail poultry is also cultured for Campylobacter. A subset of NARMS sites also culture retail meats for E. coli and Enterococcus. Isolates are sent to FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) Office of Research in Laurel, Maryland for species and serotype confirmation, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and genetic analysis.\nUSDA’s Agricultural Research Services (ARS) initiated the animal component of NARMS in 1997 by testing Salmonella isolates recovered by the USDA Food Safety Inspection Services (FSIS) Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (PR/HACCP) verification testing program. Testing later expanded to include Campylobacter (1998), E. coli (2000), and Enterococcus (2003). The NARMS Integrated Report includes HACCP isolate data for Campylobacter from chicken carcass rinsates and data for Salmonella from carcass rinsates (chicken), carcass swabs (turkey, cattle and swine, and ground products (chicken, turkey, and beef). Isolates are recovered from samples obtained at federally inspected slaughter and processing plants. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for the animal component of NARMS is performed at the USDA laboratories in Athens, Georgia.\nIn 2013, NARMS began a new animal sampling scheme through USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). Cecal samples were collected at the slaughterhouse from individual animals of the major production classes, including young chickens (6-7 weeks of age), young turkeys (18-20 weeks of age), dairy cow, beef cow, steer, and heifer, and swine (market swine, sows). The NARMS Integrated Report includes cecal isolate data for Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus recovered from these commodities. Isolates were sent to CVM’s Office of Research in Laurel, Maryland for species and serotype confirmation, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and genetic analysis until December 31, 2013. Beginning in 2014, this work has been conducted at the FSIS Eastern Laboratory in Athens, GA.\nCategorization of Antimicrobial Agents\nThe antimicrobials that NARMS uses are selected based on their importance in human and veterinary medicine and for their utility as epidemiological markers for the movement of resistant organisms and genes between environments. NARMS tests for susceptibility to 15 antimicrobials in Salmonella and E. coli, 9 in Campylobacter, and 16 in Enterococcus.\nIn its Guidance for Industry entitled ‘Evaluating the Safety of Antimicrobial New Animal Drugs with Regard to Their Microbiological Effects on Bacteria of Human Health Concern’ (GFI #152), FDA provides recommendations on how to rank antimicrobials with their relative importance in human medicine.

{"question":"How do prescriptivists and descriptivists differ in their views on language evolution and drift?","answer":"Prescriptivists try to preserve 'correct' language forms and oppose changes, believing in a 'golden age' of proper language usage. In contrast, descriptivists welcome language evolution and adaptation, studying how people actually use language. This aligns with the concept of linguistic drift, where language naturally moves in certain directions over time, seeking poise and form through collective unconscious working of the human mind. The debate can be seen in examples like the changing meaning of 'literally' and 'dilemma', where descriptivists accept new meanings based on popular usage while prescriptivists insist on original definitions.","context":["Lewis Turner explores the dilemma of shifting word senses and whether the original meaning is the ‘true’ meaning.\nI’m sure we’ve all heard someone exclaim something along of the lines of “I literally could not keep my eyes open during that lecture”. However, we all know that they physically\ncould and, in reality, they were just a bit bored. This utterance would make some people figuratively want to explode. This is an issue of semantics as the problem lies in a misunderstanding of word meaning. Any dictionary would tell you that the adverb ‘literally’ refers to ‘a truthful representation of an event’. However, as previously exemplified, it is now commonly used for emphasis or exaggeration. The perceived misuse of ‘literally’ has become one of semantics’ largest controversies; just see Jamie Redknapp’s ‘Foot In Mouth Award’ win for his very ‘nonliteral’ use of the word (Plain English, 2010) – e.g. “These balls now – they literally explode off your feet.” At the heart of this issue is the debate between prescriptivism and descriptivism.\nPrescriptivists try to uphold rules that preserve and impose a ‘correct’ form of a language whereas descriptivists attempt to describe how people actually use language and are welcoming of change and adaptation (Curzan, 2014, p. 14). Hitchings (2011) summarises this as “one says what ought to happen, and the other says what does happen” (p. 23). People’s fears over their own language usage has helped prescriptivism become a potentially large market for authors. So much so that books that purport to teach ‘proper English’, such as Gywnne’s Grammar (2013) and Heffer’s Strictly English (2010), can often be found amongst the bestseller lists. Semantics is usually a key issue in prescriptivism because, as Heffer argues, inaccurate usage of a word “can leave […interlocutors] understanding something quite different” from what we intended (2010 p. 136). He describes these types of mistakes as “vulgarities” (p. 183). This links to a belief held by many prescriptivists: that there was a ‘golden age’ for the English language where everyone used English ‘correctly’. An example that Heffer says shows the drop in modern standards is the misuse of the word ‘dilemma’. He argues that as it originates from the Greek term for ‘two propositions”, it therefore cannot be used to refer to a choice between three-or-more possibilities (p. 143).\nOn the other hand, a descriptivist would argue that such an assertion is completely pedantic as very few people actually know the etymology (the linguistic origin) of words. I think it’s pretty likely that none of us would bat an eyelid if someone told us that they were facing a ‘dilemma’ over what to buy their friend for Christmas, or where they wanted\nto go on holiday, or anything else with more than two possible solutions. As Trudgill (1998) argues, comprehension is hardly ever affected by semantic change as people are either able to use contextual clues to work out what is meant or never knew the original meaning in the first place (p. 5). Instead of tracing back to original roots, most people’s understanding of lexical items comes from how they hear other speakers use them in real life. This is supported by the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) who notes that due to popular usage, dilemmas can now refer to choices with “several” options (OED online, 2019) and who in 2011, added the ‘improper’ emphatic meaning of ‘literally’ to their dictionary (Gill, 2013). Regarding the so-called ‘golden age’, descriptivists would point out that more people than ever are able to read and write and the evidence used to support the golden age belief is usually anecdotal with no qualitative evidence (Milroy, 1998. p. 61).\nPersonally, I’m not sure if I could call myself purely a descriptivist or prescriptivist. I think words do need rules that dictate some agreed meaning or effective communication would be impossible. However, I certainly think that meanings are not set in stone and should be allowed to adapt with the times, otherwise I would have to argue that ‘nice’ could still only refer to its original meaning of ‘foolish’ (Trudgill, 1998, p. 2).\nSo, when Jamie Redknapp describes a footballer as being “literally a greyhound” this Super Sunday should we just ignore it because we all understand he is using it for emphasis? Or does this make him look too ‘nice’ (in the original sense)? All I know is that it’s an issue about which I’m literally going to sit on the fence!\nLEWIS TURNER, English Language undergraduate, University of Chester, UK\nNB: this blog was originally published on the Language Debates website on 14 May 2019","Why don’t languages just stay the same? Why does each generation of speakers introduce changes even though a steady state would seem to have served the communicative goals of a language adequately? These are questions to which answers are to be found by considering language as a semeiotic, a system of signs.\nAs indicated in an earlier post (“The Telos of Linguistic Change,” April 7, 2013), one’s first recourse in a productive approach to understanding the rationale of language change should be to thinking about change in a broader framework, to wit:\n“[U]nderlying all other laws is the only tendency which can grow by its own virtue, the tendency of all things to take habits…. In so far as evolution follows a law, the law or habit, instead of being a movement from homogeneity to heterogeneity, is growth from difformity to uniformity. But the chance divergences from laws are perpetually acting to increase the variety of the world, and are checked by a sort of natural selection and otherwise…, so that the general result may be described as ‘organized heterogeneity,’ or, better, rationalized variety” (Charles S. Peirce, Collected Papers 6.101; emphasis added).\nThis quotation from the modern founder of the theory of signs is to be combined with what the prominent interwar theoretician of historical linguistics, Edward Sapir, characterized as “drift” (both passages are from his Selected Writings, p. 382):\n“Language moves down time in a current of its own making. It has a drift…. The linguistic drift has direction. In other words, only those individual variations embody it or carry it which move in a certain direction, just as only certain wave movements in the bay outline the tide.”\n“Wherever the human mind has worked collectively and unconsciously, it has striven for and attained unique form. The important point is that the evolution of form has a drift in one direction, that it seeks poise, and that it rests, relatively speaking, when it has found this poise.”\nPresent possibilities with greater or lesser powers of actualization exist at any given historical stage of a language. Innovations that come to be full-fledged social facts, i. e., changes, must have something about their form that enables them to survive. The aggregate of such innovations-become-changes is what constitutes the drift of a language.\nBeyond such broad generalizations, what is needed in order to understand individual linguistic changes is the principle whereby drift is further defined as what might be called “the triumph of the iconic.” In other words, the trajectory of change, in the long run, follows an arc leading toward iconicity, which is the alignment between form and meaning. In the working out of this trajectory, the form-meaning alignment is regularly aided by a real tendency of change from the marked to the unmarked member of the linguistic units and categories involved.\nHere is an example from contemporary American English. For some time now, the adjective fewer in the colloquial variety of speech has been replaced by less, so that the normative (and more conservative) “fewer people” comes out as “less people,” etc. The norm requires fewer whenever the noun quantified is a so-called count noun, and less when it is a so-called mass noun. The directionality of the replacement of fewer by less even when the noun modified is a mass noun is clear in one distinct respect: the shorter of the two adjectives is winning out in the drift of the language over the longer one. The semiotic upshot of this drift is equally clear: the meaning of lesser number is better fitted to the form that is shorter, i. e., to less rather than to fewer, since the latter is one syllable longer than the former. Here we have the establishment over time of the iconic principle, understood in this case as the triumph of uniformity over variety.\nMarkedness also plays a role in this development collaterally. The marked is defined as the conceptually more restricted than the unmarked, a principle that can take several hypostases. Here the adjective fewer, applying as it does normatively to count nouns, is the marked member because individuation (as in counting) is marked vis-à-vis non-individuation (as in sets or groups). The drift away from fewer toward less is thus an instantiation of the semiotic principle that dictates the change from marked to unmarked in the long run."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:404ab2a3-a8b3-461a-87d8-dd4cd8e4a60e>","<urn:uuid:ceb2d9ff-937e-4b02-bf25-7aa040b74fe7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a historian studying winter holiday traditions, I'm curious how the maritime heritage of Chania's Venetian Harbour compares to Baltimore's Christmas harbor celebrations - what unique features define each waterfront during festive times?","answer":"While both harbors embrace maritime traditions during celebrations, they offer distinct experiences. Chania's Venetian Harbour showcases its 14th-century architecture with a mix of Cretan, Ottoman and Venetian elements, centered around its iconic lighthouse and Firkas Fort. In contrast, Baltimore's harbor transforms for Christmas with modern festivities like the German Christmas Village market, ice skating at the 6,000-square-foot Pandora Rink, and special holiday water taxi tours that showcase the harbor's light displays. Chania's harbor focuses on year-round restaurants and cafes in historic buildings, while Baltimore's Inner Harbor specifically caters to seasonal celebrations with temporary installations and events.","context":["One rarely finds a place so full of historical memories, which unfold before our eyes with exquisite skill through the architecture of the buildings looking onto the Venetian harbour, bearing scents from past times, drawing the visitor into a nostalgic game of the senses, a mixture of East and West.

You will find there is a balanced mixing of Cretan, Ottoman and Venetian elements, beautiful narrow alleys across the old town and amazing architecture. The old harbour area beckons you to enjoy a carefree journey through time as you explore it. Shall we then?\nThe old port is a fascinating place any time of the day or year, as the sun creates a variety of visual effects and gives the impression you see a different place each time you visit it! Start your walk at the NW part of it where you will see the imposing Lighthouse, the ‘jewel’ of the harbour. To your right lie the Firkas Fort built by the Venetians in order to protect the port entrance. There is a captivating brick-coloured building at the Fort entrance which once housed the Venetian naval guards. Nowadays you will find the Maritime Museum of Crete with a valuable collection of naval objects providing insight into the rich history of Chania and W. Crete. Right after that, walk along Angelou St., an upward alley which is one of the loveliest backstreets of the Topanas quarter. Feast your eyes on the Venetian architecture typical of the 16th and 17th centuries. If you fancy some more strolling, walk along the streets that begin from the coast and lead to the most beautiful part of the old town of Chania.\nThe history of Chania Venetian Harbour\nThe Venetian harbour of Chania was built by the Venetians between 1320 and 1356. The harbour was used for commerce and also to control the Sea of Crete against pirates. The Venetian harbour had room for 40 galleys, but it constantly silted up and was never very deep, so it kept having to be dredged, a difficult job with the equipment of the time. On its north side the harbour is protected by a breakwater. Near the middle of this is a small bulwark like a gun emplacement and the tiny chapel of St Nicholas. This was where the Venetians and Turks executed condemned prisoners.\nThe Firkas Fortress at the harbour entrance and the St Nicholas bastion in the middle of the breakwater defended the harbour from raiders.Today, the Venetian harbour offers moorage for fishing boats and other small craft, while the commercial and passenger port of Chania is seven kilometres to the east, in Souda Bay. The lighthouse is a distinctive feature of the harbour. It was built at the harbour entrance by the Venetians and restored in its present form by the Egyptians (1830-1840). The lighthouse of the Venetian harbour of Chania always fascinates visitors and is one of the most-photographed monuments in Crete.\n- Municipality of Chania: +30 28213 41600\n- Airport of Chania: +30 28210 83800\n- Hospital of Chania: +30 28210 22000\n- Police Station: +30 28210 25856\n- Port Authority: +30 28210 98888\n- Post Office: +30 28210 28444\n- Tourist Office: +30 28210 92943\n- Archaeological Museum: +30 28210 90334\n- Byzantine Collection: +30 28210 96046\n- Folklore Museum: +30 28210 90816\n- Nautical Museum: +30 28210 91875\n- War Museum: +30 28210 44156","Looking to spend Christmas in Baltimore?

But as Meridian CEO Larry Moliterno says, they are also taking the lead in our community in Prevention efforts, to stop addiction before it starts. There are steps families can also take to help in this effort.\nThe Face of Addiction…and the Faces of Recovery\nby Larry Moliterno\nWhen I ask people what they think the “Face of Addiction” looks like, I typically get the same answers. They tend to think of a down-and-out man or woman living under a bridge, or walking the streets aimlessly looking for their next fix. They may think of someone robbing an older woman in the grocery store parking lot, or a gang of kids smoking in a car.\nWe think like this because this is the way addiction is typically portrayed. In movies and on television, we see those struggling with drugs and alcohol as either poor and willing to do anything to get their hands on drugs — or else as really wealthy and scheming around their use.\nBut what addiction really is…is a disease that affects everyone. Two-thirds of American families are touched by addiction. Addiction affects the parents cheering next to you at your son’s soccer game, the young girl working diligently to get into a good college, the army veteran looking for a steady job, and the mom dropping her young kids off at pre-school.\nAddiction is everywhere and does not discriminate. Chief Development Officer for Subway Don Ferryman; Actress Jamie Lee Curtis; Actor Robert Downey Jr.; Chief of Staff at SAMSHA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) Tom Coderre; Singers Demi Lovato and Sir Elton John; and Best-Selling Author William Cope Moyers —all have dealt with addiction themselves, and they aren’t the typical “Face of Addiction.”\nThe examples I gave above aren’t just stories I use — they’re people who have gone through treatment and fight for their recovery every day.\nPrescription drug use has been on the rise for the last few decades. We’ve discussed that here before. In the suburbs — where people typically think addiction is not a problem — highly educated and more affluent households are more likely to have access to prescription pain medications, including frequently used drugs such as opioids, and stimulants such as oxycontin and Adderall. These drugs can lead to heroin use.\nAccording to SAMHSA, the number of teenagers between the ages of 12 and 17 introduced to heroin has grown by 80 percent since 2002. The vast majority of teenagers who turn to heroin (close to 90 percent) are white and live in the suburbs — a far cry from what is perceived to be the “Face of Addiction.”\nThis point of this article is to not to suggest that you take your family and friends and go to some remote location where drugs can’t find you. It’s to let you know that addiction isn’t some far-fetched idea that only affects “those people.” We need to recognize that, at any time, anyone can be affected — so we must begin to work towards the goals of treatment for all and prevention for all our kids.\nAt Meridian, we will continue to treat as many people as we can — no matter what walk of life they come from. But we also address the problem through prevention and stopping addiction before it starts, with initiatives such as the PANDA Leaders Club, Families Who Know and our Community Education programs.\nThe people who I named earlier are all people who struggled with an addiction. But they are now the Faces of Recovery. They are successful in their careers and have continued to advocate for treatment. This is something that we in the recovery world celebrate!\nMeridian’s CEO Participates in Trivisonno Show Townhall on Heroin\nMeridian’s President/CEO, Larry Moliterno had the opportunity to participate in WTAM1100’s Mike Trivisonno Show – Townhall on Heroin with Attorney General Mike DeWine. The Triv Show and Ohio AG Mike Dewine selected a distinguished panel of experts to discuss ways to combat the heroin epidemic. The event was divided into three segments, including a law enforcement perspective, treatment/recovery perspective and a Q&A session.\nTo listen to the entire show, please visit Mike Trivisonno Show Townhall on Heroin\nCrossroads Comedy Rivalry Crushes It!\nMore than $18,000 was raised at the Crossroads Comedy Rivalry on October 20 to help fund Addiction Prevention, Education and Treatment/Recovery at Meridian HealthCare. And this event really put the “FUN” in fundraising. No doubt about it, it was a hilarious and successful evening.\nAfter the show, several of the comedians paused to chat with Meridian’s CEO and share a few more laughs.\n(L–R above: Comedians Mike Wysocki and Sean Collier, Meridian CEO Larry Moliterno, and comedian Aaron Kleiber.)\nYSU’s Jambar “Clash of Comedy: Cleveland Versus Pittsburgh” highlights Meridian’s Comedy Fundraiser\nA Jambar story entitled “Clash of Comedy: Cleveland Versus Pittsburgh” highlights Meridian’s Comedy Show Fundraiser in October.\nVindicator “Comedians from rival cities will share stage” features Meridian’s upcoming fundraiser\nA Vindicator story entitled “Comedians from rival cities will share stage” features Meridian’s upcoming fundraiser, which will raise money for prevention and recovery in the Valley.\nProtecting Our Children from Addiction – Part 3\nby Larry Moliterno\nThe last few months we’ve been discussing why, as a community, we don’t protect our children from addiction like we protect them from car accidents, sunburn, and other diseases/safety hazards. But how do we start to do this?\nWe first have to remember that this is not just a school problem, it’s a community problem. School-based efforts should be made in context with other programs and support in the community.\nStudies show that strategies work best when they are integrated and reinforce each other — at home, in schools, within the community, and in the media. So if we bring the whole community together, we’ll see a real impact.\nWhat can schools do? Schools can institute more prevention programs — in a more formal educational model, and in a less formal peer-driven model like Meridian’s PANDA program. These programs have been proven to be effective in not only reducing drug use, but also in reducing negative behaviors. Schools can also create more opportunities for extracurricular activities in addition to sports. Students taking part in these extracurricular activities are less likely to be involved in drug use. Schools can look at truancy and behavioral issues as an opportunity to get to the root of the problem — shifting the focus from punishing bad behavior toward prevention and providing help and support.\nWhat can parents do?\nBelieve it or not, parents — your children are listening to you. When kids who don’t drink were asked who was their number-one influence in making that decision, they said their parents. Take advantage of that time you have with them to talk with them — and more importantly, listen. Get to know what they want out of life, their dreams and aspirations.\nWhat can legislators do?\nLegislators can help enact laws that keep drugs out of young people’s reach and help remove the barriers for people trying to access treatment. Legislators can also help restore the Safe and Drug-Free School dollars that have been taken away from our schools.\nWhat can religious leaders do?\nReligious leaders can use the power of the pulpit to raise awareness of the addiction problem in our community and help connect people to community resources.\nWhat can medical professionals do?\nRoutine annual medical visits are an opportunity to identify mental health and drug use issues. We need more medical professionals to recommend these screenings, which will help identify problems like depression or drug use early on.\nWhat can business leaders do?\nBusiness leaders can create more mentoring opportunities for kids to get involved locally. Being involved helps kids develop a sense of purpose and real hope for their future.\nWhat can law enforcement do?\nLocal law enforcement can create more juvenile diversion programs to help families who have a child who is just beginning down the wrong path. These programs will help address the problem before it gets worse.\nWhat can treatment providers do?\nTreatment providers should be addressing the whole person, rather than just focusing on his or her drug use or mental health illness. Let’s build up that recovery capital that helps prevent any future use and work hard to provide immediate access into treatment.\nWhat can the media do?\nThey can help us tell our story and help celebrate the positive results of the community’s efforts.\nThat’s real prevention.\nIs it going to be easy?\nBut if we invest our skills, our resources and our energies into working together to protect our kids — in a true, diverse, community-based prevention strategy —we’ll be successful, and we all will benefit.\nProtecting Our Children from Addiction – Part 2\nby Larry Moliterno\nWe know that we’re struggling with addiction in our community at epidemic levels. But is it possible to prevent addiction before it happens? Last month, I discussed all the safety precautions we routinely put in place to keep our children safe; yet we seem to lack in funding and resources when it comes to preventing our kids from addiction.\nIn order to fully understand how, as a community, we can protect our kids — we need to understand why kids use in the first place. Part of it is physiological. The prefrontal cortex of the brain isn’t fully developed until around age 21. This is the part of the brain that allows humans to understand consequences and make rational decisions. That’s why kids are more likely to be impulsive and take risks.\nConsider this too: when something hurts, what do we do? We take a pill, and the pain goes away. Why would kids think it’s any different to stop emotional hurt? Take a pill, and it will go away.\nAccording to SAMHSA (the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration), there are many risk factors that influence a person’s chance of developing a mental health or substance use disorder. Effective prevention focuses on reducing those risk factors, and strengthening the protective factors that are most closely related to the problem being addressed.\nRisk factors are characteristics at the biological, psychological, family, community or cultural level that precede and are associated with a higher likelihood of negative outcomes. There are risk periods that increase the likelihood of substance abuse as well as other risky behaviors.\nFor example, changes in physical development, social change, relationships, family dynamics, change in responsibility, and academic pressure can all be considered either a risk period or a risk factor. These risk periods/factors have a lot of sources, including personal, family and friends, school and the community.\nWhen one of these risk factors arises, instead of assuming our kids are fine or punishing them for acting out, we need to take it as an opportunity to understand why he or she is acting this way. Maybe he’s upset because something is going on at home…maybe he’s hurting because he was rejected by the girl he has a crush on…maybe she’s embarrassed by the acne on her face. If we don’t find the root cause of the behavior, we could be making the problem worse.\nAlong with the risk factors, we also recognize that there are protective factors in kids’ lives that reduce the likelihood of substance use and risky behavior. Protective factors are characteristics associated with a lower likelihood of negative outcomes; they can also reduce a risk factor’s impact.\nSome examples of protective factors are developing social skills and coping abilities, finding a strong adult role model who demonstrates what a healthy relationship should look like, and getting involved in extracurricular activities to create a sense of belonging and worth. Another is a child being recognized and rewarded for his or her contributions, which helps build self-esteem.\nProviding these protective factors is not just the responsibility of schools, but of the entire community. Simply put, we need to identify kids in risk periods, engage them, and provide more opportunities to take advantage of protective factors.\nSo how do we do this? Next month I’ll explain how our community — including schools, parents, legislators, religious leaders, medical professionals, business leaders, law enforcement, treatment providers, and even kids — can come together to help protect our kids from addiction."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c36dbbfa-fb26-433c-beb6-d5cec16be91e>","<urn:uuid:ed1d2c02-e77d-4263-92ac-ddd92bafda47>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Kansas City's Kauffman Center and Miami's cultural venues compare in terms of performing arts offerings?","answer":"The Kauffman Center, modeled after Sydney Opera House, offers theatre, opera, and orchestra performances at the edge of the Crossroads district. Similarly, Miami features diverse performing arts through the Miami City Ballet, one of the most diverse classical ballet companies in the nation, along with the New World Symphony's 87 young musicians and the Florida Grand Opera, one of Florida's oldest performing arts organizations.","context":["The Crossroads Arts District is leading the charge in Kansas City’s cultural boom. Restaurants, local retailers, loft space, hotels, offices and the KC Streetcar have helped revitalize an area that, until the last few years, was primarily populated by the brick husks of long-gone businesses.\nWhat turned things around? There were a lot of factors. Crossroads’ events, specifically First Fridays, played an undeniable role. As a nationwide return to urban areas was influencing the business and living decisions of Kansas City residents, Crossroads’ events were welcoming thousands of individuals to experience this unique neighborhood — a crisscross grid of short brick buildings crammed in between the towering downtown skyline to the north and high-rises of Hospital Hill to the south.\nToday, new developments are popping up in the form of new construction and business. The Crossroads’ events that helped propel the district forward are still ongoing throughout the year. This guide to the Crossroads will give you some events to attend and some food to try while you are there.\nFirst Fridays is a monthly street fair that has blossomed into one of the largest events in the entire city. It happens on — you guessed it — the first Friday of each month, all year long. This tradition began in 1995, when Kansas City was struggling to be more than office buildings and parking lots. Urban living was near an all-time low, which made street-level storefronts for art, retail and dining hard to maintain. Of all the Crossroads’ events, this one is intricately linked to the return of livelihood to downtown.\nThe festivities begin at 5 pm. It might be worth showing up right at the beginning, because First Fridays will be packed, especially on nice evenings. Thousands of people flood the Crossroads’ streets. Traffic is diverted to only a few roads as the connecting streets are shut down for food trucks, concert stages, art booths and other entertainment.\nYou’ll be surrounded by all of the Crossroads’ best restaurants during First Fridays, and this can be a great time to try them out. However, it’s probably best to take advantage of the eclectic community of food trucks that gather at this event. You won’t find a more diverse collection of menu offerings within one city block any other time in Kansas City.\nYou have to start with First Fridays when you’re looking at Crossroads’ events. But we’re not done, because there’s a lot more to do.\nWhere to Find Other Crossroads Events\nYou won’t find a ton of events in the Crossroads that are annual festivals. What you will find is a full event calendar with entertaining options anywhere you look. Here are a few reoccurring events that you can always look for when you’re planning a night out in Kansas City.\nKauffman Center for Performing Arts\nA crown jewel of the Crossroads, the Kauffman Center catches your eye immediately. Modeled after the world-famous Sydney Opera House, the sparkling venue sits at the top of a hill on the northwest edge of the Crossroads, the last building before crossing over into the true downtown area. At the Kauffman Center, you can find theatre, opera, orchestra and more Crossroads’ events throughout the year. If you are looking for a nice evening out, it might be the best place in Kansas City to start.\nBack in the 1930s, the Crossroads was most known for its connection to Hollywood. Before the digital age, major studios needed a central point of distribution for all their movies. Kansas City made sense, and “Film Row” was established in the Crossroads. This is the earliest roots of the Crossroads’ artistic sensibilities. Film Row paved the way for the many art galleries operating in the area today. If you are looking for Crossroads’ events, it’s never a bad idea to check out all of the gallery shows happening each week.\nJazz in Kansas City\nThe rhythm of jazz reverberates in the foundation of Kansas City. The historic 18th & Vine Jazz District is a nationwide epicenter for this classic style of music. But you can also find jazz at Crossroads’ events in the arts district. The Green Lady Lounge and Black Dolphin jazz lounges, directly next to each other on Grand Boulevard, are premiere listening destinations. Take a seat, grab a cold cocktail and take in the music.\nExhibits at Union Station\nUnion Station is one of the most beautiful buildings in Kansas City. It was established in1914 as the transit hub of not only the city, but the whole region. As rail travel declined, Union Station transitioned into a cultural center with exhibits, shops, restaurants and entertainment. You should always take a look at what’s happening at Union Station for Crossroads’ events.\nRestaurants to Try at Crossroads Events\nWhether you’re catching a performance of the Lyric Opera at the Kauffman Center or a happy hour jazz performance at the Green Lady, there are plenty of delicious Crossroads restaurants to explore. Check out our complete guide to good bites in the Crossroads for an extensive overview. But for now, here are some restaurants to complement the Crossroads’ events you are going to attend.\n- Jack Stack at the Freight House: Upscale barbecue with old-school flavor in a beautifully renovated historic building on the southern edge of the Crossroads\n- Lidia’s KC: A family-owned, historic Italian restaurant worthy of a nice evening out after attending a performance at the Kauffman Center or visiting galleries in the Crossroads\n- Mission Taco: Chow down on tacos, burritos or tortas at a cheap price without sacrificing any of the flavor\n- The Parlor: Kansas City’s first true food hall experience, choose between seven different restaurants in one building at the east Crossroads hangout\nThe Crossroads is a vibrant district at the heart of Kansas City’s continually blooming culture. Crossroads events are a great way to get to know the city, whether it’s a walk around First Fridays or an evening with the KC Symphony. We hope you find experiences that create memories at Crossroads’ events, and find some good food while you’re at it.","Must-See Galleries, Museums and Cultural Events in Miami\nWith its design district, notable museums and countless art galleries, Miami is one of the most culturally-rich cities in the country.

{"question":"As a machine learning researcher, I'm interested in understanding the key differences between perceptron algorithms and clustering techniques in terms of their learning approaches and supervision requirements. How do they fundamentally differ?","answer":"Perceptron and clustering fundamentally differ in their learning approaches. Perceptron is a supervised learning method used for binary classification, where it learns from a set of training data with predefined classes to classify objects. It works by automatically learning weight coefficients to make classification decisions. In contrast, clustering is an unsupervised learning method that groups similar data points together without predefined classes. Clustering techniques look for similarities and differences in datasets and group similar records into segments automatically, with clusters taking different forms depending on the data analyzed. The clusters are not predefined and the process requires iterative discovery and parameter adjustment until desired properties are achieved.","context":["What is the algorithm for perceptron?\nThe Perceptron algorithm is a two-class (binary) classification machine learning algorithm. It is a type of neural network model, perhaps the simplest type of neural network model. It consists of a single node or neuron that takes a row of data as input and predicts a class label.\nHow do you make a perceptron in Matlab?\nYou can create a perceptron with the following: net = perceptron; net = configure(net,P,T);\nWhat is perceptron convergence algorithm?\nPerceptron Convergence Theorem: For any finite set of linearly separable labeled examples, the Perceptron Learning Algorithm will halt after a finite number of iterations. In other words, after a finite number of iterations, the algorithm yields a vector w that classifies perfectly all the examples.\nHow do you calculate perceptron?\nThe first step in the perceptron classification process is calculating the weighted sum of the perceptron’s inputs and weights. To do this, multiply each input value by its respective weight and then add all of these products together.\nWhat is perceptron example?\nImagine a perceptron (in your brain). The perceptron tries to decide if you should go to a concert.\nWhat are the types of perceptron?\nBased on the layers, Perceptron models are divided into two types. These are as follows: Single-layer Perceptron Model. Multi-layer Perceptron model.\nWhat is neural network in Matlab?\nA neural network (also called an artificial neural network) is an adaptive system that learns by using interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles a human brain. A neural network can learn from data—so it can be trained to recognize patterns, classify data, and forecast future events.\nWhat is Perceptron in neural network?\nA Perceptron is a neural network unit that does certain computations to detect features or business intelligence in the input data. It is a function that maps its input “x,” which is multiplied by the learned weight coefficient, and generates an output value ”f(x).\nIs perceptron supervised learning?\nIn machine learning, the perceptron (or McCulloch-Pitts neuron) is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class.\nHow do you calculate bias in perceptron?\nA Bias is the Weight of an Always-Active Input\nWe add the product of all n -numbered w ‘s and their n -numbered x ‘s together, and then we add that result to the bias, b . In this equation, we can also represent b , by adding another input whose activation is always 1 , and multiplying it by a weight equal to b .\nWhat are perceptron types?\nWhy is perceptron used?\nPerceptron is usually used to classify the data into two parts.

The information is abundant, but only those who know how to use it can benefit from it.\nData mining techniques are used in many areas of research, including mathematics, cybernetics, genetics, and marketing. They are a means of predicting customer behavior.\nEach type of data mining application is supported by a set of algorithmic approaches that are used to extract the relevant relationships in the data.\nThese approaches differ depending on the type of problem you are trying to solve.\nAfter reading this article, you’ll come to know the difference between the two most prominent approaches i.e. clustering and classification.\nData Mining Clustering vs. Classification\nClustering is a method of machine learning that involves grouping data points by similarity.\nThe two common clustering algorithms in data mining are K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.\nIt is an unsupervised learning method and a popular technique for statistical data analysis.\nFor a given set of points, you can use classification algorithms to classify these individual data points into specific groups.\nAs a result, data points in a particular group exhibit similar properties. At the same time, the data points of different groups have different characteristics.\nThe clustering algorithm and appropriate parameter settings depend on the individual datasets. It is not an automatic task, but an iterative discovery process.\nTherefore, it is necessary to modify the data processing and the modeling of the parameters until the result reaches the desired properties.\nClustering techniques look for similarities and differences in a data set and groups similar records into segments or clusters, automatically, according to some criterion or metric.\nUnlike classification, clusters are not predefined and can take different forms depending on the data analyzed.\nClassification is a categorization method that practices a set of training data to distinguish, differentiate, and recognize objects.\nIt is a supervised learning method in which a set of training & well-defined observations are available.\nUsually, in the classification you have a set of predefined classes. It assigns individual data objects to certain predefined classes that were previously not assigned to these classes.\nThe algorithm that performs the classification is the classifier while the observations are the instances.\nClassification looks for new patterns, even if it means changing the way the data is organized.\nThe most popular classification algorithms in data mining are the K-Nearest Neighbor and decision tree algorithms.\nClassification is a predictive modeling approach for predicting the value of certain and constant target variables.\nFabricating on the database, the model will build sets of binary rules to divide and classify the highest proportion of similar target variables.\nAlso Discover: Pros and Cons of Data Mining Explained\nClassification is a supervised learning whereas clustering is an unsupervised learning approach.\nClustering groups similar instances on the basis of characteristics while the classification specifies predefined labels to instances on the basis of characteristics.\nClustering divides the dataset into subsets to group together instances with similar functionality. It does not use labeled data or a training set.\nOn the contrary, classification classifies new data based on observations from the training set. The training set is labeled.\nAlthough you can practice each method separately, it is considered common to use both when conducting an analysis.\nEach method has unique benefits and blends to increase the robustness, durability, and overall utility of data mining models.\nSupervised models can take benefit of the nesting of variables determined from unsupervised methods.\nYou May Also Like To Read:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e7c6522c-dfe6-4f6e-822a-e648695db314>","<urn:uuid:4e9e40c1-38ba-47b2-8139-1919001ccbef>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the diagnostic challenges that doctors face when evaluating hormonal disorders like Cushing syndrome versus thyroid problems?","answer":"Both conditions present diagnostic challenges. For Cushing syndrome, diagnosing can be a long and extensive process requiring multiple medical appointments and various tests to determine cortisol levels. Similarly, thyroid disorders can be difficult to diagnose as routine blood tests often fail to detect insufficient hormone levels in some patients. Additionally, both conditions share overlapping symptoms like fatigue and depression, which can lead to confusion in diagnosis. The symptoms can also vary widely from person to person in both conditions, making it harder for doctors to detect the underlying issue.","context":["Cushing syndrome occurs when your body is exposed to high levels of the hormone cortisol for a long time. The most common cause of Cushing syndrome, sometimes called hypercortisolism, is the use of oral corticosteroid medication. The condition can also occur when your body makes too much cortisol.\nToo much cortisol can produce some of the hallmark signs of Cushing syndrome — a fatty hump between your shoulders, a rounded face, and pink or purple stretch marks on your skin. Cushing syndrome can also result in high blood pressure, bone loss and, on occasion, diabetes.\nTreatments for Cushing syndrome can return your body's cortisol production to normal and noticeably improve your symptoms. The earlier treatment begins, the better your chances for recovery.\nThe signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome vary.\nCommon signs and symptoms involve progressive obesity and skin changes, such as:\n- Weight gain and fatty tissue deposits, particularly around the midsection and upper back, in the face (moon face), and between the shoulders (buffalo hump)\n- Pink or purple stretch marks (striae) on the skin of the abdomen, thighs, breasts and arms\n- Thinning, fragile skin that bruises easily\n- Slow healing of cuts, insect bites and infections\nWomen with Cushing syndrome may experience:\n- Thicker or more visible body and facial hair (hirsutism)\n- Irregular or absent menstrual periods\nMen with Cushing syndrome may experience:\n- Decreased libido\n- Decreased fertility\n- Erectile dysfunction\nOther signs and symptoms include:\n- Muscle weakness\n- Depression, anxiety and irritability\n- Loss of emotional control\n- Cognitive difficulties\n- New or worsened high blood pressure\n- Glucose intolerance that may lead to diabetes\n- Bone loss, leading to fractures over time\nWhen to see a doctor\nIf you're taking corticosteroid medications to treat a condition, such as asthma, arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, and experience signs and symptoms that may indicate Cushing syndrome, see your doctor for an evaluation. Even if you're not using these drugs and you have symptoms that suggest the possible presence of Cushing syndrome, contact your doctor.\nCushing syndrome results from excess levels of the hormone cortisol in your body. Your endocrine system consists of glands that produce hormones that regulate processes throughout your body. These glands include the adrenal glands, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, pancreas, ovaries (in females) and testicles (in men).\nYour adrenal glands produce a number of hormones, including cortisol. Cortisol plays a variety of roles in your body. For example, cortisol helps regulate your blood pressure and keeps your cardiovascular system functioning normally. It also helps your body respond to stress and regulates the way you convert (metabolize) proteins, carbohydrates and fats in your diet into usable energy. However, when the level of cortisol is too high in your body, you may develop Cushing syndrome.\nThe role of corticosteroids\nCushing syndrome can develop from a cause that originates outside of your body (exogenous Cushing syndrome). Taking corticosteroid medications in high doses over an extended period of time may result in Cushing syndrome. These medications, such as prednisone, have the same effects as does the cortisol produced by your body.\nYour doctor may prescribe corticosteroids to treat inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and asthma, or to prevent your body from rejecting a transplanted organ. Because the doses required to treat these conditions are often higher than the amount of cortisol your body normally needs each day, the effects of excess cortisol can occur.\nPeople can also develop Cushing syndrome from injectable corticosteroids — for example, repeated injections for joint pain, bursitis and back pain. While certain inhaled steroid medicines (taken for asthma) and steroid skin creams (used for skin disorders such as eczema) are in the same general category of drugs, they're less likely to cause Cushing syndrome, but may in some individuals especially if taken in high doses.\nYour body's own overproduction\nThe condition may also be due to your body's own overproduction of cortisol (endogenous Cushing syndrome). This may occur from excess production by one or both adrenal glands, or overproduction of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which normally regulates cortisol production. In these cases, Cushing syndrome may be related to:\n- A pituitary gland tumor (pituitary adenoma). A noncancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain, secretes an excess amount of ACTH, which in turn stimulates the adrenal glands to make more cortisol. When this form of the syndrome develops, it's called Cushing disease. It occurs much more often in women and is the most common form of endogenous Cushing syndrome.\n- An ectopic ACTH-secreting tumor. Rarely, when a tumor develops in an organ that normally does not produce ACTH, the tumor will begin to secrete this hormone in excess, resulting in Cushing syndrome. These tumors, which can be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant), are usually found in the lungs, pancreas, thyroid or thymus gland.\n- A primary adrenal gland disease. In some people, the cause of Cushing syndrome is excess cortisol secretion that doesn't depend on stimulation from ACTH and is associated with disorders of the adrenal glands. The most common of these disorders is a noncancerous tumor of the adrenal cortex, called an adrenal adenoma. Cancerous tumors of the adrenal cortex (adrenocortical carcinomas) are rare, but they can cause Cushing syndrome as well. Occasionally, benign, nodular enlargement of both adrenal glands can result in Cushing syndrome.\n- Familial Cushing syndrome. Rarely, people inherit a tendency to develop tumors on one or more of their endocrine glands, affecting cortisol levels and causing Cushing syndrome.\nIf you don't receive prompt treatment for Cushing syndrome, other complications may occur, such as:\n- Bone loss (osteoporosis), which can result in unusual bone fractures, such as rib fractures and fractures of the bones in the feet\n- High blood pressure (hypertension)\n- Frequent or unusual infections\n- Loss of muscle mass and strength\nWhen the cause of Cushing syndrome is a pituitary tumor (Cushing disease), it can sometimes lead to other problems, such as interfering with the production of other hormones controlled by the pituitary.\nYou're likely to start by seeing your family doctor or a general practitioner. However, in some cases when you call to set up an appointment, you may be referred immediately to an endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in endocrine (hormonal) disorders.\nIt's a good idea to prepare for your appointment so that you can make the most of your time with your doctor. Here's some information to help you get ready, and what to expect from your doctor.\nWhat you can do\n- Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions. At the time you make the appointment, be sure to ask if there's anything you need to do in advance to prepare for diagnostic tests.\n- Write down any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment. For example, if you've had headaches more frequently or if you've been feeling down or more tired than usual, this is important information to share with your doctor. Also tell your doctor about changes in your physical appearance, such as weight gain, new acne or increased body hair.\n- Write down key personal information, including any changes in your personal relationships and in your sex life. Let your doctor know if the people closest to you have noticed that you seem irritable or that you seem to have more mood swings than in the past. It may help to take along a photo of yourself that shows any changes in your physical appearance since you've started experiencing symptoms.\n- Make a list of all medications, as well as any vitamins, creams or supplements, that you're currently taking or have used in the past. Include on your list the specific name, dose and dates of any steroid medications you've taken in the past, such as cortisone injections.\n- Take a family member or friend along, if possible. Sometimes it can be difficult to soak up all the information provided to you during an appointment. Someone who accompanies you may remember something that you missed or forgot.\n- Write down questions to ask your doctor.\nYour time with your doctor is limited, so preparing a list of questions will help you make the most of your time together. List your questions from most important to least important in case time runs out. For Cushing syndrome, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:\n- What is likely causing my symptoms or condition?\n- Are there other possible causes for my symptoms or condition?\n- What kinds of diagnostic tests do I need? How are these tests performed?\n- What are my treatment options?\n- Will my physical signs and symptoms improve with treatment? Will I see a difference in my appearance as well as in the way I feel?\n- Will treatment help make me feel more emotionally stable?\n- What long-term impact could each treatment option have? Will there be an impact on my ability to have children?\n- How will you follow my response to treatment over time?\n- Are there any alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?\n- I have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?\n- Are there any restrictions that I need to follow?\n- Should I see a specialist?\n- Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing?\n- Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can take home with me? What websites do you recommend?\nIn addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask questions during your appointment.\nWhat to expect from your doctor\nYour doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may reserve time to go over any points you want to spend more time on. Your doctor may ask:\n- When did you first begin experiencing symptoms?\n- Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional? Have they gotten worse over time?\n- Have you noticed any changes in your sexual performance or your interest in sex?\n- For women, has your menstrual cycle changed or have you stopped having your period?\n- Have you gained weight? On what part of your body?\n- Have you had difficulty controlling your emotions?\n- Have you noticed that you bruise more easily, or that wounds and infections take longer to heal than in the past?\n- Do you have weakness in your muscles, such as difficulty getting out of the tub or walking stairs?\n- Have you developed new acne or more body or facial hair?\n- Have you been taking a corticosteroid medication? For how long?\n- What, if anything, seems to either improve or worsen your symptoms?\nDiagnosing Cushing syndrome can be a long and extensive process. You may not have any firm answers about your condition until you've had a series of medical appointments.\nTreatments for Cushing syndrome are designed to lower the high level of cortisol in your body. The best treatment for you depends on the cause of the syndrome. Treatment options include:\nReducing corticosteroid use. If the cause of Cushing syndrome is long-term use of corticosteroid medications, your doctor may be able to keep your Cushing signs and symptoms under control by reducing the dosage of the drug over a period of time, while still adequately managing your asthma, arthritis or other condition. For many of these medical problems, your doctor can prescribe noncorticosteroid drugs, which will allow him or her to reduce the dosage or eliminate the use of corticosteroids altogether.\nDon't reduce the dose of corticosteroid drugs or stop taking them on your own. Do so only under your doctor's supervision. Abruptly discontinuing these medications could lead to deficient cortisol levels. Slowly tapering off corticosteroid drugs allows your body to resume normal cortisol production.\nSurgery. If the cause of Cushing syndrome is a tumor, your doctor may recommend complete surgical removal. Pituitary tumors are typically removed by a neurosurgeon, who may perform the procedure through your nose. If a tumor is present in the adrenal glands, lungs or pancreas, the surgeon can remove it through a standard operation or in some cases by using minimally invasive surgical techniques, with smaller incisions.\nAfter the operation, you'll need to take cortisol replacement medications to provide your body with the correct amount of cortisol. In most cases, you'll eventually experience a return of normal adrenal hormone production, and your doctor can taper off the replacement drugs. However, this process can take up to a year or longer. In some instances, people with Cushing syndrome never experience a resumption of normal adrenal function; they then need lifelong replacement therapy.\n- Radiation therapy. If the surgeon can't totally remove a pituitary tumor, he or she will usually prescribe radiation therapy to be used in conjunction with the operation. Additionally, radiation may be used for people who aren't suitable candidates for surgery. Radiation can be given in small doses over a six-week period or by a technique called stereotactic radiosurgery (Gamma Knife surgery). In the latter procedure, administered as a single treatment, a large dose of radiation is delivered to the tumor, and the radiation exposure to surrounding tissues is minimized.\nMedications. Medications can be used to control cortisol production when surgery and radiation don't work. Medications may also be used before surgery in people who have become very sick with Cushing syndrome. Doctors recommend drug therapy before surgery to improve signs and symptoms and minimize surgical risk. Medications to control excessive production of cortisol include ketoconazole (Nizoral), mitotane (Lysodren) and metyrapone (Metopirone). The Food and Drug Administration has also approved the use of mifepristone (Korlym) for people with Cushing syndrome who have type 2 diabetes or glucose intolerance. Mifepristone does not decrease cortisol production, but it blocks the effect of cortisol on your tissues.\nIn some cases, the tumor or its treatment will cause other hormones produced by the pituitary or adrenal gland to become deficient and your doctor will recommend hormone replacement medications.\nIf none of these treatment options is effective, your doctor may recommend surgical removal of your adrenal glands (bilateral adrenalectomy). This procedure will cure excess production of cortisol. However, your ACTH levels will remain high, possibly causing excess pigmentation of your skin.\nThe length of your recovery from Cushing syndrome will depend on the severity and cause of your condition. Remember to be patient. You didn't develop Cushing syndrome overnight, and your symptoms won't disappear overnight either. In the meantime, these tips may help you on your journey back to health.\n- Increase activities slowly. You may be in such a hurry to get your old self back that you push yourself too hard too fast, but your weakened muscles need a slower approach. Work up to a reasonable level of exercise or activity that feels comfortable without overdoing it. You'll improve little by little, and your persistence will be rewarded.\n- Eat sensibly. Nutritious, wholesome foods provide a good source of fuel for your recovering body and can help you lose the extra pounds that you gained from Cushing syndrome. Make sure you're getting enough calcium and vitamin D. Taken together, they help your body absorb calcium, which can help strengthen your bones, counteracting the bone density loss that often occurs with Cushing syndrome.\n- Monitor your mental health. Depression can be a side effect of Cushing syndrome, but it can also persist or develop after treatment begins. Don't ignore your depression or wait it out. Seek help promptly from your doctor or a therapist if you're depressed, overwhelmed or having difficulty coping during your recovery.\n- Gently soothe aches and pains. Hot baths, massages and low-impact exercises, such as water aerobics and tai chi, can help alleviate some of the muscle and joint pain that accompanies Cushing syndrome recovery.\n- Exercise your brain. If you're recovering from any cognitive difficulties as a result of Cushing syndrome, mental exercises, such as math problems and crossword puzzles, may improve your brain function.\nSupport groups can be valuable in dealing with Cushing syndrome and recovery. They bring you together with other people who are coping with the same kinds of challenges, along with their families and friends, and offer a setting in which you can share common problems.\nAsk your doctor about support groups in your community. Your local health department, public library and telephone book as well as the Internet also may be good sources to find a support group in your area.\nMar. 28, 2013\n- Stratakis CA.

Its main functions are to regulate energy production and metabolism throughout the body—everywhere from the heart to the skin. Too much or too little of this hormone can have serious consequences.\nMany patients with thyroid disorders experience excessive fatigue, depression, hair loss, unexplained weight gain and sleep problems. However, routine blood test often fail to detect insufficient levels of this hormone in some of these patients. Also, symptoms can vary widely from person to person, making it harder to detect the issue.\nThyroid Disorders in Women\nThyroid disorders can affect both adults and children, but women are more likely to have thyroid disorders than men. This is because the thyroid gland has much to do with a woman’s reproductive system. Insufficient levels of this hormone can greatly affect a woman’s body.\nResearch shows that a slightly underactive thyroid may affect a woman’s ability to become pregnant. According to a study published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, women who have unexplained infertility were nearly twice as likely to have higher levels of this hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland than women who did not conceive due to known issues with their partner’s sperm count.\nA reason for this might be that an overactive thyroid can affect ovulation. Thyroid disorders have the potential to prevent an egg from dropping for fertilization. For women with an underactive thyroid, the ovaries are at an increased risk for cysts, which can also prevent ovulation.\nThyroid disorders can also cause puberty and menstruation to occur abnormally early or late and can cause very light or very heavy menstrual periods. It can even cause absent menstrual periods and early onset menopause (near the early 40’s or earlier).\nWho’s at Risk?\nWomen with goiter, anemia or type 1 diabetes are at a greatest risk for developing thyroid issues. Also, women with thyroid problems in the past or who have had radiotherapy affecting the thyroid gland are more likely to develop these issues.\nSymptoms of Hypo/Hyperthyroidism\nHypothyroidism, when the thyroid isn’t making enough hormones, can cause one to feel very cold, constipation, muscle weakness, weight gain, pale skin and a slow heart rate, among other symptoms.\nHyperthyroidism, when the thyroid is making too many hormones, can cause weight loss, feeling nervous or anxious, increased sweating, trembling, trouble sleeping and feeling hot, among other symptoms.\nIf you believe you are at risk for either, visit an endocrinologist to get an examination.\nWeekly Health Tips are brought to you by UCF Health, the College of Medicine’s physician practice.

{"question":"As someone studying climate change impacts, I'm curious about the long-term effects - how do the predicted economic impacts of urban heat compare to the timeline of changes caused by fossil fuel burning?","answer":"The timeline and impact scales are both significant but different. Fossil fuel burning, despite only occurring for about 150 years, has initiated changes that will continue to be felt 10,000 years into the future. Regarding economic impacts specifically, urban heat and local climate change effects are projected to cost the average city 5.6% of their economic output by 2100, with the most affected cities losing up to 11% of their economic output.

That is why the new book Rising Seas: Past, Present Future by geologist Vivien Gornitz is a timely and important contribution to helping people understand the issue.\n(Updated Wednesday, March 6, 2013) Before Hurricane Sandy, scientists at The Earth Institute were at the forefront of studying the dangers posed by such storms, especially in the New York City area, where they are based. Among their specialties: the physics of storms and storm prediction; impacts of climate on weather and sea level; vulnerability… read more\nGraduate students in architecture and urban design recently presented their findings and design work issuing out of a collaboration between the Urban Design Lab (UDL) and MCI in the Millennium City of Kumasi, Ghana. At the city’s invitation, and with MCI’s facilitation, the UDL came to Kumasi in early February, to devise solutions to revitalize the severely degraded and impoverished areas of Akrom, Adukrom and Sewabah and to design a comprehensive Women’s and Girls’ Center for the vibrant downtown commercial neighborhood of Bantama.\nThe results are in for the first study to systematically measure the effects of the city’s fledgling effort to introduce more reflective rooftops in order to reduce cooling costs and the overall heat burden on the city.\nUrbanization poses both challenges and opportunities for sustainable development and environmental management. Improved data on patterns of human settlement and trends in population can help researchers and policy makers better understand differences between urban and rural areas in terms of their impacts on the environment and vulnerability to environmental variability and change. The newly released… read more","A Hot Topic: Cities tackle rising temperatures\nBy Kurt Shickman, Executive Director, Global Cool Cities Alliance\nThis month, C40 will highlight Cool Cities: the cities working to address our overheated urban spaces. The Cool Cities Network is a city-driven partnership between C40 and the Global Cool Cities Alliance to share the successes, and challenges that cities experience as they strive to achieve a cooler, more resilient future.\nTemperatures in the world’s cities are substantially higher than those of surrounding rural areas due to a phenomenon called the urban heat island effect. Urban heat islands form because many of our cities are made of dark, impermeable surfaces like asphalt that absorb heat, and lack enough green space. In addition, human activity and industry generate heat, and large cities block or slow down natural wind patterns. Taken together, these factors make our cities several degrees hotter, on average, than rural areas. During peak temperature periods, though, urban temperatures may spike significantly above the average urban/rural difference.\nNot only are cities hotter, but they are heating up nearly twice the global average rate. Rising urban temperatures are occurring in the context of a massive global urbanization. Before the end of this century, two out of every three people will live in urban spaces where excess heat will play a critical role in their lives.\nExtreme heat events are getting more frequent and more intense. Heat kills more people than any other natural disaster, and heat-related deaths tend to be underreported. Cities on dangerously hot days consistently experience spikes in mortality from all causes, sometimes as high as an additional 17 deaths per 100,000 people in US cities alone. Nine of the ten most deadly heat waves on record have occurred since 2000 (killing nearly 130,000 people in total).\nRising urban heat is an important factor in nearly every aspect of urban life including health, air quality, energy demand, and social equity.\nThe economic impact of unchecked urban overheating will be staggering. By 2100, urban heat and local climate change impacts will cost the average city 5.6% of their economic output. The most affected cities will lose 11% of their economic output as a result of urban heat and local climate change.\nThe good news is that there are proven strategies for mitigating urban heat that deliver huge potential benefits to cities and their residents. Research shows that reflective roofs and pavements and green infrastructure can deliver 12 times their cost in net benefits and cool cities by 0.5° Celsius. Cooling of that magnitude is equivalent to cancelling over a third of total global warming over the last century.\nC40 cities in the Cool Cities Network have proven to be global leaders on addressing urban heat. New York City recently committed over $100 million to implement its Cool Neighborhoods program. Los Angeles is targeting a nearly 3°F reduction in their urban heat over 20 years by establishing strong cool roofing requirements. Durban has undertaken a comprehensive urban heat study to understand where they are hot and why. Athens, Barcelona, and Paris have not only mapped their heat, but also where they have vulnerable populations, working to ensure their citizens have ready access to cool places on hot days. Tokyo has laid down miles and miles of solar-reflective cool pavement and piloted “smog-eating” cool coatings that stay cleaner longer and improve air quality. Washington, D.C. has built cool roofs into their procurement policy for municipal buildings and will save millions of dollars as a result.\nAdapting to extreme heat has the great advantage of tangibly improving the quality of life of countless urban citizens. The measures that are being implemented by these cities will not only help them in reducing urban heat but will also bring significant health benefits by improving air quality. Members of the Cool Cities Network are committed to moving towards a climate resilient – and cooler – future."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8734e356-f3b8-48f1-8683-f0d2312d4b26>","<urn:uuid:fb71ee5f-ae4a-4e46-b0a5-67cd3bc0a090>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do arbors enhance outdoor aesthetics during day and night, and what unique survival mechanisms do coral reefs display when stressed?","answer":"During the day, arbors serve as elegant structural elements that support vines and climbing plants, enhancing gardens, decks, patios, and walkways with natural beauty. At night, they can be illuminated using various lighting options including strung electric lights, rope lighting, torches, lanterns, and permanent fixtures like sconces or spotlights to create different ambiances. As for coral reefs under stress, they exhibit a remarkable survival mechanism called colorful bleaching, where instead of turning ghostly white, they produce a protective sunscreen layer that makes them glow in bright neon colors like pink, purple, and orange. This vibrant display is believed to encourage the return of symbiotic algae, potentially helping the coral recover if the stress event is mild enough.","context":["Arbors are structural elements which add a touch of elegance to a garden, deck, patio or walkway. Some also serve as supports for vines or climbing plants, bringing even more natural beauty to the surrounding area. Rather than losing an arbor's visual elements under the dark cover of night, light the structure to give it new flair. Whether you are aiming for a festive or intimate environment, the lighting you choose for the arbor is the key to accomplishing your vision.\nStrung Electric Lights and Rope Lighting\nStrands of electric lights were once synonymous with Christmas decorating and winter holidays, but are now available year-round in a variety of colors and styles suited to just about any occasion. Plain white strands of tiny lights add an air of elegance to the arbor and can be strung up the posts and atop the structure, or even mingled in with existing vines or ivy growing on the arbor. Elegant white is suitable for weddings, classy parties and just about any occasion. Purple or orange strands bring Halloween to mind, while multicolored strands are suited to any type of outdoor festivities. For safety reasons, use lights designed for outdoor use. Rope lights are available in many colors and are a bit thicker than loose light strands. These, like regular light strands, can be strung around arbor posts or used to outline the structure.\nOutdoor summertime gatherings often include torches as a source of light. Tall tiki torches kept a short distance away from the arbor light up the arbor while creating a Hawaiian atmosphere. Glass oil torches or oil lamps designed for garden and yard use mount on small, decorative metal stakes and contain a short wick for lighting. Set near the arbor, they light the structure while the glass itself lights up, creating a mystical and festive environment at the same time. Citronella oil in a torch or oil lamp serves as lighting while also keeping mosquitoes at bay. An arbor arching over a path can be lit with four torches or lamps, two on each side, for added effect and visibility.\nParty lanterns are available in many sizes, shapes and styles. The larger types are designed to hang from hooks which can be mounted to the arbor posts. These large lanterns often contain a space inside for a small tea-light candle, which provides ambient light for the arbor, or they may contain one electric light. Hang one large lantern on each arbor post for visual balance. Smaller party lights may be electric or candle-based and can be strung up the posts of the arbor or hung from the top. Themes may be colorful Asian-style paper lanterns, lanterns shaped like animals, holiday items or beverage bottles. Plastic lanterns shaped like their paper counterparts are designed to withstand the elements and will last longer in climates with rain.\nIf you'd like lighting on the arbor available year-round, many permanent lighting options are available. Sconces mounted on the posts light the inside or outside of the arbor, depending on the mounting location. A hanging light illuminates the area beneath the arbor and is ideal for a seating area. Spotlights or uplights light it from the ground, creating a stunning effect from afar.\n- Thinkstock/Comstock/Getty Images","Cecilia D’Angelo, a molecular coral biology lecturer at the University of Southampton. Jörg Wiedenmann, Elena Bollati & Cecilia D’Angelo/University of Southampton, Palawan colourful bleaching image by Ryan Goehrung/University of Washington\nBleaching events used to be few and far between, but they now occur nearly every year. After the coral is exposed, it often breaks down and dies, altering the ecosystem for the diverse array of life that relies on it. Corals stand little chance of bouncing back from these events — but a new study suggests they have an unusual survival method: taking on a vibrant neon color.\nWhen bleaching events occur, extended heat spikes cause corals to turn a ghostly white, often leading to their death. Even slight increases in annual ocean temperatures can wreak havoc on this relationship, expelling the algae from the coral’s tissue and exposing its white skeleton. These corals can still undergo some of their normal functions for a short period of time as they hope their algae come back — whereas drastic changes in ocean temperature almost always lead to coral death. Reports of colorful bleaching during the most recent mass bleaching event in the Great Barrier Reef in March and April gave scientists hope that patches of the system have a chance to recover. “Bleaching is not always a death sentence for corals, the coral animal can still be alive,” said Dr. They found that colorful bleaching events occur when corals produce “what is effectively a sunscreen layer” on their surface to protect against harmful rays and create a glowing display that researchers believe encourages algae to return. The Ocean Agency describes the process as a “chilling, beautiful and heartbreaking” final cry for help as the coral attempts to grab the algae’s attention. “Our research shows colorful bleaching involves a self-regulating mechanism, a so-called optical feedback loop, which involves both partners of the symbiosis,” lead researcher Professor Jörg Wiedenmann of the University of Southampton said in a press release. Climate Change\nDying coral reefs turn vibrant neon in apparent survival effort\nScientists say climate change is turning coastal Antarctica green\nStudy: Climate change makes a Dust Bowl heat wave more likely\nAir pollution is already spiking in China with virus lockdown lifted\nIndia’s carbon emissions fall for the first time in four decades\nMore in Climate Change\nResearchers at the University of Southampton’s Coral Reef Laboratory studied 15 colorful bleaching events worldwide between 2010 and 2019 — including one in the Great Barrier Reef, the world’s largest coral reef system — and recreated those ocean temperatures in a lab. But “colorful bleaching” has the opposite effect: the dying corals gain more pigment, and glow in shades of bright pink, purple and orange. Scientists first spotted the mysterious neon coral a decade ago, but they had been unable to figure out why it occurred. As the recovering algal population starts taking up the light for their photosynthesis again, the light levels inside the coral will drop and the coral cells will lower the production of the colorful pigments to their normal level.”\nColorful bleaching Acropora corals in the Phillipines. Dying coral reefs turn vibrant neon colors in apparent last-ditch effort to survive\nBy Sophie Lewis\nMay 22, 2020 / 4:48 PM\n/ CBS News\nScientists use mini-satellites to save coral reefs\nFor years, coral reefs around the world have been devastated by mass bleaching events as the oceans continue to warm due to climate change. “If the stress event is mild enough, corals can re-establish the symbiosis with their algal partner.”\nThe internal changes that allow colorful bleaching to occur. In 2017 alone, nearly half the corals on the Great Barrier Reef died — and experts say we are running out of time to save them. “Unfortunately, recent episodes of global bleaching caused by unusually warm water have resulted in high coral mortality, leaving the world’s coral reefs struggling for survival,” D’Angelo said. Scientists emphasized that while colorful bleaching is a good sign, only a significant reduction of greenhouse gases globally — in addition to improvement in local water quality — can save coral reefs beyond this century.\n“Now that we know that nutrient levels can affect colorful bleaching too, we can more easily pinpoint cases where heat stress might have been aggravated by poor water quality,” researchers said. Ryan Goehrung, University of Washington\nCoral reefs support more species per unit area than any other marine environment, including about 4,000 species of fish, 800 species of hard corals and potentially millions of other undiscovered species, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Together, these actions can secure a future for coral reefs.”\nFirst published on May 22, 2020 / 4:48 PM “The resulting sunscreen layer will subsequently promote the return of the symbionts. This study, published Thursday in the journal Current Biology, suggests the corals change color as a last-ditch effort to survive. “This can be managed locally, whereas the ocean heat waves caused by climate change will need global leadership. Disruptions to coral reefs have far-reaching implications for ocean ecosystems.\nIt’s not just warming oceans that cause colorful bleaching. Researchers say changes in nutrient levels within coral reefs due to fertilizer run-off from farms also lead to bleaching events — a problem that can be fixed at the local level. Experts believe only coral that has faced mild or brief disturbances, rather than extreme mass bleaching events, can attempt to save itself using this process."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4fae2d11-6ecc-48c6-9e68-464cbda9bfe8>","<urn:uuid:369f1095-9589-4d83-9007-35418b336092>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What field research techniques are employed in tree conservation studies, and what safety protocols must be followed for prescribed burning projects?","answer":"Tree conservation research techniques include DNA extraction and analysis of rare species, drone monitoring, remote sensing, botanical specimen collection, and field surveys to document landscape distribution and morphological diversity. These methods help ensure genetic diversity preservation in botanic gardens. Regarding prescribed burning safety protocols, it is mandatory to notify the sheriff, area fire departments, and neighbors about burning intentions and keep them informed throughout the project's progression. It's advisable to notify insurance companies before participating in fire activities. Additionally, proper planning requires understanding the type of land being burned and ensuring compliance with any existing agreements or contracts that may affect management decisions.","context":["2023 Projects and Mentors\nThe Center for Tree Science REU program offers a wide range of research experiences in evolutionary biology, forest ecology, conservation biology, urban forestry and tree care, computer modeling, and engineering solutions. Undergraduates applying for the 2023 program will have a chance to select and rank their top three projects from the list below.\n- Recovery and restoration of soil, plants, and fungi in brush pile burn scars\n- Natural variation in shinnery oaks (Quercus havardii) and their hybrids\n- Monitoring tree health and drought stress in urban trees\n- Conserving genetic diversity of rare trees in botanic gardens\nRecovery and restoration of soil, plants, and fungi in brush pile burn scars\nMentors: Meghan Midgley, Antonio Del Vallé\nSummary: Brush cutting is a common technique used by natural resource managers in the Chicago region to remove invasive plants and open the canopy to promote oak growth in woodland ecosystems. Brush is typically piled and burned after cutting, as a cost-effective strategy of removing undesirable woody material. The impacts of brush pile burning have been studied in the western US, but little is known about how pile burning impacts soil, plants, fungi, and ultimately oak ecosystems in the Midwest. Moreover, little is known about the recovery of plants in these degraded burn scars, and what restoration techniques (if any) may be the most effective at promoting plant recovery.\nThis project focuses on studying the recovery of brush pile burn scars at The Morton Arboretum. This project will ultimately help provide information to managers in the region to determine when and how burn scars ecologically recover, while identifying what techniques may help to speed this recovery process. The student will be responsible for collecting samples and analyzing data from burn scars of different age classes. Gain hands-on experience surveying plants and collecting soil samples in the field, while also analyzing soil properties and identifying mycorrhizal fungi in the lab. The student can expect to develop these field and laboratory skills, while gaining experience in statistical analyses, professional writing, and oral presentations.\nPreferred Qualifications: The applicant should have a strong interest in soil and plant ecology and research. Applicants should be comfortable working in outdoor settings in adverse conditions such as hot, humid weather and biting insects, as well as working in sedentary office environments. Important skills necessary for a successful applicant include clear communication, attention to detail, organization, and the ability to work independently and as a team. The student must be willing to discuss and develop research questions, conduct fieldwork and laboratory analyses, learn and perform statistical analyses, and present project findings via presentations and written reports.\nProject setting: The Morton Arboretum with field and lab components\nNatural variation in shinnery oaks (Quercus havardii) and their hybrids\nMentors: Chuck Cannon, Sam Panock, including collaboration with the 2022 REU student and a colleague at Midwestern State University (Wichita Falls, TX)\nSummary: The shinnery oak (Quercus havardii) is an endangered species adapted to semi-arid sandy soils in the southwestern USA. This species is unusual because it forms large clonal groves that spread through the sandy soils, playing an important role in stabilizing the land and creating extensive below-ground biomass. In the rolling hills and plains region of Texas, these trees also hybridize extensively with three to four other oak species, resulting in a remarkable diversity of leaf and growth forms. Using a combination of remote sensing, drone monitoring, and field surveys, the student will work with a small team to document the landscape distribution of this diversity, in both morphology and genetics, and help establish long-term monitoring protocols. The student’s project will build upon the previous year’s work and will collaborate directly with the team of scientists and students actively working on the project.\nPreferred qualifications: Willingness to learn a variety of field and lab techniques, including botanical specimen collection and analysis, basics of genetic analysis, and remote sensing techniques, including the use of drone surveillance.\nProject setting: Primarily at the Morton Arboretum but including a two-week field trip to properties near Spur, Texas to collect samples, map populations, and fly the drone. The field trip could involve sleeping some nights in a tent and working outside for long hours in dry and hot conditions.\nMonitoring tree health and drought stress in urban trees\nMentors: Luke McCormack, Marvin Lo\nSummary: Healthy trees in urban areas provide numerous benefits to people including improved physical health and mental wellbeing. However, trees in urban settings can be prone to drought stress due to limited soil volumes, poor water infiltration and nutrient imbalances. Furthermore, climate change is expected to increase the occurrence of drought for trees in some urban areas. It is therefore important to understand how drought will impact the tree species that are most commonly planted in urban areas today, and to help identify candidate species for future use in urban settings so that we can increase the diversity and resilience of our urban forests. In this project, students will conduct repeated physiological measurements of tree responses to drought as well as tree recovery among different species. The findings will then be used to support recommendations for tree selections and plantings in managed areas.\nPreferred Qualifications: Must be interested in plant ecology, tree care, or similar fields and have completed at least one college-level course relevant to the study of plants. Students must also be willing to discuss and develop research questions, conduct fieldwork and laboratory analyses, and perform statistical analysis with data interpretation.\n- Coursework/background: introductory biology required; ecology or plant physiology course preferred\n- Ability to work in both field (hot, humid, rain, insects) and lab (standing/sitting for prolonged periods) settings\n- Bonus points: experience with trees, roots, soils, ecophysiology, data analysis, research in general\nProject setting: The Morton Arboretum, with lab and field components\nConserving genetic diversity of rare trees in botanic gardens\nMentors: Sean Hoban, Emily Schumacher, Austin Koontz\nSummary: This project will focus on conserving genetic diversity to ensure the resilience of threatened rare trees in botanic gardens. Among other conservation biology projects, the Hoban lab analyzes the DNA of rare species (such as Quercus hinckleyi) to determine if botanic gardens have conserved enough genetic diversity, and to improve future seed collection and botanic garden management and curation (see examples here and here). Applicants should be interested in learning and working with lab techniques for extracting and examining DNA, and/or learning and working on analyzing genetic/genomic data with computational techniques. The project focus can be tailored to more laboratory or more computational goals.\nPreferred Qualifications: Prior experience with lab equipment (in any lab, such as chemistry, etc.), computer programming, or DNA analysis is beneficial but not required. Prior classes in evolution, population genetics, GIS, computer science, conservation biology, or similar are beneficial. A commitment to conserving trees, careful organization, attention to detail, and working collaboratively is appreciated.\nProject setting: The Morton Arboretum with lab components.","Part 1 of this series dealt with the overall considerations for burn unit design and preparation. Here we discuss the overall burn planning process.\nGoals & Objectives\nIt is important that fire not be planned as ‘fire for the sake of fire’. Goals and objectives are critical to understanding where, when, and how to accomplish the fire project. An example of appropriate goals and objectives would be a pasture burn where one is targeting control of cedar trees. The management goal may be to reclaim 30% of the pasture area lost to cedar trees while the burn objective may be to kill all cedar trees under 3 ft. tall. Goals and objectives do not have to be perfect, but they are an important part of the process in order to plan the appropriate fire timing and weather conditions that will meet these needs. For instance, with the goals and objectives stated above, one may need to consider warm, dry early spring conditions. Similarly, if the goal is to burn 30% of a planted grass habitat that is not encumbered with a simple objective of consuming 50% of the dead grass, this can be accomplished under much different weather and timing conditions than the cedar burn, such as late May when the fire is more controllable. Seek outside assistance from local experts or experienced neighbors when planning goals and objectives.\nFirst, it is very important to understand well the ‘type’ of land you intend to burn. Generally, grassland burns fall into two major categories, land that is encumbered by an agreement, easement or contract, and land that is not. We will also discuss burn objectives in this article.\nWhen planning a burn, it is important to know if the land is encumbered by any other type of agreement, written or oral, that would suggest another entity has an interest or say in the management decisions. Examples of encumbrance may include, but are not limited to: leases (written or oral), share agreements, USDA management contracts (such as CRP, EQIP, WRP, CSP, etc.), easements, or any other such agreement where a second or third party has some ‘rights’ to the management. If encumbrances are present, it is important to begin discussions with the affected parties very early in the burn planning process to ensure all are in agreement with the management action, and that any permits or plans are properly documented.\nGenerally, Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a common program where prescribed burning is utilized for specific management objectives. Fall is the time to make local USDA Service centers aware of burn plans on CRP, especially if one desires to seek USDA financial or planning assistance. Waiting until the last minute generally creates delays and unnecessary stress on the parties involved. The CRP is a USDA FSA program with practices administered through NRCS. Fire plans generally need county committee approval. There are a few steps one should be aware of for prescribed fire:\n- Prescribed burning must be written into the conservation plan. Burning can be added to conservation plans, but now is the time to start that process.\n- Burning must be within the establishment or mid-term management designated years.\n- Electronic and paper copies of the approved South Dakota NRCS/FSA fire plan with instructions are available through local USDA service centers. Plans are also available to download at the SD NRCS range and pasture page.\n- Fire planning assistance is available through trained staff at many USDA service centers.\n- CRP burns must be completed prior to May 1. Pasture burns should be conducted in May in most cases.\nOther USDA contract lands, US Fish and Wildlife Service Easements, or other encumbered properties may require similar notifications and permissions. It is likely that in some cases, encumbered lands may require an archeological assessment and may have certain periods of the year where fire is or is not allowed, such as the primary bird nesting season. Again, to ensure a timely fire project starting the process early is important.\nGenerally, this category would include properties that are owned in fee title and do not have any other secondary relationship. A great example is a typical pasture owned and operated by an individual with no contracts or easements. In this case, the landowner need not receive outside permission and can burn this land whenever weather conditions are conducive to the prescribed goals or objectives of the fire. Landowners who lease land to others generally would not need any type of permission from their lessee. However, including your lessee in your management plans ensures that both parties are involved in cooperative planning and goal setting for the health of the pasture.\nPlanning & Implementation Assistance\nVisit the South Dakota NRCS range and pasture page to view instructional materials related to prescribed burning, including the South Dakota burn plan template.\nInstructions & Courses\nSDSU Extension, NRCS, Pheasants Forever, and other partners will once again be hosting free 1-day introductory fire courses in various locations during spring 2017. Take advantage of this opportunity to become more familiar with burn planning, tools, techniques, and rules. If you’d like to be placed on the notification list for spring 2017 fire classes, please call Jan at 605-882-5140 and request your name be put on the list.\nCost share funding may be available for those who have encumbered land. Commonly, cost share is part of a USDA program conservation plan if burning is part of it. Cost share funds can be used to reimburse fire departments or private burn contractors for their services. Take advantage of late fall and early winter to notify local fire department of burn intentions, especially if you intend to ask for their assistance and to coordinate any cost share paperwork that may be necessary.\nSafety & Liability\nAlways notify the sheriff, area fire departments, and neighbors of your intentions and keep them posted as the burn project progresses from planning to implementation. It is generally advisable to notify your insurance company if you intend to participate in fire activities.\nSource: Pete Bauman, South Dakota State University"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0bf63245-72c6-42bd-a5d0-bdecb88df30c>","<urn:uuid:3b42ef56-8c73-4f5e-ba6b-553425d36e53>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key benefits of planting large trees in urban areas, and what specific regulatory protections are in place to preserve them in Seattle?","answer":"Large trees provide multiple important benefits in urban areas: they offer high-quality habitat for wildlife, stabilize hillsides, prevent erosion, provide shade that reduces air conditioning needs, and increase residential and commercial property values. Evergreen conifers are particularly beneficial as they produce more leaf area in a smaller footprint, making them more efficient at absorbing carbon dioxide, producing oxygen, and filtering air pollutants. They also better reduce stormwater runoff since they retain foliage during the rainy season. As for protections, Seattle has implemented a tiered system of regulations, with the strongest protections for Tier 1 (heritage trees) and Tier 2 trees (24 inches or greater in diameter). These trees generally cannot be removed unless they are hazardous or removal is needed to achieve allowed development capacity. The city requires permits for removal, mandatory replacement of removed trees, and all commercial tree work must be performed by registered Tree Service Providers.","context":["Planting Considerations & Program Details\nBefore selecting your new tree, please take time to read the following information, evaluate potential planting sites, and select the right tree for your yard.\nRight Tree, Right Place\nBenefits of Planting Large Trees\nPlanting Street Trees\nTree Pickup Information\nRight Tree, Right Place\nA well placed tree can help conserve energy, provide a visual screen, and provide years of beauty. However, a tree placed in the wrong place can be harmful and potentially expensive! The small tree you plant today will someday grow tall and its roots may be as expansive as the tree's branches. Make sure you select a location with adequate room to grow above and below ground.\n- Reason for planting. Are you planting to shade your house in the summer or to create habitat for birds? Or are you looking to provide some seasonal interest or frame your view? Select the appropriate tree to help you achieve your goal.\n- Tree size at maturity. Many of these trees will get big! Read this year's tree descriptions carefully and envision what the tree will look like in 30+ years before making your selections.\n- Tree shape/form. Small, spreading trees that are multi-stemmed require regular pruning when planted near a sidewalk or road. Upright trees can be better trained to grow over pedestrian and road traffic.\n- Maximize the benefits with a large tree. Larger trees provide greater benefits to your neighborhood and our environment. Large trees absorb more water, breathe in more carbon dioxide, and breathe out more oxygen than smaller trees. For these reasons, we recommend planting larger trees whenever appropriate. If you have the space, consider one of our native evergreen conifers which will maximize the benefits to you and your neighborhood.\n- Do not plant a tall tree under overhead power lines! Trees planted under power lines should reach a maximum of approximate 25 feet. If your planting site has overhead power lines, please select a tree from the \"under power lines\" list (i.e. Cascara, Chinese Fringe Tree, Eastern Redbud, and Southern Magnolia).\n- Evaluate the planting site. Take time to evaluate potential planting sites on your property. The survival and health of a tree depends on how well suited it is to the site. Before choosing your site, consider:\n- Available planting space\n- Overhead and underground utilities\n- Surrounding trees & structures (e.g. your house, driveway, and utility poles)\n- Light (e.g. full sun, part sun, shade?)\n- Surrouding human activity\n- Soil type. What type of soil is present? Is the soil sandy or more clay-like? This will influence drainage, which should influence your tree selection. Is the soil compacted? Compacted soil can lead to poor drainage so you'll need to select a water-loving tree, such as the swamp white oak. You can test your soil's drainage by digging a hole 12 inches deep, filling it with water, and checking back one hour later.\nBenefits of Planting Large Trees\nLarge trees add character to Seattle's neighborhoods and often become treasured neighborhood assets. Research has shown that large trees maximize the benefits in urban areas. They provide higher quality habitat for birds and other wildlife, stabilize hillsides and prevent erosion, and provide shade on hot days reducing the need for air conditioning. Studies have also shown that large trees even increase residential and commercial property values!\nLarge evergreen trees, especially conifers, are even better. Because conifers grow tall in our region, they produce a larger volume of leaf area on a smaller footprint – using the same amount of yard space but working harder to take in carbon dioxide, produce oxygen, and filter out air pollutants. Since evergreens hold their needles and leaves through the winter, our rainy season, they reduce stormwater runoff to a much greater extent than do small deciduous trees.\nIf you have the space in your yard or planting strip (away from overhead power lines), consider making a long-term investment in your neighborhood by planting a tree that will give back for decades!\nPlanting Street Trees\nTo plant a tree in your planting strip along the street, you must obtain a permit from Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT). When you participate in Trees for Neighborhoods, we will apply for this permit on your behalf. Just be sure to indicate that you plan to plant a street tree on your application!\nWhen you apply for street tree, we'll take care of the details and keep you informed of the process as it proceeds.\n- Mark your street trees on your application. All street tree applications must be submitted by August 24th. Provide some notes about where you would like to plant the tree, e.g. “I would like to plant the yellowwood along 49th Ave on the north side of the driveway”.\n- Obtain a permit. In early September, we will initiate a Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) permit on your behalf. Note- Not all street tree applicants will be permitted as many trees will have long waitlists.\n- Mark underground utilities. Trees for Seattle will contact Washington 811 to mark underground utilities in your planting strip. An SDOT arborist will return to your site in September and make a decision about your street tree planting request. The arborist may drive one or more stakes in possible planting locations—please leave these stakes where they are! You do not need to be present for these visits.\n- Permit notifications. In late September, SDOT will send us all of their street tree decisions and Trees for Seattle will contact all applicants with permitting decisions in early October. An approved planting permit is necessary to receive a street tree from us.\nNot all street tree permits are approved. The SDOT arborists may deny your permit for a number of reasons, including proximity to utility lines, street lights, and street intersections.\n- CALL BEFORE YOU DIG! The week before attending the planting workshop, you are responsible for contacting Washington 811 and submitting a ticket to dig your planting hole in the designated location. We will provide you a specialized web link for submitting this dig ticket. If you prefer to do it over the phone, call 811. Note- By the terms of your permit, you must plant the tree in the same location as the stake.\nSince we receive many more tree requests than trees, we do not apply for a permit for all street tree requests. If we are not able to apply for you and you're still interested in planting your own street tree, check out this page for more information on how to apply for planting permit from SDOT.\n- Avoid conflicts. To avoid future problems, street trees must be planted to the following standards:\n- 3 ½ feet back from the face of the curb\n- 5 feet from underground utility lines\n- 10 feet from power poles\n- 7 ½ feet from driveways (10 feet recommended)\n- 20 feet from street lights and other existing trees\n- 30 feet from street intersections\n- Concrete Removal. We cannot remove concrete / pavement to create new tree planting locations. If you are planning to remove concrete / pavement yourself, that work must be coordinated with the Department of Transportation. Call 206-684-TREE for more information.\n- Tree Removal & Replacement. We cannot help with street tree removal. All street trees are protected under the Street Tree Ordinance (SMC 15.43) and must be permitted for removal. SDOT may permit a removal if the tree is hazardous, poses a threat to public safety, is in poor health, or cannot be successfully retained due to construction or development. If you're considering tree replacement, please apply for a removal permit prior to apply for a replacement tree. Please visit SDOT's website or call 206-684-TREE (8733) to learn more.\nIn 2016, the application process changed from first-come-first-serve to a lottery process. This change allows applicants more time to make tree selections and prevent certain species from selling out within minutes, as they have in past years. Nonetheless, the number of trees approved for your yard may be fewer than the number requested. Trees for Neighborhoods has become very popular and thus some trees can sell out very quickly. Small trees are most popular. To increase your chances of receiving a tree, consider planting a larger tree if space allows. If you are not immediately approved for a tree, you will be placed on a waitlist. As participants change their minds or drop out of the program, more trees will become available and will be approved in the order the applications were received.\nHow will I know if my application is approved?\nAfter the first round of the application lottery closes, Trees for Seattle will begin processing applications. Once your application is processed, you willl receive an email with the status of your tree order.\nHow does the lottery work exactly?\nAll applications received will be assigned a random number once the application closes. Trees for Seattle staff process applications sequentially by random number. An entire application order will be processed at once, however only trees still available will be marked as \"Approved\". Trees will be distributed until sold out. Once a species is sold out, requests will be added to a waitlist in the same sequential order and marked on the applicaiton as \"Waitlist\". As trees become available for the waitlist, they will be distributed in order of the position on the waitlist.\nCan I submit more than one application to improve my chances?\nNo, please submit only one application per household. We will only process the first application we receive from your address. Since we will process the entire application at once, it does not benefit you to submit more than one. If you submit your application and would like to make a change before the application closing date, please contact us and we will make that change on your behalf.\nWhich workshop do I choose?\nThere are 3 workshop dates. The first and the last workshop dates are at the Center for Urban Horticulture. The middle date is a limited workshop in south Seattle (exact location to be determined). Even though both workshops at the Center for Urban Horticulture (CUH) are the same for time and content, the first workshop is chosen more often. If you would like to attend a less crowded event, consider signing up for the later CUH workshop. If you are planting in the 98126, 98106, 98108, or 98118 zip codes and getting to the CUH is a hardship for you, choose the workshop in south Seattle. Space in this workshop is limited and will be allocated based on your lottery position. If you do not get in to this workshop, we will contact you to choose one of the workshops at CUH.\nAttention renters! If you do not own your home, you need to ask the permission of the homeowner before applying for trees. Also consider follow-up care. Young trees need regular summer watering through their first three years. If you do not plan to be at your home that long, consider how the young tree will receive the proper care it needs.\nAttention landlords! If you apply for trees for one of your rental properties, please consider future watering and maintenance. If you are unable to water the trees 2x/week during the summer months, please be sure your renter is willing.\nTree Pickup Information\nYou must be present at the planting and care workshop to pick up your tree(s). Indicate which date you are available to attend the workshop on the application.\n- You are responsible for transporting your trees from the pickup site to your home. You may need to rent or borrow a pickup truck if you have a small vehicle or are picking up numerous trees. Remember that having more passengers in the car means less space for trees!\n- The trees will be in 5, 7, or 10 gallon containers and are generally 4-6 feet tall. Staff will help you load your trees on the pick-up days, but you may need to make sure you have help to unload once you are home.\n- All trees should be planted within 1-2 weeks after receiving them. You are responsible for planting the tree, which is why we require each participant to go through a planting workshop at the pickup event. If you are physically unable to plant your tree and would like assistance, please contact us.\n- Your young trees will not survive the dry summer without watering. Water bags will be provided to help you care for your trees in the summer. For more tips about caring for your young tree, click here.\nCheck out our Frequently Asked Questions page for more information.\nContact us with additional questions at TreesForNeighborhoods@Seattle.gov or (206) 684-3979.","The City of Seattle is committed to protecting our urban tree canopy. Canopy cover is one important measure of the health of the urban forest. Urban trees provide numerous ecological, economic, and social benefits, including wildlife habitat, neighborhood livability, and improved public health outcomes.\nThe Seattle City Council recently passed Council Bill 120534 establishing new tree protection requirements on private property in Seattle. The new regulations went into effect on July 30, 2023. It is important for property owners, tenants, developers, and tree service providers to understand the new regulations to know when a tree is protected and when a tree may be removed. We are currently developing public information to help explain the new regulations. Please watch for updates on our Trees & Codes website, including links to any new or revised Tips and Director’s Rules.\nRead the Code & Supporting Resources\nYou can read the code online through Municode SMC Chapter 25.11. Occasionally there is a lag in updates to the online code, but you can still view the approved ordinance on the City Clerk website or by clicking on the “Amended by Ordinance No. 126821” link in Seattle Municipal Code 25.11. These new codes apply to actions and projects vested to land use regulations on or after July 30, 2023.\nWe have published three Director’s Rules (two final and one draft) to provide guidance on the update tree code, which will be finalized in early August:\n- DR 7-2023, Designation of Tier 2 Trees\n- DR 8-2023, Payment in lieu of tree replacement pursuant to the Tree Protection Code\n- Draft DR 10-2023, Administration of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections Tree Service Provider Registry\nPlease continue to check the Director’s Rules webpage for draft and final Director’s Rules. Additional rules are anticipated to guide tree protection areas and tree replacement requirements.\nIn addition, we are updating the Tip 242 series related to trees to help you navigate the code provisions and application processes:\n- Tip 242A, Tree Requirements Associated with Development (updates coming mid-August)\n- Tip 242B, Tree Removal on Private Property (updates coming mid-August)\n- Tip 242C, Tree Service Provider Registry\n- Tip 242D, Tree Public Notice\nPlease continue to check the Tips webpage for additional updates.\nNew Terminology – Tree Tiers\nTrees in Seattle are now categorized into 4 different tier groups – Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4. These new tree tiers replace the exceptional and non-exceptional categories of the current code. Each tier has different regulations that change depending on whether you are proposing development. Trees are measured using the diameter at standard height (DSH), an industry standard for measuring tree size.\n- Tier 1 – Includes trees designated as heritage trees. You can learn more about heritage trees by visiting the City’s heritage tree program.\n- Tier 2 – Includes trees 24 inches DSH or greater, tree groves, and specific tree species as provided by Director’s Rule 7-2023, Designation of Tier 2 Trees.\n- Tier 3– Includes trees 12 inches DSH or greater but less than 24 inches DSH that are not considered Tier 1 or 2 trees as provided by Director’s Rule 7-2023, Designation of Tier 2 Trees.\n- Tier 4– Includes trees 6 inches DSH but less than 12 inches DSH that are not considered Tier 1 or 2 trees as provided by Director’s Rule7-2023, Designation of Tier 2 Trees.\n- Other trees– Trees under 6 inches DSH are not regulated by SMC 25.11.\nNew Tree Protection Regulations\nTree protection requirements vary based on the tree tier, zone, lot condition (developed or undeveloped), and whether development is proposed. In most cases, removal of a tree from any tree tier is prohibited on undeveloped, or vacant lots. Exceptions are made for hazardous trees, which may be removed with approval by SDCI. Trees less than 6 inches DSH are not regulated by SMC 25.11.\n- Removal of Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, or Tier 4 trees is generally prohibited in all zones when no development is proposed either on developed property or undeveloped land. While tree removal is generally prohibited when no development is proposed, the tree protection regulations have several new exemptions and allowances for tree removal. For example, invasive tree species removal and removing a tree infected with pests or pathogens would be allowed. Most of these exemptions and allowances require SDCI review and approval prior to the tree work and will be reviewed via a Tree Removal and Voluntary Restoration Approval Request application. Please also consult Tip 242B, Tree Removal on Private Property (coming in mid-August).\n- The tree regulations continue to have limits on tree removal on developed lots when no development is proposed. These limits have been reduced to no more than two Tier 4 treesin a three-year period in Neighborhood Residential, Residential Small Lot, Lowrise, Midrise, Neighborhood Commercial, Commercial, and Seattle Mixed zones and no more than three Tier 3 and Tier 4 trees in a one-year period in all other zones.\n- When development is proposed, any tree removals, protection, and replacement trees will be evaluated through the standard permit review process as it is currently done.\n- Tier 1 trees generally must be protected and may not be removed unless they are hazardous or require an emergency action.\n- Tier 2 trees generally may not be removed unless they are hazardous, require an emergency action, or are permitted to achieve allowed development capacity per SMC 25.11.070 and 25.11.080.\n- Tier 3 and 4 trees are allowed to be removed or protected at your option.\nPlease also consult Tip 242A, Tree Requirements Associated with Development.\nBelow is a summary table to guide property owners and tree service providers on the tree removal allowances described above:\n|Limited Tree Removal Allowed on Private Property\n|Tree Removal Allowed\n|When no development is proposed\n|Hazardous trees (SDCI review required; replacement required for Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 trees).\n|NR, RSL, LR, MR, NC, C, and Seattle Mixed zones\nAll other zones\n|When development is proposed\n|NR, RSL, LR, MR, NC, C, and Seattle Mixed Zones\nSDCI review is required; replacement is required for Tier 2, and Tier 3 trees, including hazardous trees.\n|All other zones\nSDCI review is required; replacement is required for Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 trees, including hazardous trees.\n1. Emergency actions allowed according to SMC 25.11.040.\n2. Commercial tree work to be completed by a registered Tree Service Provider according to SMC 25.11.100.\n3. Tree Public Notice is required according to SMC 25.11.100.\n4. Trees not listed in this table are prohibited from being removed unless exempted from regulation by SMC 25.11.020. SDCI review may still be required.\n5. Tree work located within an ECA is regulated by SMC 25.09.\nTree Removal Application Process\nGenerally speaking, our permit processes are not changing, but you will now be able to apply for specific reviews given the new tree removal allowances in SMC 25.11.020 and 25.11.050 (where we currently only have a review available for hazard tree removal). Starting on July 30, you will be able to apply for a Tree Removal and Voluntary Restoration Approval Request application to request review for the following types of tree removal outside of development:\n- Hazardous tree removals (Tiers 1-4, with replacement required for Tiers 1-3; see SMC 25.11.040 for more information)\n- After-the-fact documentation of emergency tree removal (Tiers 1-3, no replacement required; see SMC 25.11.030 for more information)\n- Tree removals due to insect, pest, and/or pathogen infestation (Tiers 1-4, with replacement required for Tiers 1-3)\n- Tree removals to comply with ADA or to improve access for elderly or people with disabilities (Tiers 1-4, no replacement required)\n- Removal of invasive or nuisance trees (Tiers 1-4, with replacement required for Tiers 1-3)\n- Removal of trees to thin overplanting (Tiers 3 and 4, no replacement required)\n- Removal of trees causing obvious damage to property (Tiers 3 and 4, replacement required for Tier 3)\n- Removal of dead trees (Tiers 1-4, no replacement required)\nFor assistance with the application process, please consult How to Apply for SDCI Approval for Tree Removal and Vegetation Restoration.\nNew Site Plan Requirements\nThe tree protection code now includes requirements for what needs to be included on site plans:\n- Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4 trees, including off-site Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4 trees with canopies overhanging and/or roots extending onto the lot, are required to be documented on all site plans within a plan set submitted for a Master Use Permit or building permit.\n- Tree protection areas for all Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 trees that will be retained during development are required to be identified on all site plans.\n- Tree protection fencing and signage are required to be shown in the plan set submitted for a Master Use Permit or building permit.\nNew Tree Replacement Requirements\nIn all zones, Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 trees removed in association with development must be replaced by one or more new trees. A list of acceptable replacement trees can be found on this Green Factor Tree List.\nIf tree removal is approved, replacement trees may be located on- or off-site according to SMC 25.11.090 and SMC 25.11.115. Applicants may choose to make a voluntary payment in lieu of on-site tree replacement. Payment in lieu of replacement planting is calculated pursuant to Director’s Rule 8-2023, Payment in lieu of tree replacement pursuant to the Tree Protection Code. If an applicant chooses voluntary payment in lieu of on-site tree planting, all payments must be made to SDCI before SDCI issues a tree removal approval.\nNew Street Tree Requirements\nStreet tree requirements now apply in Neighborhood Residential (NR) zones.\nNew Development Capacity Calculation for Removal of Tier 2 Trees in Lowrise zones\n- The tree protection regulations include the use of a development capacity calculation to determine if Tier 2 trees may be removed on sites undergoing development in Lowrise (LR) zones. Instead of using floor area ratio (FAR), an allowable development area of 85 percent is used. If the 85 percent allowable development area cannot be achieved without extending into the basic tree protection area, Tier 2 trees may be removed. A new Director’s Rule (coming in August) will provide clarity around the basic tree protection area.\n- Streamlined Design Review is no longer required when Tier 2 (formerly exceptional) trees are on the site. The new tree regulations include specific modifications to development standards as a Type I decision if an applicant chooses to retain Tier 2 trees that would otherwise be allowed to be removed. Development subject to Design Review will continue to use the available Type II Design Review departures.\nEnvironmentally Critical Areas\n- Tree work within an environmentally critical area (ECA) is exempt from most of the regulations of SMC 25.11 (tree code) when a tree and vegetation management plan per SMC 25.09 is required. When this plan is not required, SMC 25.11 applies.\n- The tree work within the ECA must still be completed by a registered Tree Service Provider and comply with the notice requirements found in SMC 25.11.100.\nTree Service Providers & Tree Public Notice\n- Remember that all commercial tree work (which includes some pruning) must be completed by a registered Tree Service Provider. Please also consult draft Director’s Rule 10-2023, Administration of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections Tree Service Provider Registry, and Tip 242C, Tree Service Provider Registry.\n- Remember that all tree work (with the exception of emergencies) must be must noticed in accordance with SMC 25.11.100 and posted on-site during the work and online using SDCI’s Tree Public Notice Please also consult Tip 242D, Tree Public Notice.\nThe best way to contact our staff is via email at firstname.lastname@example.org or through SDCI’s Submit a Request form. To help route your request, indicate that you need help with “Permits, codes, zones, plans,” then select “Land Use” as the type of help you need, and then select “Trees” in the description field. If necessary, we can set up a virtual meeting to discuss potential or actual projects.

{"question":"What is the relationship between community involvement in 4-H club programs versus Nassau County Extension programs?","answer":"Both systems actively engage with community members but in different capacities. 4-H clubs invite community presenters like local police officers, veterinarians, and extension agents to give hands-on presentations and share their expertise with club members. In contrast, Nassau County Extension has a broader community engagement approach through various specialized programs, with dedicated agents for horticulture, family and consumer sciences, agriculture, and youth development, supported by different types of volunteers including Master Gardener Volunteers, Master Naturalist Volunteers, and 4-H Youth Development volunteers.","context":["Finding Your Fit with Engaging Club Programs\n- Participants will list creative and educational program ideas for club meetings.\n- Participants will create a club program chart or calendar.\nEssential Elements: Belonging and Mastery\nAn important component of any 4-H meeting is the program. Good 4-H club programs do not magically appear – they are planned. Choosing programs for the year is often the first step in mapping out the club’s activities and helping guide youths in their own development and learning.\nFun and interesting programs will keep members coming back for more. Keep programs\nfresh by brainstorming ideas with club officers and teen leaders. Finding a club’s\nprogram fit is about selecting programs of interest to the group. When leaders,\nclub officers, and members work together to identify programs of interests and\nto make the program happen, youths will be more engaged and committed to the club.\nSome programs are repeated yearly with a community. Care should be taken that these “traditions” are based on member needs and interests, rather than “we’ve always done this.” Discuss with members if they want to continue this program tradition or try something new.\nAs a club leader, it can be challenging to organize activities and programs. A guide or chart like the one below makes planning monthly activities easier. It is possible to create these charts in your 4-H registration system and then easily share it with families. The chart must be updated yearly, and activities should be youth led or driven.\nSample Club Program Guide:\n- Program: New 4-H Year (enrollment & Elections)\n- Snacks: Wilfong Family\n- Submit all enrollment forms before next meeting.\n- Program: Hunting Safety\n- Speaker – DNR Officer\n- Snacks: Streets Family\n- Community Service: Bring can goods for community baskets\n- Program: Holiday Party\n- Snacks: Club – Pizza\n- Members bring favorite snack\n- Bring a $10 dollar gift for the gift exchange.\n- NO MEETING\n- Work on Posters for the State Contest\n- Sledding Trip – January 25th 2pm-4pm\n- Program: Dental Health\n- Speaker – Local Dentist\n- Snacks: Burns & Adams Family\n- Community Service: Bring can items for Cortland Acres Residence\n- Program: Food Handler’s Card\n- Speaker – County Sanitarian\n- Snacks: Thompson Family\n- Community Service: Write a thank you note to local officials\n- Program: Don’t Be a Bully\n- Speaker – FRN\n- Snacks: Ware & Lewis Family\n- Community Service: Dog Walk to support local animal shelter\n- Program: Talks and Demonstrations\n- Speaker – Burns & Adams Family\n- Snacks: Club Picnic\n- Fundraiser: Chicken Burn\n- Each family bring 2 desserts\n- P rogram : Fly Fishing & Fly Tying\n- Speaker – Local Angler\n- Snacks: Mullenax & Auvil Family\n- Program: Bike Safety\n- Speaker – Extension Agent\n- Snacks: Walker & Alt Family\n- Bring bike for bike ride & project books are due!\n- FAIR – NO MEETING\n- All Exhibits are dropped off on August 24 from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.\n- Program: STEM Night\n- Speaker – Teen Leader\n- Snacks: Betts Family\n- Turn in Rada Fundraiser. Delivery November meeting\nNote: The sample club program guide shares many program ideas; however, clubs may choose to do an activity, such as a hike or bicycle ride, instead of a program. Some clubs may not meet in July to prepare exhibits for the fair.\nMaking It Real: Club Program Ideas\nby club members. Club members are an excellent resource for programs and\nmembers enjoy learning from each other. Members are required to do a talk or\ndemonstration for their project. Allow time for them to sign up at the beginning\nof the 4-H year so that they will be prepared.\nPresentations by community members. Kids love to hear information from people they look up to in their communities. Take a poll during your first club meeting of the year to see what members would be interested in learning about or activities they would like to do. Club programming can take place somewhere other than the regular meeting location – be sure to list it on the club plan and let your extension office know the change of the plan.\nCommunity Presenters Ideas. Involve youths in asking the presenter and ask them to include a hands-on activity as a part of the presentation.\n- Local Police Officers\n- Natural Resource Police\n- Local Veterinarian\n- Local Trappers\n- Fly Fishing/Fly Tying Expert\n- Extension Agent\n- County Sanitarian\n- Past 4-Her’s share careers\n- Health Rocks!\nProject Workshops. This offers a time for members and parents to ask questions about the projects that the members are taking. A good time to schedule this program would be 2-3 months after the members have received their project books. If your state has specific guidelines, this would be a good time to let families know expectations for completing their project books.\nPoster & Photo Workshops. Get those creative juices flowing, bring art\nsupplies and poster board to allow members to create their own posters for the\nstate poster contest. Bring copies of the rules to share. Remember construction\npaper or cardstock for members to mount their photos for the photo contest. Help\nthem create catchy captions for their photos and make sure they are ready for\nHealth Officer Activities. During the winter months when most meetings are held inside is a good Please time for your health officer(s) to present additional topics in the health officer books that they would not have covered already. Teach about making healthy snacks or ways to stay active during the winter months.\nTake a Bike Ride. Bike rides are great spring club activities. The weather is beautiful, and the members will enjoy being outdoors with their friends. To make sure everyone has access to a bicycle, ask families to bring extras if they have them, or ask your local bike shop if you could borrow them. During this time, include some visual presentations and have a club picnic.\nCommunity Service. In the fall before the cold weather, or in the spring once winter is past, are great times for outdoor community service projects. Planting trees, painting projects, community gardens, Adopt-A-Highway, or Adopt-A-Spot are ways to get members involved with the community and outside.\nClub Tool Box\n- Facilitate a brainstorm of club program ideas with youths.\n- Create a chart or club calendar together for the year.\n- Schedule youth project presentations throughout the year.\n- Invite community members to present hands-on learning experiences.\n- Hold workshops for poster/photo contests, member projects, and special club projects.\n- Be creative with community service projects.\n- Plan a new and unique outdoor activity each year.\n- 4-H Programs - STEM, Health, Agriculture & Civic Engagement.

Due to Nassau County’s diverse environments, you could enjoy a morning stroll along the beach followed by an afternoon paddling the St Mary’s River. Or, you could start your day perusing the local farmers’ markets, enjoying Fresh from Florida products, followed by an afternoon of gardening. After exploring all the great options, it is not surprising that Nassau County is quickly changing. In fact, newly released census data shows Nassau County has grown 23.24% since 2010.\nAs Nassau County continues to grow, it is important to remember that UF/IFAS Extension Nassau County is available for everyone. The extension mission is to develop knowledge in agricultural, human, and natural resources, and to make that knowledge accessible to sustain and enhance the quality of life. Our programs focus on multiple statewide initiatives. The initiatives include supporting agricultural producers, protecting water quality and quantity, conserving our vital natural resources, helping families and individuals achieve social and economic success, and preparing youth to be responsible citizens. Therefore, as the county grows, we strive to be the solutions at your fingertips.\nExtension Agents and Their Programs\nUF/IFAS Extension Nassau County’s faculty and staff are prepared to help support and work with the community. To do so, the extension office provides programs about horticulture, family and consumer sciences, agriculture and natural resources, and 4-H Youth Development.\nTaylor Clem, Ph.D. – Horticulture\nYour horticulture program works with anyone interested in gardening and landscape management. Many of the programs work with homeowners, green-industry professionals, nurseries, community associations, or designers. Throughout the year we offer education and outreach opportunities to help the community learn about the most appropriate landscape decisions that protect water quality and quantity. In addition, we can work with you and your community to plan and adopt sustainable landscape practices.\nMeg Mcalpine – Family and Consumer Sciences\nYour family and consumer sciences program range from healthy living to family financial management. Programs offered by this agent benefit every Nassau County citizen. Regarding healthy living, offered programs include learning about basic nutrition and safely handling food to minimize food-borne illnesses. In addition, the family financial management program includes tax filing assistance and Medicare education.\nVacant – Agriculture and Natural Resources\nYour agricultural and natural resources program celebrates the diversity of our natural and productive areas. The agent works a lot with agricultural producers, especially with management and troubleshooting. Additionally, the agent works with citizens to better understand the important role of Florida’s natural resources, which includes programs regarding invasive species control, gopher tortoise education, and coastal ecosystem protection.\nKelsey Irvine and Ted Karsch – 4-H Youth Development\nYour 4-H Youth Development program is the backbone to extension. The 4-H program wants to “make the best better” by teaching youth the necessary skills to be responsible, productive citizens. Throughout the year, the 4-H agents in Nassau County offer programs focusing on leadership and civic engagement. Regardless of your youth’s interests, reach out to the county office to learn more about the county’s wonderful 4-H clubs.\nThe Power of Volunteers\nYour extension program wouldn’t be nearly as successful without its unbelievably talented volunteers. Master Gardener Volunteers help lead horticulture educational programming. Master Naturalist Volunteers focus a lot of efforts on educating the public about our vital resources. Finally, 4-H Youth Development volunteers are the critical parents helping support the 4-H clubs and their youth.\nThe Solutions at Your Fingertips\nYour county extension office is here to provide science-based education to help enhance your quality of life.

{"question":"What are the benefits of predictive maintenance, and what cybersecurity risks emerge when implementing it through IoT-OT convergence?","answer":"Predictive maintenance offers multiple benefits including proper scheduling of maintenance work, avoiding unexpected equipment failures, increased plant safety, improved equipment performance and durability, reduced accidents, and fewer environmental impacts. However, when implemented through IoT-OT convergence, it introduces significant cybersecurity risks. The convergence increases the attack surface for organizations, making it harder to detect and respond to attacks. The challenges include the lack of a universal security framework, the sheer number of devices involved, limited resources for securing networks, and organizations being unaware of cybersecurity risks in an constantly evolving threat landscape.","context":["Predictive maintenance (PdM) is applied in order to find out the condition of in-service equipment with the aim of predicting the actual time when the equipment is due for maintenance. This approach helps to guide against the waste of money and time arising from performance of maintenance work done at the wrong time.\nThere are a number of benefits that can be drawn from predictive maintenance measures. In the first instance, it will help you to schedule or plan for corrective maintenance at the proper time. You can plan and budget for preventive and corrective maintenance if you know which of your equipment requires maintenance and when it is proper to carry out the maintenance work. It is also a veritable means through which one can avoid unexpected equipment failures. It will equally help to ensure increased plant safety, increased equipment performance, increased equipment durability, reduced accidents, fewer environmental impact and others.\nThere are various nondestructive testing technologies that are used in predictive maintenance in order to evaluate the equipment conditions. These aspects of predictive maintenance include vibration analysis, laser shaft alignment, air leak surveys, on-site dynamic balancing, corona detection, infrared, sound level measurements and others.\nVibration analysis or monitoring can be used on any type of rotating equipment. Though it is the most costly aspect of predictive maintenance program to plan and run but it is the most productive component that can be utilized on high-speed rotating equipment. This explains why it is the most widely used predictive maintenance technique. Vibration analysis can be classified into three categories namely, detection, diagnosis and prognosis. In detection, a broad source is utilized in measuring the level of vibration. The diagnosis of the fault detected is made. A professional will give a prognosis on the remaining life or possible failure of the equipment.\nLaser shaft alignment is another aspect of predictive maintenance. In laser shaft alignment, several shafts are aligned with each other within a tolerated margin. This aspect of predictive maintenance can help in keeping a motor and machine within the tolerance margin. This helps to expand the life of the machine and increase its efficiency.\nIn a compressed air system, the single largest energy waste is air leakage. Air leak survey is an aspect of predictive maintenance through which air leakage can be detected. Ultrasonic detectors are utilized in air leak surveys in order to detect leaks. Some powerful detectors can detect leaks from more than 50 feet away even in a noisy plant environment.\nOn-site dynamic balancing can be utilized as a diagnostic tool in predictive maintenance. On-site dynamic balancing reduces the level of vibration caused by wear. It is also effective in reducing new components tolerances, dirt build up and power consumption. It also increases the life of the bearing and optimizes the machine operation. Dynamic balancing can be used in grinders, fans, mills, hay grinders, machine tooling, mixers, grain dryers and others.\nAcoustical analysis is another aspect of predictive maintenance. It can be done on an ultrasonic or sonic level. With this aspect of predictive maintenance, friction and stress in a rotating machine can be heard.\nInfrared analysis is very effective in detecting electrical and mechanical failures. It is taken to be the most cost effective technology today by some people.","By Chandan Pani, CISO, LTIMindtree\nOT (Operational Technology) and IoT (Internet of Things) are two distinct concepts related to technology and connectivity with key differences in their scope and application. It is exciting to witness and be an integral part of them as they are increasingly getting entwined.\nIoT is revolutionizing manufacturing and industrial processes as it uses advanced technologies such as machine learning (ML), Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication, and Big Data to derive efficient outcomes from sensors and internet connected small devices. Operational Technology (OT) refers to the hardware and software systems that are used to monitor and control physical devices and processes in industrial environments. It includes technologies like supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, industrial control systems (ICS), and programmable logic controllers (PLCs).\nThe convergence has made the physical machines ‘intelligent’, and offering benefits such as Predictive maintenance, Advanced monitoring with Remote controlling, and Implementation of AI and ML or Process automation.\nWhile we enjoy and celebrate the pros, it’s essential to view and understand the cons. Since the two technologies come from unrelated and isolated realms, bridging them together with internet and technology has been like combining two pandora’s boxes. This convergence has implications on cybersecurity, as it increases the attack surface for organizations and makes it more difficult to detect and respond to attacks. For example, if an adversary gains access to a metro trains OT network or a city surveillance system, they can create any number of disasters that would affect a large part of the city’s population. To predict such attacks and to avoid such disasters, securing these networks is crucial. But due to the sheer number of devices involved in these networks and limited resources, securing them becomes challenging.\nAdditionally, the lack of a single security framework that is universally accepted for these diverse devices adds to the existing security challenges. Along with organisations being unaware of the cybersecurity risks associated and the constantly evolving threat landscape make such networks a great target for hackers and cyber terrorists.\nOrganizations need to be aware of emerging trends in cybersecurity, such as the increasing use of cloud computing, the growth of the IoT, and the development of new attack methods. Organizations can mitigate the risks associated with IoT-OT convergence by implementing a layered security approach, using security tools that are specifically designed for IoT applications, educating employees about IoT security risks, and conducting regular security assessments of IoT-OT systems.\nThe other most critical requirement is the need for the right skill set to manage complex security requirements. It is commonly seen that organizations often end up with lesser skilled resources thus compromising their security posture. It is ideal to have a skilled partner as a MSSP who can provide a wide range of services, including threat monitoring, incident response, and security consulting on IoT and OT security. By combining a well-defined incident response plan with managed security services and highly skilled teams, organizations can significantly enhance their cybersecurity posture.\nIT and OT teams need to collaborate to create a holistic and secure ecosystem for the IoT-OT convergence. By sharing information about the physical plant or a traffic control system with each other, the IT and OT teams can better understand the risks to workers and assets. This allows them to develop more effective safety and security measures and continue protecting the organisation and allowing for growth without the loss and decline caused by security incidents."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8657c526-6dd7-4f87-8554-4134696b2579>","<urn:uuid:9a6d0b59-8378-46c4-b926-84fba6f547fe>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do current AI systems handle emotion recognition across cultures, and what are the key safety considerations being debated in military AI development?","answer":"Current AI systems lack sophisticated emotion recognition capabilities across cultures, which is why DARPA's CCU program aims to develop multimodal human language technologies that can recognize speaker emotions across different languages and cultures, similar to how human interpreters monitor emotional feedback through facial expressions, tone of voice, and diction. The program seeks to create systems that can detect significant changes in communication that could indicate potential conflicts. Regarding safety considerations in military AI development, there is significant debate among researchers and experts. While some, like Gartner analyst Anton Chuvakin, view current AI as primarily mathematical and statistical tools rather than conscious systems, there is widespread agreement that automated decision-making systems for lethal purposes require careful ethical consideration. Many researchers advocate for establishing clear safety standards and ethics guidelines, with some suggesting that society is deploying AI technologies faster than developing understanding of their limitations. The lack of settled public standards for safety and ethics in military AI applications remains a critical concern.","context":["DARPA program seeks to develop natural language processing technologies capable of interpreting cross-cultural communication, norms to assist DoD operations abroad.\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) is one of many government agencies that operates globally and is in constant contact with diverse cultures. Communicative understanding, not simply of local languages but also of social customs and cultural backgrounds, lies at the heart of Civil Affairs and Military Information Support Operations activities. These collectively comprise a vast majority of U.S. counterinsurgency and stabilization efforts. Within these activities, cross-cultural miscommunication can derail negotiations, incite hostile discourse – even lead to war. The likelihood of communicative failure increases dramatically where significant social, cultural, or ideological differences exist.\nAutomated systems would be a welcome force-multiplier for DoD interpreters. However, unlike the human cultural interpreters who enable U.S. forces today, current AI-enabled systems are incapable of accurately analyzing cross-cultural communication or providing useful assistance beyond basic machine translation. While there have been significant advances made in machine learning and multimedia analysis, a number of critical deficiencies in these systems still remain.\n“To support users engaged in cross-cultural dialogue, AI-enabled systems need to go beyond providing language translation – they need to leverage deep social and cultural understanding to assist communication,” said Dr. William Corvey, a program manager in DARPA’s Information Innovation Office (I2O). “Moving AI from a tool to a partner in this capacity will require significant advances in our machines’ ability to discover and interpret sociocultural factors, recognize emotions, detect shifts in communication styles, and provide dialogue assistance when miscommunications seem imminent – all in real-time.”\nTo assist negotiations and aid critical interactions, DARPA developed the Computational Cultural Understanding (CCU) program. The goal of CCU is to create a cross-cultural language understanding service to improve a DoD operator’s situational awareness and ability to effectively interact with diverse international audiences. The program seeks to develop natural language processing (NLP) technologies that recognize, adapt to, and recommend how to operate within the emotional, social, and cultural norms that differ across societies, languages, and communities.\nCCU is divided into two primary research areas. The first is focused on research and development efforts to address a specific set of challenges limiting the application of current human language and communication technologies. These challenges include: 1) the discovery of sociocultural norms, 2) emotion recognition as a function of sociocultural norms, and 3) detection of impactful changes in sociocultural norms and emotions.\nHumans acquire inferred knowledge of diverse and varied sociocultural norms through a lifetime of learning and interaction. CCU aims to emulate this learning capability, creating technologies that are capable of automatic discovery of the sociocultural norms that influence discourse, including the social, cultural, and contextual factors that impact effective communication and rapport building.\nCCU also aims to create a capability that can recognize speaker emotions across different languages and cultures. Human interpreters continuously monitor emotional feedback from conversational participants (e.g. facial expression, tone of voice, diction), using this information to gauge how the interaction is progressing and alter the exchange as needed. In order to interpret speaker emotions as influenced by sociocultural context, CCU will focus on developing multimodal human language technologies capable of generalizing their recognition of emotion across different languages and cultures.\nFurthermore, CCU seeks to create capabilities to detect significant changes in communication that could indicate impending conflict or dispute. While promising change detection methods exist, current frameworks lack an understanding of which features are most crucial to detecting imminent communicative failure.\nTo help promote truly effective cross-cultural interaction, CCU technologies must be able to not only detect potential misunderstandings but also generate alternative socioculturally-appropriate responses. As such, the second research area in CCU will focus on the development of a dialogue assistance service. The target service will automate the detection of sociocultural context, including aspects related to identity and group affinity, and leverage the outputs of the first research area in order to follow ongoing conversations, detect misunderstandings in real-time, and provide dialogue assistance to human operators to prevent communications from going awry and/or provide remediation support.\nThe CCU Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is available on the System for Award Management (SAM) website at https://beta.sam.gov/opp/a6d0788057414e2c8fd6bdf45e3fd21d/view.","On AI and the military, researchers look to draw a line\n- By Derek B. Johnson\n- Apr 05, 2018\nResearchers with Google and academics across the world are petitioning organizations on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence research to steer their efforts away from military AI applications, particularly autonomous lethal weapons.\nConcerns about the ethical implications of AI are nothing new, but as governments and industry continue to invest in a number of technologies that fall under the artificial intelligence umbrella, the question of where -- and how -- researchers and industry should draw ethical lines around military applications has become increasingly relevant.\nIn an open letter first published by the New York Times on April 4, Google employees urged CEO Sundar Pichai to end the company's participation in Project Maven, a Pentagon program designed to apply big data analytics and machine learning to aerial imagery captured by drones and improve military decision-making. Those employees who signed -- more than 3,000, according to the Times -- argued the company “should not be in the business of war.”\n“Building this technology to assist the US Government in military surveillance -- and potentially lethal outcomes -- is not acceptable,” the letter read.\nA collection of nearly 60 AI experts and academics from around the world recently put out a similar letter, calling for a boycott of South Korean-based KAIST University over its decision to partner with Hanwha Systems, a leading South Korean defense contractor, to open a new research center dedicated to AI and military convergence.\nMarie DesJardins, a professor of computer science at University of Maryland Baltimore County and one of the signatories of the KAIST letter, told FCW she is not being pollyannish when it comes to AI. DesJardins said she doesn’t believe in “Terminator” scenarios where sentient machines turn on their human masters, and recognizes that even if the U.S. eschews the use of AI in military operations, other countries won’t necessarily follow suit.\nShe has concerns about other implications on the technology, but she draws a bright red line at autonomous weapons systems, arguing that if left unchecked, they could one day facilitate killing on a scale that would make such systems as dangerous as nuclear weapons. DesJardins said she signed the letter because KAIST was not clear about whether the center would draw any ethical boundaries around its research, while the partnership with Hanwha Systems, which traffics in missile systems, tanks and other weapons of war, indicated the potential for work on autonomous weapons.\n“We need to be working globally to think about this issue, just as we thought a lot as a species about nuclear proliferation,” said DesJardins. “There’s the same potential here, you can develop essentially weapons of mass destruction very easily if you have autonomous weapons.”\nThe letter spurred a response from KAIST University President Sung-Chul Shin. In a letter obtained by FCW, Shin assured the signatories that the research center “aims to develop algorithms on efficient logistical systems, unmanned navigation [and] aviation training systems,” but it will steer clear of “autonomous weapon lacking meaningful human control.”\n“I would like to reaffirm that KAIST does not have any intention to engage in development of lethal autonomous weapons systems,” wrote Shin. “KAIST is significantly aware of ethical concerns in the application of all technologies including artificial intelligence.”\nAnother signatory, University of Michigan computer science and engineering professor Benjamin Kuipers, told FCW via email that his interpretation of Shin’s comments indicates that the center will stay within acceptable bounds of military-based AI research.\n“From my individual point of view, as a person not accustomed to parsing diplomatic statements, this sounds like a satisfactory response,” Kuipers wrote -- though he noted “the intentions of an individual or an organization can change at any time.”\nThere’s little in the way of formally recognized standards to guide researchers, and the oncoming AI arms race means military officials and policymakers could exert pressure to push the limits.\nIn an April 5 post reacting to the Google letter, the Electronic Frontier Foundation advised companies who develop AI technologies for government to “start by recognizing that there are no settled public standards for safety and ethics in this sector yet. [A company] cannot just assume that the contracting military agency has fully assessed the risks or that it doesn't have a responsibility to do so independently.”\nDesJardins echoed those thoughts, saying society lacks agreed-upon rules about which forms of AI military work raise unique ethical concerns and which are like any other weapon of war. Partnership between the research community, government officials and technology manufacturers will be necessary to set such standards, and she said she believes an international treaty might be needed in the end.\n“We’re deploying these things way faster than we’re developing our understanding of what the limitations are,” DesJardins said.\nNot everyone is quite so concerned. Anton Chuvakin, a research vice president for technology consulting firm Gartner, said he does not understand the outrage, particularly in the case of the Google letter. He said current AI technologies are child’s play compared to the versions that regularly scare moviegoers and are more akin to advanced software systems computing mathematical formulas.\n“To me, a lot of the current AI is mathematics and statistics. There’s no consciousness, there’s no intelligence,” he said. “It isn’t like they built a killer robot for the Pentagon.”\nChuvakin and DesJardins both agree that such killer-robot technology, if it is even possible, would not rear its head for decades. As for modern applications, Chuvakin said that other countries will move forward with AI research that pushes the boundaries regardless of how the U.S. chooses to proceed. Eschewing military AI applications, he warned, could put the U.S. at a fatal long-term strategic disadvantage.\nStill, even Chuvakin acknowledged that one particular form of attainable AI does give him pause and warrants a larger ethical debate.\n“Anything that leads to automated decision-making to kill people is probably the line I would draw,” he said.\nDerek B.

{"question":"As an industrial kitchen designer, I'm interested in understanding both the novel mathematical approaches to odor cancellation and the practical plasma-based solutions for commercial kitchens. How do these two technologies compare in their approach to eliminating food odors?","answer":"The two technologies take fundamentally different approaches to odor elimination. The mathematical model approach works by identifying and emitting canceling odors - for each odor, there exists another odor that, when smelled simultaneously, results in no odor perception. This system would first detect an odor and then emit a corresponding canceling odor based on scored chemical and physical properties (-5 to 10). The plasma technology, on the other hand, uses a four-stage physical process: pre-filtration to remove solids and aerosols, electrostatic filtering, plasma oxidation reactions that break down molecular structures, and finally an activated carbon filter that traps and oxidizes remaining compounds. While the mathematical model is still theoretical, plasma technology is already implemented in commercial kitchens and has proven effective at eliminating odors without using chemicals.","context":["November 4, 2014 report\nBrothers create mathematical model for creating odor cancelling smells\nBrothers Lav Varshney with the University of Illinois, and Kush, with IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center have together come up with a way to create odor canceling smells, akin to white noise for sound. They've written a paper describing their work and have uploaded it to the preprint server arXiv.\nScientists long ago discovered that it was possible to \"cancel\" the perception of sound in humans by simultaneously playing a certain mixture of other sounds. They've also found a way to do roughly the same thing with light. Achieving that feat for smell proved more difficult—it wasn't until just two years ago that a team of researchers at Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science came up with a way to create what they called \"olfactory white.\" The idea is that for every odor, there is another odor that when smelled at the same time, results in the perception of no odor at all.\nIn this new effort, the research brothers took the idea further by creating a mathematical model that could be used to create a working olfactory white machine. To lay the groundwork for such a machine, the researchers studied a wide variety of odors and gave each a score (from -5 to 10) based on both its chemical and physical properties. Each of the odor scores was put into a database along with a paired canceling odor. A machine that took advantage of the database would first detect an odor, then emit a canceling odor. The machine could also conceivably understand new types of odors by mixing odors in its database and then coming up with a mix of canceling odors to render the new odor unsmellable.\nThe brother's Varshney have not created such a machine as yet, but are confident that the right mix of researches and engineers could build one, or may types of them. Some could be used to improve indoor air quality, for example, in buildings, cars and other public or private places. It could also conceivably be used to make some foods that some people don't like, more palatable, as the sensation of taste is wound so tightly with smell. The key to such machines, would of course, be figuring out how to cause the existing bad smell to evenly mix with the canceling smell before both enter the nostrils.\nOlfaction, the sense of smell, has received scant attention from a signal processing perspective in comparison to audition and vision. In this paper, we develop a signal processing paradigm for olfactory signals based on new scientific discoveries including the psychophysics concept of olfactory white. We describe a framework for predicting the perception of odorant compounds from their physicochemical features and use the prediction as a foundation for several downstream processing tasks. We detail formulations for odor cancellation and food steganography, and provide real-world empirical examples for the two tasks. We also discuss adaptive filtering and other olfactory signal processing tasks at a high level.\n© 2014 Tech Xplore","Odour removal using NTP plasma technology. Effective air cleaning and odour removal using CAP Cleanair Plasma equipment\nTreating air in commercial kitchens and mobile food service facilities, such as food trucks and display cooking: Effectively decreasing odors with low operating costs.\nPlasma air purification technology is a technology for treating air or circulating air in which the smallest gaseous organic carbon compounds, such as odor molecules, are eliminated and bacteria and viruses are destroyed. Solids, i.e., grease and aerosols, are separated out in the initial pre-filtration stage. Plasma technology offers a large number of applications. These include purifying exhaust from commercial kitchens and food service facilities and effectively eliminating cigarette smoke, odors from waste storage rooms, bacteria, viruses, and other harmful substances contained in indoor air.\nPlasma technology was developed to eliminate odors in the food services and in industry, and it has been used in these fields for many years as an effective way to purify exhaust. It is based purely on the principles of physics and, similar to UV ozone technology, it works entirely without chemicals.\nWhole house ventilation systems can be equipped with this technology – as well as mobile food service facilities and fields such as display cooking or food trucks, for example. Products in the CleanAir Plasma CAP 600 to 10,000 line can be adjusted to company requirements. Our plasma systems are constantly effective and so energy efficient that they ensure compliance with the Energy Savings Ordinance (EnEV 2013).\nCleanAir Plasma (CAP) technology by oxytec consists of four stages of operation:\n1. Pre-filtration with initial separation of solids & aerosols\nDuring the initial separation of solids, two mesh filters filter out coarse contaminants in the air. This effectively protects the next phase of the plasma technology. More protection is provided by an integrated sponge with with hydrosorbic properties. All the pre-filtration stages can be easily removed from the CAP system for regular cleaning.\n2. After pre-filtration, an electrostatic filter further removes substances\nThis is elimination that happens by breaking down molecular structure using electric voltage. Solids or aerosols that have remained after pre-filtering are effectively separated out into a removable, easy-to-clean pan.\n3. Reaction processes and oxidation in the plasma technology stage\nThe process of creating plasma that happens during high voltage induces reaction and oxidation processes during the flow of plasma electrons. The organically polluted exhaust is thus enriched with singleton oxygen, so that carbon compounds are either stimulated to react with oxygen or react with it directly.\n4. The activated carbon filter, the final stage, and reactive storage\nCompounds that were not oxidized are trapped by the activated carbon filter and oxidized there. Activated carbon functions as reactive storage, changing ozone (O3) back to oxygen (O2), for example. Activated carbon fluidly regenerates during the air purification and thus has a long life span.\nThe air temperature should not exceed 50°C (not common in kitchen exhaust)\nOn the basis of effective initial separation of materials and regularly cleaning the pre-filters, the air should be as free as possible of grease and aerosol particles.\nAir humidity should not be higher than 95%.\nNo harmful effect on the environment\nNo grease or aerosol particles\nNo noticeable kitchen odors\nNo harmful byproducts (thanks to Stage 4 of exhaust purification, no ozone is released into the environment)\nHowever, the exhaust essentially remains exhaust, not fresh air. In the end, it is used air from a quasi-industrial process.\nUnconventional ventilation concepts can be implemented due to the components installed in the CAP system.\nOdor pollution is eliminated.\nIt is possible to release exhaust into areas where there are people (streets with shops).\nThanks to compact construction, it can be easily used for preparing food in small kitchens, e.g., in shopping centers or display cooking stations.\nOptionally, it can be used in heat recovery without additional costs.\nEffective heat recovery is possible:\nThe previously mentioned EnEV regulation on energy savings, starting at 4000 m³/h, if it is economically feasible\nHeat recovery (cross flow)\nCombined circulation system (KVS in German)\nConventional heat exchangers\nImportant for heat recovery design: a constant level of efficiency, because grease deposits are not excluded\nTechnological Advantages over the Competition\nA one-year warranty on all components\nSignificantly larger space for plasma reactions\nShort-circuit shutdown of each plasma unit for fire safety reasons\nLocal companies can conduct maintenance after being trained\nThe lining of the interior casing is from stainless steel, according to VDI Standard 2052\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nNecessary cookies are absolutely essential for the website to function properly.

{"question":"How do the cultural significance and preservation stories of Albany's York Street and Washington's Old Post Office compare?","answer":"Both sites represent important preservation success stories but faced different challenges. York Street in Albany showcases Western Australia's oldest settlement history through preserved heritage buildings and artworks honoring Aboriginal-European relations. The Old Post Office Building in Washington DC was repeatedly threatened with demolition (in 1928 and 1964) but was saved through preservationist efforts, particularly those of Nancy Hanks, and was successfully adapted for mixed commercial and federal use, becoming a model for historic preservation.","context":["Location: York St, Albany\nDistance: 1.4km loop\nTrail Marker: No markers, unofficial trail\nDuration: 1 - 2 hours\nCost: $0, free entry\nDate Hiked: 18th January 2019\nKml Map File: Please click here.\nStraight up I just want to point out that this is an unmarked, unofficial trail, but one I think would be a great asset to the Albany Trails Network. As the oldest settlement in Western Australia Albany has a rich Aboriginal and European history. You only have to walk down the main street to see this but this small street also has some amazing art works so I thought it would be nice to create a little trail for anyone interested.\nYou can technically start the trail from anywhere on York St but for the purpose of this blog I have started it outside the Albany Visitor Centre.\nRight next door to the visitor centre is the Alison Hartman Gardens also referred to as Mokare Park. This is the first point of interest on this walk. The gardens are currently under construction (May19) and I am not 100% sure when they are due to be finished but from the planning pictures it looks like it's going to be an amazing little garden and I do believe the Mokare statue will remain in recognition of the role he played in the peaceful co-existence between Noongar people and the first European settlers.\nMokare was a Noongar Elder of the Menang people and at the time the Albany settlement was declared by the British in 1826, the land covering about 6000 square kilometres had belonged to his family. With natural curiosity on both sides in the early years of British settlement, there was some exchange and interaction between the Menang and the British and Mokare became known as the /Man of Peace', acting as a guide and interpreter for the newcomers, showing them traditional walking trails of the Menang and also assisting in their explorations.\nAnother highlight to the gardens is 'The Albany Peace Pole', an international symbol which stands for peaceful harmony. There are well over 200,000 Peace Poles in 180 countries around the world with the message on each pole - \"May Peace Prevail on Earth\". With the blessing of local Noongar Elders, the Mayor of Albany, Milton Evans, dedicated The Albany Peace Pole during the Harmony Week celebrations on 20th March 2011.\nThe highlights at the top of York St include:\n'Hordern's Monument' which has significant heritage value. Crowning the intersection of four major thoroughfares into the centre of Albany's shopping precinct the monument is a fitting tribute to the memory of Anthony Hordern, who was the entrepreneur behind the WA Land Company, which, was the catalyst to the building of the Great Southern Railway.\nThe top of York St provides my favourite view of a street in Western Australia, looking downhill towards Princess Royal Drive and the Anzac Peace Park at the foot of the hill adjacent to Princess Royal Harbour.\nAcross the road is the first Art piece on this walk, painted by artist 'Hense'. For this untitled piece of art, Hense started out with a very loose and unpologetic painting approach, reacting progressively as he workd to the shape and architecture of the wall.\n\"The final piece has both a painterly quality and graphic edge with large elements that read from a distance\" - HENSE\nFrom here you need to start heading back down York St on the opposite side, till you reach the laneway between the Albany Hotel and Paperbarks.\nI seem to have lost my photo of the Albany Hotel so will have to add it in later but this is quite a significant building. Formerly called the Freemason's Hotel, The Albany Hotel was one of the three hotels built in Albany in the 1890s and still remains intact playing an important role in the entertainment and food industry since its inception in the late 1800s. Love a good country pub.\nThe artwork on the Paperbark Building is also quite appealing.\nThe first is by artist Deborah Ceccaroni. Despite having her signature and website there is actually no information on the name of this piece so viewers are open to their own interpretation.\nThe second piece on this wall is by artist Chad Marwick and is titled \"From Cheynes to Muttonbird', representing the coastline from Cheymes Beach to Muttonbird Island.\n\"I've spent so much of my life on these beaches and thought it fitting that I represent my home town's natural beauty with an abstract map of sorts and an abundance of vibrancy.\" - CHAD\nOn the other side of the laneway (The Albany Hotel building) is lots of individual art done as part of an Open Access Youth Art Studio Project for Youth Week 2008.\nContinuing on down to the next lane way and you will find two large pieces.\n'Metrical Geometrical' by artist Add Fuel reinterprets traditional Portugese glazed tile design, known as azulejo, creating layers of history over and beneath existing structures using stencils. The blue patterning he creates on walls and facades seems straightforward from a distance but up close it reveals a quirky, contemporary twist.\n\"The geometry of the stencil itself is an influence in the wall and vice versa, so the mural is actually integrated with the wall, the windows and the frames, creating this movement with the windows breaking the symmetry\" - ADD FUEL\n\"The Beginning\" by artist Karim Jabbari is a paste up of a photograph that he took in Tunisia. His lettering work uses different patterns, shapes, and colours, featuring compositins of classic Kufi and Maghrebi calligraphy.\n\"It's a light painting using fire to highlight the fact that Albany was the spark that ignited settlement in WA. The picture was pasted on the wall and blended with black on black calligraphy spelling AL BIDAYA - THE BEGINNING. The fire on the image slowly fades into floating letters saying Albany was the beginning and the beginning was Albany.\" - KARIM JABBARI\nIf you walk down to the Grey Street roundabout you can admire the grandest building on the whole of York St, the Albany Town Hall, designed by Adelaide firm Henderson, Marriot and Co., a superb example of Victorian Free Classical architecture. The building’s foundation stone was laid on December 9, 1886, by Albany Mayoress Mrs W G Knight and approximately 18 months later on June 1, 1888, the building was officially opened by her husband, Mayor William Grills Knight,\nExternally, Albany Town Hall is built from granite masonry with stucco decoration and internally from plastered brickwork. It is a two-storey building with a gallery and additional levels in the central clock tower. Its Free Classical elements include corner pilasters and quoins, round and elliptical details to window openings, pediments and decorative urns at the ends of the truncated pediment. This sits behind a clock tower which continues the architectural detail and is capped by a domed roof and flagpole.\nSince its construction the town hall has been used for entertainment, public meetings and indoor sporting activities. In the period 1981-1986 the building was converted into a theatre reflecting the earlier use in 1911 of the building as a picture theatre.\nContinuing on across Grey St is The Premier Hotel, the second of the three hotels built in Albany in the 1890s. Currently under construction so getting a nice pic of it was not going to happen. Apparently the former licencee orchestrated a fire that caused $1.5 million worth of damage to the historic hotel so he could claim the insurance. He was caught and has been jailed for 10 years.\nThankfully plans were recently revealed for the hotel’s new life, hence why it is under construction and will be till 2020.\nIn the lane-way alongside the hotel is the next piece of art, created by one of my favourite artists 'Stormie Mills'. His art titled 'So the Wind Won't Blow It All Away' incorporates paste up leaves by Albany artist Nat Rad, and acknowledges the ANZAC'S who left Albany and never came back.\n\"I melded the idea of someone who I respect and admire for their resilience and tenacity, FORM's Production Manager Sean Byford, with a homage to the ANZAC's that was perhaps, and it remains to be seen, more of a transient component of the whole work.\" - STORMIE MILLS\nNext up in the lane way between The Wombat Lodge and The Hub is a beautiful piece by artist Andrew Frazer called Returning Home. The mural is a nature based narrative work evoking journeys. Andrew has incorporated local plants into the mural and worked topography into the body of the character her has created in a reference to the area.\n\"The bandage on this character represents the hurdles we face, and how we carry them but move forward despite them.\" - ANDREW FRAZER\nNext up is Fearless by artist Borondo located on the wall opposite the beautiful building of the Scots Uniting Church. Borondo's style is influenced by his exposure to the Christ and the Holy Mary sculptures which his father restored as a career in Madrid. For this mural he sketched up his lines with a spray can through netting taped to the wall so he could reproduce the outline across the length of the wall before completing the work with aerosol and rollers.\n\"Through my artworks and their different levels I try to make people think about the hidden messages behind the poetic image. I look for reflection and harmony and not for reaction.\" - BORONDO\nAlong the walk you will see lots of these small square mosaics etched into the paving. I couldn't find a single bit of information on these, instead jagging finding out from Geoff Waldeck when I was admiring the artwork outside Six Degrees. Apparently it is the work of his wife, Sue Codee. Would be great to have some acknowledgement somewhere or some info on the displays.\nHeading down to the corner of York and Stirling Tce is where you will find a few points of interest.\nFirst of all the grand Empire Buildings, which are a group of heritage listed buildings constructed in 1912 and once comprised a group of shops and a cinema. The buildings have elements of Federation Free Style architectural design such as asymmetry and use of two contrasting building materials of brick and cement render. Features of the two storey building include a corner entrance, asymmetrical facade, parapet wall concealing roof, informal groupings of windows, gabled pediment and decorative skyline features.\nThe Western Australian Bank, also known as the Haynes Robinson building, is a heritage listed building located next door to the Empire Buildings. It was built in the Federation Academic Classical style and originally housed the local branch of the Commercial Bank of Australia. The two storey building has many features that are identical to the Empire Buildings.The two storey building has a symmetrical smooth rendered façade, with the lower floor finished in rendered ashlar. The paired groups of arched windows have classical pillars and prominent architraves. A number of classical motifs have been utilised to embellish the façade.\nJust across the road in front of these buildings is a striking sculpture to mark the centenary of the end of WWI called ‘Marching Soldiers’. Sculptor Tony Pankiw created the work, which depicts two soldiers on their way to depart troopships in November 1914.\n\"I wanted to send them back home for the 2018 commemorations – they have come home after the war, alive and well. I wanted to return them to the place the Anzacs left in 1914 and thought having the two soldiers in Albany again at this special time would be very complementary to the City’s events.\" - TONY PANKIW\nFrom here you will need to cross over York St again as we begin to make our way back up to the Visitors Centre. On the opposite corner you'll find the\nDirectly opposite is a state heritage-listed York Street landmark, Albany House which was originally constructed as the Union Bank of Australia building, and completed in 1884. The banking chamber occupied the ground floor while the manager's residence took up the first floor. The two storey building was built in the Victorian Regency style; it is constructed from load-bearing masonry that has been rendered and painted. A rendered plinth at the base of the building is continuous around the main facade and is deepest at the truncated corner as the site slopes to the south. The building has a dominant square form with a truncated corner, where the main entrance is located, at the intersection of Stirling Terrace and York Street.\nAn example of an old phone box sits just outside.\nA couple of other heritage listed buildings are just a little further up.\nBlush retail gallery is situated in a beautiful white heritage building seen below. The building has recently been refurbished, and features a new light filled contemporary showroom.\nNext door, the yellow and brown building was the old “Nonna’s” restaurant, a local landmark for more than 50 years. The 120 year old building has been transformed by the South Coast Woodworks team into a stunning new gallery space.\nOn the corner of York and Peels Pl is where you will find the Albany War Memorial, commemorating those who died in service or were killed in action in World War One, World War Two, the Korean and Vietnam Wars. It was originally erected as a World War One Monument.\nIn the same garden complex is where you will find St John's Church, the first church to be consecrated in Western Australia and which is still in use today. Together with St John's Rectory and Hall, the War Memorial, Scots Uniting Church (across the road) and the Town Hall, this historic precinct forms an important focal point for Albany.\nThe last of the heritage buildings is the Newspaper House, Home to Albany Advertiser. First published in 1888 as the Australian Advertiser, the paper is still in circulation. The paper is the oldest continuous-running non-metropolitan newspaper in Western Australia.\nFrom here you just need to walk back up to the visitors centre. I will mention that Stirling Terrace is another worthy place that would warrant a trail. I've done a little bit of exploring but perhaps that will be another blog for another day.\nHopefully this post inspires you to visit and if so, we would love to hear your thoughts on the trail. Please feel free to tag us in your adventures.\nWe acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we walk, the traditional lands of the first nations people & wish to acknowledge them as traditional owners paying respects to their Elders, past & present, and Elders from other communities who may be here today.","Built from 1892 to 1899 to house the U.S. Post Office Department Headquarters and the city's post office, the Old Post Office Building is the second-tallest structure in the nation's capital, after the Washington Monument. For most of the twentieth century, it seemed that the massive Romanesque Revival structure was destined to be demolished, but through the efforts of dedicated preservationists it has become one of Washington's favorite landmarks.\nIn 1928, the Old Post Office Building was slated for demolition in the development now known as the Federal Triangle. Lack of funds during the Great Depression saved the building at that time, and over the next 30 years, it provided space for various Government agencies. In 1964, the President's Council on Pennsylvania Avenue recommended the demolition of all but the clock tower. As a result, local citizens banded together and, with the help of Nancy Hanks (the politically influential chairperson of the National Endowment of the Arts), convinced Congress to reverse its decision.\nA decade later, redevelopment plans for the Pennsylvania Avenue corridor included preservation of the Old Post Office Building, and renovation began in 1977. The plan called for retail commercial spaces on the lower level, with Federal offices on the upper levels. This adaptive, mixed-use approach received national attention as a viable approach to historic preservation. In 1983, the building was officially renamed the Nancy Hanks Center in recognition of her devotion to the preservation of significant buildings.\nIn honor of our nation's Bicentennial celebration in 1976, the Ditchley Foundation of Great Britain presented a set of English change ringing bells to the U.S. Congress as a symbol of friendship. The bells were permanently placed in the Old Post Office clock tower in 1983 and are rung at the opening and closing of Congress and for national holidays.\nThe Old Post Office Building is a reminder of the foresight of preservationists devoted to conservation of our built environment. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\nThe Old Post Office Building occupies an entire city block, centered on the north side of the Federal Triangle along Pennsylvania Avenue -- the link between the Capitol and the White House. Designed by Willoughby J. Edbrooke, Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department, the Old Post Office Building exhibits a matured version of the Romanesque Revival style, which was popularized by renowned architect H.H. Richardson in the late nineteenth century. The building's massive scale, rustication, arched fenestration, and ornamentation evokes the Romanesque Revival style, while incorporating a variety of complementary features such as Byzantine sculptural capitals, French Gothic dormers and sculpture, and French Renaissance detailing. The eclectic effect of these details creates a delightful visual vitality that is now regarded as a virtue along Pennsylvania Avenue's predominantly Classical Revival corridor.\nSheathed in granite from Vinalhaven, Maine, set upon an iron and steel superstructure, the vast nine-story building was the first steel-frame building erected in Washington. Unlike other contemporary tall buildings, the five-feet-thick granite masonry walls are self-supporting, while the steel girders are used to support the interior floor beams. As a fire-proofing measure, a terra-cotta shell encases each steel and iron structural member.\nAlong Pennsylvania Avenue, three large semicircular Romanesque arches frame the principal entrance and are ornamented with Romanesque Revival columns, capitals, moldings and richly foliated spandrels. The rock-cut rustication at the first-story and mezzanine walls contrast with the smooth surfaces of the upper stories, where vertically stacked bays are crowned with a continuous springing course and wide arches at the fifth story. The sixth and seventh floors, separated from the lower floors by a stringcourse, are composed of narrow, two-story window units separated by twin-columned mullions, capped by arcades. At the top of the wall, a wide, dentiled cornice is reminiscent of the machicolation used in medieval fortifications.\nThe facade (north elevation) is divided into three vertical sections, defined by the central recessed portion of the building. At its center, a lofty clock tower projects forward and rises 315 feet to a hipped roof accentuated by pinnacles at the belfry. Tall stone pilasters support the clock face, which is simply framed by a Roman arch. Above this, an observation deck is pierced by three large, arched openings that offer some of the best views of the city. The east and west wings of the facade project forward slightly, with corners embellished by soaring pinnacles with conical roofs. The steeply pitched, slate-clad roof is pierced by stone-clad dormers adorned with stone finials.\nThe most remarkable feature inside is the nine-story light court topped by an enormous skylight that floods the interior with natural light. When it was built, the room was the largest, uninterrupted interior space in Washington. The building's renovation uncovered the skylight and added a glass-enclosed elevator on the clock tower's south side to provide visitor access to the observation deck. A lower glass atrium at the east side of the building was added in 1992.\n1892-99: The building is constructed.\n1928: Development of the Federal Triangle south of Pennsylvania Avenue threatens the Old Post Office.\n1964: Plans to finish the Federal Triangle jeopardize the Old Post Office Building, prompting a vocal campaign to save the building, led by Nancy Hanks.\n1973: The Old Post Office Building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n1976: The Ditchley Foundation of Great Britain presents the Congress Bells in honor of the nation's Bicentennial.\n1977-83: GSA rehabilitates the building while remodeling it for adaptive-use.\n1983: The building reopens with a combination of Federal offices and retail spaces. It is officially renamed the Nancy Hanks Center.\nArchitect: Willoughby J. Edbrooke\nConstruction Dates: 1892-99\nLandmark Status: Listed in the National Register of Historic Places\nLocation: 12th Street & Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.\nArchitectural Style: Romanesque Revival\nPrimary Materials: Granite, steel, iron\nProminent Features: Clock tower, atrium, Congress Bells\nThe Old Post Office, designed in the tradition of Romanesque Revival architecture of H.H. Richardson, occupies the entire city block bounded by 11th, 12th, C and D Streets at the juncture of Pennsylvania Avenue. A massive rectangular structure, it measures approximately 200 feet from east to west and 300 feet from north to south. The nine-story building rises 135 feet to the flat portion of the roof. The tower, located in the center of the north façade, rises to a height of 315 feet above grade.\nThe massive structure, faced with granite from Vinalhaven, Maine, is a solid masonry load-bearing structure with walls over five feet thick. The plans indicate that the exterior walls of the building are self-supporting, not reinforced with steel girders at each floor, as was customary for tall buildings. The steel columns embedded in the walls seem only to support the interior floor beams (the above structural information was taken from a paper by Watterson).\nThe heavy masonry massing and detailing of the building are typical of the Romanesque revival style. The main Pennsylvania Avenue entrance is defined by three massive arches with smooth-faced voussoirs, ornamented archivolts and the ciphers US and PO in richly foliated spandrels. On the second story, with its contrasting surface of smooth, rusticated masonry, are three rectangular windows above each arch. Above the windows is an ornamented parapet. The entrances on the east and west sides contain one large arch flanked by two smaller arched openings. The south façade contains a loading dock.\nThe exterior of the first, mezzanine and second floors flanking the entrance and on the other sides of the building is of rock-faced masonry. The second story is separated from the upper stories by a molded stringcourse, which continues around the building. Twin arched windows flank the main entrance. On the second floor are found narrow, rectangular two-light windows.\nIn contrast to the rock-faced masonry of the lower floors, the upper walls are of smooth, rusticated granite. Above the main entrance, the third story terrace is cut into the building, allowing the east and west ends to project, forming wings. Each wing is terminated on both ends by round towers with conical roofs topped by stone finials. The windows in the tower are narrow and rectangular. The fenestration on the third, fourth and fifth floors are conceived as a unit: rectangular windows on the third and fourth floors with round-headed windows on the fifth floor. Each bay is separated by a pilaster terminating in a cornice. From the cornice springs an arch on the front wings, forming two arcades and six arcades on the sides. The ordering of the windows and placement of the terraces above the entrances is similar for all sides of the building.\nThe sixth and seventh floors are separated from the lower floors by a stringcourse. The fenestration is conceived as a two-story unit terminating in round-headed windows below the arches, which are supported by twin-columned mullions forming four arcades on the east and west wings and twelve arcades on the sides. Above the machicolated cornice rises the steep slate Chateau roof containing large stone dormers terminating in stone finials.\nThe tower rises 315 feet above grade from the center of the main façade. Below the cornice line, its massing is accentuated by a projection of several feet from the central façade. Above the arched fifth story window is the inscription: ANNO DOMINI MDCCXCVII (reflecting the architect's optimism that the building would be finished by 1897). From the cornice line the tower rises as a solid mass with only narrow slits for openings and decorative arches above the clock face on each of the four sides. Above the clocks are four turrets, one on each corner, separated by five narrow arched windows. Above rises the steeply slanting roof.\nThe interior of the building opens onto a grand court or cortile, which is ringed by offices that open onto corridors overlooking the court. The court was originally roofed in glass and flooded with light, but at present has been covered with insulation material, resulting in a very dark open space. The first floor of the cortile was roofed over with a steel and glass roof so that it could be heated and used. The interior corridors on the first floor are linked with marble wainscoting. The open cage elevators are also of interest.\nThe Office of Building Management, Public Buildings Service, described the building in 1962 as obsolete and recommended the limitation of improvements to those required for seven to ten years occupancy. The report warned that an extension of life expectancy to an indefinite period would require complete modernization.\n(Information taken from the 1973 NR Nomination)\nOver time, there has been little appreciation for the Old U.S. Post Office Building. It was constructed during the last decade of the nineteenth century, a period of architectural change, when tastes were turning from the boldness of Victorian styles to the refinement of the Classics. It seems fair to say that the Old Post Office was long viewed as a graceless intruder to an elegant setting.\nOnly in recent years has the building attracted attention for its own values. What was once regarded as a fault--its unique visual quality--is now a virtue, a delightful variation of form, size, and style.\nOriginally designed by Willoughby J. Edbrooke, Supervising Architect of the Treasury between 1891 and 1893, the design and construction of the Old Post Office extended through the terms of five different Supervising Architects. Among them, Jeremiah O'Rourke and William Martin Aiken were responsible for major modifications to Edbrooke's design. Construction started in 1892 but progressed slowly and it was not until 1899 that the building was ready for occupancy.\nStylistically, the building has many features similar to designs by H. H. Richardson and therefore has been characterized as Richardsonian Romanesque. However, it is only in materials and certain details that the building is typical of this style. The basic shape was inspired by the large municipal halls of great Italian medieval cities, though its symmetry shows a nineteenth century European academic influence and there are details on the exterior best described as Renaissance. The turreted pavilions are capped by steeply sloping roofs with gabled dormers, giving the upper part of the building a strong flavor of French Renaissance or Chateau style. These sharp-edged, free-standing tops accent the building corners and lend an exciting independence of form.\nThe Old Post Office is noteworthy among Washington buildings for more than its individuality of style. With the exception of the Washington Monument, it is the tallest building in the city. Its construction incorporated many of the latest technical innovations of the day, such as steel and iron framing, fireproofing, and an electric power plant. The building encloses a magnificent interior space, the largest such uninterrupted space in the city.\nOriginally intended to house both the U.S. Post Office Department and the Washington City Post Office, the entire building was turned over to the federal department in 1914. The structure apparently was never large enough for even that operation alone, however, and in 1934, a new U.S. Post Office Building was constructed in the Federal Triangle across Twelfth Street. Since then, the Old Post Office has alternately housed the departments of Justice, Defense, Agriculture, and Interior, as well as the General Accounting Office, Interstate Commerce Commission, U.S. Information Agency, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nApparently the Old Post Office was one of the first federal buildings to be constructed in this area of the District of Columbia. Unfortunately, little is known about its site history. The Preliminary Historic Structures Report recommended that additional research be undertaken relating to the site. However, planning funds have not been made available for this purpose. It can be easily seen, nonetheless, that the building's orientation and two of its facades were ignored in subsequent site development.\nThe architecture of the building itself gives character to the Old Post Office site. Its style, essentially Richardsonian Romanesque, and its form-including the seven story stone facade, two story chateau-like roof, lofty clock tower and the highly decorative arches which define the main entrance--have a significant impact on the building's surroundings. One of the most important aspects of the building-to-site relationship is that the ponderous Romanesque nature of the architecture demands that the structure rest clearly, sharply and distinctly on its ground plane.\nNational Register 1973 Nomination\nThe Old Post Office, with its huge clock tower, has long been one of Washington's favorite landmarks. In recent years the clock tower, which is visible from a distance of several miles, has received particular acclaim as an element of great vitality in the otherwise sterile skyline of the Federal Triangle.\nThe Joint Committee on Landmarks has designated the Old Post Office and Clock Tower a category II Landmark of importance, which contributes significantly to the cultural heritage and visual beauty of the District of Columbia. The Old Post Office is one of Washington's few significant Romanesque Revival buildings on a monumental scale. It was the first Federal building erected on Pennsylvania Avenue in the area now known as the Federal Triangle. Plans for the building were prepared in 1891 in the office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury, W.J. Edbrooke. Many similarly styled Richardsonian-inspired Federal Buildings erected throughout the country in the 1890¿s were designed in Edbrooke's office. At the time of its completion in 1899, the building with its 315-foot high clock tower was the third highest in Washington, exceeded only by the Capitol and Washington Monument. Its central enclosed court was one of the largest in the world.\nDesigned to house the U.S. Post Office Department as well as the Washington City Post Office, the building served as the headquarters of every Postmaster General from 1899-1934. IT was there in 1908 that the observance of Flag Day was initiated by some employees who met on the second floor balcony overlooking the court and sang homage to the Star Spangled Banner. Every Flag Day, a complete collection of State Flags was displayed from the walls of the central court. Normally on display was the largest correctly proportioned U.S. Flag in existence. This flag, which hung down nearly seven stories from the skylighted room, was furled on Flag Day to avoid dwarfing the smaller State Flags.\nIn 1914, the Washington City Post Office moved to a new building adjacent to Union Station. The department remained in its headquarters until 1934 when the new U.S. Post Office Building across 12th street was ready for their use. The Old Post Office has since been shared by a number of Federal Executive Departments and agencies.\nFor over 30 years, the Old Post Office has prevented completion of the final quadrant of the Great Circle on 12th street, an important element in the Federal Triangle plan of 1928-1938."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9a115379-b2d6-42c1-a1c8-afef1052840d>","<urn:uuid:c97205ca-4dcb-4686-be52-bcf461bebcaa>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do geographic barriers and environmental changes influence both coral reef ecosystems and the evolution of cryptic species like Tridacna elongatissima?","answer":"Geographic barriers and environmental changes have significant impacts on both coral reefs and species evolution. For coral reefs, warming oceans are causing increasingly frequent and severe mass bleaching events, with some areas showing no signs of recovery. This has led to the destruction of 80% of Caribbean coral and 50% of Indonesian and Pacific coral over 30-40 years. Similarly, geographic barriers like the Horn of Africa's opposing currents have influenced species evolution, as demonstrated by Tridacna elongatissima's separation from T. squamosina. These currents create a 'headwind' that prevents larval movement between regions, leading to allopatric speciation where populations become genetically isolated and evolve into distinct species over millions of years.","context":["I have always been fascinated by scientific discoveries that are hanging right in front of our noses. Cryptic species are one such surprise. Sometimes, researchers using genetic sequencing are surprised to discover that a group of animals that all look the same from the outside are actually reproductively isolated from each other; separate twigs on the tree of life. This surprise has happened over and over in the history of natural science.\nIt turns out such puzzles are frequent among the giant clams. These unusual bivalves are specialists in coral reef environments, growing to large size with the help of symbiotic algae that create sugars through photosynthesis. Within the genus Tridacna there are ~10 accepted species which vary in size, shape, color and mode of life.\nI specialize in the three species known (so far) from the Red Sea, including the small giant clam Tridacna maxima and the fluted giant clam T. squamosa, which are both found worldwide, all the way from the Red Sea to down past the equator along the Great Barrier Reef. The third local species, T. squamosina is more unusual, so far being only known from the Red Sea (an endemic species). T. squamosina is an example of a cryptic species, having previously been assumed to be a local variant of T. squamosa. It looks pretty similar, with long scutes (flap-like appendages) protruding from its shell, thought to help stabilize it on the flat bottom of loose coral rubble. But unlike T. squamosa, T. squamosina lives exclusively at the top of the reef in the shallowest waters closest to the sun. It has a very angular, zig-zag pattern in its plications (the wavy shapes at the edge of the shell) and a characteristic pair of green stripes where the soft tissue meets the edges of the shell. The soft tissue is covered with warty protuberances.\nIt was only first described in detail in the early 2000s, when an international team of researchers figured out using genetic sequencing that it was a distinct species and named it T. costata. They noted that in their surveys all around the shores of the Red Sea, they only found 13 live specimens, making it an extremely rare and possibly endangered species. Fossil specimens on local reefs appeared to be much more common, suggesting it had a much larger population in the past. Then in 2011, another team at the Natural History Museum in Vienna discovered a shell of one had been forgotten in its collection for over 100 years. Rudolf Sturany, the researcher on the 1895 research cruise who had originally collected the clam, had called it T. squamosina.\nIn taxonomy (the science of naming and classifying organisms), the first team to name the species wins, so the name T. costata was synonymized (retired) in favor of the earlier name T. squamosina, which became the name of record. It must be annoying to spend so much time working to name a species and then discover you had been scooped over a century before! But such is science.\nThe strange part was that there were some murmurs over the last few years that T. squamosina was not only found in the Red Sea, but also had been seen along the coast of Africa as far south as Kenya, Mozambique and Madagascar. Divers and snorkelers had taken pictures of a giant clam that did indeed look strangely like T. squamosina, with a zigzag shell opening and green stripes at the edge of its tissue. But some aspects of these individuals seemed off. In the Red Sea, T. squamosina lives freely, not embedded in the coral as these pictures showed, and the geometry of the angles of the shell seemed a bit different. It also would be difficult for T. squamosina to be connected in population from the Red Sea all the way South to Mozambique, as there are natural barriers which would prevent its planktonic larvae from riding currents to intermix between the two regions. When populations are separated by a barrier, the flow of genes between them is cut off and evolution begins to separate the populations from each other until they are separate species, a process called allopatric speciation.\nI figured that someday, researchers would collect tissue samples from these mystery clams to settle whether they were actually T. squamosina or something else. And this year, a team did just that, traveling along the coast of Mozambique, Madagascar, Kenya and other places, collecting samples of tissue to compare how all the different clams they saw were related in a family tree. They genetically sequenced these “clamples” and in the process, found that the mystery clams were a new cryptic species, which they called T. elongatissima!\nT. elongatissima closely resembles T. squamosina, and they are sister species on the bivalve family tree. It’s hard to tell them apart without training. Even a professional would probably mix some of them up if they were all placed sitting next to each other. The major differences appear to relate to shell shape, with T. elongatissima having a less symmetrical shell than T. squamosina, and a bigger opening at the rear hinge for a foot to poke through. The symmetrical shell and closing of the foot opening may represent changes that T. squamosina took on to adapt to be able to sit freely on the bottom, rather than embedding in the coral like T. elongatissima seems to prefer. If you’ve read this far, you may be thinking “Who cares? A clam’s a clam and these look practically the same. Aren’t you just splitting clams at this point?” At the end of the day, a species is a man-made concept; an organizing tool for use by us humans. Species are the characters in our reconstruction of the history of the world. What can we learn about the world by having identified this species T. elongatissima?\nThe researchers behind the new paper discuss that based on statistical analyses of the genetic differences between the species, the most recent common ancestor for T. elongatissima and T. squamosina probably lived more than 1.4 million years ago! Some researchers have previously suggested that T. squamosina probably began its development as a separate species due to geographic isolation by low sea level, caused by repeated glaciations. With so much water trapped as ice on land during this period, the narrow Strait of Bab al Mandab, currently the gateway to the Red Sea, became a land barrier as sea level fell (kind of like opposite of the Bering Sea land bridge that formed allowing humans to migrate to the Americas). Ancestral clams trapped on the Northern end of this barrier were proposed to have evolved to become the rare T. squamosina.\nThis has occurred with a variety of species that became Red Sea endemics (meaning they are unique species that evolved in the Red Sea and are found nowhere else), including a unique crown of thorns starfish. The issue is that during this time of low sea level, the Red Sea went through periods where it was a rather unfriendly place for clams to live. All sorts of creatures went extinct in the period when the sea was repeatedly cut off, because the water became extremely salty, along with other unfriendly changes. So it’s unlikely T. squamosina would be present for us to see today if it only lived in the Red Sea throughout the entire length of time.\nThe researchers of this new paper propose that T. squamosina was more likely to have initially branched off due to the barrier of the Horn of Africa. The seas off of Kenya and Somalia harbor a meeting of southward and northward currents which then group and head offshore, away from the reefs that giant clam larvae are trying to get to. So any tiny floating planktonic clam larvae would experience a strong “headwind” preventing them from crossing that point. It would also mean that during times that the Red Sea was not a happy place to be a clam, T. squamosina may have found refuge on the coasts of places like Eritrea, Oman and possibly even as far as Pakistan. During times when sea levels rose and Red Sea conditions became friendlier, it recolonized the area.\nAs far as we know, the Red Sea is the only place T. squamosina is now found, but it may well be present elsewhere like Yemen or Oman. If T. squamosina was found in other regions, it would be tremendously important for its conservation. Right now, the species is thought to be extremely rare, with a very small native range. If it inhabited a broader area, that would mean more reservoirs of genetic diversity. This would reduce the odds that it will go extinct as reefs are put under stress from climate change, pollution and overharvesting. To survive as a species, it helps to not put all your eggs in one basket. If you’re only found in one small place, it increases the chances that a disaster (like climate change) will wipe you out.\nThe only way we will know for sure is to visit reefs in understudied places like Yemen, Oman, Pakistan, Eritrea and Somalia, to understand the richness of the giant clams present. These areas are understudied for various reasons: lack of research funding for non-Western researchers, lack of interest from the scientific community too focused on familiar places, and geopolitical situations that make it difficult to conduct research. But I hope someday to collaborate with people in these countries to better understand the giant clams present in such understudied regions of the globe. It is virtually certain that there are more species of giant clams, both alive and as fossils, waiting to be discovered.","How global warming is driving mass coral bleaching\nWhat the science says...\nDespite what you may read or see in the mainstream media, out in the real world, massive and rapid changes are taking place in many ecological systems as a result of global warming. The Earth seems to be already convinced of global warming and is responding quickly.\nPerhaps the most significant, and likely most enduring, are the shifts taking place in the Earth's oceans. Whilst many readers may have read or heard about Ocean Acidification, there are numerous other changes taking place in the oceans which should be equally as concerning. One such phenomena to appear in the last few decades is mass coral bleaching, a consequence of the continued warming of the oceans. Once vast stretches of colourful reefs teeming with marine life are being reduced to lifeless rubble covered in seaweed or slime. Many areas are not recovering, and the scale and frequency of bleaching worldwide is getting worse. In fact, early reports suggest 2010 may have witnessed the largest single bleaching event ever recorded.\nThe lowdown on coral bleaching\nReef-coral are actually a symbiosis (a mutually beneficial relationship) between the coral polyp, an anemone-like creature, and tiny algae called zooxanthellae. The coral provide shelter and nutrients for the algae , and in exchange the algae provide carbohydrates (food) to the polyp, using energy from the sun (photosynthesis) and the nutrients provided by the coral. These algae live in the skin tissue of the polyp and produce the coloured pigments which make coral reefs so visually spectacular. When this partnership breaks down the polyps expel the algae, which leads to the \"bleached\" effect. Although the polyp does feed using its tentacles to snare food, the bulk of its nutrition (90%+) comes from the algae, and they are a critical component of coral skeleton formation and therefore reef maintenance and growth. Without symbiotic algae, the coral can die from starvation, or become so weakened by a lack of food, that it succumbs to harmful bacteria (Mao-Jones 2010), and/or seaweeds which can poison and kill coral on contact.\nBecause reef-coral have adapted tolerance to a narrow band of environmental conditions, bleaching can occur for a number of reasons, such as ocean acidification, pollution, excess nutrients from run-off, high UV radiation levels, exposure at extremely low tides and cooling or warming of the waters in which the coral reside. Typically these events are very localized in scale and if bleaching is mild, the coral can survive long enough to re-acquire new algal partners. So bleaching in itself is not something new, but mass coral bleaching on the huge scale being observed certainly appears to be, and represents a whole new level of coral reef decline.\nOcean warming is driving mass coral bleaching\nAs coral reefs operate very near to their upper limit of heat tolerance (Glynn & D'Croz 1990), bleaching en masse happens when the surface waters get too warm above their normal summer temperature, and are sustained at this warmer level for too long. The intensity of bleaching corresponds with how high, and how long temperatures are elevated and, as one might expect, the intensity of bleaching affects the rate of survival. Small rises of 1 -2 degree C, for weeks at a time, usually induce bleaching.\nThis episodic ocean warming has been most pronounced worldwide during El-Nino events, when the Pacific Ocean exchanges heat to the atmosphere and surface waters. In recent years though, severe mass bleaching is happening outside of El-Nino because of the \"background\" ocean warming. The huge mass bleaching in the Caribbean in 2005, a non El-Nino year, and again this year is a prime example of this (Eakin 2010) . Evidence connecting warm surface waters and mass coral bleaching has strengthened to the extent that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has a coral bleaching alert system in place. This alert system accurately forecasts mass coral bleaching based on satellite data of sea surface temperatures.\nHot water + Coral = Dead coral\nSo how does hot water kill coral? It requires both high water temperatures and sunlight. Oxygen is released as waste during photosynthesis and like all chemical processes this is affected by temperature, speeding up as more energy (warmth) is applied. When water temperatures rise too high the protective mechanisms to prevent heat damage, employed by the coral and the algae, are overwhelmed. The zooxanthellae algae produce high levels of oxygen waste which begin to poison the coral polyp. In acts of self-preservation the coral kick out the algae, and in doing so become susceptible to starvation, opportunistic diseases, competitive seaweeds and macroalgae (slime to you and me) . Coral can succumb to the effects of bleaching years later, and for those coral that survive, growth effectively ceases and full recovery can take anything up to a decade.\nCoral resilience is futile\nOn a world scale coral reefs are in decline, and it makes for rather depressing reading for an avid diver like myself. Over the last 30-40 years 80% of coral in the Caribbean have been destroyed (Gardner 2003) and 50% in Indonesia and the Pacific (Bruno & Selig 2007). Bleaching associated with the 1982 -1983 El-Nino killed over 95% of coral in the Galapagos Islands (Glynn 1990), and the 1997-1998 El-Nino alone wiped out 16% of all coral on the planet. Globally about 1% of coral is dying out each year. Not all of this continual decline is solely down to bleaching of course, pollution and other human activities are also contributing, but bleaching is speeding up the loss of coral.\nLooking only at bleaching though, we find that the incidence of mass coral bleaching increases dramatically in the last few decades. Despite modern records being biased by better monitoring and reporting in recent times, there seem to be little evidence of mass coral bleaching further back in time when examining long-lived coral communities. Studies from around the world show no signs of bleaching dating back many thousands of years, until recent decades (Abram 2003), (Aronson 2003). In the Caribbean there are no signs of previous mass bleaching dating back 220,000 years (Pandolfini & Jackson 2006)\nSo where does this resilience claim originate you may ask?. Perhaps from studies that have shown some coral, in secondary bleaching events, have lower rates of death. A few coral are in more fact tolerant to bleaching, some algae for instance manufacture their own \"organic sunscreen\". However this a only small proportion, major reef-building coral species seem incapable of forming long-lasting partnerships with these heat tolerant algae (Coffroth 2010), and the coral polyp themselves have a very poor genetic ability to adapt to warming (Csaszar 2010). However the \"resilience\" fallacy arose, there's no evidence a few hardy individuals will somehow prevent the loss of most coral worldwide.\nThe importance of coral reefs - the oasis in a marine desert\nSo what does this all have to do with the average man or woman in the street?, well, as far as humans are concerned, there is a rather large dollar value attached to coral reefs. Goods and services derived from coral reefs are very roughly estimated to be between $172 to $375 billion dollars per year (Martinez 2007). Not only that, but reefs directly provide food and income to over half a billion people worldwide. The decline of coral reefs is going to not only impact those that directly depend on them for a living and sustenance, but eventually have dramatic effects on economies worldwide, and will likely drastically drive up world food prices as fish populations nosedive.\nEcologically speaking the value of coral reefs is even greater because they are integral to the well being of the oceans as we know them. It might serve to picture them as the undersea equivalent of rainforest trees. Tropical waters are naturally low in nutrients because the warm water limits nutrients essential for life from welling up from the deep, which is why they are sometimes called a \"marine desert\". Through the photosynthesis carried out by their algae, coral serve as a vital input of food into the tropical/sub-tropical marine food-chain, and assist in recycling the nutrients too. The reefs provide home and shelter to over 25% of fish in the ocean and up to two million marine species. They are also a nursery for the juvenile forms of many marine creatures .\nI could go on, but the similarity with the rainforest should now be clear. Eliminate the undersea \"trees\", which mass coral bleaching is in the process of doing, and you'll eliminate everything that depends on it for survival, a point best exemplified in the following sequence of photos. (sequence of healthy coral-bleached coral-rubble & slime)\nA grim outlook for coral\nThe critical issue with global warming induced coral bleaching, as it is for many eco-systems, is the speed of warming. They are simply not being given sufficient time to evolve tolerance. The coral's algal partners have short lifetimes and possess genetic traits which may enable successful adaptation to warming. Coral themselves aren't so lucky, somewhat in contrast to their algae, they possess a poor genetic ability to combat warming stress and have decadal lifetimes. It's likely therefore that many coral will die because the speed of warming is too great within an individual communities lifetime.\nPerhaps a useful way of looking at it, is that the \"bar\" is continually being set higher and higher, and the recovery time between bleaching events becoming smaller and smaller. Gradually this continual ocean warming will start to impact areas which have so far escaped unscathed, and these coral will succumb too. Of course coral reefs aren't just under fire from bleaching, as mentioned earlier, humans are hurting them in many other ways. Ocean Acidification in particular is a large looming threat (Veron 2009). The increasing frequency and severity of bleaching, coupled with the persistent decline in coral around the world, should however immediately dispel any myths about coral resilience.\nLast updated on 13 January 2011 by Rob Painting."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:58ed455d-cf3b-4d26-9fa1-e39eaf1efc0f>","<urn:uuid:d53d108b-2c99-45e6-a40f-93cbe8606b7f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do customer loyalty and user experience relate to each other in terms of their business impact?","answer":"Customer loyalty and user experience are closely interrelated in their business impact. A bad user experience leads to lost customers who won't return and may go to competitors, while a great user experience fosters customer loyalty. Loyal customers become brand evangelists, providing long-term value. Similarly from the customer service perspective, providing excellent service and meeting customer needs leads to repeat business and customers encouraging others to use the service. Both UX and customer service contribute to customer satisfaction - when users find interactions easy, pleasant and natural, they are more likely to engage with the product/service repeatedly, leading to higher conversion rates and sales.","context":["Are you wondering what all the User Experience fuss is about?\nUser Experience (UX) is somewhat of an elusive notion with many different definitions, even amongst the UX community themselves. There is user experience involved in all product and service design however my focus here is purely on digital user experience (e.g. websites, intranets, applications, software).\nThere have been studies conducted, theories put forward, discussions and research has been undertaken – as a result of which there are now several formal definitions of User Experience that co-exist.\nFormal Definitions of User Experience (UX)\nISO 9241-210 (Ergonomics of human-system interaction) defines user experience as “a person’s perceptions and responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a product, system or service”.\nThe problem with this definition is that it still leaves so much to interpretation. Designing the user experience is a combination of an art and science with many “rules” actually being guidelines based on user behaviors during testing.\nAdditional notes in the ISO definition go on to explain that UX includes all the users’ emotions, beliefs, preferences, perceptions, physical and psychological responses, behaviours and accomplishments that occur before, during and after use. That really is a lot to think about – with much of it out of our control.\nFurther definitions on UX can be found all around the web and in print – the result of the UX communities’ own efforts to agree on what we do, and how we define it. A good list of links to all the various definitions is available on All About UX.\nNumber 4 in this list –\nEvery aspect of the user’s interaction with a product, service, or company that make up the user’s perceptions of the whole. User experience design as a discipline is concerned with all the elements that together make up that interface, including layout, visual design, text, brand, sound, and interaction.\nThis definition from the User Experience Professionals Association, is the definition I prefer to use as, to me, it is more specific and only includes areas I know I can control or influence when designing the user experience.\nPeter Boersma describes user experience as the umbrella term that joins a number of related disciplines. He developed a T model diagram to show this, discussed below.\nI particularly like this model as it has survived for some time (in terms of the web) and it is an accurate assessment of the key disciplines involved in being a User Experience Practitioner. This T-model has provided a platform for more in-depth analysis into Information Architecture, as discussed by Nathaniel Davis in UX Matters.\nThe six core disciplines of Peter Boersma’s User Experience T-Model:-\n- Information Architecture\n- Interaction design\n- Visual design\nWhen a UX person has a fairly well balanced set of the six disciplines, they have a broad understanding of all the disciplines and as such they are known as a UX Generalist (see diagram below). Each UX person will be different as to the weighting of the disciplines.\nMany of today’s User Experience professionals started out their careers with a specialty in one of the disciplines. This becomes their specialty due to their depth of knowledge and they’re known as a UX Specialist in that discipline. They have some knowledge of other the other five UX disciplines. The example below shows this for a UX Specialist in Content.\nThe T-shaped UX practitioner is a hybrid of a generalist and specialist. They will have broad knowledge in all the disciplines and have deep knowledge in at least one, if not two of the disciplines. They combine depth and breadth and I’ve found that they are usually the more experienced UX professionals.\nUX professionals and the skills they have generally fall into these three types. Each of the types has different levels of knowledge in each of the six disciplines. As an organization, you need to think about which of the UX types is best for your needs, but having a UX generalist on board is always a good place to start, bringing in specialist skills as and when required.\nWhy you need User Experience\nIt is very likely that every person reading this article has had an interaction with a product or service that doesn’t work the way you expect or that doesn’t quite meet your needs. Think back to the time, and how it made you feel. Frustrated? Confused? Stupid? Angry?\nWhen your product or interface doesn’t work the way your users expect it to, these are some of the feelings that they experience. Generally your users are your customers and as such, any of these emotions are the last thing you want them to experience when engaging with your business.\nIn addition there are some key areas in your business that can be affected by the user experience you offer.\n1. Customer Loyalty\nIn the simplest terms possible, if your users have a bad experience on your website, they won’t come back. So not only have you lost a customer, you’ve increased the likelihood that your customer will go to a competitor. If your user has an okay experience on your website, but a better experience on your competitors website, they’ll go back to the competitor.\nYou can add all the features and functions you want but when it comes to customer loyalty the user experience offered has a far greater impact. All your new fancy features and functionality won’t bring a customer back to your website – but a great user experience will.\nIt is also well known that loyal customers make some of the best brand evangelists. Having this kind of customer should be your ultimate goal and great UX helps achieve this.\n2. Return on Investment and Conversion Rates\nHaving a really good user experience ensures that your company gets a return on its investment. It ensures that all the money you put into the website generates into measurable value for your business. This value may be in dollar terms but it could also be in things like conversion rates. For example, because your user experience is good:-\n- Customers are loyal and frequently return to buy your products/services.\n- Customers think it is easy to find, use or buy your products/services.\n- You have the ability to convert “browsers” into “buyers”, increasing your “browser to buyer” conversion rates.\nKeeping track of what percentage of users you convert into customers helps you measure how effectively your website meets your business goals. This percentage is called the conversion rate, and this is far more effective in measuring your user experience than actual sales figures.\n3. Efficiency and/or Productivity\nA great user experience improves efficiency as well – by either helping your users to do things faster or by helping them make fewer mistakes. If you’re looking at UX for an internal customer – such as employees who use an intranet, improving efficiency of your tools has a direct correlation to productivity and improves it.\nThe less time it takes to achieve a task, the more you can get done in a day. Looking at this on something like an eCommerce website, the faster and simpler it is to buy a product, the more likely it is that users will buy multiple products.\n4. Customer satisfaction\nYour customers are your users. When it is easy, pleasant and natural for users to be able to achieve a given task, users are likely to do the task more often.\nSo if this customer was your employee an experience that was easy, pleasant and natural to achieve helps ensure the employee experiences a high level of satisfaction – which can help them become productive.\nIf the user was your customer, the satisfaction experienced because the product was easy and pleasant to use, means it is likely that the product (e.g. website) will be used more often which leads to higher conversion rates and often to higher sales figures as well.\nI hope this article has helped you better understand what user experience is and why it should be important to your business.\nRemember, your customers expect to be able to engage with you on their terms. Helping them do so can only help your business.\nYour turn. How do you define User Experience and why do you think it is important (or not important) to your business?","Customer Service: What Is It and Why Is It Important?\nEvery one of us serve customers, whether we realize it or not. Maybe you’re on the front lines of a company, serving the people who buy your products. Perhaps you’re an accountant, serving the employees by ensuring paychecks go out and bills are paid on time. Or maybe you’re a company owner, serving your staff and your customers.\nWho Are Customers?\nA customer is anyone who uses a service. Most customers are external and are the primary revenue source for a company. These customers influence the business by either encouraging or discouraging potential customers based on their experience. Since existing customers provide a source of revenue and have a strong influence on potential growth, ensuring these customers are satisfied is paramount.\nWhat is Customer Service?\nPeople will always remember both good & bad customer service experiences, but we are more likely to talk about or report the bad experiences. If you want to ensure you are getting repeat business, prioritizing the needs of your customer base is essential. There are various ways to provide good customer service, but there are certain elements that remain constant, regardless of the nature of the business.\nCustomers have a basic criteria and priorities that determine whether their experience is positive or negative. Customer service can be defined as any action you take to ensure the customer is pleased with the transaction on a long-term basis. This includes “after sales service,” which ensures the customer leaves the point of sale with the item desired, within the timeframe they expect, and that the item has no defects or issues. The actual sales transaction is the simple part of customer service since both the customer and seller typically have the same objective. Ensuring that customers are pleased after the transaction requires more attention.\nWho Are Customer Service Providers?\nWhatever the beginning of the process is within your organization, everyone who is behind the scenes should be focused on completing their tasks correctly to ensure that the entire process goes smoothly. Say you work in a sales environment with a warehouse – stockers in the warehouse may not seem like they are part of good end-user customer service, but one misplaced or mislabeled part can lead to delays, confusion, or even shipping the wrong item to a customer. Even employees who don’t interact directly with external customers or whose jobs don’t seem to have a direct correlation with the end-user experience can influence customer service. Great customer service starts at the beginning! If your direct customer is internal to your organization, providing them with excellent service ensures that the next step can go smoothly. When everyone completes their job tasks correctly so the next person in the chain can do the same without delay, our end-user customers will only benefit!\nAttitude is Everything\nProviding great customer service requires energy and enthusiasm. Body language can speak volumes when dealing with a customer, regardless of what is being said. Customers can see the difference between an employee who is just saying the company scripted lines and one who genuinely wants to help them. Staying energized and enthusiastic always would be ideal, but it is not realistic. We all experience fatigue at times that can affect our attitudes, but here are some tips to help minimize fatigue and boost low energy levels:\n- Take a walk\n- Drink a glass of cold water\n- Be sure to eat a good breakfast and lunch\n- Place yourself around energetic people\n- Listen to up-beat music\n- Try to stay humorous\nSituations may arise that cause you to become irritated or frustrated, and a negative attitude will typically have a negative effect on customer service. If you are finding it difficult to stay positive in certain situations, try following these tips:\n- Rearrange or redecorate your workspace\n- View negative situations as a training session for your future and use them to your benefit\n- Find ways to spend more time on tasks you enjoy\n- Look for opportunities to learn new things\n- Realize that you can find positives in any negative situation\nIdentifying and Addressing Customer Needs\nThe first step in improving customer service is determining what your customers value. The obvious way to find the answer is to simply ask them. Businesses spend time and money surveying customers, which usually results in constructive feedback. After identifying customer needs, the next step is to commit yourself to meeting them and showing them how important they are to your organization.\nWhile it is important to speak with customers and assist them with their needs, it is equally important to actively listen to the customer and avoid presumptions. Learn by listening and determining what kind of customer you are working with. Some customers know exactly what they want or need and want to be told how you can meet those needs. Others may have a general idea of what the end goal is and want you to share your knowledge to fill in the gaps so you can work together toward a solution. Listen to your customer’s complete thoughts before interjecting.\nThe priorities of your organization should mirror the priorities of your customers. Customers typically have a few of these basic needs:\n- Friendliness & Acknowledgment\n- Understanding and empathy\n- Control/Ability to have an impact\n- Options and alternatives\nCustomer Service over the Phone\nWhen providing customer service over the phone, the success of your interactions depends on your tone of voice and choice of words. Customers expect a courteous, helpful response when they call your business.\nFollowing the basics of telephone etiquette can help provide the response that customers expect:\n- Answer the phone promptly and with a smile. Practice your greeting with and without smiling. You should be able to hear a difference and so can your customers!\n- Always use a greeting word or phrase first when answering the phone– often, the first thing you say will not be heard by the person on the line. If you utilize a greeting word or phrase like “Good Morning,” your customer will be more likely hear what you say next (like your company name and your own name).\n- Offer your personal assistance upfront, then listen to the caller explain the reason and nature of their call without interrupting.\n- Speak clearly and make notes as the customer is talking. Always jot down the caller’s first name so you can address them by name when responding. This helps your customer trust that you are listening and attentive.\n- Ask your customer before putting them on hold. If your phone does not have hold music or an on-hold message, let them know that it will be silent as they hold so they do not think they’ve been disconnected.\n- If you need to transfer the caller to another person, let the customer know what you’re doing, and if possible, you should let your colleague know who you are transferring and any information you’ve already gathered from the caller. No one appreciates having to repeat the same information to a new person. This will show your customer that you’ve been paying attention and care about their issue.\n- Always let your customer hang up the phone first to ensure they are done with the call\nManaging Unhappy Customers\nDealing with an angry customer is inevitable. Whether the customer’s anger and frustration are warranted or not, it is the job of the customer service representative to accept the situation and move forward with solving the problem. The best way to get to the root issue quickly is to try to calm the customer so they can fully explain their issue.\n- Speak calmly and evenly.\n- Listen without interrupting; take notes.\n- Be empathetic without being patronizing; using phrases like “I understand” or “I can sympathize with you” aren’t necessarily good in situations with angry customers – if you understand, then why did it happen to them in the first place? Those phrases can also make your customer feel like you’re cutting them off.\n- Once your customer is done speaking, quickly read your notes and recap the issue as you understand it to make sure you are both on the same page with what the problem is that needs to be solved.\n- If you know how to solve the issue right away, clearly explain what the process will be and the timeframe the customer should expect.\nThere are times when you may not be able to provide a timely solution without additional resources. When these situations occur, it is important to communicate your plan of action and leave your customer on good terms. Communicate any updates, whether good or bad, in a timely fashion as you follow up on the issue toward resolution. It’s important to manage your emotions do not take anything personally; your customer is not angry with you, and it is your responsibility to make sure they feel validated and that their problem is resolved. Remember this Customer Bill of Rights when managing angry customers:\n- Customers should always be taken seriously\n- Customers should always be respected\n- Customers should always be listened to\n- Customers should always receive a quick response\nBeing gracious and helpful when addressing customer complaints can cause your customer to rave about your customer service, even in an initially adverse situation and generate return business.\nTen Tips to Get Customers Working for Your Business\nIf you want to make a lasting impression on customers, you need to go the extra mile. Giving customers more than they expect will not only keep them coming back, but it will also inspire them to encourage others to increase your customer base.\n- Greet customers with a smile\n- Be helpful and make customers feel that your primary concern is being helpful to them\n- Know your product or service\n- Don’t make customers feel ignorant\n- Listen to customers more than you talk to them\n- Treat employees with consideration and respect\n- Make customers feel important and appreciated\n- Make things easy for customers\n- Throw in something extra\n- Say thank you and show appreciation\nIf you haven’t already, make a list to define your direct customer base. If your customers are internal, list ways that your job can affect their success and how your actions can affect the end-user customer experience. If your customers are external end-users, choose a few interactions you’ve had in the past, both positive and negative, with your customers and analyze each situation. Why were you successful or unsuccessful in these situations? Be flexible in your processes so that you can continue to update them to provide the best service when you see an opportunity for change and growth. Remember, the customer may not always be right, but the customer is always important."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:22b829ff-52e6-4edc-92ca-cd98a5d6c16b>","<urn:uuid:5ee23b05-8fd7-4391-9bd2-fb622a5e8e2d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm a minority student interested in physics. What is the current representation of diverse scientists in physics, and what initiatives exist to address inclusion challenges in the field?","answer":"Currently, the representation of minorities in physics is very low. From 1973 to 2012, while over 22,000 white men earned PhDs in physics, only 66 African American women and 106 Latinas received PhDs - averaging fewer than 2 black women per year compared to 550 white men annually. About 15 Asian American women earned physics PhDs each year during this period. The field is working to address these disparities by recognizing that low representation stems from limited opportunities, lack of role models, non-inclusive behaviors and discrimination, rather than lack of interest or ability. Leaders like Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, the first Black woman to hold a faculty position in theoretical cosmology, are helping transform perceptions about who can be a scientist while conducting important research and advocating for justice and inclusion in science.","context":["Chanda Prescod-Weinstein is Assistant Professor of Physics and Astronomy and a Core Faculty Member in Women’s Studies at the University of New Hampshire. She is the lead “axion wrangler” and a social media team member for the NASA STROBE-X Probe Concept Study.\nThe first Black woman in history to hold a faculty position in theoretical cosmology, Prescod-Weinstein is also a Twitter activist who frequently goes viral, a prolific writer and editor in multiple genres and disciplines, and the author of a soon to come column in the New Scientist, and a 2021 book, The Disordered Cosmos: from Dark Matter to Black Lives Matter.\nA millennial, she is at the vanguard of a new cohort of brilliant, young, tech-savvy academics who are conducting important research in science and technology while also gracefully shouldering the responsibility of helping transform the way many of us think about what it means to be a scientist or technologist and who we think of when we imagine those categories.\nWhy interview a theoretical cosmologist for this series on tech ethics? Because tech, like science, has much work to do in reckoning with issues of race, gender, inclusion, and intersectionality.\nAs I spoke with her recently, I pictured young women and men of color or other marginalized backgrounds, looking to find their own place in the extraordinary world that is our tech culture/industry (I call tech a religion to underscore its size and influence, but more on that some other column) and wondering if a) they will be given a just and equitable opportunity to demonstrate their innate abilities; and b) if in their quest to “make it” in this world they will have to somehow ‘sell out.’\nPrescod-Weinstein tells the story, below, of a profound ethical dilemma she faced at the very beginning of her career in science.\nIn speaking of her own experience, she mentions Daniel Berrigan, about whom she first read in an Adrienne Rich poem about the“Catonsville Nine:” a group of anti-war activists who, in 1968, took hundreds of draft files in wire baskets to the parking lot of the draft board in Catonsville, MD. Berrigan, his brother and fellow Catholic priest Phillip, and their seven colleagues dumped the files out, doused them in homemade napalm, and set them on fire.\nBerrigan later explained he was inspired to take such dramatic action rather than merely talking about ethics, because he believed that mere talk would place him “in danger of verbalizing my moral impulses out of existence.”\nPrescod-Weinstein’s story, and her reference to Berrigan, offer a parable about the need for inclusion and justice in today’s tech world. When we talk about tech ethics, after all, are we talking mainly of more academic discussions about self-regulation or incremental policy changes? Or will we eventually grapple with burning issues to which we can only respond meaningfully with hard choices or dramatic actions?\nWhat we all make of this, and of other ethical questions raised in the conversation below, will determine so much about the future of ethics in tech.\nGreg E.: You have been playing a prominent role in facilitating conversations about justice, inclusion, and intersectionality in the science world. I wanted to speak with you about your activism because it seems to me discussions are also needed in the tech world, but seem to be happening even less in tech. What do you think?","The connections between identity diversity and relevant cognitive diversity in mathematics are less obvious. Could gender, race, ethnicity, or physical capabilities influence the representations and analytic tools a mathematician applies?\nMany of our complex challenges involve understanding the actions, preferences, and capabilities of diverse people. Thus, identity diversity also contributes relevant cognitive diversity.\nThe aforementioned efforts to reduce obesity require understanding economic, social, and psychological influences on behavior, as well as the impact of media. Our understandings of those dimensions will benefit from identity-diverse teams. The analysis of the effects of infrastructure will benefit from people from different geographic regions and from urban and rural locations. Overall, identity diversity may weigh in with similar magnitude as disciplinary diversity. To not include any men, or any women, on a team formulating an obesity-reduction program would be as shortsighted as not including a geneticist or a psychologist.\nThe connections between identity diversity and relevant cognitive diversity in mathematics are less obvious. Could gender, race, ethnicity, or physical capabilities influence the representations and analytic tools a mathematician applies? Sure. In mathematical research, identity is less germane than academic training, though it is possible that a person’s identity could influence how she represents a mathematics problem as well as the problems she chooses to tackle. That’s truer for the frontiers of math, where mathematicians often rely on analogies and knowledge from other experiences.\nThe lack of an obvious logic linking identity diversity to germane cognitive diversity in fields like math or physics does not mean that those fields do not need to be inclusive. On the contrary, because mathematics community confronts hard problems, it needs cognitive diversity.\nPermit me a slight digression to make a larger point linking inclusion to cognitive diversity. Define the capacity of a mathematician as the number of tools she can acquire. A great mathematician might learn about twenty topics, a good one only fifteen. Excluding some identity groups from being mathematicians or making the field less attractive to some groups results in a cohort of mathematicians with lower overall capacity. If a woman with a capacity of twenty opts out of mathematics, and a man with capacity sixteen replaces her, then mathematics suffers. The profession loses talent because she has more capacity, and it loses diversity because of her larger capacity.\nFifty years ago, people chalked up the low representation of women and some racial groups in mathematics, and science generally, to a lack of interest—“Women do not want to become physicists.” As recently as twelve years ago, some attributed the low numbers in these professions (offensively, I might add) to a lack of cognitive ability. Current thinking points to the effects of limited opportunities and exposure, the lack of role models, and the effects of non-inclusive behaviors and discrimination.\nPersonal accounts of women who entered school with the interest and ability to excel at mathematics and science but pursued other paths reveal the accumulated dampening of interest produced by repeated acts of discrimination. Some actions were overt and direct. Others were subtler. Combined, they made science an unwelcoming place.\nAs an undergrad, I took a two-year math sequence listed as Honors Track II that students referred to as “math for gods.” Lacking any training in calculus, I struggled during the first two courses. Recently, I looked up three students who had excelled in those classes. All three have enjoyed successful careers. One works as the chief actuary and risk officer at a large insurance company. A second serves as a chaired professor of law at the University of Chicago. The third, the only woman of the three, began her career in engineering, rose to become a senior software engineer, and now works as a life coach, facilitator, and counselor.\nPersonal accounts of women who tried to pursue scientific careers reveal any number of obstacles, both direct and indirect.1 The fact that the two men remain in technical fields and the one woman opted out is not surprising, but it is disheartening. We lose talent and diversity when environments are not inclusive.\nData gathered by the National Science Foundation reveal low representation of women and minorities in many technical fields, and we cannot but infer lost diversity bonuses. In 2013–2014, 1,200 US citizens earned PhDs in mathematics. Of these scholars, 12 were African American men and just 6 were African American women. From 1973 to 2012, over 22,000 white men earned PhDs in physics, as compared to only 66 African American women and 106 Latinas. Those numbers translate into over 550 white men and fewer than 2 black women earning PhDs each year. Over that same time period, about 15 Asian American women earned physics PhDs each year.2\nIn addition, recall how mathematics connects to other disciplines and how those connections can produce bonuses. A person may apply his mathematical tools to a problem that leverages identity-based knowledge or interests.\nThus, even if we see no obvious direct links between identity and relevant cognitive diversity within a technical field, diversity and inclusion produce bonuses by increasing the pool of talent and the range of problems studied. Think back first to the complicated graph of mathematical knowledge. People with greater capacity can trace out longer paths in that graph. Their talent adds diversity. In addition, on cross-disciplinarity complex tasks like the obesity epidemic or rising opioid use, identity-based knowledge or perspectives become germane, and identity brings relevant cognitive diversity.\n2.

{"question":"Can someone explain how scripture functions in Islamic religious practice? Need to understand basics.","answer":"In Islamic religious practice, scripture (the Qur'an) functions both as a written text and as a spoken word. It is particularly important in ritual practice and textual authority.

We have a whole article on the difference between hot sites and remote sites.\nA computer system or application that is essential to the functioning of your business and its processes.\nProduction or Primary Site\nIn the context of a primary and secondary site, the primary site contains the original data that cannot be recreated.\nRecovery Time Objective (RTO)\nThe RTO is the duration of time and service level within which a business process must be restored after a disruption in order to avoid unacceptable losses. RTO begins when a disaster hits and does not end until all systems are up and running.\nRecovery Point Objective (RPO)\nThe RPO is the point in time to which a firm must recover data as defined by the organisation. In other words, the RPO is what an organisation determines is an “acceptable loss” in a disaster situation. The RPO dictates which replication method will be required (i.e. nightly backups, snapshots, continuous replication).\nA system of using multiple sources, devices or connections so that no single point of failure will completely stop the flow of information.\nThe identification and prioritisation of potential business risk and disruptions based on severity and likelihood of occurrence.\nSecondary Site (or DR Site)\nThe secondary site contains information and applications that are built from the primary repository information.

{"question":"What are the historical dangers of methane in coal mines, and what modern monitoring systems are used to prevent accidents?","answer":"Historically, methane (known as firedamp) was a deadly threat in coal mines - it could explode when coming into contact with miners' candle flames. Miners used to take canaries underground as an early warning system. Today, sophisticated monitoring systems are used, including ultrasonic velocity instrumentation and integrated airflow and methane monitors. These systems continuously measure methane levels, airflow velocity and direction, particularly around electrical and belt installations. The monitoring helps detect problems in mine atmosphere at their earliest stage, though some areas of underground operations may still lack continuous monitoring.","context":["Coal bed methane While much of the media attention on unconventional gas in the UK has been focused on shale gas, coal bed methane is as great a problem, and a bigger threat in many areas.

Many underground coal mines cover vast areas where workers are not located. Continuous knowledge of the ventilation system status, along with information on the presence of methane or products of combustion from fires, is critical for detecting and correcting problems in the mine atmosphere in their earliest stage.\nTo this end, monitors can be used in targeted areas of the mine to collect environmental data on levels of combustible gas or products of combustion that may provide an early indication that heating is in progress. In addition to levels of combustible gas, monitoring airflow velocity and direction continuously can improve the safety of the underground workforce. However, continuous measurements of air velocity may not always provide accurate assessments of ventilation conditions, as these values can change rapidly depending on measurement location and airflow conditions.\nWhat is the extent of the problem?\nUnder MSHA regulations for atmospheric monitoring systems, monitoring in active mining areas usually involves methane and products of combustion around electrical and belt installations. Monitoring of ventilation airflow velocity is less common, with little information gathered on airflow direction. Large portions of many underground operations may not be continuously monitored for airflow velocity and methane accumulations.\nHow is OMSHR addressing the problem?\nThe Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) is investigating the use of ultrasonic velocity instrumentation in the underground mine environment. Ultrasonic anemometers are known for their accuracy, capability to measure low airflows, continuous measurement characteristics, and ability to provide a directional sign to the air velocity. This can be especially beneficial in situations with low air velocity in that airflow reversals may occur.\nCurrent OMSHR research efforts are focused on the installation of integrated airflow and methane monitors in active areas of underground coal mining operations. This work is identifying specific sampling protocols for these devices and is assessing the behavior of these instruments in relation to the presence of airway obstructions such as personnel and equipment. OMSHR is also identifying potential applications and limitations of integrated air velocity and methane monitoring systems and developing guidelines to interpret air velocity and methane monitor outputs.\nWhat are the significant findings?\nOMSHR laboratory testing showed that air velocity readings from continuous recording instruments correlated well with those obtained using standard measurement techniques. Obstructions upstream of a continuous recording anemometer led to noticeable impacts on air velocity readings, suggesting that movement of these obstructions in the ventilation airstream could be correlated to changes in instrument readings. In conditions with steady airflow, recorded velocities showed little variation over time, whereas turbulent conditions produced greater variability. This work also identified the minimum number of instrument readings needed to obtain an accurate assessment of ventilation air velocity in both steady and turbulent airflow conditions.\nWhat are the next steps?\nFuture work in this area will deploy sensors in underground coal mine environments to collect long-term data on airflow velocities and directions and on methane levels. This information will be analyzed for any trends that suggest the development of ventilation conditions conducive to accumulations of methane gas.\nNoteworthy Publications & Products\n- Composition Change Model for Sealed Atmosphere in Coal Mines (2010-06)\nThis paper presents a mathematical model based on the conservation of mass principle describing the flow of air (nitrogen and oxygen), methane, and carbon dioxide into and out of a sealed atmosphere and time-dependent changes in gas concentration.\n- Methods to Determine The Status of Mine Atmospheres - An Overview (2006-03)\nThis paper serves as an overview to remind and/or instruct readers about gas-sampling methodologies and gas analyses to assist in determining the status of underground atmospheres."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9e5af636-97a0-4fe3-b36d-0f10fd89266d>","<urn:uuid:9c6b6e23-fb39-4165-880a-4befdcb479e1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences in sample introduction methods between the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) system and the TSQ Quantum GC mass spectrometer?","answer":"The ICP system is designed primarily for liquid samples, though it can accommodate gases and solids with a special sampling system.

The TSQ Quantum XLS and the TSQ Quantum GC are advanced analytical instruments that include a mass spectrometer, liquid chromatograph, and the Xcalibur™ data system.\nIn a typical analysis, an autosampler (AS) introduces a sample into the gas chromatograph (GC). The GC separates the sample into its various components. The components elute from the GC and pass into the mass spectrometer where they are analyzed.\nThe TSQ Quantum XLS and TSQ Quantum GC mass spectrometers include an electron ionization/chemical ionization (EI/CI) ion source, ion optics, a triple-stage mass analyzer, and an ion detection system—all of which are enclosed in a vacuum manifold. Ionization of the sample takes place in the ion source. The specific process used to ionize the sample is known as the ionization mode.\nThe ion optics transmit the ions produced in the ion source into the mass analyzer, where they are filtered according to their mass-to-charge ratio. The polarity of the potentials applied to the lenses in the ion source and ion optics determines whether positively charged ions or negatively charged ions are transmitted to the mass analyzer. You can configure the mass spectrometer to analyze positively or negatively charged ions (called the positive or negative ion polarity mode).\nThe mass spectrometer is operated as a tandem mass spectrometer with two stages of mass analysis. The ion source ionizes the sample and the ion products are mass analyzed by the first-rod assembly. In this case, however, mass-selected ions exiting the first-rod assembly collide with an inert gas in the second-rod assembly and fragment to produce a set of ions known as product ions. (A chamber called the collision cell surrounds the second-rod assembly. The collision cell can be pressurized with an inert gas.) The product ions undergo further mass analysis in the third rod assembly to detect selected ions.\nFurthermore, in a second stage of mass analysis, the mass spectrometer can fragment and separate each ionic fragment of a molecule formed in the ion source to build up an entire structure for the molecule, piece by piece. As a result, the TSQ Quantum XLS and the TSQ Quantum GC systems make investigating all pathways for the formation and fragmentation of each ion in the mass spectrum possible.\nThe two stages of mass analysis, with resultant reduction of chemical noise in the final mass spectrum, allow for very selective and sensitive analysis.\nEach sequence of single or triple-stage mass analysis of the ions is called a scan.\nThe mass spectrometer uses several different scan modes and different scan types to filter, fragment, or transmit ions in the mass analyzer. Along with the ionization and ion polarity modes, the ability to vary the scan mode and scan type affords you great flexibility in the instrumentation\nfor solving complex analytical problems."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a7303159-6552-4c86-ac0d-beff39d0293e>","<urn:uuid:ebb7fbef-ae38-4a70-8033-d5dfc692663d>"],"error":null}
