{"question":"What important architectural achievements connect the Hungerburgbahn stations and the Heydar Aliyev Center?","answer":"Both the Hungerburgbahn stations and the Heydar Aliyev Center were designed by renowned architect Zaha Hadid. The Hungerburgbahn stations, which opened in 2007, won the RIBA European Award in 2008, while the Heydar Aliyev Center, completed in 2013, exemplifies Hadid's quest for complex, fluid space. Both projects showcase her signature deconstructivist style, with the Hungerburgbahn stations featuring smooth, curvy canopies and the Heydar Aliyev Center demonstrating her innovative architectural forms.","context":["The Hungerburgbahn in Austria has some of the most jaw-dropping station design you’ll see on an urban metro. But frankly, pretty much everything about the Hungerburgbahn is extraordinary.\nIt’s sort of a funicular mountain railway, and sort of a cable-hauled light railway, sort of a city metro, and sort of an underground railway, all at once. Cable hauled trams aren’t new: San Francisco still has them, as does the Great Orme in Wales, UK, and they’re often used as short-distance people movers, for instance at Birmingham Airport, UK. Neither are funicular mountain railways, which can be found the world over, and many of which are over 100 years old. Underground metros have also been around for a very long time. But if you put all these together, you get something rather unusual.\nThe Hungerburgbahn opened in 2007, linking the centre of Innsbruck with Hungerburg, a suburb a little over a mile away, in the Nordpark area. Oh, and although Hungerburg is about a mile away, it also happens to be 300m higher up the side of a mountain. That’s a lot in railway terms, and it’s even more impressive when you discover that the Hungerburgbahn starts off at an underground station at the Innsbruck end, pops up to the surface to serve the first of its two intermediate stations, crosses the river Inn, pops back down into a tunnel, pops back up again and does most of its climbing on the last third of its route, on which part is the second of its intermediate stations.\nThere is a very obvious design problem to overcome with such a strange hybrid of systems. If the Hungerburgbahn used a conventional railway carriage, the passengers would fall out of their seats (or just fall over, if they were standing) on the steep gradients at the Hungerburg end of the route. Conversely, if the tiered design of a conventional large funicular were used, everyone would fall out/over once the vehicle was on the flatter sections at the Innsbruck end.\nVery cleverly, the Hungerburgbahn uses vehicles which are essentially cages, inside which are five separate cabins. Each cabin has its own pivot connecting it to the larger cage, and when the vehicle is on a gradient, the cabins remain horizontal (independently of each other) as the cage tilts up around them. Hmm, this is hard to explain. Easier in pictures, I think:\nThere’s only one other system like it in the world (according to cable-hauled railway specialist website The Gondola Project), at Neuchatel, Switzerland, and that one’s much shorter and doesn’t have any intermediate stations. The Gondola Project has a lengthy piece on the applications of such technology and does it much more coherently than the above, so it’s time to turn our attention from the clever technology to the beautiful stations.\nMaking a welcome reappearance in this blog is architect Zaha Hadid, who previously caught our attention with Glasgow’s Riverside Museum of Transport. The Hungerburgbahn stations are an earlier work, but there are similarities which make them clearly products of the same imagination. Hadid’s Zaha Hadid Architects designed all four stations on the route, as well as the bridge over the Inn. It’s a commission which harks back to London Underground head Frank Pick bringing in architect Charles Holden to design stations along new Underground routes in the 1920s and 30s, because he wanted brilliant design to be employed. Ordinary was not good enough for Pick, and neither was it for Innsbruck mountain railway operator Innsbrucker Nordketten Bahnen. Fortunately, Hadid’s designs are extraordinary.\nEach of the four Hungerburgbahn stations is a variation on a theme, one that Hadid (who worked on the designs with Patrik Schumacher, also of Zaha Hadid Architects) refers to as “shell and shadow”. The “shells” form the roof sections of each station. These extraordinary structures are clad in white glass panels separated by black joint lines, which help define the shape. There’s barely a straight line to be seen on these smooth, curvy canopies; they seem half melted or half deformed, but into the most sensuous and tactile elements you could imagine. In other words they’re typical of what you’d expect from Hadid’s deconstructivist sensibilities. Despite their size, they touch down only at points, with remarkably small footprints, leaving these impressive structures apparently floating over the concrete plinths below. The smooth white shapes are intended to represent ice movement, and the formations created by glaciers (which they do); they are entirely in keeping with the mountain locale.\nThe concrete plinths under the white glass canopies employ many Hadid trademarks. The concrete is formed into zig-zags, curves and terraces which sweep around the stations, tracing the “shadow” of the shell above. Look carefully and you’ll see corners are rounded off, and the concrete is polished and smooth. It’s big concrete, but it’s far from Brutalist. The concept (canopy shelters a concrete base containing lifts/escalators/stairs, platforms and basic station facilities) is simple. The joy is all in the imagination and execution, and the individuality of each station in amongst a family likeness.\nCongress station is at the Innsbruck end of the line. The platforms are underground, so the concrete plinth is quite modest here, wrapping around the street corner on which the station entrance is placed. Above, the white ‘shell’ features a skylight, and it appears to balance precariously over the station entrance. It’s small in scale, big on impact.\nNext up is Löwenhaus, where the concrete plinth is more visible because there are stairs up to an elevated platform. The canopy has to reach down much further so that it can touch the ground.\nLook how the cycle parking is sheltered under the platform (lovely). It’s also interesting to note that this is another very small site, but the station successfully avoids looking ‘squeezed in’.\nBetween the two intermediate stations is the bridge over the Inn. An asymmetric s-curved cable-stayed bridge, the cables are supported by just two sculptural towers (like giant needles, eye at the top), one each side of the track.\nWouldn’t it be exciting to be the driver of a Hungerburgbahn train and see this everyday?\nWell, no, because the Hungerburgbahn is driverless. Which means that passengers get to enjoy the view instead.\nThe next stop is Alpenzoo (home of Europe’s highest zoo…). Built onto the steep side of the mountain, the platform is close to the mountainside at one end, while the other end dangles in the air. It’s a decent lift journey (or several flights of stairs) to reach the ground.\nAlpenzoo’s canopy is less obviously sculpted than those at the other stations, but the building as a whole is wonderfully dramatic, resembling nothing so much as a ski jump. Hadid has form on ski jumps actually, having designed one for Innsbruck in the late 1990s.\nAt the top end of the line is Hungerburg station, again with platforms on a lower level, so it’s all about the canopy again. It’s probably the most dramatic on the Hungerburgbahn, a big pair of wings wrapping themselves protectively around the top of the station (though seen from above, the canopy isn’t as symmetrical as it seems from ground level).\nIf the Hungerburgbahn recalls Pick and Holden’s determination to give London Underground stations good design, then Hungerburg station is the spiritual successor of the Underground’s Cockfosters station. Both feature cutting edge roofs in radical new forms, protectively enveloping the platforms, passengers and trains below. All the Hungerburgbahn stations are especially impressive at night, when the lighting bounces off the reflective glass of the canopies.\nYou’ll have realised by now that I think the Hungerburgbahn is quite fantastic. Fortunately, rather more eminent persons than I share that view. The Royal Institute of British Architects gave the Hungerburgbahn stations the RIBA European Award in 2008.\nHow to find the Hungerburgbahn\nThe green arrow indicates the location of the Congress station, at the city end of the line. Launch the map and play around with the satellite view, and you’ll soon find the other stations and the bridge over the Inn.\nFurther reading and bibliography\nIf you’ve been intrigued by the Hungerburgbahn, you can visit it virtually if you’re not conveniently placed to pop over in person. The operator’s website has a 360 panorama function which allows you to explore the outside and inside of the stations, here. Great fun once you get the hang of it.\nPress release from operator Innsbrucker Nordketten Bahnen marking the opening of the Hungerburgbahn (2007), here\nInternational Ropeway Review’s (I should have known there was a trade magazine) piece on the Hungerburgbahn and the other local cable cars has lots of technical detail, here\nFinally, I shouldn’t forget to mention the links in the main article, all of which refer to materials I looked at before writing this entry.","The British designer, born in Iraq, has designed some of the world’s most famous buildings like the Sleuk Rith Institute and Heydar Aliyev Center.

Her building, Heydar Aliyev Centre won the Design Museum Design of the Year Award in 2014, also making her the first woman to win the top prize in that competition.\nHer company, Zaha Hadid Architects, just released the following lengthy statement in which they explain that she contracted bronchitis in the early hours of the morning, but passed on following a sudden heart attack in a Miami hospital:\nZAHA HADID 1950-2016\nIt is with great sadness that Zaha Hadid Architects have confirmed that Dame Zaha Hadid, DBE died suddenly in Miami in the early hours of this morning. She had contracted bronchitis earlier this week and suffered a sudden heart attack while being treated in hospital.\nZaha Hadid was widely regarded to be the greatest female architect in the world today. Born in Baghdad in 1950, she studied mathematics at the American University of Beirut before starting her architectural journey in 1972 at the Architectural Association in London.\nBy 1979 she had established her own practice in London – Zaha Hadid Architects – garnering a reputation across the world for her ground-breaking theoretical works including The Peak in Hong Kong (1983), the Kurfürstendamm in Berlin (1986) and the Cardiff Bay Opera House in Wales (1994).\nWorking with office partner Patrik Schumacher, her interest was in the interface between architecture, landscape, and geology; which her practice integrates with the use of innovative technologies often resulting in unexpected and dynamic architectural forms.\nZaha Hadid’s first major built commission, one that affirmed her international recognition, was the Vitra Fire Station in Weil Am Rhein, Germany (1993); subsequent notable projects including the MAXXI: Italian National Museum of 21st Century Arts in Rome (2009), the London Aquatics Centre for the 2012 Olympic Games (2011) and the Heydar Aliyev Centre in Baku (2013) illustrate her quest for complex, fluid space. Buildings such as the Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art in Cincinnati (2003) and the Guangzhou Opera House in China (2010) have also been hailed as architecture that transforms our ideas of the future with visionary spatial concepts defined by advanced design, material and construction processes.\nIn 2004, Zaha Hadid became the first woman to be awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize. She twice won the UK’s most prestigious architecture award, the RIBA Stirling Prize: in 2010 for the MAXXI Museum in Rome, a building for the staging of 21st century art, the distillation of years of experimentation, a mature piece of architecture conveying a calmness that belies the complexities of its form and organisation; and the Evelyn Grace Academy, a unique design, expertly inserted into an extremely tight site, that shows the students, staff and local residents they are valued and celebrates the school’s specialism throughout its fabric, with views of student participation at every turn.\nZaha Hadid’s other awards included the Republic of France’s Commandeur de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, Japan’s Praemium Imperiale and in 2012, Zaha Hadid was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. She was made Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and Fellow of the American Institute of Architecture.\nShe held various academic roles including the Kenzo Tange Chair at the Graduate School of Design, Harvard University; the Sullivan Chair at the University of Illinois, School of Architecture. Hadid also taught studios at Columbia University, Yale University and the University of Applied Arts in Vienna.\nZaha Hadid was recently awarded the RIBA’s 2016 Royal Gold Medal, the first woman to be awarded the prestigious honour in her own right.\nDetails of Zaha Hadid’s memorial service will be announced shortly."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2403e05b-cc8e-4e72-b3fd-0041e514b702>","<urn:uuid:e5bc8e61-a903-4249-969c-6a5bc0a656c8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the key difference between using f/2.8 and f/8 aperture settings in terms of their practical applications in photography?","answer":"F/2.8 and f/8 serve different purposes in photography. F/2.8 is a wider aperture that lets in more light (specifically, it lets in half as much light as f/2.0) and creates a shallow depth of field, which is useful when you want to separate a subject from its background. Meanwhile, f/8 is considered a good default aperture that provides enough depth of field to get everything in focus, making it particularly useful for manual focusing and when you want both foreground and distant objects to appear sharp in the image.","context":["How to Take Sharp Photos\nIntroduction to How to Take Sharp Photos\nIn this article we look in detail at how to take sharp photos. This is an important subject for most photographers, but especially when shooting landscape photography. Often in landscape photography we want to have both foreground and distant objects in sharp focus at the same time. This alone can be tricky, but there are other aspects to taking sharp photos that we need to consider.\nDespite the importance of taking sharp photos, many photographers encounter the same common problems. Many of thee can be easily avoided so in this article we are going to examine:\n- The confusion that often arises between sharpness and depth of field.\n- The best aperture to use for taking sharp photos.\n- How to correctly focus to get a sharp photo.\n- Ways to avoid camera shake.\n- Processing photos for sharpness.\nThis doesn’t cover everything there is to know about taking sharp photos, but it will help you avoid the most common problems.\nDon’t Confuse Sharpness with Depth of Field\nA common mistake in photography is to confuse sharpness with depth of field. Whilst the two are related, they are quite different things.\nDepth of field is the area around the point of focus in a photo that appears to be sharp. In a photo with a shallow depth of field, only a small part of the image is in focus (near to the focus point). Beyond this the image quickly becomes blurred. This is a useful technique when you want to separate a subject from its background because you can throw the background out of focus, drawing attention to the subject.\nConversely, a large depth of field means most if not all the image appears in focus, from the nearest to furthest points. This is a common technique used in landscape photography.\nExample of an image with a large depth of field to ensure the foreground rocks and distant mountains are in focus and sharp.\nUnfortunately, many photographers confuse depth of field with sharpness. More depth of field doesn’t mean sharper images. In fact, when you try to capture the maximum depth of field by using a small aperture, you can introduce a problem called diffraction which can cause softness. Avoid using the smallest aperture your lens supports.\nDepth of field is a problem if you don’t have enough for the image you are trying to shoot. For example, if the foreground is out of focus in the landscape where you have the distant hills in focus. This will look odd and may look like the image isn’t sharp.\nIt’s important to decide how much depth of field you need for your image and will this cause a problem with diffraction. If it does cause a problem and depth of field, consider using a technique like focus stacking. This allows you to pick the best aperture for taking a sharp photo.\nBest Aperture for Taking Sharp Photos\nAs mentioned, using a small aperture can soften your photos because of a problem called diffraction. But what about a large aperture? Is there a similar problem?\nThe first problem with using a large aperture is that it might not give you enough depth of field. But let’s suppose for a moment that it does. You then encounter the next problem which is a possible increase in chromatic aberration and softness.\nWhen you use a large aperture, most lenses are softer to some degree than at their sharpest aperture. This is less of a problem with high quality (usually more expensive) lenses but it often still present.\nMost lenses reach their best performance in terms of image sharpness once they have been stopped down by around 2 stops (you can learn about f-stops here). Then as you continue to stop the lens down (close the aperture) the performance will begin to deteriorate. How quickly this happens will depend on the quality of your lens and it’s something you should really test for if taking sharp photos is your priority.\nUltimately there is an aperture range where your lens will perform at its best to produce sharp images. As you move outside of this range image sharpness will suffer. Generally, try to keep around 2 stops from the largest and smallest aperture. If you can’t achieve enough depth of field in this range, you either need to sacrifice sharpness or use focus stacking techniques. If you want to shoot a lot using shallow depth of field and the aperture wide open, consider buying quality prime lenses.\nPick a Focus Point for Sharp Photos\nAnother important aspect of taking sharp photos is where you place the point of focus. This again relates to the depth of field question, but it can also help with the illusion of sharpness.\nThe point of focus is important to depth of field as the region we perceive to be in focus extends either side of the focus point. Typically, it extends towards the camera half as far as it does away from the camera. For example, if the depth of field were 3m, it would extend from the point of focus towards the camera by 1m and away from the camera by 2m. If you pick the wrong point of focus it could make the image look like it doesn’t have enough depth of field or that it’s blurred.\nIn theory, you can calculate the best point of focus using something called the hyperfocal distance. If you want to know how to calculate this try using a photo app like PhotoPills or the calculator on their website. The alternative to this (which I tend to use) is trial and error. Take a test shot and zoom in to check the nearest and furthest points. Based on what you see change the focus point and/or aperture. This takes some getting used to, but it can be a quick and effective approach.\nThe other point about focus and sharpness is that you can use it to create the perception of increased sharpness. Supposed you have a composition where you can place an object looming large in the foreground like a rock. By focussing on the rock and ensuring that it and the rest of the foreground is as sharp as possible, you create the appearance of a sharper photo. It usually doesn’t matter much if something in the distance isn’t quite sharp; that’s what our brains expect to see.\nCamera Focus Settings\nSome cameras have a focus compensation setting if the lens doesn’t quite focus on the point that it should. This allows you to enter a compensation factor to use with a specific lens. If you think you have a focus problem, it’s worth checking this hasn’t been set in error. I’ve purchased cameras second hand in the past where focus compensation settings are still registered and affecting images.\nAvoiding Camera Shake\nAssuming you have sufficient depth of field, have focussed correctly, and are using a good lens at a reasonable aperture, the next problem to deal with is camera shake. Camera shake is the enemy of taking sharp photos. Even slight camera shake can soften an image, and this becomes even more obvious when you do everything else right.\nRather than trying to cover everything here, I’ve published a separate tutorial explaining how to avoid camera shake when photographing.\nEven when you manage to get everything right, you can still encounter lens problems that prevent you from taking sharp photos. I’ve owned several lenses in the past which have exhibited problems. It’s worth checking every new lens you buy at different apertures and focal lengths (if it’s a zoom lens) for any issues. This involves taking a series of test shots which you can inspect at 100% magnification for signs of any problems.\nIt’s likely that kit lenses will have the greatest problems, but even pro lenses aren’t immune. Here’s an example taken with a Leica 12-60 lens which had to be returned.\nIf you look at the area marked 1 in the image you can see how blurred and soft the trees are when compared to area 2.\nProcessing Photos for Sharpness\nIf you’ve followed the advice above, you should be well on your way to taking sharp photos with consistency. In addition to this, there are a few other factors in post processing to consider.\nThe first point is that it’s important to shoot using RAW format if you want to maximise the sharpness of your photos. Some people will argue that the JPEG performance of x, y or z camera is equal to the RAW file, but I’ve never found this. I’ve always been able to produce a sharper image by working from the RAW file.\nClosely related to the point above is that you need to use the best RAW converter for your camera. There can be a huge difference in image sharpness produced by different RAW converters. For example, the detail produced by Lightroom for my Fuji XT3 RAW files is poor in comparison to Capture One which is my preferred RAW converter.\nWhen it comes to sharpening photos, there could be a lot to say. I personally use a multi-stage sharpening approach, but this may be too much for most people. Recently I’ve been using either Topaz DeNoise AI (which also sharpens) or Topaz Sharpen AI with most of my images. Even when the image I’m working on already looks sharp, these tools will add a level of sharpness that’s hard to believe unless you see it. Topaz Sharpener AI is also great for fixing sharpness problems like poor focus and insufficient depth of field.\nGet Landscape Photography: Shoot Like a Pro\nGet the inside edge on what it takes to shoot consistently good landscapes.\n30 day, no questions money back guarantee\nBuy now or learn more...\nSummary of How to Take Sharp Photos\nTaking sharp photos is a combination of getting the technicalities and avoiding common problems.

Other settings such as f/3.5 and f/6.3 are fractions between these whole stops.\nHow many F stops is 2.8 and 4?\nBeing able to open your aperture from f/4.0 to f/2.8 is exactly one full stop of light however camera manufacturers will tell you that having a stabilization system in the lens will give you an extra 2-4 stops of light.\nWhat does F 2.8 mean in photography?\nHere’s the aperture scale. Each step down lets in half as much light: f/1.4 (very large opening of your aperture blades, lets in a lot of light) f/2.0 (lets in half as much light as f/1.4) f/2.8 (lets in half as much light as f/2.0)\nWhat is f stop used for?\n(Focal-STOP) The f-stop is the “aperture” opening of a camera lens, which allows light to come in. It also determines how much is in focus in front of and behind the subject (see depth of field).\nWhat F stop gives best depth of field?\nThe aperture is the setting that beginners typically use to control depth of field. The wider the aperture (smaller f-number f/1.4 to f/4), the shallower the depth of field. On the contrary, the smaller the aperture (large f-number: f/11 to f/22), the deeper the depth of field.\nWhat is the lowest f stop possible?\nMaximum and minimum apertures In this case, f/1.4 is the maximum aperture (the widest opening), and f/22 is the minimum aperture (the smallest opening).\nWhat is the formula for determining a lens F number or f stop?\nThe formula used to assign a number to the lens opening is: f/stop = focal length / diameter of effective aperture (entrance pupil) of the lens. Written on the barrel of your lens, or digitally inside your camera and displayed in the viewfinder or LCD screen, you probably see f/stop markings at one-stop increments.\nWhat is the F number of a lens?\nA lens’ speed is usually referred to by the size of the maximum aperture of the lens. This diameter is expressed as an f-number, such as f/2.8 or f/5.6. Note the smaller the f-number the larger the size of the opening and the more light is let through when the shutter is open.\nIs F stop shutter speed?\nA: Aperture (f/stop) and shutter speed are both used to control the amount of light that reaches the film. Opening the aperture wider (such as opening from f/16 to f. 2.8) allows more light to get through the lens.\nWhat F stop is sharpest?\nThe sharpest aperture on any lens is generally about two or three stops from wide open. This rule of thumb has guided photographers to shoot somewhere in the neighborhood of ƒ/8 or ƒ/11 for generations, and this technique still works well. It’s bound to get you close to the sharpest aperture.\nIs 2.8 fast enough for low light?\nIf you have a fair bit of ambient light, a slow(ish) subject, IS and a camera with good high ISO image quality, then an f 2.8 lens will be adequate for almost all photos without flash. …\nWhat is the sharpest aperture?\nThe sharpest aperture of your lens, known as the sweet spot, is located two to three f/stops from the widest aperture.\nWhat is the F stop on camera?\nAn f-stop is a camera setting that specifies the aperture of the lens on a particular photograph. It is represented using f-numbers.\nIS F 4.0 A large aperture?\nMinimum and Maximum Aperture of Lenses A lens that has a maximum aperture of f/1.4 or f/1.8 is considered to be a “fast” lens, because it can pass through more light than, for example, a lens with a “slow” maximum aperture of f/4.0. That’s why lenses with large apertures usually cost more.\nWhat is better f/2.8 or f4?\nThe most obvious difference between an f/2.8 and an f/4 lens is in their “brightness”, i.e. in the maximum amount of light each lens allows to reach the sensor. … An f/2.8 lens would usually be capable of giving a more shallow depth of field (and therefore a bigger background bokeh) than an f/4 lens.\nWhen should I change my f stop?\nWhen you are working in low light it is best to use a wider lens aperture. The smaller the f-stop number, the more light that can get through your lens. This helps the ISO to remain on the low side and also provides access to fast shutter speed. The higher the ISO setting, the grainier your photos will be.\nWhat is a good maximum aperture?\nAn f/4.0 maximum aperture is generally good in medium lighting levels. An f/5.6 maximum aperture requires good lighting or image stabilization unless outdoors before sunset. If you are shooting landscapes from a tripod, you are likely happy with f/8.0 or f/11.0. That your lens opens wider may be of little importance."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1a019377-8954-4489-834b-490477cdffa4>","<urn:uuid:a673ce58-83be-42be-ad0a-8b017de8e6b0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do traditional Hindu wedding ceremonies work, and what anthropological insights exist about unique marriage systems in Kerala?","answer":"Traditional Hindu weddings begin with selecting an auspicious day and include elaborate customs like Mehendi decoration, the groom's procession (baraat), and the main ceremony where priests chant Sanskrit mantras as the couple takes seven steps (saptapadi) around sacred fire. In the anthropological context, Kerala presents unique marriage systems, particularly in the matrilineal Nair society, where young girls were ceremoniously married but didn't live with their husbands. Instead, they were permitted to take lovers and bear children, with neither husbands nor lovers having rights over the children, who became members of their mother's lineage. The Nairs of Kerala are notably the only matrilineal community in India, with their wedding ceremonies being distinctly different from other South Indian weddings, featuring close-knit affairs with less fanfare.","context":["Diversity of India reflects on every dimensions of Indian context and Indian wedding is not an exception.

The tradition of Indian wedding wavers across religion, caste, ethnicity, language, region and other things. Today Indian scenario is changing where arranged marriages is gradually moving to love marriages. Still in modern society Indian marriages almost have the same appeal and tradition. Traditional Indian weddings are generally starts with pre-wedding day ceremonies. In some parts it starts from one week ahead of wedding ceremony.\nTypes Of Indian Wedding\nHindu Indian Wedding- Selection of wedding day is an important tasks. Hindu marriages are executed by priests who chant sanskrit hymns and mantras in front of sacred fire. In north Indian wedding, music is also play an important part. Playing Shehnai in north indian and Nadaswaram in south is a ritual. The pocession of groom known as baraat is an exciting event. This happens in much fanfare and enthusiasm. In the mandap, a dias where the marraige ceremony is performed, groom ties knowt with bride and they together walk seven times around the sacred fire while the priests continue to chant mantras. The last stage of marriage is known as saptapadi, where the bride and the groom take seven steps together facing the north, after which the bride shifts to the groom’s left. The couple is now declared married.\nMuslim Indian Wedding - Pre wedding ceremony consists of two ceremonies. First one is mangni where the would be husband and wife exchange rings. The bride wears an outfit gfted by future in laws. At mangni ceremony day of marriage is fixed. Another one is mehendi ceremony when bride sport attractive on her palm and feet. In the wedding day, groom comes with a procession with band of musicians. The groom shares a drink of sherbet with bride’s brother. The nikah or marriage is conducted in a close association of relatives and guests. The nikah is complete in presence of priest after proposal and acceptance of both bride and groom side. According to muslim law nikahnama is a document in which the marriage contract is registered.\nSikh Wedding - Punjabi wedding is one of the most exuberant marriage ceremonies of India. the atmospeher is set before one week of wedding ceremony. The shagun ceremony, where two families exchange gifts to confirm the engagement. The bangle ceremony is an unique and improtant ceremony, where bride maternal uncle and aunt put red bangles on the bride’s wrist. The procession of groom is same like in other marriages. In the marriage ceremony, bridal couple sit in front of Granth Sahib. The ardas are read and ten Sikh gurus are saluted. The last ceremony is doli or farewell of bride to groom’s house. Bride leave her hose throwing handful of rice over shoulder.\nKerala Hindu Nair Wedding – Kerala Hindu Nair marriages is something very different from other souht Indian weddings. The Nairs of Kerala are only the matrilineal community in the country. Ceremonies include announcement of engagement and exchange of rings, prenuptial blessings of bride, the bride and groom are blessed by elders. The wedding ceremony is a close affair, groom come to bride house with a procession but with less fanfare compare to other Indian wedding.\nCustoms And Rituals\nIn India marriages are complex and grand event with so many customs and rituals. Long before the actual marriage ceremony almost in all the religion customs and rituals play an important part in Indian wedding. The announcement the date of marriage is an important custom followed by ‘mangni’ or engagement function. In India marriage is not only the binding between bride and groom but also it associates two separate families. Songs, dances, little mischiefs and family union is all about Indian marriages. Its just not an event of bride or groom but its like a festival where every single member actively participate in that. Although inflow of foreign culture affect some of Indian tradition but the root is still strong. Indian geographical variation have an effect on their marriage customs and rituals. Every zones have a separate method of celebrating marriage ceremony. The religious customs and rituals are same but the method is different. For example, Marwari marriages in Rajasthan are grand affair and lasted for at least 10 weeks whereas in Bengal wedding affair is less illustrious. Most of the north Indian marriages, procession of groom come with much pomp and gaudery but in south India that is not the man event and they mainly stress on traditional customs and complicated rituals.\nWedding Destinations In India\nRoyal Wedding In Rajasthan – Imagine wedding in some of the magnificent palace in Rajasthan with grandiose ambiance, desert theme parties, and wedding in the middle of the lake. Rajasthan is one of the most favorite wedding destination because of its royal charm and rough beauty. Apart from wedding Rajasthan is an excellent place to visit and to enjoy the traditional beauty of the land of Maharajas.\nBeach Wedding In Goa- The Goa reminds the seducing beaches, laid back lifestyle, food and obviously fun.

In addition to wedding the place is perfect for picnic, adventure activities, and unadulterated fun.\nWedding In Kerala- Some call it paradise, some says nature’s bliss. Undoubtedly Kerala is most coveted destinations for Wedding. Beautiful backwater, ayurvedic massage and serene beaches, Kerala has all.","It has been generally assumed that the institution of marriage is a universal feature in human societies. Although many sociologists and anthropologists have attempted to provide definitions of marriage, none of them has been satisfactorily and sufficiently general enough to encompass all its various manifestations. This is because marriage is a unique institution of human society that has different implications in different cultures. It is a biological fact that marriage is intimately linked to parenthood. This has led to many anthropologists like Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown to propose definitions of marriage centering on the Principle of Legitimacy.\nAccording to Malinowski, a legal marriage is one which gives a woman a socially recognized husband and her children a socially recognized father.\nRadcliffe-Brown states that Marriage is a social arrangement by which a child is given a legitimate position in the society determined by parent hood in the social sense.\nAccording to Westermarck it is a relation of one or more men to one or more women which is recognized by custom or law and involves certain rights and duties both in the case of parties entering the union and in the case of children born out of this union.\nAccording to Lundberg, marriage consists of rules and regulations that define the rights, duties and privileges of husband and wife with respect to each other.\nAccording to Horton and Hunt marriage is the approved social pattern whereby two or more persons establish a family.\nAccording to John Levy and Ruth Monroe people get married because of the feeling that being in a family is the only proper indeed the only possible way to live. People do not marry because it is their social duty to perpetuate the institution of family or because the scriptures recommend matrimony but because they lived in a family as children and cannot get over the feeling that being in a family is the only proper way to live in society.\nEdmund Leach argued that the institutions commonly classed as marriage are concerned with the allocation of a number of distinguishable classes of rights and hence may serve to do any or some or all of the following.\nIt is clear from different definitions that it is only through the establishment of culturally controlled and sanctioned marital relations that a family comes into being. The institutionalized form of these relations is called marriage. Marriage and family are two aspects of the same social reality that is recognized by the world. Anderson and Parker say that wedding is the recognition of the significance of marriage to society and to individuals through the public ceremony usually accompanying it. Such a ceremony indicates the society's control.\nAnthropological studies of marriage have brought out complex marriage systems .In the Nuer ghost marriage a woman marries a woman. In another form of marriage a widow either remarries or takes lovers. The children born to her are considered as a legitimate offspring of her dead husband. In yet another form of marriage among the Nuer a woman marries another senior woman. Children born to the junior woman because of the links with a lover are considered to be the members of the husband’s patrilineage. In the matrilineal Nair society in Kerala, young girls were married ceremoniously but did not reside with their husbands. The girls were permitted to take lovers with whom they bore children. Neither the husbands nor the lovers had right over the children who became the members of their mother’s lineage.\nThe norm in Hypergamy is that a man should marry his daughter in a family of higher status than his own. In a hypergamous marriage a woman marries a superior or an equal; a man should not marry a woman of higher status than himself. Though Hypergamy is prevalent in India it is not universal. In classical Hindu ideology the bride is considered as a gift or dan. In addition gifts in terms of dowry and materials are also given. The hierarchical relationship between the wife giver and wife receiver may be expressed in commensal activities. Families by adopting hypergamous marriages may improve their rank. Hypergamous marriages when repeated by wife givers and wife receivers may lead to consolidation of affinal relationship.\nThe norm in hypogamous system is that a man should marry a woman of higher status than his own. In such a case the wife giver has a higher status than the wife receiver. Such a type of marriage has been chronicled in Myanmar where commoners married women of aristocratic lineages."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:eebd0c8d-09fc-4f06-b664-7c99720db36a>","<urn:uuid:1b239bd8-b1af-443b-a98b-c0118a81b3d0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the safety considerations for having a fireplace during the holidays, and what specific cleaning requirements should be followed to prevent hazards?","answer":"During the holidays, several safety considerations are essential for fireplace use. Keep the area in front of the fireplace free of combustible material, use a screen to prevent sparks, and keep children and pets away. Don't place wrapped packages or gift boxes near the fireplace, and maintain at least 3 feet distance between combustible materials and heat sources. Never burn wrapping paper or Christmas trees in the fireplace. As for cleaning requirements, the National Fire Protection Association recommends annual chimney cleaning and inspection to remove hazardous substances like soot (black flaky substance), creosote (flammable smoke residue), and glaze (tar-like substance). Chimney cleaning should be done when creosote or soot exceeds 1/4 inch thickness, or when glaze reaches 1/8 inch. Professional cleaning involves using brushes, wire cables, and high-powered vacuums to clear deposits while preventing residue from entering the home.","context":["CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY INFORMATION PORTAL\nHomepage For Construction Industry Professionals\nInformation resources for construction industry employment and operations\nHoliday Safetyby Susan McElrath\nPrinter Friendly Version\nFrom now until New Year's Day there are all sorts of things to celebrate. Unfortunately, decorations, food, and alcohol all present dangers, particularly to young children. A few common-sense precautions can help keep your holidays safe and happy.\nCandles, colored lights, Christmas trees, artificial snow, and plants add a lot of beauty to festive occasions. Unfortunately, young children (pets, too!) often like to play with these. Kids may even try to taste these lovely decorations, or experiment with that candle flame. Make sure decorations are kid-safe or out of reach. Watch out especially for small ornaments, button batteries, and festive yet poisonous plants such as mistletoe, poinsettia, and Jerusalem cherry. (Hard or chewy candy can choke children, so keep it away from them, too.)\nCandles are also popular, but don't let yours go up in smoke! Speaking of candles, have you ever let one get too close to some greenery, paper, or a tablecloth? You know what can happen. Keep an eye on those candles. Never leave them burning unattended, and never place them too close to other objects. (Light candles only in containers meant for lighted candles--many candles are not meant to be lit in their original, usually decorative, containers.) Keep those lighters and matches out of children's reach, too.\nIf you use outdoor lights, make sure they're approved for outdoor use. For indoor and outdoor lights, inspect them for broken or missing bulbs, and check the cords for fraying before you use them. Don't place cords where they can trip people, and don't run them under furniture, rugs, carpeting or other objects, or around doors and windows.\nA crackling fire in the fireplace is a welcome sight. Keep yours safe. Make sure the fireplace and chimney are clean when you begin using it each year. Call a professional to clean and inspect your flue. Keep the area in front of the fireplace free of combustible material, and use a screen to keep sparks from flying out. Again, keep young children and pets away from the fireplace.\nThere's plenty to eat during the holiday season. Unfortunately eating food that isn't prepared right or that has been sitting around too long can turn happiness to misery. Foodborne illness can make you very sick. It can also kill. You should always be aware of food safety precautions and follow them no matter what time of year. If you are hosting a celebration, be sure to follow safe handling, cooking, and re-heating practices, especially for meats and eggs. These precautions can usually be found printed on the food packages and in published literature, such as cookbooks or health department brochures. Don't take a chance by eating food that is not fully cooked, seems to have been sitting out too long, or that contains raw eggs--not even cookie dough!. The risk of serious illness is just not worth it.\nMany holiday celebrations include alcohol consumption. If you do drink, never drink and drive. Watch out for guests and make sure everyone is riding with a sober driver. Provide plenty of alternatives to alcohol such as soft drinks, coffee, tea, and cocoa. Stop serving alcohol a few hours before your party ends. Also, never leave drinks around where youngsters and pets can get them. Alcohol can make them very sick. Collect used glasses and cups quickly and lock up your supply.\nFinally, make sure your home is equipped with smoke detectors and, if your home uses a fossil fuel heat source, carbon monoxide detectors. Test the batteries frequently--some people find it helpful to replace the batteries twice a year when Daylight Savings Time begins and ends. If your home has been vacant for several days test the detector batteries when you return. The low-battery alarm may have sounded while you were away and could be silent when you return. The battery may be dead and you won't know unless you check. Don't let accidents spoil your holidays. Plan now to play it safe this year and every year.Happy Holidays!","Fireplace Safety During the Winter Holidays\nThe winter holiday season is the most joyous time of the year for many families. Bright decorations on the mantle make warming by the fireplace even more special than usual. But before enjoying your fireplace during the wintertime, it’s important to get your annual chimney cleaning and inspection. In addition to that, there are special fire prevention steps to take especially during the holidays.\nCleaning and Inspection\nThe National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) recommends getting your chimney cleaned and inspected annually. There are several hazards which are eliminated when a professional chimney sweep cleans your chimney, including the removal of soot, creosote, and glaze.\nSoot is a black flaky or powdery substance that is created by the incomplete burning of logs. Soot consists primarily of amorphous carbon but also contains some ash. The less ash is in the mix, the more dangerous soot is, since carbon is highly flammable and creates a greater risk of a chimney fire.\nCreosote is a substance that builds up in your chimney and can create chimney fires, as well. Creosote is smoke and vapor residue from wood that doesn’t burn completely. A highly flammable material, creosote leaves hard, flaky deposits in your chimney liner. Get your chimney cleaned anytime creosote or soot builds up to a layer thicker than ¼ inch.\nGlaze is a shiny, tar-like substance which creates black puddles in your chimney. Glaze is more difficult to remove than soot or creosote, and it’s a more dangerous fire hazard because it’s dense. Glaze also sometimes creates icicle-like deposits which hang above your fireplace. Remove glaze if it gets 1/8 of an inch thick or more.\nA chimney inspection could reveal that your flue lining is cracked. When there is a crack, it means that the heat from the fireplace could enter your home and create a house fire. A flue lining crack should be repaired before using the fireplace.\nChimney Cleaning Procedures\nThere’s no need to worry that a chimney sweep will make a mess of your home. Advanced methods of chimney cleaning combined with the special care we take in your home mean that you can be confidence that your chimney will be cleaned without leaving sooty residue behind.\nOur chimney sweeps have brushes and high-powered vacuums which run along the walls of your chimney and prevent the substances from the chimney from entering your home.\nWe also use brushes, wire cables, and chains which are twisted and turned by a motor at a rapid speed to clear the chimney shaft of creosote, soot, and glaze deposits. Chemicals can also be used to give the chimney liner a thorough cleaning.\nOther Fire Prevention Tips\n• Install smoke alarms on every level of your home; check the batteries regularly to make sure the alarms are working properly.\n• Get a carbon dioxide alarm which will alert you if carbon dioxide poisoning becomes a threat. This is an important precautionary step, since you can’t smell this deadly gas.\n• Dispose of ashes with great care to make sure that an unexpected fire will not start due to hot ashes.\n• Burn only seasoned firewood in your fireplace or wood stove. The less moisture there is in your firewood, the less soot and creosote buildup there will be.\nSome tips specifically for the holidays include:\n• Because they are highly combustible, don’t place wrapped packages or gift boxes near the fireplace. Keep all combustible materials at least 3 feet away from heat sources such as candles, portable heaters, fireplaces, and wood stoves.\n• Wrapping paper contains additives which make it burn at extremely high temperatures; don’t burn wrapping paper in your fireplace.\n• Do not dispose of wrapping paper, boxes, or other types of garbage in your fireplace.\n• After the holiday season, do not dispose of your Christmas tree by burning it in the fire. The Christmas tree wood has not been properly dried out for burning and may become a fire hazard.\n• Keep a fire extinguisher handy.\nEnjoying the holidays begins with the peace of mind of knowing that your fireplace is safe for your family to use.

{"question":"How do container-grown plants and urban street trees differ in their cold weather vulnerabilities?","answer":"Container-grown plants are more susceptible to cold temperatures because their roots are more exposed above ground, requiring protective measures like moving them indoors or using coverings. In contrast, urban street trees, particularly native cultivars like Nyssa sylvatica and Carpinus caroliniana, have better natural cold resistance due to their deep root systems and natural adaptability. Container plants may show delayed signs of cold damage when temperatures increase, while street trees mainly face challenges from infrastructure constraints and space limitations rather than cold vulnerability itself.","context":["Approximately 80 percent of the population of the United States now lives in urban environments where trees are both beloved — and imperiled.\nEstimates are that urban environments are home to 77 percent of invasive species introduced for horticulture and 13 percent for forestry.\nSpecies such as Callery pear (Pyrus calleryana) and Norway maple (Acer platanoides) were first planted in North America in 1700 and until recently they were one of the most widely planted maple varieties on urban streets on the East Coast. Now, Norway maple is on invasive species lists for some states and banned in others.\nWhether it’s such problems as non-native species, compacted soils, Dutch elm and other diseases, pests such as emerald ash borer or even climate change, many cities are turning toward diversifying tree lists to maintain the known social, health, ecological and economic benefits of urban forests.\nIn so doing, increasingly, cultivars of lesser-known native North American trees are being considered.\nMaking preferred tree lists of many cities for their strong adaptability and newfound predictability of performance are Carpinus caroliniana (American hornbeam or musclewood), Nyssa sylvatica (black gum), Cercis canadensis (Eastern redbud) and Ostrya virginiana (American hophornbeam).\nA move to diversity\nThis upturn in nurseries selecting lesser-known native North American trees has roots going back as far as 1999, when former U.S. President Bill Clinton signed an executive order directing agencies to address the spread of invasive species.\nSoon after, Keith Warren, the now-retired director of product development of J. Frank Schmidt & Son Co. (Boring, Oregon) who still works part-time at the nursery and as a consultant, was invited to join an American Nursery and Landscape Association (ANLA) task force to formulate a policy position and recommendations for action.\n“I realized the problems were real and important, and the move toward more native plants in our landscapes was a groundswell and not just a fad,” Warren said. “I realized the nursery industry had a responsibility here, and the nursery industry was part of the problem, but could be part of the solution. I thought it an ethical issue and also an economic opportunity.”\nWarren and other growers started putting more emphasis on developing the lesser-known species of native North American trees. These new cultivars are sometimes dubbed “nativars” for their mixed heritage — they are natives with characteristics that meet the demand of the market for uniformity and reliability of performance that cultivars offer.\n“There is some regionalness to an interest in native trees,” Warren said, “but it is the development of these cultivars that has spurred demand. Demand has blossomed.”\nThat boom is echoed by Mark Krautmann, owner of Heritage Seedlings and Liners (Salem, Oregon), where revenue from native plants and wildflower seed has doubled at an average of 10 percent annual growth in the last seven years.\nAs a testament to that market strength when the last recession hit, woody non-native tree liner sales dropped 40 percent for Heritage, but native tree sales dropped only 15 percent.\n“Residential neighborhoods are under extreme development pressure as the demand for close-in urban housing increases,” Krautmann said. “Generally speaking, native trees can usually offer more ‘ecosystem services’ than non-natives.”\nNative trees capture carbon and water runoff, and offer food sources for bees, butterflies and native songbirds. Usually, Krautmann said, native insect larvae eat small amounts of leaves, countering the “But I don’t want insects to eat my leaves” argument. Introduced pest species will eat the tree leaves more than the native insects these trees support, he said.\nGrowers like Keith Warren and Michael Yanny, owner of JN Plant Selections and senior horticulturalist at Johnson’s Nursery (Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin), started early experimenting with C. caroliniana, working diligently to turn these natives with so much variation into ones with consistent characteristics.\n“[Yanny] started with a few trees that had some fall color, and now he is releasing, with our help, the Wisconsin Red™ strain, which has amazing fall color,” Krautmann said. “So much so in fact, if you didn’t know better, you would suspect it was a different species. Raging reds, oranges and yellow autumn tones set this strain apart from ordinary seedlings and even his earlier work with grafted selections.”\nCarlos Oliveira, general manager at Blue Heron Farms (Corvallis, Oregon), points to another Yanny seed selection, Fire King™ Musclewood (Carpinus caroliniana ‘J.N. Select A’ PPAF) as a standout, especially for its vigorous growth.\n“Fire King comes out of Wisconsin, so it’s a tough tree that takes cold and drought,” Oliveira said. “And at 25 to 30 feet high and 20 feet wide, it’s a bigger tree.”\nOliveira also recommends Firespire musclewood (Carpinus caroliniana ‘J.N. Upright’) for its more narrow compact form, as it reaches only 20 feet tall and 10 feet wide while maintaining the same orange-red fall color that makes both standout trees.\nJim Barborinas, ISA certified arborist and wholesale nursery owner of Urban Forest Nursery (Mt. Vernon, Washington), expects more good C. caroliniana to be discovered because of its strong showing in development, with great color and uniformity, including Ball O’ Fire™ and Native Flame (Carpinus caroliniana ‘JFS-KW6’) for their good fall color and Palisade® for its narrow structure.\n“Given their very tough nature, adaptability to challenging sites, flexible limbs and resistance to disease and insects, all of them are going to be promising trees,” Barborinas said.\nBarborinas points to another historic challenge of street tree installations that’s generally considered an asset: fast growth.\n“A lot of your typical street trees — Fraxinus, Liriodendron, Ulmus, Acer, Liquidambar and Platanus — they tend to be such aggressive rooting trees, so vigorous, they end up creating infrastructure damage and outgrowing their space,” Barborinas said. “The spaces we give trees now, above and below ground, are getting smaller and smaller, and it becomes an issue for cities to replace the trees or fix infrastructure.”\nNative North American tree cultivars are excellent alternatives to these fast-growing, large-maturing trees, and Nyssa cultivars provide very good replacements.\n“Nyssa have small fruit, no insect problem, awesome fall color and flexible limbs, which is important during production, shipping and while growing in the urban jungle,” Barborinas said.\nThese new cultivars are strikingly different from the Nyssa sylvatica species, the ones only available 20 years ago, when planting the straight Nyssa species in numbers was done at great aesthetic risk. Landscapers requesting 60 to 80 trees for a single job could expect many shapes and forms once the trees matured.\n“If we planted 100 of the straight species, we would end up with a mix of straight or crooked stems, dense or lite forms, uprights, weepers and some that looked like none of the others,” Barborinas said.\nNot so with the newer Nyssa cultivars.\n“There are many new selections with good form,” Oliveira said, “and they all have a nice upright form that maintains excellent fall color. You want upright trees with a fairly narrow shape and hardy. We’re looking for plants that can be planted in a tougher environment.”\nN. sylvatica ‘Wildfire’ is adapted to a wide range of growing conditions, from USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 5 to 9, and laden with bursts of shiny, orange-red foliage in spring.\n“This one feature of ‘Wildfire’ is enough to make it popular,” Krautmann said. “It’s so different from the species. The seedlings are just green trees and quite variable.”\nN. sylvatica ‘Tupelo Tower’ is even hardier, to Zone 4, and maintains a striking, columnar form.\nThe superior pyramidal form of N. sylvatica Green Gable™ ‘NSUHH’ distinguishes this nativar with its green leaves in summer and brilliant orange and red showing in fall. “This selection offers growers predictable growth habit for a uniform crop and predictable performance for architects and gardeners,” Krautmann said.\n“Of the Nyssa, my favorite right now is ‘Afterburner’,” said Barborinas, “with a good, predictable form and spectacular fall color. It also has other great Nyssa characteristics like deep or nonaggressive roots and flexible limbs.”\nN. sylvatica ‘David Odom’ Afterburner® Tupelo was introduced by J. Frank Schmidt & Son Co.\n“Quite a few people have jumped into the Nyssa sylvatica production,” Warren said. “You might think this would create this competition and there wouldn’t be enough of a pie. But the pie has gotten big because the selections are so good. Nyssa has gone from a rare to a mainstream item.”\nOver the past five years, sales at Heritage have bumped up from 12 to 14 percent annually in native trees such as black gum, and redbuds are even more popular.\n“Demand is especially great for grafted liners in the 4- to 6-foot sizes to bump into #5 to #7 pots for sale year-round. Others may choose the pot-in-pot option to hold them for larger street trees or landscape specimens,” Krautmann said.\nOliveira recommends C. canadensis f. alba ‘Royal White’, which at 20 to 30 feet high and 15 to 25 feet wide is the more compact of the species and hardier. It’s covered in small white flowers in spring, followed by the emergence of bronze, heart-shaped leaves that turn to green.\nHe also recommended the new Merlot Redbud (Cercis × ‘Merlot’ PP22297), a cross between C. canadensis ‘Forest Pansy’ and C. canadensis var. texensis, that has the same color of ‘Forest Pansy’ but keeps its purple foliage throughout the summer and can withstand heat and drought.\nAccording to Krautmann, C. canadensis ‘Pink Pom Poms’ PPAF from Dennis Werner at North Carolina State University has seedless double flowers on two-year-old stems. It’s so new that hardiness is not yet final, but tests at this point show down to Zone 6(b).\nThen there’s Black Pearl™ redbud, with lavender flowers that are followed by much darker foliage than the long-sold ‘Forest Pansy’,” Krautmann said. Closer node spacing means it grows as a shorter, more densely branched small tree, reaching 20 feet tall by 25 wide, and it is drought tolerant once established.\nThere is also Rising Sun™, which has with light pumpkin-orange tinted new leaves. “It doesn’t burn in the heat of the South; it just grows faster in those conditions,” Krautmann said. “It’s incandescently attractive, truly distinctive and more shrub-like than its closest rival, ‘Hearts of Gold’ PP17740.”\nOther notable trees\nThe downside of these native cultivars, the growers said, is they are slower-growing, taking one to three years longer than Acer or Fraxinus to get to marketable size. Barborinas suggested maybe 20 to 30 percent more time is needed.\n“However, knowledgeable arborists and decision-makers are more than willing to pay that for less problems in the long term,” Barborinas said.\nOliveira believes there is a longer learning curve as growers figure whether to grow them in grow bags or containers, for instance, moving away from the standard bareroot.\n“It has to be in a consistent and successful manner; that’s what we want,” Oliveira said. It requires partnerships with customers and growers to get to the best products.\nBut the effort is proving worthwhile when for trees like these standouts:\n• Liquidambar styraciflua ‘Slender Silhouette’, has a lot of architectural/landscaping interest with a very tight column, reaching 60 feet tall and only 7 feet wide.\n• Liquidambar styraciflua ‘Clydesform’ Emerald Sentinel® sweetgum, introduced by J. Frank Schmidt & Son Co., has compact, slowing-growing habit, tight pyramidal form and shorter stature to 30 feet high and 12 foot wide.\n• Autumn Treasure® hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana ‘JFS-KW5’), introduced by J. Frank Schmidt & Son Co. has tight pyramidal form at 40 feet by 20 feet, good branch structure, nice yellow fall color and clean defoliation.\n• Lindsey’s Skyward™ bald cypress (Taxodium distichum ‘Skyward’ PP22812), is a dwarf deciduous conifer that is also a narrow 6 feet wide with tiers reaching to 20 feet and can tolerate dry and wet conditions.\n• Green Whisper® Bald Cypress (Taxodium distichum ‘JFS-SGPN’), is a more recent introduction from J. Frank Schmidt & Son Co. with lush, fluffy lettuce-green foliage in summer and rusty orange in fall on a pyramidal 55 foot with 30 foot spread.\n• Greenfeather® pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens ‘Carolyn Malone’) with greater heat adaptability.\n• Debonair pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens ‘Morris’ Debonair® PPAF), is a deciduous conifer that is in demand and fits the urban landscape because it’s tough, withstanding drought, wind and hot weather.\n• Espresso™ Kentucky coffee tree (Gymnocladus dioicus ‘Espresso-JFS’), is one of the other bigger trees on this list at 50 feet high and 35 foot spread, so it requires specific citing. As a fast-growing male selection without seeds and tolerant of heat, drought, cold and a wide range of soils, it is an attractive urban selection.\nNativars offer an opportunity to employ better native trees in urban landscapes to do what growers have always done: produce the best performing trees.\n“The word is getting out to landscape architects, and a lot of these cultivars have only come out in the last five to six years, but articles like this will help spread the word,” Barborinas said. “Another way is to update outdated lists of acceptable trees from cities that need to be changed, partly because they are unaware of these new and better selections.”\nHowever, change should be made appropriately, “Being native is no panacea; it’s just one more feature, a qualifying criteria that people in the industry can add to the benefit mix,” Krautmann said.\nAccording to Warren, it’s a plus that native cultivars have advanced in performance at the same time that urban forests face greater challenges and more options in trees are sought in the interest of greater diversity\n“They offer an option for people in the trade to talk about a plant that offers something better than a non-native species as an ornamental, as an addition to the landscape,” Krautmann said.\n“I think in the next generation there will be an enormous shift to include our own American species. For example, North America is home to more oak species than all of Asia, and new hybrids don’t get powdery mildew like columnar hybrids of English oak. Or, now you can have a sweetgum that fits a tight footprint, and it won’t leave bundles of leaf litter. It’s ripe new territory, and right under our noses here in the U.S. There is a huge amount of material to choose, select and see how it works — and you don’t have to fly thousands of miles to discover ‘new’ trees.”","Protecting Plants from Cold Temperatures\nAlthough we live in the South, winter sometimes brings cold temperatures that can cause severe damage to many of our landscape plants. A late freeze after the temperature rises in January or February could be more injurious than the same cold temperature in winter when these plants have become dormant and more resistant to changes in temperature. An example is the sudden drop in temperature in April 2007 that killed or severely damaged many plants. It is important to protect plants from these cold temperatures.\nTemperature Changes and Plant Damage\nA plant’s ability to withstand cold temperatures depends on plant species, and how low and how fast temperatures decrease. When temperatures gradually decrease, a plant can acclimate, or adjust itself, to withstand colder temperatures better. Sudden decreases in temperature cause more damage in fall or early winter than similar low temperatures well into winter. If temperatures increase during the winter months, some plants may break dormancy, or deacclimate, and begin leafing out or flowering. Plants that break bud dormancy become more susceptible to late frost because of their new, tender growth.\nCold injury can occur to all parts of the plant (flowers, fruits, leaves, stems, trunks, roots, and buds). Fruits and flowers are the least tolerant of cold injury because they have little ability to adjust or build up tolerance to colder temperatures. Leaf and stem tissues are injured and damaged when ice forms within the plant’s cells, which typically occurs during a rapid freeze. When this happens, the plant’s tissue dies; this is often characterized by plant parts turning brown and mushy. When the temperature drops slowly, ice sometimes forms between the walls of the plant’s cells. Hardy or cold-acclimated plants can often withstand this type of ice formation.\nWindy conditions can also cause plant damage by desiccation, or the drying out of the plant. Desiccation causes marginal or leaf-tip burn or totally brown leaves in severe cases. Desiccation occurs when a plant loses more water than it absorbs, or takes up, by its roots, especially when the ground is frozen.\nHomeowners in Mississippi can enjoy a wide variety of plants. They can increase their choice of available plants by careful selection based on growing conditions and location in the landscape. By planting a combination of tender and hardy plants and by protecting plants susceptible to cold temperatures, homeowners can have landscapes that survive cold temperatures.\nProtecting Plants from Cold Temperatures\nPlant and Site Selection\nThe best way to prevent cold injury to plants is to choose plants that tolerate the cold temperatures in your area. Mississippi is in USDA Cold Hardiness Zones 7b, 8, and 9a. Northern regions of Mississippi are in Zone 7b, which means that plants need to be hardy to 5–10ºF. Northwestern and central regions of Mississippi are in Zone 8a (10–15ºF); southern Mississippi is in Zone 8b (15–20ºF); and the coastal tips of Mississippi’s three coastal counties are in Zone 9a (20–25ºF). Select plants that meet the minimum cold-hardy requirements in your area; for example, if you live in Zone 8a, choose plants that are hardy to at least zone 8a and preferably zone 7 to ensure they can better withstand any sudden cold dips in temperatures in your area.\nIn addition to proper plant selection, proper site selection is essential. Assess your property to determine the location of the coldest and the warmest spots. During the winter, the coldest spots are often found on the north and northwest parts of the property and in low areas where cold air settles. The warmest spots are usually on the southern part of the property.\nAssessing the microclimates of your property is also important. Elevation, landform, soil properties, canopy cover, and proximity to structures or other plants determine a microclimate. You can help protect plants by placing cold-sensitive plants near the part of the house that receives southern exposure or near larger plants or other structures.\nMaintaining proper plant nutrition also helps protect your plants from cold damage. Proper nutrition of plants is critical. A plant that has been given the appropriate nutrition tolerates cold temperatures, withstands sudden temperature drops, and recovers from cold damage better than plants that are nutritionally deficient.\nFertilizing plants at the proper time of year is also vital. Fertilizing plants in the fall (after August or September) with a fertilizer high in nitrogen can result in a flush of new growth that is more susceptible to cold temperatures.\nDuring the fall and winter months, most plants enter a dormant period when they need less fertilization. Winterizing-formulated fertilizers, which are high in potassium and low in nitrogen, may be used.\nCanopies and Shade\nTree canopies can reduce cold injury from radiational freezes. Radiational freezes occur on calm, clear nights when temperatures drop because of radiational cooling or heat loss from the earth and from the surfaces of objects. Canopies help reduce radiant heat loss from the ground to the atmosphere by raising the minimum night temperature beneath them.\nPlants that grow in shaded areas are less susceptible to winter desiccation, or drying out, than plants that grow in open areas. But plants that prefer full sun do not do well in the shade and will be unhealthy and less tolerant of cold temperatures if you plant them in the shade.\nWindbreaks such as fences, buildings, and temporary coverings can help protect plants from cold injury. Windbreaks are most useful in reducing injury resulting from cold winds and advective freezes (freezes that occur when temperatures drop because of the invasion of cold air masses into the area).\nCovering and Heating\nProtect plants that are in containers either by placing them inside a protective structure (house, garage, greenhouse, or shed) or by placing a protective covering over them. Container plants are more susceptible to cold temperatures than a similar plant growing in the ground. Their roots are more exposed because they are above the ground. Roots that are damaged by cold temperatures may not show immediate signs of damage, but these plants will show signs of stress when temperatures increase.\nPush together container plants that are left outside, and mulch or cover them to decrease heat loss from the sides of the containers. Wrap the bases of the containers in plastic, burlap, or blankets to reduce heat loss.\nPlants that grow close to the ground are usually protected by heat radiating from the soil. Plants that are tall and more open do not receive this radiating heat and are not as protected from the cold.\nRemember to mulch the soil. Mulching protects the roots of plants and helps reduce heat loss, thus minimizing temperature fluctuations. As with shrubs and trees, protecting the roots is necessary for them to survive the cold and come back in the spring.\nCovering your plants helps protect them from frost as well as from extremely cold temperatures. Covers that reach the ground and do not come in contact with foliage form a layer of insulation from the cold temperature. To prevent foliage breakage, avoid having the covers (sheets, blankets) touch the foliage. Remember to remove these protective coverings from the plant canopy after cold temperatures have passed.\nWhen extremely cold temperatures are predicted, place a light bulb (60-watt is sufficient) or other heat source under the cover to provide heat. Be very careful when using a bulb or other heat source, which can be a potential fire hazard. Do not let the bulb or heat source come in contact with the plant or the cover. Remove the cover and provide ventilation during the day to allow release of the heat that is trapped by solar radiation. This precaution is critical when using plastic covers.\nWater Needs before and after a Freeze\nWatering plants before a freeze can help protect them from cold injury. Soil that is well watered absorbs more heat and then reradiates heat, helping to increase the elevated temperature around the plants. However, poorly drained soils result in plants that have weak and shallow roots, which are more susceptible to cold injury. Use mulch to help retain soil moisture.\nCheck the water needs of plants after a freeze. After very cold temperatures, water that is in the soil may still be frozen and unavailable to the roots. If plants are transpiring (losing water from their leaves) and water is unavailable to the roots, plants may dry out. To provide water for plants, apply water to thaw the soil and the ice.\nPruning in late summer or early fall can result in new growth that is more susceptible to cold injury; so avoid pruning at this time of year.\nWait to prune plants until new growth appears in late winter or early spring. Cold damage will be more apparent, making it easier to remove the damaged portions of the plant. Severely injured plants may not break bud in the spring and may take on an overall weak appearance. Branch tips are more likely to suffer cold injury than older wood.\nTo determine if wood has been injured by the cold, check the cambium layer (layer directly under the bark). To do this, carefully scratch through the bark layer or carefully slice through this layer with a knife. Healthy, undamaged cambial tissue will be green; damaged will be brown or black. Prune this wood below the discoloration.\nTo determine if your fruit plants have been damaged by the cold temperatures, wait several days after a freeze and remove several flower buds from the plants. Use a sharp knife or razor blade to cut a cross section of the bud’s top. If there is any discoloration in the bud, the bud has been damaged and will not produce fruit. Damage may be localized, however, and not all buds may have been damaged. Check several buds from different areas of the plant to get a better assessment of the damage.\nPlants can be protected from cold temperatures by proper selection, placement, and care. Healthy plants are more resistant to cold injury than plants that are weakened by disease, by insect damage, or by improper care. You can take measures to protect plants during sudden and prolonged exposure to cold temperatures.\nPublication 2303 (POD-02-19)\nRevised by Jeff Wilson, PhD, Assistant Professor and State Master Gardener Coordinator, North Mississippi Research and Extension Center.\nThe Mississippi State University Extension Service is working to ensure all web content is accessible to all users.

{"question":"¿Cuáles son los procedimientos diagnósticos que utiliza un especialista en dolor para evaluar a los pacientes, y cuáles son las responsabilidades de comunicación del paciente durante este proceso?","answer":"Pain specialists perform several diagnostic tests including MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), skin temperature monitoring, and muscle and nerve x-rays and imaging to pinpoint pain areas and identify abnormal muscle or nerve function. They also take detailed medical histories and ask specific questions about pain characteristics, location, duration, and factors that improve or worsen the pain. As for patient communication responsibilities, they must provide a complete medical history including past illnesses, hospitalizations, family history, allergies, and medications. Patients must communicate openly with their healthcare team, express concerns clearly, and report whether they understand their health status and treatment options. They are also required to ask questions, request information, and clearly communicate about their pain management needs.","context":["Your successful medical care requires on ongoing partnership between you and your healthcare providers. All parties must take an active role. Your providers have the responsibility to provide health care services to the best of their abilities. Patients have responsibilities too.\nYou, the Patient, Have the Responsibility\n- To provide a complete medical history including past illnesses, hospitalizations, family history of illnesses, allergies, medications, including herbals and over-the-counter medications and any matters related to your present state of health.\n- To communicate openly with your health care team including your physicians and nurses, to express your concerns clearly and participate in decisions about your diagnostic and treatment options and recommendations\n- To report whether or not you understand your health status and treatment options, ask questions, request information and comply with the agreed upon treatment protocol.\n- To help your health care team develop a pain management plan, including discussion of available options for your pain relief, asking what you should expect, help in the measurement of your pain, and tell when your pain first begins and if it does not subside.\n- For your actions if you refuse treatment or do not follow your provider’s instructions.\n- To refrain from taking any medications, drugs, or alcoholic beverages unless ordered by your physician. Smoking is prohibited in the facility.\n- To report promptly to your providers and nurses any unexpected problems or changes in your medical condition.\n- Discuss end-of-life decisions with your physicians and make your wishes known; possibly writing an advance directive.\n- You may provide for a duly authorized family member or friend to make medical decisions on your behalf in the event you become unable to communicate.\n- To discuss organ donation with your physicians and, if donation is desired, make applicable provisions.\n- To meet your financial obligations with regard to your medical care or to discuss financial hardships with your physicians.\n- To be committed to health maintenance through health-enhancing behavior. Illness can often be prevented by a healthy lifestyle, and you should take personal responsibility when you are able to avert the development of disease.\n- To respect the rights of fellow patients, and hospital personnel, follow rules and regulations affecting patient care and treatment. This includes the responsibility of respecting the privacy of other patients and treating information concerning them as confidential.\n- To understand the effects of your conduct on others and refrain from behavior that unreasonably places the health of others at risk. You should inquire as to the means and likelihood of infectious disease transmission and act upon that information which can best prevent further transmission.\n- To respect the property of CRMC, fellow patients and other facility staff, to assist in noise control and number of visitors.\n- To report on time for scheduled procedures and to keep all healthcare appointments. If you are unable to do so for any reason, notify your provider to cancel and reschedule the appointment.\n- To not initiate or participate in fraudulent health care and to report illegal or unethical behavior by physicians and other providers to the appropriate medical societies, licensing boards, or law enforcement authorities.\nPARENTS OF PEDIATRIC PATIENTS\nWe encourage someone to stay with your child (there may be some restrictions due to the size of the room and space needed to care for your child). However you will always be able to have one parent or designee stay with your child. Your involvement in your child’s care is very important to your child’s comfort and security. If you can’t be here, try to have a family and/or friends spend time with your child. While your child is hospitalized, we encourage you to participate with meal planning so that your child is given food to meet his wants and needs. Please know that we will encourage you to take an active part in discharge and follow up care. It is important for your child’s safety that the crib rails remain elevated at all times. If you are with your child and are leaving, you MUST inform the nursing staff prior to leaving the unit. We encourage parents to make sure that they have a rest period and time to themselves.\nPlease know that:\n- Children at different developmental levels react differently to hospitalization. Knowing the behaviors that are typical for your child at various ages makes it easier for you to address them. It’s important for you to know how the stresses of illness and hospitalization affect your child’s feelings and behaviors.\n- It is important to be honest with children, especially if something is going to hurt.\n- Children 3 years of age and younger generally cannot understand their illness, the new change in their familiar environment and are more concerned with being away from family and home. Toddlers may have difficulty coping with these changes in their routines, especially related to eating, sleeping and toileting. You can help your child by being with them in the hospital. If you can’t be here, try to have family or friends spend time with your child.\n- Children 3 – 6 years of age usually view the hospital and procedures as punishment. Reassure your child that he/she hasn’t done anything wrong. They can also fear a loss of control and fear of the unknown. It will be reassuring to your child to give simple, honest, and developmentally appropriate explanations. Bring a favorite toy; we encourage you to bring blankets or clothes from home which may also be comforting. If your child has a ‘security’ blanket or ‘lovey’ that will serve to calm them as well please bring it along. Please label or mark personal items so staff can assist retrieving if an item is misplaced. Encourage walking around or playing outside his/her room.\n- Children 7 – 12 years old are often worried about painful procedures and may also believe that hospitalization and procedures are punishment. This age group fears a loss of control and independence. It is very import to provide information to this age group. Whenever possible, ask staff to inform your child in advance of what is going to happen (procedures, changes in environment, etc.) Giving your child choices when able is important to regain some control.\n- Adolescents age 12 and up are very concerned about loss of control, fear separation from their friends, and may be very self-conscious. It is important to respect their privacy whenever possible. Encourage adolescent to ask questions and include him/her in discussions and decision making. Support interactions with friends via phone, email and visits.\n- Parents and caregivers will find this a stressful time not only for the child, but also the family. It is important for parents and caregivers to make sure to meet their own needs. Switching off time with the child, taking a break from the room or unit, and communicating stresses or frustrations with your child’s team of healthcare providers will assist you in best supporting your child.\nPatients’ Bill of Rights & Responsbilities\nIt is the policy of Catskill Regional Medical Center to admit, retain and care for all patients without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, cultural differences, spiritual beliefs, disability, psychosocial, personal values, translation needs, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation and/or preferences, source of payment, or age.\nAll hospital employees and Medical staff are responsible for ensuring that the patient’s rights are respected and enforced.

{"question":"How do modern green architecture skyscrapers like the Hearst Tower compare to the underground design approach of the UCCA Dune Art Museum in terms of construction techniques?","answer":"The Hearst Tower and UCCA Dune Art Museum represent contrasting construction approaches. The Hearst Tower, built on top of a 1928 building, exemplifies modern green architecture through its use of 90% recycled materials in its construction. The UCCA Dune Art Museum, on the other hand, employs local craftsmanship and traditional techniques, with former shipbuilders creating in-situ cast concrete shells over rough timber board formwork. This results in faceted, textured surfaces that contrast with typical sterile exhibition spaces. The museum consists of irregularly shaped concrete shell structures forming a network of dome-like spaces, while the Hearst Tower represents a more conventional skyscraper construction approach focused on recycled materials and energy efficiency.","context":["With the advent of increasingly innovative green technologies, architects are now more than ever able to fully maximize their sophisticated artistic visions, while simultaneously minimizing the negative environmental effects of their structures. As climates and resources shift, environmentally-conscious architecture is beginning to produce more and more complex, sustainable, and awe-inspiring buildings, signifying that green architecture is the wave of the future from both a creativity standpoint, as well as out of ecological necessity. In fact, in the most extreme and inventive cases, architects are now not only working to preserve the natural environment, but actually to positively affect, alter and improve it.\nIn its most basic form, green architecture signifies building designs and practices which predominantly utilize recyclable and renewable materials to create structures that operate on a minimal amount of energy. Efficient building models are able to run off of solar, wind, and sometimes water-powered energy generation and take up as little land as possible in order to preserve or encourage green space.\nIf you’re interested in more architecture inspiration, these posts will amaze you:\n- 30 Incredibly Realistic Interior and Exterior CG Environments\n- 50 Conceptual CG Buildings and Environments\n- 30 Striking Architectural Photographs\nA massive and trendsetting example of green architecture is the Hearst Tower in New York City, which in 2006 was the first building to become certified with an LEED Gold rating.\nThe towering skyscraper, which is built on top of the 1928 Hearst International Magazine Building, can boast that it was constructed out of 90% recycled materials and currently uses 26% less energy than is required by today’s standard building codes.\nAn even more space-age like recent example – one which dominates another skyline – is the Bahrain World Trade Center.\nThe complex’s two towers are connected by giant wind turbines, which are capable of providing up to 15% of the buildings’ total energy consumption.\nAnd it’s not just about the skyscrapers. While plenty of private clients now choose to construct homes, offices, and schools out of recyclable materials, outfitting them with solar panels and energy-saving appliances, some properties go one step further, opting to adopt “green roofs.” This design choice is exactly what it sounds like: soil and grass-covered roofs that provide insulation for the home, give back the green space claimed by the building itself and, in the most sophisticated of cases, help to maintain the ecology for surrounding wildlife.\nA stunningly simple residential example of this can be seen in the OS house built in Spain by NOLASTER Architects.\nThe art department at Nanyang Technological University offers an even more whimsical model.\nThis, however, is only the beginning. As green technology advances, so too do architects’ visions for its usage. Some, like Vincent Callebaut Architects’ “Lilypad Project”, which proposes ocean-based eco-city islands that run on collected rainwater, will most likely remain pure fantasy.\nOthers, like Sheila Kennedy’s “Soft House”, that makes use of solar-harvesting textiles, may simply be too costly to ever be put into mass production.\nThe ideas come in all shapes and sizes, from skyscrapers filled with agricultural farmland to single-family homes that run off of energy produced by the household’s own inhabitants and objects.\nCK Designworks in Nanjing, China, has recently unveiled their design plans for a remarkably large eco-city development slated to begin construction shortly. And while some projects are focused on preserving natural resources and finding alternative energy sources, others like the Living Mountain, dream up the creation of entirely new micro-environments.\nIn this particular proposal, inhabitants will survive the growing desert landscape by building cities inside of massive, mountainous skyscrapers. While creating protection from the uninhabitable outside, the structure will also work to pull water from the region, cycling it inside to produce an entirely new climate and ecology.\nOne thing clear in all these plans, visions, proposals and dreams is that green architecture provides not only new challenges, but new opportunities for designers. It is an inspiring and growing field full of imagination and innovation, one which puts firmly in the architect’s hands the exciting responsibility of envisioning and constructing a new look for the future.","UCCA Dune Art Museum / Open Architecture\nCarved into a sand dune on a quiet beach in Bohai Bay, the UCCA Dune Art Museum by Open Architecture integrates adventurous structural design, a dynamic coastal site, and local building techniques to suggest exciting new possibilities for typically neutral exhibition spaces.\nAccording to the architects, the museum’s unique form is motivated by a desire to preserve the site’s fragile dune ecosystem, “formed by natural forces over thousands of years”. Rather than leveling the dunes to realise their project, the architects opted for a building form which integrates itself into the existing natural environment. Ironically, this approach has the added benefit of preserving the sand dunes in its immediate vicinity – in China, dune ecosystems are often destroyed to make way for profitable seaside real estate developments.\nThe museum itself is a vascular network of irregularly shaped concrete shell structures. These primitive, dome-like spaces were built as a means to house a series of different galleries, a cafe, and a reception area. Resting above these spaces are the dunes themselves – the museum acting as a kind of giant framework to bear the weight of the landscape above. Additionally, the building’s natural roof greatly reduces its summer heat load. Upon the approach, visitors are led through a long, dark tunnel deep into the dunes, past the small reception area, before entering the largest of the gallery domes. Rather than the neutral white box which defines the typical gallery space,\nThe eight main gallery spaces vary in size, each one a unique shell geometry with a unique skylight to match. Uniquely oriented to each gallery space, these roof apertures form a distinct relationship between the museum and the ever-changing weather outside, while providing natural light all year round. The skylights range from roughly punched holes through the concrete shells, to bizarre, distended geometries which reach downward into the spaces bellow. The simple combination of light and space results in a carefully choreographed sequence of different spatial conditions – from light to dark, inside to outside, and everything in between.\nThough painted white in the tradition of neutral gallery spaces the world over, the shell structures have been cast in-situ by local craftsmen, many of them former shipbuilders, over a formwork of rough timber boards. As a result, the complex, double curved concrete surfaces become faceted and textured – the subtle form of surface ornamentation a result of their making. Combined with the proximity to the landscape, this surface treatment is a curious counterpoint to the usually sterile aesthetic of exhibition spaces.\nFrom the museum’s landscaped roof terraces, the relationship between site and building is perhaps most visible as the dramatic skylight forms protrude upward through the dunes – hinting at, but never revealing, the exhibition spaces below. The UCCA Dune Art Museum hints at a new promise for museum buildings – one where the primacy of spatial experience, and the proximity to a natural landscape creates new atmospheres and experiences in what are usually neutral exhibition spaces. Here the relationship between building and site is blurred rather than distinct – but in a way that releases possibilities rather than constraining them. Thee site becomes a fluid extension of the exhibition content in the building’s myriad gallery spaces, and the building an apparatus for framing, understanding, and recontextualising the site."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2045cf36-823b-4c76-b4f2-d93d31ef31e3>","<urn:uuid:7eedcf4e-717a-4620-b1fc-d03e9c15389d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the primary safety difference between High Tension Cable Barriers and advisory shoulders in managing vehicle interactions?","answer":"High Tension Cable Barriers (HTCB) and advisory shoulders serve different safety purposes. HTCBs are designed to prevent cross-median collisions by absorbing impact and guiding vehicles to a stop when struck, resulting in less vehicle damage and fewer severe injuries. Advisory shoulders, on the other hand, manage vehicle interactions by creating a prioritized but non-exclusive space for bicyclists and pedestrians, requiring drivers to yield when passing these users and allowing vehicles to safely encroach into the shoulder space when meeting oncoming traffic.","context":["Please read below memo on installations of median barriers:\nWhy is the City of Calgary installing median barriers?\nWith a number of recent national, provincial and city wide initiatives and targets developed in reducing traffic fatalities and serious injuries, the City of Calgary has made efforts to achieve these ambitious targets. City of Calgary’s Safer Mobility Plan strives to reduce fatal and injury collisions in Calgary roadways. Cross median collisions are generally of a high severity, often resulting in serious injuries or fatalities. Despite efforts to reduce such high severity collisions, a number cross median collisions continue to occur throughout the City in recent years that have sparked the discussion on the adequacy of the existing median barriers on Calgary roadways. In light of these collisions, a review of existing median barriers on roadways with speed limit 70 km/h or higher was undertaken few years ago with the aim to determine the current state of median barriers and to identify new locations that warrant the installation of median barriers.\nThe City of Calgary standards reference the Transportation Association of Canada (TAC) Geometric Design Guide for Canadian Roads (1999) for roadside design. However, the more recent Alberta Transportation (AT) Roadside Design Guide (2007) is frequently used as a reference by designers. The warrant processes\nfor both of these documents are based on the AAHTO Roadside Design Guide. Alberta Transportation’s Roadside Design Guide (2007) was used for warrant analysis. As per the guideline, a median barrier is recommended if the Average Annual Daily Traffic is greater than 20,000 vehicles and width of median is\nless than 10 m. A barrier can be considered for the median width between 10m and 15m.\nWhy was John Laurie Bv identified for median barrier treatment?\nBased on the network level analysis, five roadway corridors: Glenmore Tr SW (Crowchild Tr – 37 St), Crowchild Tr NW (Memorial Dr – 24 St), Anderson Rd (Deerfoot Tr – 37 St SW), Macleod Tr SE (Heritage Dr – Stoney Tr) and John Laurie Bv NW (14 St – Shaganappi Tr) were identified as top priority for median\ninstallation based on the amount of cross median collisions occurred within these roadways. These corridors were ranked based on median related collisions/km. The vehicles either crossed the median and resulted in head on collision with vehicles coming from other direction or ended up somewhere within the median, often striking light standards or other infrastructure. John Laurie Bv corridor between 14 St NW and Shaganappi Tr NW had 41 median related collisions within 5 years (2010-2014). A more recent review of collisions indicated that this pattern continued prior to barrier installation.\nJohn Laurie Bv NW:\nAverage Annual Daily Traffic (AADT): 42,000\nMedian width: 5m or less at most of the locations along the JLB corridor\nBased on this criteria, median barrier is recommended for John Laurie Boulevard NW between 14 St and Shaganappi Tr NW. Installation of median barriers along most of these high priority roadways have been completed in recent years. The map below indicates all roadways identified for median barrier installation with different level of priorities depending on the number of cross median collisions occurred on these roadways.\nHow does HTCB compare with other types of median barriers?\nThere have been a number of researches conducted on the performance on safety and cost effeteness of median ‘High Tension Cable Barriers’ compared to other types of barriers. Following the installation of median cable barriers along Highway 2 and other roadways, Alberta Transportation has compiled a\nnumber of resources for public understanding which seems to be beneficial in this context. In general, HTCBs help prevent serious collisions on roadways by reducing the number of vehicles that cross the median into oncoming traffic. Other benefits include:\no HTCB cables “give” and absorb the impact of the hitting vehicle\no The hitting vehicle tends to travel along the cable barrier until it comes to a stop, resulting in less\ndamage to the vehicle, and fewer severe injuries to vehicle occupants\no Most vehicles that strike the HTCB are able to drive away:\nHere are the links to the resources that explain how these cable barriers perform compared to other barriers for motorcyclist safety:\nWhy were two rows of cable barrier installed along John Laurie Bv NW instead of one along the median? The installation of median cable barrier follows the technical specifications provided by the Alberta Transportation roadside design guide. In general, one side of installation should be adequate if the roadway is flush (at the same level) with a shoulder and has adequate space for the barrier to deflect the vehicles in case they happen to hit the barrier. More information about roadside design for errant vehicles relative to curb conditions is available in Chapter H-4 of the Alberta Roadside Design Guide.\nRoadside design guide [Current] – Open Government (alberta.ca)\nJohn Laurie Bv is a unique situation where the median is in a slope and the roadside has vertical curbs instead of a flush shoulder. If a vehicle hits a curb, it has tendency to vault to the other side of the roadway. Providing the cable barrier on one side only or along the center of median would not be adequate to contain the errant vehicles in this context","Advisory shoulders create usable shoulders for bicyclists on a roadway that is otherwise too narrow to accommodate one. The shoulder is delineated by pavement marking and optional pavement color. Motorists may only enter the shoulder when no bicyclists are present and must overtake these users with caution due to potential oncoming traffic.\nNote: Advisory shoulders are a new treatment type in the United States and no performance data has yet been collected to compare to a substantial body of international experience. In order to install advisory shoulders, an approved Request to Experiment is required as detailed in Section 1A.10 of the MUTCD. FHWA is also accepting requests for experimentation with a similar treatment called “dashed bicycle lanes.”\nIncreases predictability and clarifies desired lateral positioning between people bicycling or walking and people driving in a narrow roadway.\nFunctions well within a rural and small town traffic and land use context.\nSupports the natural environment through reduced paved surface requirements.\nProvides a delineated but nonexclusive space available for walking and biking on a roadway otherwise too narrow for dedicated shoulders.\nMinimizes potential impacts to visual or natural resources through efficient use of existing space.\nMay function as an interim measure where plans include shoulder widening in the future.\nRoads with advisory shoulders accommodate low to moderate volumes of two-way motor vehicle traffic and provide a prioritized space for bicyclists with little or no widening of the paved roadway surface.\nUnlike a conventional shoulder, an advisory shoulder is a part of the traveled way, and it is expected that vehicles will regularly encounter meeting or passing situations where driving in the advisory shoulder is necessary and safe, as illustrated in Figure 2-9.Advisory Shoulder\nThe advisory shoulder space is a visually distinct area on the edge of the roadway, offering a prioritized space for people to bicycle and walk.\n- The preferred width of the advisory shoulder space is 6 ft (2.0 m). Absolute minimum width is 4 ft (1.2 m) when no curb and gutter is present.\n- Consider using contrasting paving materials between the advisory shoulder and center travel lane to differentiate the advisory shoulder from the center two-way travel lane in order to minimize unnecessary encroachment and reduce regular straddling of the advisory shoulder striping.\nThe two-way center travel lane is created from the remaining paved roadway space after the advisory shoulder has been accounted for.\n- Preferred two-way center travel lane width is 13.5–16 ft (4.1–4.9 m) although may function with widths of 10–18 ft (3.0–5.5 m). Table 2-2 describes the impacts of various center lane widths on roadway operations.\nAn approved Request to Experiment is required to implement Advisory Shoulders, called “dashed bicycle lanes” in the FHWA experimentation process. For more information on the experimentation process, visit http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/.\nFigure 2-9. Advisory shoulders clarify positioning and yield priority on roads too narrow to provide exclusive travel space. When pedestrians or bicyclists are present, motorists may need to yield to users present in the advisory shoulder before passing.\nFigure 2-10. Motorists travel in the center two-way travel lane. When passing a bicyclist, no lane change is necessary.\nFigure 2-11. When two motor vehicles meet, motorists may need to encroach into the advisory shoulder space.\nTable 2-2. Interactions when vehicles traveling in opposite directions meet by two-way center turn lane width.\nImplementing agencies should be advised that the above dimensional guidance is intended to facilitate implementation on common roadway widths in the U.S. As with most treatments, more overall width is preferable to constrained circumstances.\nFigure 2-12. Total roadway width affects the number of road users that can meet and pass simultaneously. Wider roadways allows for more simultaneous interactions, and can support higher volumes of motor vehicles.\n- A broken lane line used to delineate the advisory shoulder should consist of 3 ft (1.0 m) line segments and 6 ft (2.0 m) gaps.\n- Where additional edge definition is desired, stripe a normal solid white edge line in addition to the broken advisory shoulder line.\n- In general, do not mark a center line on the roadway. Short sections may be marked with center line pavement markings to separate opposing traffic flows at specific locations, such as around curves, over hills, on approaches to at-grade crossings, and at bridges. At these locations, widen the paved roadway surface to provide space for paved bicycle-accessible shoulders and conventional width travel lanes. See Table 2-3 for sight distance requirements.\nHanover, NH – Pop 11,250\nWestern Transportation Institute\nFigure 2-14. At crossings of minor intersections and driveways, maintain the striping and construction material (if used) of the advisory shoulder.\nTable 2-3. Minimum Passing Sight Distances for No-Passing Zone Markings. Adapted from MUTCD Table 3B-1.\nUse signs to warn road users of the special characteristics of the street. Potential signs for use with advisory shoulders include:\n- As illustrated in Figure 2-13. Use an unmodified Two-Way Traffic warning sign (W6-3) to clarify two-way operation of the road.\n- Use a NO CENTER LINE warning sign (W8-12) to help clarify the unique striping pattern.\n- Use a NO PARKING ON PAVEMENT (R8-1) to discourage parking within the advisory shoulder.\nFigure 2-13. The W6-3 two-way traffic warning sign can clarify undivided two-way operation of the advisory shoulder configuration.\nAdvisory shoulder designs work best on road segments without frequent stop or signal controlled intersections that require vehicles to stop within the roadway. The designer should strive to maintain the visual definition of the advisory shoulder through all driveways and street crossings, and provide a conventional shoulder at controlled intersections.\n- At minor street crossings, use a dotted line extension on both sides of the advisory shoulder to maintain delineation of the advisory shoulder space Figure 2-14.\n- If contrasting pavement material is used, maintain the material through driveway crossings and minor intersections.\n- Where the road is controlled by a stop sign or traffic signal, discontinue the advisory shoulder 50 ft (15 m) in advance of the intersection. At these locations, provide a bicycle accessible paved shoulder outside of the travel lanes or design for operation as a shared roadway.\nBloomington, IN – Population 82,000\nCity of Bloomington Planning and Transportation Department\nIn order to install advisory shoulders, an approved Request to Experiment is required as detailed in the MUTCD 2009, Sec. 1A.10. FHWA is also accepting requests for experimentation with a similar treatment called \"dashed bicycle lanes.\"\nAdvisory shoulders as described here are not intended for use by pedestrians. When advisory shoulders are intended for use by pedestrians, they must meet accessibility guidelines.\nEdina, MN – Population 49,300\nAlta Planning + Design\nAdvisory Shoulder Case Study\nHanover, New Hampshire\nIn 2012, Hanover completed a bicycle and pedestrian planning effort. This plan identified Valley Road as a local bicycle connection in the overall network. In 2013, Hanover completed a Safe Routes to School (SRTS) Plan, which introduced the idea of using advisory shoulders (called advisory bike lanes for this project) on Valley Road. Hanover’s Bicycle and Pedestrian Committee (HBPC) advocated to use Valley Road as a pilot project for advisory shoulders. The HBPC surveyed the Valley Road neighbors and built support for a pilot project. While there was some resistance, the neighborhood was generally supportive of the idea. Hanover’s Department of Public Works was open to the idea and it was presented to the town select board who approved installation of advisory shoulders on Valley Rd. The advisory shoulders were painted on about 400 meters of Valley road in the summer of 2014.\nIn 2016 an evaluation report was produced with traffic counts and results from a follow up survey. Based on the success of the Valley Road advisory shoulders, Hanover is currently evaluating adding advisory shoulders to another important bicycle and pedestrian connection between schools and neighborhoods. Factors in the success of the advisory shoulders were the leadership of the HBPC, support from the adjacent neighbors, the willingness to pilot them by the Department of Public Works and inclusion of Valley Road and advisory shoulders in both the SRTS and Bicycle and Pedestrian Plans.\nHanover, NH, is a town of approximately 11,000 with 8,000 living in the town center. Hanover is home to Dartmouth College with a student population of 6,300. Hanover is located on the Connecticut River and has a dense builtup area surrounded by small suburban neighborhoods that transition quickly to\na very rural setting.\nKey Design Elements\nThe advisory shoulders project was built on a low-volume, low-speed, residential road. Implementation included pavement markings and signs.\nRoles in the Network\nValley Road is a local bicycle connection between neighborhoods with schools, the downtown, and the Dartmouth College campus. Sidewalks were\nremoved due to root damage and were not replaced because the neighborhood preferred the rural look of streets without sidewalks. Advisory shoulders use existing pavement to provide space prioritized for bicycles and pedestrians at very low cost.\nThe Hanover Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan and the advisory shoulders project were both accomplished with funding from the HBPC, which is funded by a $5 local fee on vehicle registration that was passed by the select board to support alternative transportation and generates approximately $30,000 annually.\nFor more information, refer to the City of Hanover Public Works Department.\nCardiff Council.

{"question":"What symptoms of reflux are unique to infants and children compared to adults?","answer":"While adults typically experience symptoms like heartburn and acid regurgitation with GERD, infants and children show distinct symptoms. In infants and children, both GERD and LPR can cause respiratory problems including repeated vomiting, coughing, sore throat, and ear infections. Additionally, children with LPR may specifically experience serious airway-related symptoms such as noisy breathing (stridor), sleep-disordered breathing, turning blue (cyanosis), pauses in breathing (apnea), and failure to thrive. Most infants typically grow out of GERD by age one, and their frequent spitting up is usually normal during the first year unless accompanied by breathing or feeding problems.","context":["As always, you can contact our office to answer any questions or concerns.\nWhat is laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR)?\nFood or liquids that are swallowed travel through the esophagus and into the stomach where acids help digestion. Each end of the esophagus has a sphincter, a ring of muscle, that helps keep the acidic contents of the stomach in the stomach or out of the throat. When these rings of muscle do not work properly, you may get heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux (GER). Chronic GER is often diagnosed as gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD.\nSometimes, acidic stomach contents will reflux all the way up the esophagus, past the ring of muscle at the top (upper esophageal sphincter or UES), and into the throat. When this happens, acidic material contacts the sensitive tissue at back of the throat and even the back of the nasal airway. This is known as laryngopharyngeal reflux or LPR.\nDuring the first year, infants frequently spit up, and in most infants, it is a normal occurrence that resolves in the first year. Only infants who have associated breathing or feeding problems require evaluation by a specialist. This is most critical when breathing-related symptoms are present.\nWhat are symptoms of LPR?\nThere are various symptoms of LPR. Adults may be able to identify LPR as a bitter taste in the back of the throat, more commonly in the morning upon awakening, and the sensation of a “lump” or something “stuck” in the throat, which does not go away despite multiple swallowing attempts to clear the “lump.” Some adults may also experience a burning sensation in the throat. A more uncommon symptom is difficulty breathing, which occurs because the acidic, refluxed material comes in contact with the voice box (larynx) and causes the vocal cords to close to prevent aspiration of the material into the windpipe (trachea). This is known as “laryngospasm.”\nInfants and children are unable to describe sensations like adults can. Therefore, LPR is only successfully diagnosed if parents are suspicious and the child undergoes a full evaluation by a specialist, such as an otolaryngologist (ear-nose-throat doctor). Airway or breathing-related problems are the most commonly seen symptoms of LPR in infants and children and can be serious. If your infant or child experiences any of the following symptoms, timely evaluation is critical.\n- Chronic cough\n- Noisy breathing (stridor)\n- Reactive airway disease (asthma)\n- Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB)\n- Feeding difficulty\n- Turning blue (cyanosis)\n- Pauses in breathing (apnea)\n- Apparent life-threatening event (ALTE)\n- Failure to thrive (a severe deficiency in growth, where an infant or child is less than 5 percentile, compared to the expected norm)\nWhat are the complications of LPR?\nIn infants and children, chronic exposure of the laryngeal structures to acidic contents may cause long-term airway problems such as a narrowing of the area below the vocal cords (subglottic stenosis), hoarseness, and possibly eustachian tube dysfunction. The latter can cause recurrent ear infections, or persistent middle ear fluid, and even symptoms of sinusitis. The direct relationship between LPR and the latter mentioned problems are currently being researched.\nHow is LPR diagnosed?\nCurrently, there is no good standardized test to identify LPR. If parents notice any symptoms of LPR in their child, they may wish to discuss with their pediatrician getting a referral to see an otolaryngologist for evaluation. In the office, he or she may look directly at the voice box and related structures with a flexible scope or order a 24-hour pH monitoring of the esophagus. The otolaryngologist may also decide to perform further evaluation of the child under general anesthesia. This would include looking directly at the voice box (direct laryngoscopy), trachea and bronchi (bronchoscopy), and esophagus (esophagoscopy). LPR in infants and children remains a diagnosis of clinical judgment, based on history given by the parents, the physical exam, and endoscopic evaluations.\nHow is LPR treated?\nSince LPR is an extension of GER, successful treatment is usually based on successful treatment of GER. In infants and children, basic recommendations may include use of smaller and more frequent feedings, thickening of the food/liquid, and keeping an infant in a vertical position after feeding for at least 30 minutes. A trial of medications, including H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors, may be necessary. Similar to adults, children with severe symptoms who fail medical treatment or have diagnostic evaluations demonstrating anatomical abnormalities, may require surgical intervention.","What is GERD?\nGastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, occurs when acid from the stomach backs up into the esophagus. Normally, food travels from the mouth, down through the esophagus and into the stomach. A ring of muscle at the bottom of the esophagus, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), contracts to keep the acidic contents of the stomach from “refluxing” or coming back up into the esophagus. In those who have GERD, the LES does not close properly, allowing acid to move up the esophagus.\nWhen stomach acid touches the sensitive tissue lining the esophagus, it causes a reaction similar to squirting lemon juice in your eye. This is why GERD is often characterized by the burning sensation known as heartburn.\nOccasional heartburn is normal. However, if heartburn becomes chronic, occurring more than twice a week, you may have GERD. Left untreated, GERD can lead to more serious health problems.\nWho gets GERD?\nAnyone can have GERD. Women, men, infants and children can all experience this disorder. Overweight people and pregnant women are particularly susceptible because of the pressure on their stomachs. Recent studies indicate that GERD may often be overlooked in infants and children. In infants and children, GERD can cause repeated vomiting, coughing, and other respiratory problems such as sore throat and ear infections. Most infants grow out of GERD by the time they are one year old.\nTips to Prevent GERD\n● Do not drink alcohol● Lose weight● Quit smoking● Limit problem foods such as:● Caffeine● Carbonated drinks● Chocolate● Peppermint● Tomato and citrus foods● Fatty and fried foods● Wear loose clothing● Eat small meals and slowly\nWhat are the symptoms of GERD?\nThe symptoms of GERD may include persistent heartburn, acid regurgitation, and nausea. Some people have GERD without heartburn. Instead, they experience pain in the chest that can be sever enough to mimic the pain of a heart attack, hoarseness in the morning, or trouble swallowing. Some people may also feel like they have food stuck in their throat or like they are choking. GERD can also cause a dry cough and bad breath.\nWhat are the complications of GERD?\nGERD can lead to other medical problems such as ulcers and strictures of the esophagus (esophagitis), cough, asthma, throat and laryngeal inflammation, inflammation and infection of the lungs, and collection of fluid in the sinuses and middle ear. GERD can also cause a change in the esophageal lining called Barrett's esophagus, which is a serious complication that can lead to cancer.\nWhat causes GERD?\nPhysical causes of GERD can include: a malfunctioning or abnormal lower esophageal sphincter muscle (LES), hiatal hernia, abnormal esophageal contractions, and slow emptying of the stomach.\nLifestyle factors that contribute to GERD include:\n● alcohol use● obesity● pregnancy● smoking\nCertain foods can contribute to GERD, such as:● citrus fruits● chocolate● caffeinated drinks● fatty and fried foods● garlic and onions● mint flavorings (especially peppermint)● spicy foods● tomato-based foods, like spaghetti sauce, chili, and pizza\nWhen should I see a doctor?\nIf you experience heartburn more than twice a week, frequent chest pains after eating, trouble swallowing, persistent nausea, and cough or sore throat unrelated to illness, you may have GERD. For proper diagnosis and treatment, you should be evaluated by a physician.\nHow can my ENT help?\nOtolaryngologists, or ear, nose, and throat doctors, and have extensive experience with the tools that diagnose GERD and they are specialists in the treatment of many of the complications of GERD, including: sinus and ear infections, throat and laryngeal inflammation, Barrett’s esophagus, and ulcerations of the esophagus.\nHow is GERD diagnosed?\nGERD can be diagnosed or evaluated by clinical observation and the patient’s response to a trial of treatment with medication. In some cases other tests may be needed including: an endoscopic examination (a long tube with a camera inserted into the esophagus), biopsy, x-ray, examination of the throat and larynx, 24 hour esophageal acid testing, esophageal motility testing (manometry), emptying studies of the stomach, and esophageal acid perfusion (Bernstein test). Endoscopic examination, biopsy, and x-ray may be performed as an outpatient in a hospital setting. Light sedation may be used for endoscopic examinations.\nWhile most people with GERD respond to a combination of lifestyle changes and medication. Occasionally, surgery is recommended.\nLifestyle changes include: losing weight, quitting smoking, wearing loose clothing around the waist, raising the head of your bed (so gravity can help keep stomach acid in the stomach), eating your last meal of the day three hours before bed, and limiting certain foods such as spicy and high fat foods, caffeine, alcohol.\nMedications your doctor may prescribe for GERD include: antacids (such as Tums, Rolaids, etc.), histamine antagonists (H2 blockers such as Tagamet,), proton pump inhibitors (such as Prilosec, Prevacid, Aciphex, Protonix, and Nexium), pro-motility drugs (Reglan), and foam barriers (Gaviscon). Some of these products are now available over-the-counter and do not require a prescription.\nSurgical treatment includes: fundoplication, a procedure where a part of the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophagus to tighten the LES, and endoscopy, where hand stitches or a laser is used to make the LES tighter.\nAre there long-term health problems associated with GERD?\nGERD may damage the lining of the esophagus, thereby causing inflammation (esophagitis), although usually it does not. Barrett's esophagus is a pre-cancerous condition that requires periodic endoscopic surveillance for the development of cancer.\nFor more information on GERD or to find an otolaryngologist near you, visit www.entnet.org."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:66433615-7e6a-4556-9afd-d3ab0bef5805>","<urn:uuid:c4e4feb9-ca7a-44e0-8fc3-6825db5e91f6>"],"error":null}
