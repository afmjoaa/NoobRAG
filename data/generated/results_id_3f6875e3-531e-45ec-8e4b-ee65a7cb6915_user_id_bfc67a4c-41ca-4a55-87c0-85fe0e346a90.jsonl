{"question":"What specific electrolytes besides sodium do endurance athletes need during workouts >90 minutes? Looking for precise supplementation amounts.","answer":"For workouts longer than 90 minutes, besides sodium, athletes should include 100-200mg of potassium and some magnesium and calcium in their hydration supplement. For magnesium specifically, it's recommended to use magnesium citrate or chelated magnesium (magnesium bisglycinate) instead of magnesium oxide to avoid gastrointestinal distress. The other electrolytes can typically be obtained through meeting the recommended daily intake through regular diet.","context":["By Holley Samuel MEd, RD, LD, CPT\nWith summer on the horizon, one of your biggest concerns as an endurance athlete is probably hydration. You may be wondering what to drink, how much, and when to drink it, along with how to know if you're hydrating well enough to achieve your goals. Whether it's summer or not, endurance athletes sweat during their workouts, and they're losing water and electrolytes. Our environmental conditions, along with more specific details like which phase we're in of the menstrual cycle, if we're female, can also impact how much we sweat and its composition.\nOur bodies store carbohydrates as glycogen and body fat for energy, but we cannot store water and electrolytes in the same way. This is why we need to replace what we lose during our training or race. Once we become too dehydrated and start to experience symptoms like headache, fatigue, chills, cramping, or gastrointestinal distress, we can probably kiss our performance goals goodbye.\nFirst, let's talk about the fluid component of your hydration strategy. On average, we lose about 12-32oz of fluid in sweat per hour or as much as 50-80oz on the hottest days. How much we sweat varies from person to person, independent of their environment. We don't need to replace 100% of what is lost in sweat, but aiming for at least 80% can help prevent significant impacts on performance.\nOptional Mini Experiment: To understand your unique sweat rate, weigh yourself without clothes before going out for a run. Then run for 60 minutes, keeping track of any and how much water you drink or if you use the bathroom. Then weigh yourself immediately after you finish your run without clothes. If you want to calculate your sweat rate, visit this calculator and enter the data you collected from this mini-experiment.\nThe goal is to prevent anything more than 2-3% body weight loss by replacing fluids and electrolytes during your activity. Studies show that performance is significantly impacted when we lose too much weight through sweat during training, and dehydration negatively impacts our overall health. In order to meet your hydration needs, consuming between 4-8oz of water every 10-20 mins during activities is recommended, especially for activities that last longer than 60 minutes. Remember that 1oz is about one gulp to make running math easier! On hotter days, you'll likely have to drink more water more frequently.\nElectrolytes include sodium, calcium, potassium, bicarbonate, magnesium, and chloride as the most notably lost in sweat, with sodium and potassium being the most significantly lost. Electrolytes help us maintain fluid balance, which allows our muscles to contract and relax. Since running requires many muscles to contract and relax, including our heart, maintaining proper fluid balance through adequate electrolyte intake during exercise is vital to maintaining your performance and keeping you safe and healthy.\nWhen we consume water only or not enough electrolytes, this can cause a condition called hyponatremia, which can be extremely dangerous or fatal as a result of improper fluid balance. Other common symptoms of dehydration or improper hydration (meaning you don't take in the correct ratio of electrolytes to fluid for your unique needs) include calf cramps, side stitches, gastrointestinal distress like vomiting and diarrhea, and muscle spasms that can also lead to injury.\nThe American College of Sports Medicine recommends between 300-600mg of sodium per hour during prolonged exercise and notes that athletes with saltier sweat may need up to 1200mg of sodium per hour. Research indicates that sodium loading prior to competition intended to achieve the status of euhydration- or being optimally hydrated- leads to improved performance outcomes in both men and women.\nYou may be thinking about how the health industry encourages Americans to limit their sodium intake- while you should consult with your registered dietitian and physician about what applies to you individually, typically, athletes need far more sodium than the average person to replace what's lost daily in sweat.\nJust like we all have different sweat loss rates, we also have different sweat compositions. Traditionally, it is challenging to assess your unique sweat composition without access to fancy equipment at university and sports performance research centers. Still, new products are being released like the Gatorade Patch that can help you assess and understand your sweat right at home.\nFor other electrolytes, meeting the recommended daily intake for athletes through daily diet should suffice, but as a dietitian, I typically recommend endurance athletes include between 100-200mg potassium and some magnesium and calcium in their hydration supplement during workouts longer than 90 minutes or on shorter workouts on hot days. Keep in mind that some forms of magnesium can cause gastrointestinal distress in those with sensitive guts, so it's best to look for magnesium citrate or chelated magnesium (otherwise known as magnesium bisglycinate) instead of magnesium oxide to avoid this.\nHow To Implement And How does this all come together?\nAim to drink 4-8oz water every 10-20 mins, especially on runs lasting longer than 60 minutes.\nAlternate every other drinking interval with plain water and an electrolyte beverage to avoid potential gastrointestinal distress from taking too much at once.\nWhile your running fuel like gels and chews may contain some electrolytes, read the labels and assess if you need an electrolyte supplement to meet the recommendation of taking 400-800mg sodium and 100-200mg potassium per hour.\nMy favorite brands are Skratch Labs, NUUN Podium series, Liquid IV, Stage Hydration, Elete, Ultima, Vitalyte, Generation UCAN Hydration, and Gatorade Endurance Formula.\nFind a vessel you can use to carry your hydration like a handheld water bottle, hydration vest, or practice stashing bottles on the course, or doing a loop course around your car or home.\nPractice with whatever you plan to use on race day to get your body accustomed to it ahead of time.\nKeep sweating and stay hydrated this summer!\nBelval LN, Hosokawa Y, Casa DJ, Adams WM, Armstrong LE, Baker LB, Burke L, Cheuvront S, Chiampas G, González-Alonso J, Huggins RA, Kavouras SA, Lee EC, McDermott BP, Miller K, Schlader Z, Sims S, Stearns RL, Troyanos C, Wingo J.

{"question":"What role does community involvement play in both HOPE SF's housing developments and San Francisco's overall resilience planning?","answer":"Both initiatives emphasize strong community participation. HOPE SF implements an inclusive, community-led process where residents and neighbors have a say in new site plans through community meetings, ensuring their thoughts and wishes are heard. It also uses Community Builders to facilitate activities that bring together residents across income levels to address shared concerns like neighborhood safety. Similarly, San Francisco's resilience strategy emphasizes empowering neighborhoods, recognizing that the city is made up of neighborhoods and neighbors. It aims to build trust, equity, and partnership through effective governmental stewardship to create resilient, healthy, and cohesive neighborhoods.","context":["Get Involved: FAQ\nQ. What is HOPE SF?\nA. HOPE SF will revitalize San Francisco’s severely distressed public housing sites by creating thriving, mixed-income communities. In an effort that is likely to become a national model, HOPE SF will create opportunities to transform residents’ lives, not just their homes, by investing in the schools, services, safety, and support needed for success.\nQ. What are the HOPE SF sites? Why were these sites chosen?\nA. HOPE SF includes eight public housing properties selected by the San Francisco Housing Authority and the Mayor’s Office of Housing. It would be more expensive to repair these properties than to rebuild them with new homes. Additionally, these sites were exclusively public housing at lower densities than the surrounding neighborhoods, which offers the opportunity to create a mixed-income community while replacing all of the public housing.\nFind out more about the sites currently in preplanning or planning stages:\nHunters View and the Hunters View website\nSunnydale-Velasco and the Mercy Housing CA website\nPotrero Terrace and Potrero Annex and the Rebuild Potrero website\nAlice Griffith and the Choice Neighborhoods Press Release\nFuture HOPE SF sites include Hunters Point and Westbrook.\nBack to Top\nQ. How much money will the HOPE SF project cost in total? Who is financing the HOPE SF project?\nA. Each development is individually financed, with more than half of the financing coming from private sector investment. Hunters View, the first HOPE SF development, is estimated to cost a total of $450 million, with 75% of the funding coming from private investment and state or federal funds.\nQ. How long will it take to complete?\nA. The first five developments are expected to take 10 years to complete. The specific timeline for the remaining developments will be determined by the availability of local, state, and federal funding.\nSee Development Plan and Project Timeline for more information.\nBack to Top\nQ. Will the residents and communities have a say in the new plans or does HOPE SF have its own ideas of what to do at each site?\nA. HOPE SF will plan collaboratively with residents and neighbors of each site. An inclusive, community-led process will ensure that new sites meet the needs of current residents. Community meetings will ensure that residents’ and neighbors’ thoughts and wishes are heard.\nQ. Where will the residents live during construction?\nA. The HOPE SF model is to rebuild each site in phases. The goal is to minimize relocation needs and, when possible, enable residents to stay in their existing communities during construction. At Hunters View, all 55 families that were living in the first phase of buildings to be demolished were successfully relocated, each with the opportunity to relocate onsite and most choosing to stay onsite. A few families chose to move for health reasons and were successfully assisted in moving to affordable housing elsewhere.\nSee The Basics and Right to Revitalized Housing for more information.\nBack to Top\nQ. Will the residents be able to return after construction? Will there be restrictions regarding the residents' return?\nA. All residents will have the right to move into the revitalized units, provided that they have not been evicted or served by the Housing Authority with a summons and complaint for eviction.\nSee Right to Revitalized Housing for more information.\nQ. Some of the problems at these sites won’t be solved just by constructing new buildings. How will things be different?\nA. HOPE SF will not simply rebuild dilapidated buildings. HOPE SF offers residents new opportunities to grow, succeed, and become part of a healthy, mixed-income community.\n|•||Service Connectors will put residents in touch with vital city services, including educational and employment opportunities and child care.|\n|•||Community Builders will facilitate planning of activities to bring together all residents across income levels to strengthen the community and address shared concerns such as neighborhood safety|\n|•||Job training programs will prepare residents to access new employment opportunities, including demolition and construction jobs at the site.|\n|•||Economically Integrated Communities|\n|•||Parks and Open Space|\n|•||Neighborhood Shops and Businesses|\nThese are the building blocks of neighborhood transformation, and are essential to achieving the goal of creating neighborhoods desirable to families with a wide range of incomes.\nLearn more about neighborhood improvements.\nBack to Top\nQ. Who are the developers HOPE SF is working with? Why were they chosen?\nA. Five different development teams work on HOPE SF. Each site has its own team which was selected by the San Francisco Housing Authority through a competitive selection process.\n- Ridge Point Non Profit Housing Corporation\n- The John Stewart Company\n- Devine and Gong, Inc.\n- Bridge Housing Corporation\n- Build LLC\n- Mercy Housing\n- The Related Companies\nSee HOPE SF Partners and Contacts for more information.\nBack to Top\nQ. Which city agencies are involved in HOPE SF?\nA. San Francisco Mayor’s Office of Housing\nSan Francisco Housing Authority\nSan Francisco Human Services Agency\nSan Francisco Unified School District\nSan Francisco Department of Children, Youth & Their Families\nSan Francisco Department of Public Health\nSan Francisco Office of Economic and Workforce Development\nSee HOPE SF Partners for more information.\nQ. How many public housing units will you be building in Hunters View?\nA. The developers of Hunters View will rebuild all 267 units of public housing. The replacement apartments will be integrated in the same buildings with 83 affordable rental homes, generally for other families earning between $40,000 and $50,000 per year. These buildings will be mixed with for-sale condominiums and townhouses across the Hunters View site. The first phase of Hunters View will include 106 rental apartments and 80 homes for-sale. Find out more about Hunters View.\nFor the broader HOPE SF initiative, there will be a one-for-one replacement of all of the public housing integrated in the same buildings with other affordable rental homes. The total number of market-rate and affordable homes will be determined on a site-by-site basis in consultation with residents, neighbors, and public officials.\nBack to Top\nQ. Isn’t HOPE SF just a repeat of HOPE VI? How is it different?\nA. HOPE SF was developed in response to some of the lessons learned from HOPE VI revitalization projects. Unlike many HOPE VI projects around the country, HOPE SF is focused on minimizing displacement of residents and ensuring that current residents are the main beneficiaries of this investment. In addition, the HOPE SF efforts in San Francisco generally includes efforts to create a broader income-mix within the community, rebuild parks, improve schools, and bring neighborhood-serving retail within easy walking distance of homes. Finally, many HOPE VI revitalization projects resulted in a loss of public housing. HOPE SF is committed to replacing every public housing unit in the project sites.\nBefore launching HOPE SF, the HOPE SF Task Force and public agency staff studied efforts in cities around the country to find out more what worked and what didn’t. The HOPE SF Principles reflect those lessons learned and put a “San Francisco” stamp on the national effort to revitalize public housing.\nQ. Isn’t the main purpose to gentrify these neighborhoods?\nA. HOPE SF is not urban renewal and it is not a clever attempt to disguise gentrification. Unlike many HOPE VI projects around the country, HOPE SF is focused on minimizing relocation of residents and ensuring that current residents are the main beneficiaries of this investment. In addition to a commitment to replace all of the public housing, HOPE SF developments are generally done in phases to minimize the need for relocation and allow families to remain in their community if they choose. In addition, HOPE SF’s heavy investment in pre-development services and high resident involvement help to stabilize and improve the lives of the current residents, preparing them for future success.\nPotrero Terrace and Potrero Annex\nBack to Top","RESILIENT SF is a strategy that seeks to tap into our city’s tenacity by laying out our most pressing challenges and demanding that City government partner with the community to make bold and lasting progress on these challenges. When we think about San Francisco, we think of a city of unwavering strength, a city that is prepared to not only respond but to recover, and a San Francisco of strong and unified neighborhoods, ready to continue reimagining, and striving for the strong and resilient San Francisco of tomorrow.\nCities around the world are grappling with the realities of climate change and rising seas, escalating urbanization and increasingly frequent disruptions of daily life. Here in San Francisco, we are struggling with how the hazards we face—and our response to them—expose several interdependencies that we must better understand. What is 21st century San Francisco? To whom will this city be available? How can we maintain our San Francisco values and, perhaps, make them even stronger?\nResilience describes the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses and systems within a city to survive, adapt and grow, no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience. Approaching challenges through the lens of resilience helps cities better serve their residents today and plan for the longer term. Resilience demands moving beyond reaction through proactive planning. The approach calls for considering problems systematically and bridging the practice gaps between social justice, sustainability, disaster recovery and other areas.\nThe Office of Resilience and Capital Planning has been leading the implementation of several initiatives and collaborating and tracking the progress of initiatives led by partner agencies. Click on the links to the left to learn more about our city’s challenges and current priority resilience initiatives.\nOur Resilience Challenges:\nEarthquakes: There is a 76 percent chance the Bay Area will experience a 7.0 magnitude earthquake in the next 30 years. Even the relatively moderate and distant 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake (6.9) caused substantial damage to our city. It is imperative to the survival of San Francisco that we continue working to prepare for and recover from the “big one.”\nClimate Change: The impacts of climate change are already being felt in the form of drought and record breaking temperatures. In addition, up to 66 inches of sea level rise could impact our shores by 2100. We must secure our city’s future by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, while adapting to the likely impacts of climate change today rather than when it is too late.\nInfrastructure: Infrastructure is central to our daily lives—from the roads and pipes we use every day, to the larger systems, like food, social networks and housing that we rely on as lifelines. Sometimes these systems continue to operate past their intended life span, and sometimes they are inadequate altogether to meet the needs of a growing and vibrant city.\nSocial Inequity: San Francisco embraces equality and equity in all policies, but this work is never done. Social equity and inclusiveness need to be at the core of what makes a city thrive.\nUnaffordability: Forty-five percent of renters in San Francisco pay more than 30 percent of their household income in rent. Median home prices are continuing to rise, making it a challenge for first-time homebuyers. San Francisco is becoming out of reach for many of the people who made the city what it is today.\nPopulation Growth: The Association of Bay Area Governments projects that the population of San Francisco will grow to 1 million, and the Bay Area will grow to 7.2 million residents by 2040. We cannot just plan for our needs of today but rather must work together to plan for the needs of a growing population.\nWe have determined four actionable goals to address San Francisco’s interconnected challenges. Each goal was formed from, and will be supported by, leveraging successful City department-level initiatives, as well as supporting efforts (e.g., department studies, existing projects) within each goal’s policy area:\n- Plan and Prepare: San Francisco’s challenges build slowly and quickly, steadily and suddenly. This goal looks toward building our city’s capacity to handle today’s challenges and tomorrow’s disasters. We address land use planning and recovery planning, as well as earthquake planning and preparedness.\n- Retrofit Mitigate Adapt: We face a future with certain challenges. This goal looks to confront the pressing realities of an imminent large earthquake, a changing climate and rising seas, all while building a stronger city today.\n- Ensure Housing: Today’s challenges will only worsen with tomorrow’s disruptions. We must work now to ensure housing for all San Franciscans before and after a disaster. We will work to address our city’s housing and homeless crises through innovative policies, reimagining and bold action to build a stronger city for today and tomorrow.\n- Empower Neighborhoods: San Francisco is a city of neighborhoods and neighbors. This goal seeks to build on the strength of our city’s character and vibrancy, by being effective governmental stewards of resilient, healthy and cohesive neighborhoods based in trust, equity and partnership."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:36b7c3bd-78e2-45db-b441-837480537d0c>","<urn:uuid:fec41993-c4df-49c2-84be-140971d35590>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the technical requirements for implementing WebSocket communication in LabVIEW, and how can organizations monitor its security through Splunk integration?","answer":"WebSocket implementation in LabVIEW requires TCP/IP VIs and additional VIs for HTTP handshaking and data framing, working on both RT and Windows targets. The API includes functions for handshaking, header management, reading/writing data, and connection closure. For security monitoring, organizations need Splunk Core (version 8.1.x and above) and Chrome Browser Cloud Management, with Chrome 110+ required for extension events and Chrome 104+ for malicious download events. The integration uses HTTP Event Collector tokens and requires configuration of service accounts and external lookup inputs to track browser-related security events.","context":["To download NI software, including the products shown below, visit ni.com/downloads.\nEarlier this year I posted about the myRIO Giant Tetris project I worked on which ended up appearing at NI Week in Texas and NI Days in the UK this year. One of the coolest features of this was the ability to control the game using a web browser from a computer or mobile device. The technology for doing this was WebSockets which allows you to create and maintain an open WebSocket connection (using TCP/IP) and send data with low-latency and overhead between a modern web-browser and a server (in this case LabVIEW RT).\nI have finally been able to tidy up the code and offer it to the community to play with!\nHere's what I originally wrote about WebSockets for the Giant Tetris:\nWebSockets is a web technology that allows a browser and a server to communicate in a way similar to TCP/IP. The browser sends a WebSocket upgrade request (very similar to a HTTP request), the server sends a HTTP response with specific headers and then you can send/receive data through the open connection. To implement this in LabVIEW I used the TCP/IP VIs and some additional VIs for performing the HTTP handshaking and framing the websockets data. In my case, the browser is communicating directly with the myRIO (or it could be other RT targets or PCs) with no intermediate server.\nThe library I have produced acts as a wrapper for the TCP Read/Write VIs and includes a handshaking VI for reading and responding to an incoming handshake request from the browser.\nHere's an overview of the API for the LabVIEW Side:\nDo Handshake: Performs the WebSocket handshaking after a connection is made - reads the headers from the HTTP request and replies with the appropriate WebSocket key to open the connection.\nDo Client Handshake: This VI allows you to initiate a connection acting as a WebSocket client, communicating to an existing WebSocket server (either implementing in LabVIEW or otherwise). It sends the necessary HTTP header to start a WebSocket connection and waits for the reply from the server.\nGet Header: I store the header name/value pairs as variant attributes, you can use this VI to retrieve a header value.\nRead: Wrapper for the TCP Read primitive that splits out the data from the WebSocket frame. The returned Opcode is as per the WebSocket standard.\nWrite: Wrapper for the TCP Write primitive that packages the data into a WebSocket frame and sends to the connection.\nClose: Sends the WebSocket close Opcode to the browser. According to the WebSockets spec, both sides of the connection are supposed to send the close Opcode before terminating the TCP connection so this VI doesn't close the TCP connection.\nAs it's just a wrapper for TCP/IP functions with some maths/string manipulation (for hashing the WebSocket key) it works on RT and Windows targets.\nThe included example VI, when run, acts as a server for an incoming WebSocket connection, displays the string data received from the connected browser and allows you to send string data back to the browser. The included index.html file in the installed package acts as a client to connect and display the string data:\nI've published this in an attempt that it will be useful for the NI community. The package/source is released under the MIT License. The source code and releases are available on GitHub: https://github.com/MediaMongrels-Ltd/LabVIEW-WebSockets-API\nIf you find anything wrong with it then I hope you'll let me know in the comments so it can be improved and built upon.\nThe VI package is available/installed through the LabVIEW Tools Network VIPM repository at the following link: vipm://mediamongrels_ltd_lib_websockets_api\nExample code from the Example Code Exchange in the NI Community is licensed with the MIT license.","You’re a SOC analyst who understands that as employees spend more time working in browsers, the chances of risky browser behavior impacting enterprise resiliency increases.

{"question":"I'm researching peaceful resistance movements. Are there any similarities between the teaching materials on civil disobedience by Thoreau and Gandhi's implementation of non-violence in India?","answer":"Yes, there are significant similarities. Both emphasized using moral courage rather than physical force to combat injustice. Thoreau's writings taught that 'what is once well done is done forever' and questioned whether democracy was the final improvement in government, while Gandhi similarly believed in shaming opponents into submission through moral force rather than violence. Both saw their approaches as requiring greater courage than violent resistance - Gandhi specifically argued that the moral strength needed for non-violence was greater than that needed for violent retaliation, aligning with Thoreau's emphasis on conscience over governmental authority.","context":["Today, the eve of Halloween, we will honor Edgar Allen Poe.\nWe will read the “The Tell Tale Heart” aloud in class.\nStudents will read “The Black Cat” & “The Pit & the Pendulum” next week.\nUPDATE: We’ve taken 2- 50 point split-quote quizzes over the first two stories.

Non-violence had always been the founding principle of Gandhian spirituality, and his bedrock of his political philosophy. Gandhi's distrust of violence as a mode to assume political power and as a tool of revolution was ingrained in his world-view from the very early days of his political career.\nIt is impossible to look at Gandhi's political activism in isolation. Springing deeply from his belief in truth, Gandhi's political goals were ultimately specific correlatives of higher commitments to humanity and world peace. Non-violence preaches world peace and brotherhood, whereas political movements naturally revel in polemics of difference and anatagonism. Gandhi's greatness lies in bringing together these two apparently combative and incongruous ideas and putting them on a common platform, where they do not subtract, but support each other. Gandhi's significance in the world political scenario is two-fold. First, he retrieved non-violence as a powerful political tool, and secondly, he was the one of the chief promulgators of the theory that political goal is ultimately a manifestation of a higher spiritual and humanitarian goal, culminating in world peace. For Gandhi, the means were as important as the end, and there could be only one means - that of non-violence.\nThe Origins of Gandhi's Non-Violence Philosophy\nGandhi's secularism and openness to all kinds of theological and philosophical schools is well-known. It was through an assimilation of various concepts and philosophical tenets that Gandhi arrived at his own understanding of non-violence. Jainism and Buddhism were the most important influences that lay behind the foundation of Gandhi's non-violence theory. Both Jainism and Buddhism preached non-violence as the basic principle of existence. All other thoughts and actions propagated by these two religious schools were based on this base of non-violence. Gandhi was deeply influenced by his readings of these scriptures. The Acaranga Sutra of the Jains stated all life to be dear and precious, and Gandhi believed in it earnestly. The Bhagvadgita was another important influence, with its stress on non-attachment and selfless action. Christianity, along with its message of love and compassion, extended even to one's enemies, was another important influence on Gandhi's life. Bringing together all these theological schools, Gandhi was in search for a meaningful life, a life based on truth and honesty, a life that would boast of a moral courage to stand for the right and for justice, even at its own cost. It was this outlook that Gandhi employed as a tool to guide India's freedom struggle, which eventually succeeded to unite the length and breadth of the country like never before.\nGandhi's Use of Non-Violence in India's Freedom Struggle\nGandhi's championing of the cause of non-violence as the tool of India's freedom struggle was not without its share of criticism. That was, however, expected considering the fact that Gandhi entered the political scenario soon after the ascendancy of the extremists in the history of India's freedom struggle. Armed revolution was believed to be the only legitimate way to snatch political power from an oppressive regime. Gandhi's system of Satyagraha on the basis of non-violence and non-cooperation was largely unheard of, and generally distrusted. However, Gandhi's faith was strong. It was a faith based not on arms and antagonism, but on extreme moral courage that drew its strength from innate human truth and honesty. He applied his systems with success in South Africa and was convinced of its power. However, it was an uphill task for him to convince his countrymen. Gandhi slowly started to popularise the ideas in the ranks of the Indian National Congress, under proper guidance from his political mentor Gopal Krishna Gokhale. The Congress was suffering from a lack of national leadership following the arrest and execution of the extremist leaders like Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai, and the protest to the insulting Rowlatt Act was an immediate necessity. Gandhi soon held the mantle and introduced his non-violence modes with great success in the non-cooperation movement. It was a new era in the history of Indian Freedom struggle. Though the movement ended on an abrupt note, yet its significance was immense.\nGandhi's Rationale for the Application of Non-Violence in Indian Freedom Struggle\nMost religions preached non-violence as a way to celebrate the miracle of life. Gandhi's concern was both based on theological as well as more pragmatic considerations. Gandhi in his trial speech accepted that Indian history is replete with tales and narratives of countless foreign invasions. However, he accused the British rule of being particularly despicable because they left the Indians more helpless and emasculated than any of its predecessors. India was in no position to get into an armed conflict with the British, having been robbed of all economic and moral strength. So, Gandhi had the option of reinvigorating a nation that has lost all confidence in its power and inner strength. After these practical considerations, Gandhi found that the only alternative was to fall back upon what was integral to India's cultural and historical psyche, the principle of non-violence. This non-violence was used in conjunction with the philosophy of non-attachment. Gandhi declared the two goals of his life to be ensuring India's freedom and to achieve it through non-violence. One without the other would be unacceptable and weakening. Violence, Gandhi believed, breded violence, and can never be a solution to India's problem. To shame the opponent into submission was a unique feature of Gandhi's political ideology, as were discussions and amicable arrivals at convenient conclusions. No person, for him was integrally good or bad, and he was cautious never to stoop into a visceral rhetoric of hatred, except against what was unacceptable to his spiritual ideology.\nOne of the greatest criticisms against non-violence was that it was demeaning and cowardly, forwarded particularly by freedom fighters like Savarkar. However, Gandhi believed just the opposite. He emphasized that the moral courage needed to uphold non-violence as a tool of protest was much greater than the one needed to strike back in a violent way. All through his life, he pleaded the Indians to exhibit the moral strength to refrain from resorting to violence, even at the face of all provocation. His disillusionment that followed the Chauri Chaura incident that led to his calling off the non-cooperation movement when at its zenith was an example of his lifelong and earnest commitment to the cause of non-violence.\nThe Legacy of Non-Violence\nNon-violence played a very important role in defining the course of Indian national movement, from the 1920s to the final achievement of the freedom. It formed the basis of the methods of Satyagraha that became closely associated with the Gandhian whirlwind in Indian politics. Gandhi understood economic profit to be the guiding force of the imperialist project and attacked the British government at where it hurt most, which was financial gain. Picketing, non-cooperation and organised resistance to British modes of oppression were the main modes of the non-violent political movements in India. It shaped the course of the Civil Disobedience Movement as well. Even at a later time, during the Quit India Movement, Gandhi's theory of non-violence held strong in the face of the new and radical waves in the world of Indian politics like communism and armed revolution. Even at the dawn of independence, as Nehru was getting ready to eloquently unleash his 'tryst with destiny', Gandhi was busy on the troubled roads of Bengal, preaching non-violence to mad rioters. It was probably pre-ordained that he had to lay down his life for holding on to his ideals.\nGandhi was truly a martyr for the cause of non-violence, who not only preached but practiced what he preached. His life was a glorious example of his thoughts, and thousands of Indians from all walks of life, from cities and villages alike, took encouragement and force from his simple life and unshaken faith in the innate goodness of the human soul. He wielded the weapon of love and understanding, and succeeded to upturn even the strongest of the martial nations with it. Gandhi has left the world richer with a renewed faith in the dictates of non-violence.\nLast Updated on 17/04/2013"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3e4b1de6-592e-4089-b844-35547980a44f>","<urn:uuid:4d6fdf79-652e-4d5c-a0fd-38e8925d9ff2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do passive sampling and biomonitoring compare in terms of cost and analysis requirements?","answer":"Both passive sampling and biomonitoring require laboratory analysis to process samples. Passive sampling is characterized as a low-cost method, while biomonitoring involves more complex processes including growing plants, harvesting, and analysis by external certified laboratories. Passive sampling typically provides weekly or longer averages, while biomonitoring samples are analyzed every four to eight weeks depending on the plant species used.","context":["Biomonitoring is the use of plants to measure air quality. Plants can absorb and store substances from the air. After harvesting, these can be analysed for compounds such as heavy metals, PAHs, dioxins and PCBs. Biomonitoring has been found to be a powerful tool for monitoring air quality around waste incineration plants, ore-processing industries and airports.\n1. What is biomonitoring?\nIn order to measure air quality using biomonitoring, WUR researchers grow sensitive plants such as spinach, kale and grass in the vicinity of industries with airborne emissions (the ‘source’). These plants are grown as indicator plants. They can absorb and store substances from the air, usually without visible symptoms. The plants are grown in containers with standardised soil to exclude any influence of local differences in soil quality and to limit measurements to airborne absorption. As an additional measure, milk samples are sometimes taken from dairy farms in the vicinity of industrial sites.\nEvery four weeks, the researchers examine whether the plants are showing abnormalities and look for the presence of any harmful compounds such as heavy metals, PAHs, fluorides and dioxins in the plants. If abnormalities do occur, this becomes apparent at an early stage. The measurements mainly have a signal function. As long as the standards are not exceeded in the indicator crops and products, all the crops grown in the immediate vicinity of the source are safe. Further investigation is only needed if the norms are exceeded.\n2. What kinds of industrial situations is biomonitoring used in?\nBiomonitoring can be used to measure air quality around individual point sources such as waste incineration plants, ore-processing industries, power plants and airports. It can also be used in areas with a lot of industry or around large industrial estates. Another use is for monitoring the quality of food crops grown in an urban area.\n3. What substances can biomonitoring identify?\nThe range of compounds that can be included in a biomonitoring programme depends on the emissions being released. Other selection criteria include properties such as toxicity, volatility, demonstrability and societal relevance (such as dioxins in milk).\nMonitoring air pollutants such as carbon dioxide (CO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter, ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) is less useful since these substances are emitted by many different sources such as industry, agriculture, households and traffic. These components cannot be identified in plants as such because of the conversions that take place in the plant and because it is impossible to distinguish the contribution made by an individual source from the ‘blanket’ that already covers the Netherlands.\n4. Where are measurements taken?\nAs the name suggests, the main function of a biomonitoring programme is to monitor. This requires spatial distribution with measuring points in as many wind directions as possible in relation to the source. It can then be investigated whether there is a correlation between the wind direction and the levels found. The number and location of the monitoring points is determined on the basis of the geographical location of the source and the likely distribution pattern of the emissions. A reference measurement point is also set up at a greater distance from the direct sphere of influence of the source to determine the local background load. Between five and eight measuring points are sufficient for most situations.\n5. How often are measurements taken?\nA biomonitoring programme can monitor the air quality around an industry all year round. The frequency of sampling depends on the plant species:\n- Spinach is grown in spring and summer and is harvested and analysed every four weeks.\n- Kale is grown in autumn and winter and is analysed every eight weeks.\n- Fluoride levels in grass are determined every four weeks throughout the year.\nIn order to reliably determine trends over time (whether environmental quality is better, the same or worse than the background load), a multi-year measurement programme is required.\n6. Who carries out the biomonitoring?\nThe monitoring activities, which include setting up the measuring points, growing the crops, harvesting, reporting and discussing the results with the parties concerned, are carried out by WUR employees. The crop analyses are outsourced to external certified laboratories.\n7. What are the measurements tested against?\nTo determine the effects on crops, the measured levels around the source are compared with those at the reference point, which is in the same area but outside the direct sphere of influence of the source (local background levels). The levels are also compared with the national background levels.\n8. When are the results available?\nAfter each sampling it takes about three weeks for the analysis results to become available. A measurement programme of at least one year is required to identify trends over time.\n9. Who can view the results?\nEach biomonitoring programme has a supervisory committee on which the parties involved are represented. The supervisory committee meets once or twice a year to discuss the outcomes of the programme. Potential adjustments to the monitoring programme are also discussed at these meetings. Once the annual report has been drawn up, it is generally made public.\n10. What previous projects have there been?\nAn example of a previous project is the biomonitoring carried out to map the situation around Lelystad Airport. The future consequences of the planned expansion of Lelystad Airport on crops in the immediate vicinity was determined by taking measurements near Bremen Airport, which has similar activity levels to the future Lelystad Airport. This study found that emissions of aircraft exhaust fumes have no adverse impact on the quality of the crops grown in the immediate vicinity of Bremen Airport.","Air monitoring methodologies can be divided into five main types, covering a wide range of costs and performance levels. The methods and their relative merits are shown in the table below and discussed in the following section. The use of a particular type of monitoring equipment may need to be justified in review and assessment reports and therefore should be chosen appropriately.\nIt is also important to choose the most appropriate monitoring location for investigating a specific air pollution source or problem.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Monitoring Methods\nPlease click the method links to view detailed description of the method.\n|Passive sampling||Low cost - simple.

Data not readily comparable with point measurements.|\nSince monitoring instrumentation covers a wide range in capital and running costs, it is usually advisable to choose the simplest method available to meet the specified monitoring objectives. Many baseline monitoring, spatial screening and indicative surveys can be served perfectly well by inexpensive active or passive sampling methods. Only proven and generally accepted measurement methods should be considered.\nMonitoring site locations\nMonitoring sites can be classified according to the type of environment in which they are located, in order to permit more meaningful evaluation of data.

{"question":"How do university health centers handle psychiatric medication management for both new patients and those transitioning from existing care, and what is the evaluation process like?","answer":"For new patients, university health centers typically require an initial evaluation. At Nebraska Medicine, students first meet with a counseling therapist who assesses if psychiatric care is needed. The first psychiatric evaluation is a 60-minute appointment involving vital signs, health history review, and extensive questioning about physical health, social history, and mental health concerns. Follow-up appointments ranging from 20-40 minutes are scheduled to monitor progress. For students transitioning from existing care, health centers coordinate with home providers to ensure seamless transitions. UHS at UW-Madison provides psychiatric consultation and medication management, while students with complex conditions can be referred to off-campus providers.

Our psychiatric team is comprised of medically trained providers that offer assessment, education and medication management for a wide array of conditions such as depression, anxiety, life stressors, eating disorders, ADD/ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and more.\nFor those who are new to psychiatric services or are uncertain if this type of care is needed, we first have students schedule a brief appointment with a Counseling and Psychological Services therapist. The therapist will assess the situation and help determine if a psychiatric evaluation is appropriate or recommended. If so, they will assist the student in making an appointment with a member of the Health Center psychiatry team or a psychiatrist in the community.\nFor those who have already seen a psychiatrist and would like to schedule an appointment with a member of the Health Center’s psychiatry team, please call 402.472.5000.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nPsychiatric medication management visits are not covered under the University Program and Facilities Fee and will therefore incur a charge. For pricing information, call 402.472.5000 and select Billing and Insurance among the options. Please be advised, mental health appointments with a Health Center general medical provider are also not covered under the University Program and Facilities Fee, and will incur a charge.\nYour first psychiatric evaluation appointment is scheduled for 60 minutes. It starts very similar to a regular doctor’s appointment. After you’ve checked in at the front desk, a nurse will call you back from the waiting room and will gather your vital signs, review your allergies and medications, and go over your health history. When this is completed, you will then meet with a psychiatric team member. Plan on being asked a lot of questions about your physical health (past or current illnesses, injuries, or surgeries), social history (school, work, hobbies, relationships, gender identity, spiritual beliefs, drug/alcohol use, etc.) and mental health history (any treatment you may have received prior to this appointment). Of course, time will also be spent talking about the concerns that prompted you to schedule the appointment.\nAt the end of the evaluation, the psychiatric provider will talk with you about your symptoms and possible diagnosis, go over your treatment options (which may or may not include medication), answer any questions you may have and make a return appointment.\nAfter you’ve been established with one of our psychiatric providers, follow up appointments are scheduled to see if your symptoms are getting better, if any changes need to be made and to address any additional questions or concerns you may have. How often you will follow up with your psychiatric provider will be determined by you and your provider. Appointments are scheduled on average for 30 minutes but can vary from 20 to 40 minutes.\nThese decisions are based on several criteria such as your symptoms, if you have any other medical conditions, what medications/herbal supplements you are currently taking, what medications you’ve already tried, etc.\nRemember, responses to medication are highly individualized. A medicine that works well for one person (even if a family member) may work very differently for you.\nNo. The goal of treatment is to stabilize brain chemistry and relieve your symptoms so you can feel like yourself again. Think of it like having a broken leg. Putting a cast on your leg doesn’t change who you are. Instead, it stabilizes your leg so you’re more capable to be who you are.\nNo. Treating mental health issues with medication is no different than taking medication for medical conditions like allergies, asthma, infections or diabetes.\nNo. These medications are not addictive.\nHowever, there are some medications in other drug classes used by medical providers that can be habit forming. Your provider will discuss this with you should it be a concern. At any time, feel free to ask questions.\nNo need to worry. Our psychiatric team is more than willing to coordinate care with your psychiatric provider at home. Every effort is made to be sure the transitions between home and school are as seamless as possible.\nThe best option is to have your psychiatric provider at home write a prescription that you can have refilled at a local pharmacy when you’re at school. Unfortunately, members of our psychiatric team cannot refill medications without having an initial evaluation and routine follow up appointments."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:36a92241-f7bd-4128-863a-fbccf4189afa>","<urn:uuid:28b3ef12-aef5-4fb5-9c22-21309f40bb7a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What was established first: MARPOL's electronic record books or environmental insurance regulations under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)?","answer":"RCRA's environmental insurance regulations were established first. RCRA became law in 1976 and included requirements for facilities to demonstrate financial means to respond to pollution events, with insurance being one approved mechanism. In contrast, MARPOL's electronic record books amendments only entered into force on October 1, 2020, making them a much more recent development.","context":["MARPOL Electronic Recordkeeping—Finally a Reality\nLong-awaited amendments to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”) entered into force on October 1, 2020, which expressly permit the use of electronic record books for certain MARPOL-required logs. Although the United States reserved its decision regarding adoption of the amendments when they were approved by the International Maritime Organization (“IMO”) in May 2019, the United States ultimately accepted their adoption in accordance with the tacit acceptance procedure. This is a significant and welcomed development.\nElectronic record books have been the subject of much debate and consideration at the IMO and within the United States for a number of years. During MEPC 74 in May 2019, amendments were approved, revising MARPOL Annexes I, II, V, and VI to allow the use of electronic record books approved by the vessels’ Administration for the Oil Record Book (“ORB”), Cargo Record Book, Garbage Record Book, and Annex VI air pollution prevention recordkeeping requirements. In adopting the amendments, the IMO stated the use of electronic record books “should be encouraged as it may have many benefits for the retention of records by companies, crew, and officers.” These amendments entered into force on October 1, 2020, although a number of flag States believed the previous MARPOL language provided them with the discretion to allow the use of electronic record books and had already approved their use on vessels for some years. Even so, the permissibility of using electronic record books to meet MARPOL requirements is now clear.\nAlong with the MARPOL amendments, Guidelines for the Use of Electronic Record Books under MARPOL (“Guidelines”), MEPC.312(74), were also adopted, which flag States are required to take into account in approving electronic recordkeeping systems. The Guidelines specify software system standards, such as ability to automatically record revisions and attempts to manipulate data, role-based access control, and data recovery and power source standards that must be considered. To accommodate port State inspections, the Guidelines also state that systems should be capable of printing out entries, pages, or the entire log, along with the name of the person that made each entry, a record of amendments, date and time of printing, page counts, and the name and version of the system.\nAlthough the United States has moved toward electronic recordkeeping in a number of areas, such as with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) Vessel General Permit, the United States had not been supportive of transitioning MARPOL records to electronic systems. When the MARPOL amendments to allow electronic recordkeeping were approved, the United States reserved its position on their adoption and stridently spoke against electronic record books. The United States asserted that “the use of electronic record books should only be permitted after mandatory standards for electronic record books are adopted and incorporated into the text of MARPOL…without doing so, we would be reducing the level of care and environmental protection currently provided in MARPOL.”\nIn the days preceding the amendments taking effect, discussion was still ongoing in the United States with respect to whether the amendments should be allowed to take effect or whether the United States would file a formal objection. We speculate that the U.S. Department of Justice, which relies heavily on errors and omissions in handwritten paper record books for criminal enforcement actions, remained concerned about the prosecutorial value of and challenges associated with electronic records. Meanwhile, the U.S. Coast Guard (“USCG”), the EPA, and numerous other federal agencies have been moving towards electronic recordkeeping for many years, valuing the improved efficiency and ability for vessel owners and operators to maintain real-time oversight of vessel operations. It was not until the last hours prior to entry into force that the United States determined it would accept the amendments.\nShortly thereafter, the USCG published guidance indicating that Port State Control Officers and Marine Inspectors would begin examining electronic records books in a similar manner as written record books to ensure compliance with MARPOL and the Guidelines. As such, vessel owners/operators must be prepared to provide the Port State Control Officers and Marine Inspectors with written confirmation from the flag State that the electronic system meets the criteria provided in the Guidelines.\nWe anticipate that more detailed Port State Control guidance may be forthcoming, including in connection with approving electronic record keeping systems for U.S.-flag vessels. Additionally, some amendments to U.S. Coast Guard regulations may also be required to remove requirements for paper records and set new requirements related to electronic recordkeeping, but this is not envisioned to occur anywhere in the near term.\nThe United States’ acceptance of the MARPOL amendments regarding electronic recordkeeping is a significant and positive development and will allow shipowners and operators the opportunity for improved efficiency and oversight. However, because the USCG is likely to scrutinize electronic records, owners and operators must be vigilant and should thus strictly comply with their flag States’ and IMO’s guidance on electronic record keeping, train their crew members, and closely monitor the implementation of an electronic record keeping program to help avoid MARPOL missteps.\nThis article was first published as a Blank Rome Maritime client advisory on October 1, 2020.\nThis article is one in a series of articles written for Blank Rome's MAINBRACE: December 2020 edition.","Environmental insurance is a $4.5 Billion industry with many opportunities. Every account has a pollution exposure. By discussing environmental products that can effectively address these exposures, you will provide broader coverage for your client, highlight your agency’s professionalism, help secure future renewals, and generate more revenue on your accounts.\nWhat is Environmental Insurance?\nEnvironmental insurance (also known as pollution insurance or pollution coverage) is a type of business insurance product that is designed to respond to claims for loss or damage resulting from unexpected releases of pollutants. These losses or damages typically arise in the form of claims against insureds for bodily injury, property damage, cleanup costs, and business interruption. Insureds often think they have coverage for pollution releases under their General Liability and Property policies, however, in our experience, those policies either restrict coverage by having time-element clauses, exclude coverage for certain pollutants altogether, or do not provide enough limits to investigate a pollution-related claim, let alone provide enough limits to adequately respond to a claim or clean up a pollution condition.\nThe State of the Environmental Insurance Market\nThere are currently approximately fifty insurance companies offering environmental insurance products. The environmental market capacity is in the range of $4 billion. In the broadest sense, environmental insurance products can be categorized as follows:\n- Products for site owners and operators\n- Products for contractors and professionals\n- Products for storage tanks\nInsurers have developed products within these categories to support specific sectors, situations, and job sites/projects. Examples of sector-specific policies include policies for healthcare facilities, educational facilities, and real estate entities. Examples of policies designed to respond to specific situations include environmental policies over indemnifications, policies that facilitate transactions, policies that are excess over other environmental carrier forms in order to obtain additional limits, and policies that consist of combined General Liability and environmental forms with the goal of reducing coverage gaps, overlaps, and coverage disputes. Examples of job site/project policies include specific types of project policies such as restoration or green projects, and practice policies that can provide coverage for any project a contractor or professional works on during the year.\nTypes of Environmental Insurance Products\n- Site Owner/Operator policies: also known as Site Pollution Policies (SPP), Environmental Impairment Liability Policies (EIL), and Pollution Legal Liability Policies (PLL)\no Stand Alone Site Owner/Operator Policies\no Combined General Liability and Site Owner/Operator policies\n- Contractor Pollution Liability policies: also known as CPL policies\no Stand Alone Contractor Pollution Liability Policies\no Combined Contractor Pollution Liability and Professional Liability Policies\no Combined General Liability/Contractor Pollution Liability/Professional Liability Policies\n- Storage Tank policies\nSignificant Environmental Regulations That Have Environmental Liability Provisions\nThere are numerous environmental regulations with which companies must comply. Not complying with these regulations could result in fines, penalties, and legal actions by environmental regulators or third parties. Some of the most notable ones that include environmental liability provisions are:\n1970: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) formed. Clean Air Act (CAA) becomes a law that regulates air emissions from stationary and mobile sources as a means to protect the public and regulate hazardous air pollutants. The impetus for this is widely believed to have been the beginning of the Earth Day movement and public pressure for Congress to adopt regulations to control air emissions.\n1972: Clean Water Act (CWA) becomes a law that regulates pollutant discharges into the waters of the United States and the quality standards of surface waters. The impetus for this is believed to have been reports and studies that were done on various populations with respect to water quality such as fishing industry losses in the Chesapeake Bay, mercury levels in fish, and drinking water quality. It was determined that uncontrolled dumping was taking place into waterways which was compromising water quality throughout the United States.\n1976: Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) becomes a law. It provides a regulatory scheme for the generation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. It imposes requirements on facilities that conduct these activities to show that they have the financial means to respond to a pollution event if one occurs at their facility through state approved mechanisms, insurance typically being one of them. These mechanisms are used to show that a facility has the financial means to respond to third party claims and conduct cleanup operations related to pollution events. RCRA also imposes rules for certain storage tank owners/operators that include requirements for them to have proof of financial means to respond to pollution releases from storage tanks.\n1980: Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA aka Superfund) Enacted in response to environmental incidents such as Love Canal and Times Beach. It provides for a Federal fund to clean up spills or releases of pollutants at hazardous waste sites. There are three types of liability provisions within CERCLA as follows:\n1) Strict liability for cleanup costs on past and present owners and operators of sites, transporters to sites and any party that generated hazardous materials at a site. On a state level, laws have been enacted which require that certain properties be investigated in order for landowners and prospective purchasers to obtain relief from CERCLA liability.\n2) Administrative orders or judicial injunctions to stop the actual or threatened release of hazardous substances at a site.\n3) Liability on responsible parties for “damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources”.\nGlossary of Terms\nFor an explanation of common environmental insurance terms and acronyms, please visit our glossary.\n- Top 5 Coverages to Watch For in an Environmental Policy\n- Products Pollution Liability Not Just for Manufacturers\n- Important Coverages to Consider When Moving an Environmental Insurance Account\n- Understanding Key Environmental Terms\n- Environmental Insurance and Craft Beer: Similar Industries and Buyer Behavior\n- Working with an Environmental Specialist"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:11a653d1-0f77-49f2-8959-ce52facd838a>","<urn:uuid:8564d810-6dcf-48ba-95c1-ea2797dde445>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Cuál es el método reverse sear para cocinar filet mignon, and what is the typical serving size and cost of this cut?","answer":"The reverse sear method involves cooking filet mignon at a low temperature (225-275°F) in the oven first, followed by a quick high-heat sear to create a perfect crust. The process includes three main steps: slow cooking, resting for 5-10 minutes, and final searing for 1-2 minutes per side. Regarding serving size and cost, filet mignon is typically served as individual portions and should be chosen at around 1.5 to 2 inches thick. It is considered the most expensive steak cut, with Choice-grade tenderloin steaks costing about $15 or more per pound.","context":["When it comes to cooking filet mignon, achieving a perfect tender and juicy result can be a challenge. However, the reverse sear method has emerged as an efficient way to ensure the ideal texture and consistency throughout this prized cut of beef. This article will introduce you to the process of reverse searing a filet mignon, providing tips to help you achieve perfectly cooked steaks every time.\nReverse searing is an innovative cooking technique that starts by cooking the meat at a low temperature in the oven, followed by finishing it on the stovetop or grill for a quick, high-temperature sear. This technique promotes even cooking, resulting in a tender, juicy, and full of flavor filet mignon. Moreover, it addresses the common issue of overcooked edges on the steak, as seen traditional searing methods.\nAlthough this method may sound intimidating, it is quite simple to execute and can elevate your home-cooked filet mignon to a gourmet level. In addition, the reverse sear technique can be adapted to various cooking appliances, making it accessible to any home cook. Throughout this article, we will explore the essential steps of reverse searing a filet mignon and providing you with the information needed to master this satisfying culinary technique.\nWhat is Reverse Sear Method?\nThe reverse sear method is a cooking technique that involves cooking a piece of meat, such as filet mignon, at a low temperature first before giving it a high-heat sear to create a perfectly cooked center and an appealing crust. This method allows for a more even distribution of heat throughout the meat, ensuring a uniform doneness and a tender, juicy result.\nHere are the basic steps involved in the reverse sear method:\n- Slow and Low: Begin by cooking the meat in an oven, set to a low temperature, typically around 225-275°F (107-135°C). This low-heat cooking will slowly raise the internal temperature of the meat, ensuring even cooking.\n- Resting: Once the meat has reached its desired internal temperature, remove it from the oven and let it rest for about 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute within the meat, making it more flavorful and tender.\n- Searing: Finally, sear the meat quickly over high heat, either in a hot skillet, grill, or broiler for 1-2 minutes per side. This imparts a flavorful crust and adds a visually appealing, browned exterior.\nThe reverse sear method is ideal for thicker cuts of meat, such as filet mignon, as thinner cuts may become overcooked during the low-heat phase. The technique is particularly beneficial for filet mignon due to its minimal fat content, which can leave the meat dry if not cooked properly.\nBenefits of Reverse Searing Filet Mignon\nReverse searing filet mignon offers various advantages over traditional cooking methods. Not only does this process lead to a tender and juicy steak, but it also provides a consistent and controlled cooking experience. Here are some benefits worth considering.\n1. Even doneness: With the reverse sear technique, the filet mignon is cooked more evenly from edge to edge. This results in less gray or overcooked areas, allowing better preservation of the steak’s natural juices, flavor, and tenderness.\n2. Improved temperature control: Reverse searing involves slow cooking the steak at a low temperature before searing it. This allows for precise internal temperature control, ensuring that the filet mignon reaches your desired level of doneness consistently.\n3. Better crust development: By cooking the steak at a low temperature initially, moisture on the surface evaporates. This leads to a drier surface for searing, facilitating the Maillard reaction and producing a delectable, caramelized crust.\n4. Less risk of overcooking: Traditional methods, like pan-searing or grilling, can easily overcook a filet mignon due to the high heat. Reverse searing offers more control over the cooking process, minimizing the risk of overcooking and making it more forgiving for beginners.\nBy employing the reverse sear method, you can enjoy a filet mignon that boasts an evenly cooked, tender texture, and a beautifully developed crust, elevating your culinary experience.\nTools You Will Need\nTo produce the perfect reverse sear filet mignon, having the right tools on hand is essential. The tools listed below are commonly found in most kitchens and will help ensure a successful cooking experience.\n- Thick, quality cut of filet mignon: A well-trimmed filet mignon, 1.5 to 2 inches thick, is crucial in the reverse sear method.\n- Oven and oven-safe pan: Choose an oven-safe pan or baking sheet, preferably with a wire rack, which allows for even heating around the filet.\n- Meat thermometer: A reliable meat thermometer will help you monitor the internal temperature of your filet mignon for accurate cooking.\n- Skillet: Use a heavy, quality skillet, ideally with high heat capacity, such as cast iron, for a proper sear.\n- Tongs: Tongs are essential for turning the filet mignon without piercing the meat, preserving its juiciness.\n- Oil and butter: A combination of high-heat oil and butter enhances the searing process and adds flavor to the filet.\nWith these tools in place, you’ll be fully prepared to embark on creating a beautifully prepared reverse sear filet mignon.\nStep-by-Step Process for Reverse Searing Filet Mignon\nReverse searing filet mignon is a cooking technique that can yield incredible results. Follow these steps to achieve a perfectly cooked steak every time.\n1. Preparing the Filet Mignon:\n- Bring the filet mignon to room temperature by removing it from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before cooking.\n- Pat the steak dry with paper towels to remove moisture, which helps to achieve a better sear.\n- Season the steak generously on all sides with salt and pepper.\n2. Preheat the Oven:\nSet your oven to a low temperature (around 200-250°F, or 93-121°C) and let it preheat. The low and slow cooking will allow the steak to cook evenly.\nPlace the seasoned filet mignon on a wire rack above a baking sheet. This will help air circulate around the meat for even cooking. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the steak and bake until the internal temperature reaches 125°F (51°C) for medium-rare or 135°F (57°C) for medium.\nRemove the filet mignon from the oven and let it rest for 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices inside the steak to redistribute, ensuring a moist and tender result.\n- Preheat a heavy skillet or cast-iron pan over high heat. Add a small amount of oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable oil.\n- Once the oil is hot and shimmering, carefully lower the steak into the pan. Sear each side for 1-2 minutes or until a rich, brown crust forms.\n- While searing, you can also add some aromatics to the pan, such as garlic or fresh herbs, to infuse the steak with extra flavor.\nWith these steps, you’ll have a perfectly reverse-seared filet mignon that is sure to impress your guests.\nTips and Tricks\nChoosing the right cut of meat is crucial for a perfect reverse sear filet mignon. Opt for a thick cut of filet mignon, around 1.5-2 inches thick, which will allow for an even cook at a low temperature.\nInvest in a quality instant-read thermometer to accurately monitor the internal temperature of your filet mignon during the cooking process. This will help you achieve the desired level of doneness.\nSeason your filet mignon generously with salt and pepper to enhance the flavor. For an extra touch, consider adding a herb or spice rub, but avoid any with sugars, as they can burn during the searing process.\nLet your filet mignon come to room temperature before cooking. This will help the meat cook evenly and prevent the exterior from overcooking. Simply remove the filet from the refrigerator about 30 minutes prior to cooking.\nTo elevate your reverse sear filet mignon, choose a high-quality cooking fat like clarified butter or high smoke-point oil, such as avocado or grapeseed oil, for searing.\nLastly, don’t forget to let your filet mignon rest for 5-10 minutes after searing. This will allow the juices to redistribute and create a tender, flavorful final result.\nReverse sear filet mignon is a decadent and impressive dish on its own, but pairing it with complementary side dishes can elevate your dining experience even further. Here are a few serving suggestions:\n- Garlic Mashed Potatoes: Creamy and flavorful, these potatoes blend beautifully with the rich flavors of the filet mignon.\n- Grilled Asparagus: Grilled to perfection, asparagus provides a crispy and healthy vegetable option that complements the tender steak.\n- Red Wine Reduction Sauce: Drizzle a red wine reduction sauce over your filet mignon for an extra layer of depth and flavor.\n- Fresh Garden Salad: Balance the richness of the filet with a light and refreshing salad, dressed in a simple vinaigrette.\nYou may also consider a few different methods to present your reverse sear filet mignon:\n|Serve the entire filet mignon on a plate, allowing guests to cut their own slices.\n|Slices the filet mignon and fan the pieces out on the plate, showcasing the beautiful cooked interior.\n|Steak with Herb Butter\n|Top the filet mignon with a pat of herb butter, which will melt over the steak and enhance its flavor.\nFeel free to mix and match these serving suggestions to create a memorable meal for your guests.\nThe reverse sear method for cooking filet mignon is an excellent technique, offering consistent results and tender, juicy steaks. By cooking at a low temperature and finishing with a quick sear, the meat retains its moisture and flavor.\nWhen using this method, it is crucial to:\n- Preheat the oven to the appropriate temperature\n- Monitor the internal temperature with a meat thermometer\n- Allow the steak to rest before searing\nIn summary, mastering the reverse sear technique for filet mignon can elevate your home-cooked steak dinners, impressing family and friends alike. Happy cooking!","Known in some parts of the country as Delmonico steak, these bone-in or boneless steaks are cut from the rib section. Rib eyes are juicy, rich and very tender.\nServing size and cost: Boneless rib eyes are typically 3/4 to 1 inch thick, while bone-in versions are about 1-1/2 inches. Thinner rib eyes serve one, while thicker steaks feed two. Rib eyes are the second most costly steak behind the tenderloin.\nGrilling tip: These heavily marbled steaks are prone to flare-ups on the grill; medium heat and a watchful eye is the key to a well-grilled rib eye. Rib eye steaks can withstand longer grilling and can be cooked medium to well-done.\nPeppered Ribeye Steaks Recipe\nConsidered the queen of steaks, this boneless loin cut is commonly called filet mignon. It's the most tender of steaks and boasts fine marbling. Although lean, its mild buttery flavor has made it popular.\nChoice-grade tenderloin steaks are the most expensive steak, but there is no waste on edge fat or bone.\nServing size and cost: Their small size makes tenderloin ideal for individual servings. Choose filets that are around 1-1/2 to 2 inches thick. Choice-grade tenderloin steaks are about $15 or more a pound.\nGrilling tip: Since tenderloins have little fat, they're best grilled medium-rare to medium.\nSeasoned Steaks with Horseradish Cream Recipe\nWhen shopping for sirloin, choose those labeled top sirloin, indicating that it is cut from the loin. Other steaks labeled as sirloin, such as petite sirloin or sirloin tip steak, are less tender and best when marinated before grilling.\nLightly marbled sirloin steaks are lean and have a good chew, but are less moist than heavily marbled steaks.\nServing size and cost: Usually sold boneless from 1 to 2 inches thick, sirloins are intended to serve three to six people. As the least expensive of the tender steaks, sirloins are a great choice for families.\nGrilling tip: When grilling a thick sirloin, a two-level fire assures steaks cooked past medium will remain moist.\nGrilled Steaks with Cilantro Sauce Recipe\nPorterhouse and T-Bone Steaks\nWith their characteristic \"T\"-shaped bone, these cuts are actually two steaks in one. The longer narrow section is top loin steak and the smaller is tenderloin. The porterhouse, often called the \"king\" of steaks because of its size, has a larger rounder tenderloin section than the T-bone.\nServing size and cost: These steaks may be found from 3/4 to 2 inches thick, with 3/4-inch T-bones being a generous individual serving. Porterhouses around 2 inches thick are intended to serve two to three people. And cost…they're middle-of-the-road.\nGrilling tip: Grill thick porterhouse steaks over a two-level fire—a hot zone for searing, and a medium-heat zone for the remainder of the cooking. Porterhouse and T-bone steaks can be grilled from medium-rare to well-done.\nGarlic-Rubbed T-Bones with Burgundy Mushrooms Recipe\nTop Loin Steaks\nStrip, New York strip, Kansas City strip and club steak…this hearty steak goes by many names. No matter what it's called, you can't miss with this flavorful well-marbled steak and its firm chewy texture. Cut from the loin, it's available bone-in or boneless.\nServing size and cost: Top loin steaks may be cut from 3/4 to 2 inches thick; the thinner 3/4 to 1-inch cuts are better suited for single servings. While their price per pound may be more expensive than a porterhouse or T-bone, boneless strips are a better value since you aren't paying for the bone.\nGrilling tip: Because they're fairly lean, strip steaks are great grilled medium-rare to medium.\nTangy Sirloin Strips Recipe\nIts characteristic horizontal grain easily identifies this steak. Though most think of flank steak as a marinating steak, choice-grade flank grills well when seasoned. Flank steak has a rich beefy flavor and a moderate chew.\nServing size and cost: Flank steaks are 1 to 1-1/2 pounds and serve four to six people. Flank steaks are fairly economical; they cost a little more than sirloin steak.\nGrilling tip: The key to tender moist flank steak is grilling to medium-rare or medium, and thinly slicing 1/4-inch thick across the grain.\nLoaded Flank Steak Recipe"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:619ec99d-5f19-45b3-9473-806f6c88c413>","<urn:uuid:35055d14-5f7c-431e-b8c9-8978abd4d50d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did the size and composition of Spartacus' rebel army compare to Hannibal's forces during their respective conflicts with Rome?","answer":"Spartacus' army grew from 70 escaped slaves to over 65,000 men, with some estimates reaching 125,000. His forces included ex-slaves, shepherds, and herdsmen from the area. In contrast, Hannibal began his campaign with 50,000 infantry, 9,000 cavalry, and 37 war elephants. After crossing the Alps, his force was reduced to 26,000 men but grew again with recruited Gallic warriors. At the Battle of Trebia, Hannibal commanded 28,000 infantry, 10,000 cavalry, and 37 war elephants, though he lost almost all his elephants to frostbite after the battle.","context":["Spartacus was a Thracian gladiator who, along with the Gauls Crixus, Gannicus, Castus and Oenomaus, was one of the escaped slave leaders in the Third Servile War, a major slave uprising against the Roman Republic. Take a look below for 30 more fascinating and interesting facts about Spartacus.\n1. Little is known about Spartacus beyond the events of the war, and surviving historical accounts are sometimes contradictory and may not always be reliable.\n2. All historical sources agree that he was a former gladiator and an accomplished military leader.\n3. The Greek essayist Plutarch describes Spartacus as, “a Thracian of Nomadic stock,” in a possible reference to the Maedi tribe.\n4. Appian says he was, “a Thracian by birth, who had once served as a soldier with the Romans, but had since been a prisoner and sold for a gladiator.”\n5. Florus described him as one, “who, from a Thracian mercenary, had become a Roman soldier, that had deserted and became enslaved, and afterward, from consideration of his strength, a gladiator.”\n6. Plutarch also writes that Spartacus’ wife, a prophetess of the Maedi tribe, was enslaved with him.\n7. According to Appian, a Roman historian but Greek by birth, Spartacus was born in Thrace but once served as a soldier of Rome. He was later sold into slavery, from where he was sold into a gladiator school.\n8. In 73 BCE, Spartacus along with 70 other slaves receiving gladiator training plotted an escape from captivity. They grabbed some kitchen utensils and fought the Iudus guards.\n9. During their escape, Spartacus and some other slaves managed to capture a wagon that was full of weapons and armor meant for gladiators. Though the weapons weren’t military issue, the escaped slaves managed to use the weapons to defeat a small force that was trying to capture them.\n10. Spartacus was initially a member of the Roman Army. However, he didn’t like not being able to have control of his own life, so he fled the army in order to be a free man.\n11. Some historians argue that Spartacus was actually a Roman auxiliary officer before escaping, which would mean that he originally volunteered for service.\n12. After going AWOL, Spartacus was captured and forced into slavery as punishment for his desertion.\n13. Spartacus was purchased by a man named Lentulus Batiatus, who was the one that enrolled him in the gladiator school in Capua, which Batiatus just so happened to own.\n14. As a gladiator, Spartacus was trained in the role of a “murmillo,” a heavyweight gladiator.\n15. Murmillos fought with a broadsword up to 18 inches in length, and used a large shield called a scutum in defense. They also fought bare chested and barefooted.\n16. When Spartacus and the other slaves escaped, they traveled south, fighting to free other slaves and recruiting them to their side.\n17. Accounts say that three men were chosen as leaders of the rebelling slaves: Spartacus, Crixus and Oenomaus.\n18. Originally comprised of only 70 escapees, the rebellion army population quickly skyrocketed to over 65,000 men. Some estimates even put the number at around 125,000 men.\n19. While the escapee forces were originally comprised mostly of ex-slaves, Spartacus also allowed many of the shepherds and herdsmen of the area to join his army.\n20. Spartacus wasn’t the first slave to rebel, and his slave army wasn’t the first that Rome attempted to put down. The First and Second Servile War both took place in Sicily, with the second resulting in a four year fight between the slaves and Rome. However, Spartacus’ rebel army was bigger and more organized than the groups in previous wars.\n21. Spartacus’ revolt led to a fear of slaves. This fear spread throughout Rome, as the first two Servile Wars had already taken their toll on the population.\n22. Under Spartacus’ leadership, the rebel army was able to defeat nine separate Roman armies during the war by causing chaos in the countryside and aggressively attacking the Roman armies who underestimated the slaves’ capacity and capabilities.\n23. Part of the reason why Spartacus was so successful in fighting the Roman armies was because Rome was already engaged in two other wars at the same time.\n24. During the war, Spartacus and his right hand man, Crixus, split up. Some believe that it was a strategic plan by the leader, and some believe that Crixus wanted to pillage the Roman countryside on their way to Rome.\n25. After splitting up, Crixus and his followers were attacked and defeated by the Roman army. Upon hearing of Crixus’ death, Spartacus took revenge by executing 300 of his Roman captives.\n26. Before he sacrificed the Romans, Spartacus held a mock gladiator game, pitting the Roman soldiers against each other in a fight to the death.\n27. After their escape from the gladiator school, Spartacus’ wife woke up one morning and saw Spartacus sleeping with a serpent wrapped up around his head. She perceived this as a sign of, “a tremendous and fearsome power that would bring him to an unfortunate end.”\n28. Before the final battle of the war, the Battle of the Silarus River, Spartacus made a bold move to rile up his troops. He brought his horse before his men and killed it, declaring that if they won the battle, he would have new horses to choose from, but if they lost, he wouldn’t need one.\n29. Spartacus died on the battlefield at the banks of the Silarus river. However, some sources say that his body was never recovered.\n30. Spartacus’ objectives for inciting the war are debated. Nothing that he did suggested that he was looking to abolish slavery and most historians seem to think that he just got caught up in plundering during his escape.","The Battle of Trebia.\nUpdated: Jul 21\nOn 21 December 218 BCE, the Battle of Trebia was fought between the Carthaginians under Hannibal Barca and the Romans under Sempronius Longus during the Second Punic War.\nWhy did it happen?\nIn 221 BCE, Hannibal Barca assumed command of Carthaginian forces in Spain and set about his plans for the invasion of Italy. In 219 BCE, Hannibal besieged the pro-Roman town of Saguntum, effectively declaring war on Rome. In June 218 BCE, Hannibal set out from Spain with a force comprised of 50,000 infantry, 9,000 cavalry and 37 war elephants to cross over the Alps into Italy. This was done to achieve surprise and bypass Roman garrisons stationed south of the Alps, in addition to the fact that the Romans had control of the sea. Although Hannibal’s forces were reduced to 26,000 men by the time he arrived in Italy, he managed to recruit Gallic warriors to his cause after defeating the Romans in a cavalry skirmish at the Ticinus River. A few weeks later in December, Hannibal faced a major Roman army under Sempronius Longus across the Trebia river.\nWho was involved?\nThe Carthaginian army at Trebia comprised of 28,000 infantry, 10,000 cavalry and 37 war elephants. Hannibal’s plan was to send a force of Numidian cavalry to harass the Roman camp and lure the Roman army across the freezing Trebia river where it could be engaged in a set-piece battle. Hannibal’s main army would consist of heavy infantry in the centre, light infantry in the vanguard while the cavalry and war elephants would be arranged on the flanks. In addition, Mago Barca would be hidden nearby with 2,000 troops ready to attack the Roman army in the rear. The Roman army consisted of 36,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry.\nAt dawn on 21 December, Hannibal sent his Numidian cavalry to harass the Roman camp with missile fire before retreating across the Trebia River. This prompted Sempronius Longus to send his army across the river and arrange itself in three lines with cavalry on the wings. As the Roman infantry advanced, it forced the Carthaginian light infantry to withdraw behind the Carthaginian heavy infantry which then engaged the Roman infantry in hand-to-hand combat. At the same time, the Carthaginian cavalry and war elephants attacked the Roman cavalry and routed them before falling upon the flanks of the Roman infantry. Once this had happened, the order was given for Mago Barca to emerge from the nearby woods and attack the Romans in the rear, effectively surrounding them. While most of the Roman army was butchered, Sempronius Longus and 10,000 legionaries managed to hack their way through the Carthaginian army and escape to the nearby town of Piacenza. While Roman casualties numbered 30,000 killed, Carthaginian losses numbered about 5,000 men.\nWhat changed as a result?\nThe Battle of Trebia was a victory for the Carthaginians. Not only did it open the rest of Italy to Hannibal, but it also demonstrated his tactical genius, particularly his trademark double envelopment manoeuvre, that would confound the Romans again at the Battle of Cannae. As Patrick N. Hunt analysed,\n“Hannibal won his first Italian victory by careful strategy and thoughtful preparation against a Roman army that outnumbered him. He exploited Roman weaknesses in leadership. He also exploited weakness in Roman tactics, especially the outmatched Roman cavalry and Roman overdependence on slow infantry, as well as the use of raw legions. Hannibal used nature fully to his advantage. Having found a way to defeat Rome, he would use all of these strategies again (Hunt, 2017, p.97).\nFollowing the battle, Hannibal lost all but one of his elephants to frostbite. In addition, after crossing the Arno Marshes during the march into Etruria, Hannibal contracted an eye infection that caused him to lose sight in one eye. Nevertheless, Trebia brought Gallic allies to his standard and would mark the beginning of his sixteen-year-long campaign against Rome.\nGrant, R.G. 1001 Battles That Changed the Course of History.

{"question":"How do complications from CPR differ between thin adults and children?","answer":"In thin adults with low BMI (around 20), excessive force during CPR can lead to isolated acute traumatic aortic injury through mechanisms like the osseous pinch and water-hammer effect, as demonstrated in the case of a 58-year-old woman with BMI 19.4.

Review of literature reveals two cases of aortic injury in the setting of CPR. However, these two cases occurred in the setting of significant trauma preceding CPR, multiple CPR providers, and multiple bony injuries including fractures. We propose acute traumatic aortic injury occurred via the osseous pinch and water-hammer effect because of chest compression of excessive force. CPR providers need to be aware that chest compression of excessive force, especially in individuals with low body mass index (BMI), can cause isolated acute traumatic aortic injury.\n| Case Report|| |\nA 58-year-old woman had syncope at home and fell. Her husband is a police officer by profession, trained in emergency medical services, found her pulseless and started CPR. Resuscitation was successful, and patient arrived to hospital service conscious. She has a known history of pulmonary embolism and was on warfarin. Her Crohn's disease had a recent flare-up with persistent diarrhea for the preceding days. She was hypokalemic with potassium of 2.8 mEq/L and her QTc was 528 ms.\nWorkup included spiral computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography which demonstrated new proximal descending aortic [Figure 1]a,[Figure 1]c, and [Figure 1]e, white arrows] and aortic root [Figure 1]b and [Figure 1]d, white arrows] mural injuries compared to prior CT 2 years ago. She most likely had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation precipitated in the setting of an acquired long QT induced by hypokalemia. She was treated conservatively, hypokalemia corrected which normalized her QTc, and was safely discharged without surgical intervention. Follow-up CT scan 6 months later demonstrated resolution of aortic injuries [Figure 1]f.\n|Figure 1: (a and b) Transverse computed tomography arteriogram images following aortic injury.

The 2010 guidelines represent a change from previous guidelines recommending a compression depth of 1.5–2 inches. The most recent guidelines do not recommend an upper limit of chest compression depth.\nChest compressions are known to cause a variety of complications including those related to the ribs, thoracic and abdominal viscera, and cardiac and vascular structures. However, aortic injuries following chest compressions are rare. Aortic injury following CPR has been described in two recent cases. The first patient wan an 86-year-old female who fell ten steps sustained hemothorax and multiple rib fractures. She needed CPR for acute cardiovascular decompensation, and a thoracic aortic dissection was seen on transesophageal echocardiogram. The other patient, a 71-year-old female, had multiple cardiac arrests, CPR multiple times, thrombolytic therapy, and use of an automated chest compression device. She developed multiple injuries that included aortic intramural hematoma, hepatic pseudoaneurysm, several rib fractures, and liver lacerations.\nOur patient is distinct in that there was no significant deceleration injury, simple CPR of 3 min duration, no rib fractures, and yet she developed an isolated aortic intramural injury. Aortic injuries have an incidence of 5–10 patients/1,000,000 population in the United States, most commonly affecting male patients aged 50–70 years. Acute traumatic aortic injury occurs via a variety of mechanisms. Rapid deceleration is the most frequently described mechanism; however, the incidence of isolated deceleration mechanism appears to be rare. Alternative mechanisms include (a) compression and upward motion of the heart placing torsion and shearing stress on the aorta and (b) lateral deforming forces to the chest can cause anterior displacement of the heart and sheering forces at the isthmus. Two additional mechanisms, the first known as the osseous pinch can cause injury via compression of the aorta between the spine and anterior chest wall, and the second mechanism is known as the water-hammer effect. The water-hammer effect occurs as a result of increased intravascular pressure which can exceed 2000 mmHg following direct pressure of the aorta which has been known to cause transverse tears at the isthmus and forces can travel retrograde resulting in aortic root injuries.,\nThe most likely mechanisms of injury occurred via the osseous pinch and the water-hammer effect. In our patient, excessive force was transmitted in an anterior to posterior direction. The osseous pinch occurred via anterior chest wall compressing the aorta along the isthmus and ligamentum arteriosum [Figure 1]f, black arrows] and direct compression of the spine [Figure 1]a and [Figure 1]c, black arrows]. In addition, the water-hammer effect occurred likely due to the direct compression of the aorta between the chest wall and spine causing a transverse tear at the isthmus and retrograde aortic root injury [Figure 1]a and [Figure 1]b.\nOur patient is 5´4˝ and 51.3 kg with a BMI of 19.4. Force required for chest compression will be very different for a patient with a BMI around 20 versus a patient with a BMI around 40. The CPR guidelines recommend 2 inches of chest compression which is a very appropriate recommendation. In a healthy, thin patient, such as ours special care needs to be taken to avoid overuse of force to prevent acute traumatic aortic injuries.\nFinancial support and sponsorship\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\n| References|| |\nField JM, Hazinski MF, Sayre MR, Chameides L, Schexnayder SM, Hemphill R, et al.\nPart 1: executive summary: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care.

CPR helps deliver oxygen rich blood to the body tissue when the body is not able to do this on its own.\nReasons for Procedure TOP\nCPR is given to a child who is not breathing. Reasons for this may include:\nThe outcome will depend on the cause and how soon effective CPR was initiated. Many are unable to regain a normal heartbeat after it has stopped.\nPossible Complications TOP\nIt is possible that ribs will fracture or break during chest compressions. Other complications, like a puncture of a lung, are also possible.\nPeople with weakened bones have a higher risk of fractures from CPR. However, there is greater risk of death if CPR is delayed or not done correctly.\nWhat to Do TOP\nPrior to Procedure\nWhen you see a child suddenly collapse, or find a child unconscious on the ground, immediately check to see if they are responsive. Tap the child and ask: “Are you OK?” If the child is unresponsive, follow these steps:\nHow Long Will It Take?\nThe length of time for CPR depends on the underlying causes and response time of medical help.\nWill It Hurt the Child? TOP\nThe child is unconscious when CPR is given. The procedure does not hurt. Some children may complain of soreness in the chest after regaining consciousness.\nPost-procedure Care TOP\nThe emergency team will take over care when they arrive.\nChildren will need to be taken to the hospital for evaluation following CPR.\nCall for Help TOP\nIf a child is unresponsive and someone is with you, have that person call for emergency medical services right away. If you are alone, do CPR for about 2 minutes before calling for medical help.\nCaring for Kids—Canadian Paediatric Society\nHeart and Stroke Foundation of Canada\n2005 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and emergency cardiovascular care (ECC) of pediatric and neonatal patients: pediatric basic life support.

Despite centuries of external pressure from evolving migrant caravans, zealous political figures, and major changes in Spanish society itself, the tradition of dancing persists. Spain is only about twice the size of Oregon, but it packs quite a punch of cultural delight and beauty within its relatively small borders. This vibrant country keeps its culture alive by embracing the glory, history, and living story of Spanish dance.\nHistory of Spanish Dances\nSpanish dances reflect the tumultuous history of Spain itself. Even before the 15th century, regional dances and music were an integral part of life and culture for the people of Spain. Although many of these dances have ritualistic and war-related origins, the Spaniards’ creative spark transformed Spanish dance. They pushed it into a new realm of free-flowing movements that developed into the dances we see today. By the 20th century, Francisco Franco’s dictatorship threatened the traditional dances of Spain. His desire to streamline the culture led to the ban of regional dances and their music for 35 years. After his death, the people of Spain filled the air with traditional music and danced with every ounce of pride they felt for the creativity, movement, and sound that had once defined their region.\nTypes of Spanish Dance\nAt one point, there were over 200 traditional and distinct Spanish dances. Although there are not as many today, we can still see the reflection of those dances in modern interpretations. The current well-known Spanish dances are combinations of those older choreographies that embody the spirit of the country and its people.\nThe Jota is a typical dance from northern Spain, which most likely originated in Aragón. It has spread to many different regions in the country where distinct groups have put their own touches on the dance. It features a quick-paced tempo as couples dance with their hands raised above their heads. They sometimes play castanets, which are percussion instruments made of two ivory or hardwood shells joined on one side by a cord and held within the palms of the hand. Other times they simply move their hands as if they had castanets.\nMusic: Guitars, bandurrias, lutes, dulzaina, and drums accompany the Castilian style of the Jota. The Galicians, though, use bagpipes, drums, and bombos, a type of bass drum.\nCostumes: Interpreters of the Jota dress in regional costumes that reflect the history of their particular people group.\nWatch the Jota here!\nIn what’s considered the “national dance” of Catalonia, multiple couples dance in circles using short, bouncy steps to move back and forth. While they start small, the circles grow bigger as more dancers participate, which acts as an artistic expression of unity.\nMusic: To perform the Sardana, the dancers need an 11-member band called a cobla. Various brass and woodwind instruments comprise the cobla, with the flaviol (similar to the flute) leading the group. The tambourine and bass help keep the beat for the dancers.\nCostumes: Interestingly, this dance has no official dress. Because it is used to express unity, the dancers should wear their everyday clothes so they can communicate their desire for harmony between individuals from various walks of life.\nWatch the Sardana here!\nBoth pairs and individuals dance along to the music of the gaita, a form of bagpipe. This traditional and playful dance is typical throughout Galego, Spain. Also known as Galicia, this place is an autonomous Celtic community recognized by the government of Spain. The title of the dance means “millstone” and “miller’s wife” in the community’s regional language of Galician. The measured movements are equivalent to those of a jig or lively folk music in compound meter.\nMusic: Bagpipes and castanets weave together in a fast-paced, lively tempo that energizes the dancers. This prompts loads of jumping, kicking, and improvising in a cheerful, spirited expression of this Celtic art.\nCostumes: The woman wears a special kind of apron, or matelo, along with a vest (chaleco), silk scarf (peno), shirt (camisa), and skirt (falda). The man wears a jacket (chaqueta) and trousers (pantalón). He accessorizes his look with a hat, or monteira, and a silk scarf called a pana de namorar.\nWatch Muñiera here!\nThe zambra is a passionate and sensual “barefoot Flamenco” style dance, known for having different influences. It began as a Moorish dance then morphed into a traditional dance for gypsy weddings. The Spaniards have kept it alive by adapting it to the Spanish dance customs of Flamenco. However, it is highly distinct from contemporary Flamenco. In zambra, the dancer does not wear shoes and the music accompaniment normally features a woman’s voice in deep song.\nMusic: The cante jondo, also known as deep song or Gypsy song, guides the zambra dance with its unique sound. One prominent note provides the foundation for the melody, which is then led by the guitar. Foreign influences have greatly influenced this style of song over the years. It now frequently utilizes the flamenco guitar coupled with Middle Eastern melodies and rhythms. This gives the cante jondo a fuller sound with beautiful highs and a tight low end.\nCostumes: The costume used for Zambra includes a full skirt with ruffled edges and several underskirt layers that can be wielded as a cape. The look is completed with a blouse tied under the bust baring the midriff and a wide hip scarf with or without coins.\nWatch Zambra here!\nThe bolero is one of the oldest and most traditional of the Spanish dances. In contrast to many others, the bolero was primarily a dance for a solo female performer whose hand and arm would move in sync to the accompaniment of castanets. The dance consists of sharp turns and revolutions of the body, with short quick rushes of two or three steps, going to one side, then to the other. The beating steps (called battements) are set in time to the music. When there is a sudden pause in the tune, the dancer stops rigidly in a picturesque pose, bending her body slightly backward, her hands on her hips, and her head erect and defiant.\nMusic: A slow Rumba-style music provides the beat for the bolero. However, many contemporary dancers use any song that has a very slow beginning, a faster-paced middle, and a slow end to it.\nCostume: As a dance, bolero has evolved tremendously over the last two centuries and has tweaked its style along with the various costumes that show off its purpose. Some more traditional female dancers still use large, wide skirts with a frilled bottom and a long-sleeved shirt. Other dancers, though, wear a sleek, tight dress with slits on either side of a long skirt to highlight the various movements of their legs.\nWatch the Bolero here!\nThere is some controversy about the origins of this dance, but it seems likely that it was born in Andalusia, Spain. Although it started as a folk dance, it was later copied and modified in other parts of the world. At one point the fandango was the most famous dance of Spain, where dancers usually “compete” to expand upon one another’s movements. Some movements include snapping their fingers or using castanets. The rhythm signaled by these maneuvers escalates throughout the song, making it a lively, happy Spanish dance.\nMusic: The Spanish both dance and sing the Fandango. Regardless, foot-stomping, hand-clapping (or palmas), castanets, and a clean, crisp guitar sound usually accompany the Fandango.\nCostumes: Like many Spanish dances, the Fandango dancers use a particular costume. The woman’s dress is detailed with black lace, which contrasts the bright color of her short dress. Likewise, the man’s embellished vest reflects the details sewn into the woman’s dress.\nWatch the Fandango here!\nThe Paso doble has a rich history with Spanish and French roots, danced as an embodiment of the Spanish bullfight. This quick one-step dance is a performance of great pride, arrogance and strength displayed by the man, who represents the torero, or bullfighter, while the woman dances around him with graceful curves as she morphs into the bullfighter’s cape that taunts the bull.\nMusic: This dance requires a fast-paced beat as it allows the torero to showcase his strength and prowess in movement. A good example is the traditional music faena, which is played during a bullfighter’s entrance into the ring – the paseo – or during the dramatic moments just before the torero kills the bull. One song in particular, the “Spanish Gypsy Dance,” has become the universal anthem of the Paso Doble.\nCostumes: The costume is central to this dance, as it represents the full story of the bullfight in action. The man often wears a traditional bullfighter’s costume while the woman, acting as the cape, wears a long circular skirt whose sensual fluid movement enhances the drama of the dance.\nWatch Paso Doble here!\nA soulful, passionate dance that originated with the Roma (gypsies) in Andalusia, Spain, flamenco has become internationally known for its emotionally riveting dance moves, hard foot stamping in rhythm with the guitar, and intense outpour of palpable sentiments. Finger snapping, hand clapping, and shouting accompany the song and dance.\nMusic: The core of flamenco lies with the music since the canto, or song, sets the tone of the entire dance. There are three forms of song in flamenco: profoundly tragic and deep, moderately serious, or light in themes of love and nature.\nCostumes: Women wear colorful dresses with multi-layered sleeves and skirts – batas de cola – to add dramatic flair to their movements. Although the women’s costumes are much more elaborate than the men’s, the gentlemen also wear impressive costumes. Their attire mimics the style of the traditional matador’s costume that was worn during bullfights.\nWatch Flamenco here!\nIt Takes Two\nSpanish dances have a clear and present impact on dance all over the world. It continues to evolve and grow into new forms of artistic expression for those who choose to dance and embody them. The dancer and the dance develop a special bond, which is one of the most sacred expressions in the human experience. One dance in particular, Flamenco, has proved to be of such value to Spanish culture itself. In terms of defining and characterizing it, that UNESCO has named it an “Item of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity”.

{"question":"Which provides more environmental benefits between green building infrastructure and electric vehicles in terms of carbon emission reduction?","answer":"Both have significant environmental benefits but serve different roles in emission reduction. Green buildings can reduce 30% of global CO2 emissions through the building sector, which is currently responsible for 40% of global resource consumption. Electric vehicles, while crucial for sustainability, are part of the transportation sector's emission reduction efforts, with projections showing EVs reaching 200 million passenger cars by 2030. Green buildings offer additional benefits like 30-50% water savings and 20-30% energy savings, while EVs primarily focus on reducing transportation emissions through zero-emission vehicles.","context":["Green building method, sometimes known as sustainable building or even green building, is an approach to building and architecture that favors environmentally sound and resource-efficient methods that last through a building’s lifecycle.\nBenefits of green building: 30-50 % water saving, 20-30 % energy saving, conserves natural scarce resources and generates less waste, enhanced air quality and excellent day-lighting and provides healthier space for occupants.\nThe building sector has the greatest potential to reduce CO2 emissions. Currently, 30% of global CO2 emissions and 40% of global resource consumption is a result of constructing buildings.\nOur main goal is to optimise the environmental performance of a building using a life cycle approach, in which the materials and products used in a building are compared and evaluated for best performance at the building level (life cycle assessment).\nOur expertise spans all phases of a project from conceptual design through construction to project hand-over; in addition to continuous operation and maintenance.\nThe built environment has a vast impact on the natural environment, human health, and the economy. By adopting green building strategies, we can maximize both economic and environmental performance. Green construction methods can be integrated into buildings at any stage, from design and construction, to renovation and deconstruction. However, the most significant benefits can be obtained if the design and construction team takes an integrated approach from the earliest stages of a building project.\nGreen infrastructure can be broadly defined as a strategically planned network of high quality natural and semi-natural areas with other environmental features, which is designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services and protect biodiversity in both rural and urban settings.\nGreen infrastructure is effective, economical, and enhances community safety and quality of life.\nMore specifically green infrastructure, being a spatial structure providing benefits from nature to people, aims to enhance nature’s ability to deliver multiple valuable ecosystem goods and services, such as clean air or water.\nExperience has shown that investing in green infrastructure can contribute to the recovery of Europe’s economy by fostering innovative approaches and creating new green businesses. Green jobs already represent around 5% of the job market.\nGreen infrastructure and sustainability goals are our specialty, and achieving these goals requires technical knowledge and training in varied fields.\nPotential benefits of green infrastructure can include:\n- Provision of clean water\n- Removal of pollutants from air and water\n- Improved air and water quality\n- Protection against soil erosion\n- Improvement of land quality\n- Enhanced and protected biodiversity and ecosystems\n- Reducing waste streams\n- Conserved and restored natural resources\n- Creation of jobs\n- More energy solutions\n- greener cities\n- Better health and human well-being\n- Diversification of local economy\n- Minimized strain on local infrastructure\n- Improved overall quality of life\nClimate change adaptation and mitigation benefits\n- Disaster prevention\n- Flood alleviation\n- Strengthening ecosystems resilience\n- Ecological corridors\n- Landscape permeability\n- Improved habitats for wildlife\n- Reduced operating costs\n- Improved occupant productivity\n- Optimized life-cycle economic performance","Utilities in the age of electric vehicles\nUtilities in the age of electric vehicles\nUtilities in the age of electric vehicles\nThe impact of vehicles on the environment has driven regulatory mandates to adopt a more sustainable way of commuting. As a result, electric vehicles (EVs), and the necessary infrastructure to operate them, has changed the automobile and utility industries over the past decade.\nElectric vehicles are powered by a charged battery pack and can be separated into two categories:\n- Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs): These EVs are purely electric with lithium ion batteries suitable for short to medium distances.\n- Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs): Electric vehicles with an internal combustion engine (ICE) with support from a small electric motor.\nWhy Electric Vehicles?\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement has challenged countries to reduce their carbon emissions to “net zero” over the coming years. This international treaty has prompted governments around the world to phase out gas and diesel powered vehicles, shifting instead to EVs:\nSales of electric vehicles have grown steadily over the last decade. The following chart from the International Energy Agency shows China leading market share at 47%. Twenty other countries have reached a market share of above 1%: emissions. As a segment, the automobile industry can tout sustainability and the environmental benefits of emerging technologies to entice consumers to buy EVs.\nAccording to a study by IRENA (International Renewable Energy Agency) on EVs:\n- Electric passenger cars will reach 200 million by 2030\n- Electric two-wheeled and three-wheeled vehicles could outnumber four-wheeled vehicles, with as many as 900 million on roads by 2030\n- Electric buses and light-duty vehicles could surpass 10 million by 2030\nFactors Contributing to EV Adoption\n1. Consumer Interest:\nEco-friendly consumers who want to decrease their carbon footprint prefer to buy EVs. Transportation around the globe is one of the biggest contributors of carbon emissions. As a segment, the automobile industry can tout sustainability and the environmental benefits of emerging technologies to entice consumers to buy EVs. A 2019 international electric vehicle consumer survey (of 7,600 consumers in seven regions) shows consumer interest in electric vehicles is high. 50% of consumers say they’re interested in owning an EV and 28% say they’ll purchase one as their next vehicle.\nConsumer benefits to owning electric vehicles:\n- Reduced operating costs, lower charging prices and simpler maintenance\n- Quieter driving experience\n- Exemption in Clean Air Zones – areas that charge fees to vehicles that pollute the environment\n- Government subsidies that make EVs cheaper than ICE vehicles\n- Preferential parking permits in dense urban areas\nEV technology has vastly improved. Range limitations and charging times have been addressed, alleviating concerns and increasing purchase momentum. Consider these three, top selling EV models in the world in 2020:\n3. NetZero Target:\nIn support of the 2015 Paris Agreement, utility and automobile companies are working to achieve net-zero emissions. To do this, they’re offering customers low-carbon products such as renewable electricity and electric vehicles. By taking advantage of these offerings, individual consumers can reduce their carbon footprint. Businesses can reduce their overall cost of fleet ownership, and organisations can reduce fuel costs, reap tax benefits and take advantage of government incentives.\nChallenges for Utilities:\nEVs help combat climate change. However, barriers to adoption exist:\nCharging Pricing: An increase in the number of electric vehicles can lead to disorganised charging. This makes peak shaving difficult, creates incremental costs for generators, increases transmission and distribution pressures and reduces grid reliability and security. It also degrades power quality and increases the harmonics of the grid. Ultimately, an unreasonable pricing structure can lead to its failure. A dynamic pricing strategy can help utilities overcome the challenges of EVs and can reduce the burden of power on a grid.\nComplex Billing: EVs also present billing challenges for utilities:\n- Number of Stakeholders: Charging hosts, charging point operators, eMobility service providers, roaming network providers, etc. are all involved in the billing process. These stakeholders have to manage multiple plans – pre-paid, postpaid, ad hoc, group plans, etc.\n- Customer Type and Charging Location: Plans offered will vary based on customer type such as individual, fleet, business, public and private. They’ll also vary based on location, including home, office, fleet charging center, parking lot, multi-tenant unit, municipal location and more.\n- Price Per Charge: The customer can be charged based on charge point, price per kWh or by minute/ hour (flat fee). The charging session may include ancillary fees such as a connection fee or a waiting fee for staying connected after reaching a full charge.\nCharging Infrastructure: The mechanics of charging pose challenges to utility companies:\n- Network: Availability remains limited\n- Technology: Fast-charge still in its initial stage and widely unavailable in the network\n- Customer Experience: Unpredictable charging experience negatively affects customer opinion\nService and Maintenance: Electric vehicles require specialised mechanics who are still difficult to find. According to a study done by UK’s Institute of the Motor Industry (IMI), 97% of today’s mechanics aren’t qualified to work on electric vehicles. Of the 3% of mechanics who do qualify, many work directly for EV dealerships, limiting service options for general EV buyers.\nHigher Upfront Investment: Higher manufacturing costs vs. the cost to make a combustion engine vehicle make EVs more expensive to buy. This sticker shock feeds consumer doubt about the long-term economic benefits of an electric vehicle. Government subsidisations help alleviate that doubt, but total consumer buy-in will take time.\nThe Utility Opportunity\nAs more people switch to electric cars, the impact of EV charging loads on generation, transmission and distribution networks translates into more energy and more revenue opportunities for utility companies.\n- Charging Infrastructure: Utilities can play a vital role in modulating charging rates and shifting charging times to provide grid services that support supply and demand. Consider these energy giants already investing in charging infrastructure:\n- Shell recently announced the rollout of 500,000 electric charging stations over the next four years.1\n- Ecotricity a “Big Six” UK energy supplier, partners with Moto, RoadChef and Welcome Break to offer 45-minute fast-charge stations. They call the network “The Electric Highway.”2\n- In the UK, companies like Centrica are building out their EV charging capabilities by acquiring smaller independents. Centrica invested in Driivz, a software company that manages EV fleets and charging networks, to create Centrica Electric Vehicle Services (CEVS) 3\n- New EV Tariffs: Consumer tariff structures (e.g. time-of-use tariffs) reward consumers who slow-charge during off-peak hours. These tariffs, which reduce consumer bills and prevent overloads on the grid, help influence EV drivers to shift their charging behavior. By partnering with EV manufacturers, utility companies can create custom electricity tariffs that can be bundled into the purchase of an electric vehicles. Energy suppliers in the US, UK and other European countries have already begun offering EV energy tariffs.\n- Improved Customer Experience: Careful planning, phased execution and synergy with non-utility businesses can help electric utilities facilitate a smooth transition to EV adoption. With the right customer relationship management (CRM) platform in place, utilities can offer consumers “charging ecosystems” – chargers, charging plans, etc. - for their vehicle. This positive consumer experience, combined with the financial upside of aligning with non-utility companies, translates into increased revenue for the utility company.\n- Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G): While EV tariffs can prevent overloads by shifting charging behavior, they also present challenges. If too many EV drivers charge during off-peak times, it can spike load levels and lead to grid congestion. To counter this, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enables energy to be pushed back to the power grid from the battery of an electric vehicle. This helps balance the variations in energy production and consumption. Furthermore, V2G can support the integration of renewable energy resources into the grid.\n- AI Driven EV Marketing: With electric vehicle purchases on the rise, utilities must position themselves at the forefront of energy innovation to ensure brand credibility. AI-driven marketing helps identify crucial digital touchpoints for targeted messaging.\n- Data Advantages: Utilities can use data analytics and data science tools to develop services, applications and hyper-personalised product offerings. They can also leverage the data to expand into non-core markets. This allows for:\n- Joint offerings with automotive companies\n- After sales services in conjunction with car dealerships\n- Installation of charging stations at locations where customers park electric vehicles for more than an hour\nGlobally the uptake of electric vehicles is leading to the transportation and electricity sectors becoming increasingly connected.\nEven though barriers to EV adoption exist they are phasing out due to technological advancements. Innovation is the key in identifying opportunities to minimise costs and reducing pain points.\nFor utilities the biggest challenges is to ensure grid reliability and resilience. Providing a successful infrastructure for EV adoption will require coordination among various parties - Vehicle & charging manufactures, Electricity service providers, Distribution network operators, and Regulatory authorities\nIn the long run - Utilities that invest in electric vehicle infrastructure and technology will be well-equipped to offer solutions that benefit future customers.\n2Ecotricity and Nissan install UK electric-car-charging network | Guardian sustainable business | The Guardian\nEXL Utilities Academy"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:888f4a5f-235e-46c4-907a-3e8da92ff1d6>","<urn:uuid:dc7f0a0b-46cd-416c-b618-7a830371a8fd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the difference between aesthetic and efferent reading according to reading theory?","answer":"Aesthetic reading involves paying attention to the words themselves, taking pleasure in their sounds, images, and connotations. In contrast, efferent reading refers to reading for knowledge, information, or directions to action - essentially reading to carry away specific information from a text. While aesthetic reading emphasizes participatory pleasure, efferent reading focuses on extracting concrete information.","context":["An interpretation in philosophy of art, is an explanation of the meaning of some work of art. An aesthetic interpretation expresses a particular emotional or experiential understanding most often used in reference to a poem, or piece of literature, and may also apply to a work of visual art, or performance.\nReaders may approach reading a text from different starting points. A student assigned to interpret a poem for class comes at reading differently from someone on the beach reading a novel for escapist pleasure. \"Interpretation\" implies the conscious task of making sense out of a piece of writing that may not be clear at first glance or that may reward deeper reading even if it at first appears perfectly clear. The beach reader will probably not need to interpret what she or he reads, but the student will. Professor Louise Rosenblatt, a specialist in the study of the reading process, distinguished between two reading stances that occupy opposite ends of a spectrum. Aesthetic reading differs from efferent reading in that the former describes a reader coming to the text expecting to devote attention to the words themselves, to take pleasure in their sounds, images, connotations, etc. Efferent reading, on the other hand, describes someone, \"reading for knowledge, for information, or for the conclusion to an argument, or maybe for directions as to action, as in a recipe..., reading for what [one is] going to carry away afterwards. I term this efferent reading.\"(L. Rosenblat) That is what efferent means, leading or conducting away from something, in this case information from a text. On this view, poems and stories do not offer the reader a message to carry away, but a pleasure in which to participate actively—aesthetically.\nThere are many different theories of interpretation. On the one hand, there may be innumerable interpretations for any given piece of art, any one of which may be considered valid. However, it may also be claimed that there really is only one valid interpretation for any given piece of art. The aesthetic theory that says people may approach art with different but equally valid aims is called \"pluralism.\" But the aim of some of interpretations is such that they claim to be true or false.\nA \"relativistic\" kind of claim - between \"All readings are equally good\" and \"Only one reading is correct\" - holds that readings that tie together more details of the text and that gain approval of practiced readers are better than ones that do not. One kind of relativistic interpretation is called \"formal,\" referring to the \"form\" or shape of patterns in the words of a text, especially a poem or song. Pointing to the rhymes at the ends of lines is an objective set of resemblances in a poem. A reader of Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\". cannot help but hear the repetition of \"nevermore\" as a formal element of Poe's poem. Less obvious and a bit subjective would be an interpreter's pointing to the resemblance tying together all the mentions of weariness, napping, dreaming, and the drug nepenthe.\nIn the early 20th Century the German philosopher Martin Heidegger explored questions of formal philosophical analysis verses personal interpretations of aesthetic experience, preferencing the direct subjective experience of a work of art as essential to an individual's aesthetic interpretation.\nA contemporary theory informed by awareness that an ever-expanding exposure to ideas made possible by the internet has changed both the act of creation, and the experience of perception, is known as Multi Factorial Apperception (MFA). This approach seeks to integrate a wide range of cultural variables to expand the contextual frame for viewing the creation, and perception, of aesthetic experience. Emphasis is on a dynamic mulit-layerd cultural framing of the act of creation at a particular moment in time, and admits that the meaning of a particular work will be in flux from that moment onward.\nSome students of the reading process advocate that a reader should attempt to identify what the artist is trying to accomplish and interpret the art in terms of whether or not the artist has succeeded. Professor E. D. Hirsch wrote two books arguing that \"the author's intention must be the ultimate determiner of meaning.\" (E. D. Hirsch) In this controversial view, there is a single correct interpretation consistent with the artist's intention for any given art work."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4acf5e58-5da2-435d-bbcd-97b8c80e2eb1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do false killer whales' social structures compare to their vulnerability to environmental threats?","answer":"False killer whales exhibit complex social structures, forming pods of related individuals that travel and forage together, with the main Hawaiian Islands population divided into five major social clusters. This social organization coexists with their high vulnerability to environmental threats - they are more susceptible to organochloride buildup than other dolphins due to their position higher in the food chain. Their threats are compounded by their high trophic level, slow life history with long inter-birth intervals and delayed reproduction, and multiple anthropogenic pressures including persistent organic pollutants and fishing gear interactions.","context":["Hawaiian Islands False Killer Whale\nIn addition to the social construction found among all three Hawaiian false killer whale populations, there may be vital social construction within the principle Hawaiian Islands insular inhabitants. A social network analysis signifies that this inhabitants could be broadly divided into 5 major social clusters. The broad pelagic distribution of most false killer whale populations make it tough to estimate the worldwide population dimension of this species.\nFalse killer whales are classified as knowledge deficient on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

We use the outcomes of this analysis to tell management selections, further direct scientific research, and improve conservation and restoration efforts for the species. Using the 2010 Status Review Report for the main Hawaiian Islands insular false killer whale as a foundation, we developed an up-to-date Recovery Status Review for the species. A Recovery Status Review is a stand-alone doc that provides all the detailed info on the speciesâ€™ biology, ecology, status and threats, and conservation efforts to date. This doc, was printed on October sixteen, 2020, can be updated as needed with new data and used for various purposes, including 5-year evaluations, section 7consultations, and part 10 conservation plans. Traditionally, this data was included within the background of a restoration plan and became outdated rapidly.\nSome moms will hold a fish within the mouth and allow their calf to feed on the fish. Large strandings have been reported on seashores in Scotland, Ceylon, Zanzibar and along the coasts of Britain. It is assumed that stranded teams may need been chasing teams of seals or sea lions into the shallower waters and have become caught. False killer whales are black or darkish gray with a white blaze on their ventral side. Their heads are rounded and infrequently described as blunt and conical with a melon-formed forehead. The dorsal fin is sickle-formed and protrudes from the middle of their back, the pectoral flippers are pointed.\nHawaiian Islands False Killer Whale\nEntanglement can cause drowning, lack of circulation to an appendage, or impede the animal’s capacity to hunt, and swallowing the hook can puncture the digestive tract or can turn out to be a blockage. In Hawaii, that is doubtless leading to the decline in local populations, lowering them by 75% from 1989 to 2009. The false killer whale is extra prone to organochloride buildup than different dolphins, being larger up on the meals chain, and stranded individuals all over the world present greater ranges than other dolphins.\nTo cut back threats as a result of fishery interactions to the MHI insular population and different false killer whale populations in Hawaii, we additionally recommended that NMFS set up a Hawaiian False Killer Whale Take Reduction Team. In February 2010, NMFS established the staff and charged it with getting ready a plan to attenuate false killer whale interactions with the Hawaii longline fisheries for tuna and swordfish. A consultant of the Commission has been a member of the team since its inception. In November 2012, the NMFS listed the MHI insular inhabitants as Endangered beneath the ESA. False killer whales are highly social animals that type social clusters, generally known as ’pods’, of related people that travel and forage along with no obvious lasting exchange among these clusters. Within pods, individuals may spread out over many miles when searching, whereas smaller sub-groups unfold aside and merge over durations of hours to days.\nTheir flippers average about one-tenth of the pinnacle and body length and have a definite hump on the leading margin of the fin. There is a particular median notch on their flukes and they’re very thin with pointed suggestions. False killer whales even have eight to 11 tooth on all sides of their jaw. & Baird, R. W.

Photo by Annie Gorgone\nThe most well-publicized threat to Hawaiian odontocetes is the issue of harassment and potential displacement of spinner dolphins from their resting areas by swimmers, snorkelers, and small boats. Spinner dolphins are the only species of cetacean that rests near shore in protected bays around the main Hawaiian Islands, and this behavior puts them at risk from usually well-intentioned people that will follow groups of dolphins for extended periods. While some individual spinner dolphins, particularly juveniles, may show interest in swimmers or bowride on vessels, even when the majority of the group is resting, interacting with spinner dolphins in their resting areas may result in them moving out of their preferred resting areas, potentially exposing them to greater risk of attacks by sharks and disruption of their daily cycles. But is harassment the biggest conservation threat to Hawaiian odontocetes? A list of threats, some of which are more important to certain species than others, is below.\n|Threat||Species most likely to be affected|\n|Hook ingestion||false killer whale, bottlenose dolphin, rough-toothed dolphin|\n|Navy sonar||beaked whales, dwarf sperm whales, melon-headed whales, possibly others|\n|Vessel collisions||short-finned pilot whales, sperm whales, pantropical spotted dolphins, possibly others|\n|Reduction in prey base||false killer whales, possibly bottlenose dolphins|\n|Deliberate shooting||rough-toothed dolphins, melon-headed whales, possibly others|\n|Vessel/human disturbance||pantropical spotted dolphins, spinner dolphins, short-finned pilot whales, probably other species|\n|Line injuries/hooking||pantropical spotted dolphins, dwarf sperm whales, pygmy killer whales,others|\n|Persistent organic pollutants||false killer whales, probably others|\n|Entanglements in nearshore nets||bottlenose dolphins|\nSome of these threats may cause the immediate death of individuals, and some may cause injuries that could later lead to death. Other threats could make it harder to “make a living” (e.g., reduction in prey base), or could increase an individual’s susceptibility to infection or disease (e.g., persistent organic pollutants).\nWhat puts a species most at risk?\n- Low abundance\n- Population structure/sub-division\n- “Slow” life history (e.g., long inter-birth intervals, delayed age of first reproduction)\n- Known threats\n- High trophic level\n- High uncertainty (e.g., about threats, abundance, population structure)\nOf the 18 species of odontocetes in Hawaiian waters, until December 2012 only one was listed as Endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, the sperm whale. But is it the most at risk? Sperm whales were listed as Endangered because of large reductions in abundance world-wide due to commercial whaling. Although there is no recent abundance estimate available for the North Pacific, “on the basis of total abundance, current distribution, and regulatory measures that are currently in place, it is unlikely that this stock is in danger of extinction” (Allen and Angliss 2009). The species of toothed whale most at risk in Hawai‘i was listed as Endangered in December 2012, the main Hawaiian Islands population of false killer whales. False killer whales have the lowest known abundance of any of the 18 species in Hawaiian waters, are divided into three discrete populations (an open-ocean or pelagic population, a Northwestern Hawaiian Islands populatoin and the insular population around the main Hawaiian Islands), is slow to reproduce, is known to be threatened by a number of different anthropogenic activities, and is very high on the food web.\nBut many other species face a diversity of threats which could be impacting their populations in Hawaiian waters. Much of our research is focused on studying the factors that put species at risk in Hawaiian waters.\nBottlenose dolphin with hook in mouth (trailing a monofilament line) off the west coast of the island of Hawai‘i, July 5, 2009, evidence that this population does interact with local fisheries.

This species feeds primarily on large game fish, and thus may injest hooks by consuming free-swimming fish that have hooks in them, or take fish off the lines of fishermen, potentially getting entangled or killed as a result. In addition, many game fish populations have declined due to overfishing and habitat degredation, potentially affecting false killer whale populations.

{"question":"Between steaming meat in a dedicated steamer and using a multi-cooker's steam mode, which method provides more cooking options?","answer":"A dedicated steamer is specifically described as using moist heat cooking that suspends meat above water, resulting in tender and flavorful beef. The multi-cooker's steam cooking mode is more versatile, as it comes with grilles and a container for water, and can be used for cooking various foods without fat while maximizing nutrient preservation. Additionally, the multi-cooker offers other cooking modes like stewing and frying, making it more flexible for different meat preparation methods.","context":["Of course, a set of preset automatic cooking programs significantly affects the cost, functionality and choice of the optimal multi-cooker. Typically, all programs work based data from sensors in the bottom and on the lid. Modern models differs by the number of basic programs and availability of custom programs.\nBut, cooking time in these modes usually exceeds this value for conventional programs. As a rule, they are used to cooking the pilaf, porridges etc.\nThey have the following features:\n– the possibility / impossibility of intervention in the work of automatic programs;\n– presence / absence of a manual mode (multi chef mode);\n– possibility / impossibility of changing the temperature and time during the cooking process;\n– step variations of temperature and time in different modes;\n– countdown time.\nCountdown starts at the moment of switching-on or after reaching a predetermined temperature. Of course, this feature of the model should be considered.\nUsually, modern models support a few dozens of popular cooking programs.\nGroats (rice/buckwheat) and porridge (milk/crumbly/pilaf)\nGroats mode provides cooking crumbly dishes from different cereals. Therefore, cooking in this mode continues until full evaporating the liquid. Typically, device uses the maximum power. Usually, cooking time for any groats does not exceed 35 minutes.\nPorridge (milk/crumbly/pilaf) mode also continues until full evaporating the water.\nUnfortunately, not all models support milk porridge program. It operates at a temperature of about 90 degrees. But cooking time lasts about 1 hour.\nThe flakes are divorced by milk and are heated in the appropriate mode.\nPilaf mode in the ending the cooking sharply increases temperature, drys and roasts the cooked rice.\nStewing, steam cooking, baking, cooking soup/broth/compote and frying\nUsually, universal stewing mode provides cooking soups, meat, fish and vegetables. As a rule, it has long cooking time at a relatively low temperature.\nAs known, steam cooking provides the cooking without fat with maximum preservation of nutrients. Typically, models with this mode have the grilles and container for water.\nOf course, baking provides cooking at high temperature with the lid closed.\nCooking soup/broth/compote uses predetermined temperature.\nFrying mode uses the set temperature. This value is kept constant during cooking and reaches of 180 degrees.\nAuto warming up, keeping temperature, Multi chef mode\nAuto warming up program provides defrost and warming up food. Usually, device uses a temperature from 30 to 60 degrees. As a rule, power consumption does not exceed 20 W. But some models envisage switching off this mode that is convenient in case when recipe envisages a natural cooling.\nMoreover, this mode can used for cooking yogurt. But this option is only available in models that provide the temperature of 40 degrees during at least 8 hours. Unfortunately, a higher temperature kills the strain of useful bacteria.\nTypically, program of keeping temperature operates at a minimum temperature. In fact, device merely compensates the heat leakage.\nMulti chef mode changes the values of time and temperature during cooking process. But some models support the formation of programs from the fragments with different values of temperature and duration. As a rule, this function provides programming the complex dishes.\nCooking yoghurt, pasteurisation and deep fryer\nCooking yoghurt keeps a constant temperature (not more than 40 ° C) for a long time (up to 8 hours or more).\nPasteurization increases the shelf life of perishable foods. Pasteurization use a temperature of 60-80 ° C. Duration of this program depends on the foods weight.\nDeep fryer mode operates with the lid open and with the maximum temperature.\nThis program can also be used for cooking fondue.\nThis video demonstrates the wide possibilities of the cooking programs in modern multi-cookers.","What meals can you cook in a steamer?\n- Steamed trout with mint & dill dressing. …\n- Steamed bao buns. …\n- Steamed salmon & veg rice bowl. …\n- Raspberry & coconut steamed sponge. …\n- Chocolate & marmalade steamed pudding with marmalade cream. …\n- Thai-style steamed fish. …\n- Steamed chocolate, stout & prune pudding. …\n- Chocolate-orange steamed pudding with chocolate sauce.\nCan you cook meat in a steamer?\nLike braising and stewing, steaming is a moist heat cooking method that results in tender and flavorful beef through the use of steam.

{"question":"How can a ruler ensure their kingdom becomes prosperous according to ancient Chinese wisdom? Need step by step guide for good governance.","answer":"To achieve royal governance and prosperity, follow these steps: 1) Ensure agricultural seasons aren't disrupted so grain production exceeds consumption needs. 2) Regulate fishing by preventing close nets in pools and ponds. 3) Control wood harvesting by only allowing cutting at proper times. 4) Plant mulberry trees around homesteads to enable people over 50 to have silk clothing. 5) Properly manage breeding times of livestock so elderly can eat meat. 6) Protect farming time for hundred mâu farms to prevent hunger. 7) Establish schools emphasizing filial and fraternal duties. When implemented properly, these measures will result in elderly wearing silk, eating meat, and no one suffering from hunger or cold - signs of achieving royal dignity.","context":["Benvolence and righteousness Mencius's only topics with the princes of his time; and the only principles which can make a country prosperous.\n1. Mencius went to see king Hûi of Liang.\n2. The king said, 'Venerable sir, since you have not counted it far to come here, a distance of a thousand lî, may I presume that you are provided with counsels to profit my kingdom?'\n3. Mencius replied, 'Why must your Majesty use that word \"profit?\" What I am provided with, are counsels to benevolence and righteousness, and these are my only topics.\n4. 'If your Majesty say, \"What is to be done to profit my kingdom?\" the great officers will say, \"What is to be done to profit our families?\" and the inferior officers and the common people will say, \"What is to be done to profit our persons?\" Superiors and inferiors will try to snatch this profit the one from the other, and the kingdom will be endangered. In the kingdom of ten thousand chariots, the murderer of his sovereign shall be the chief of a family of a thousand chariots. In the kingdom of a thousand chariots, the murderer of his prince shall be the chief of a family of a hundred chariots. To have a thousand in ten thousand, and a hundred in a thousand, cannot be said not to be a large allotment, but if righteousness be put last, and profit be put first, they will not be satisfied without snatching all.\n5. 'There never has been a benevolent man who neglected his parents. There never has been a righteous man who made his sovereign an after consideration.\n6. 'Let your Majesty also say, \"Benevolence and righteousness, and let these be your only themes.\" Why must you use that word -- \"profit?\".\nRulers must share their pleasures with the people. They can only be happy when they rule over happy subjects.\n1. Mencius, another day, saw King Hûi of Liang. The king went and stood with him by a pond, and, looking round at the large geese and deer, said, 'Do wise and good princes also find pleasure in these things?'\n2. Mencius replied, 'Being wise and good, they have pleasure in these things. If they are not wise and good, though they have these things, they do not find pleasure.\n3. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry,\nHe measured out and commenced his marvellous tower;\nHe measured it out and planned it.\nThe people addressed themselves to it,\nAnd in less than a day completed it.\nWhen he measured and began it, he said to them --\nBe not so earnest:\nBut the multitudes came as if they had been his children.\nThe king was in his marvellous park;\nThe does reposed about,\nThe does so sleek and fat:\nAnd the white birds came glistening.\nThe king was by his marvellous pond;\nHow full was it of fishes leaping about!\"\n'King Wan used the strength of the people to make his tower and his pond, and yet the people rejoiced to do the work, calling the tower \"the marvellous tower,\" calling the pond \"the marvellous pond,\" and rejoicing that he had his large deer, his fishes, and turtles. The ancients caused the people to have pleasure as well as themselves, and therefore they could enjoy it.\n4. 'In the Declaration of T'ang it is said, \"O sun, when wilt thou expire? We will die together with thee.\" The people wished for Chieh's death, though they should die with him. Although he had towers, ponds, birds, and animals, how could he have pleasure alone?'\nHalf measures are of little use. The great principles of royal government must be faithfully and in their spirit carried out.\n1. King Hûi of Liang said, 'Small as my virtue is, in the government of my kingdom, I do indeed exert my mind to the utmost. If the year be bad on the inside of the river, I remove as many of the people as I can to the east of the river, and convey grain to the country in the inside. When the year is bad on the east of the river, I act on the same plan. On examining the government of the neighboring kingdoms, I do not find that there is any prince who exerts his mind as I do. And yet the people of the neighboring kingdoms do not decrease, nor do my people increase. How is this?'\n2. Mencius replied, 'Your majesty is fond of war; -- let me take an illustration from war. -- The soldiers move forward to the sound of the drums; and after their weapons have been crossed, on one side they throw away their coats of mail, trail their arms behind them, and run. Some run a hundred paces and stop; some run fifty paces and stop. What would you think if those who run fifty paces were to laugh at those who run a hundred paces?' The kind said, 'They should not do so. Though they did not run a hundred paces, yet they also ran away.' 'Since your Majesty knows this,' replied Mencius, 'you need not hope that your people will become more numerous than those of the neighboring kingdoms.\n3. 'If the seasons of husbandry be not interfered with, the grain will be more than can be eaten. If close nets are not allowed to enter the pools and ponds, the fishes and turtles will be more than can be consumed. If the axes and bills enter the hills and forests only at the proper time, the wood will be more than can be used. When the grain and fish and turtles are more than can be eaten, and there is more wood than can be used, this enables the people to nourish their living and mourn for their dead, without any feeling against any. This condition, in which the people nourish their living and bury their dead without any feeling against any, is the first step of royal government.\n4. 'Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five mâu, and persons of fifty years may be clothed with silk. In keeping fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let not their times of breeding be neglected, and persons of seventy years may eat flesh. Let there not be taken away the time that is proper for the cultivation of the farm with its hundred mâ, and the family of several mouths that is supported by it shall not suffer from hunger. Let careful attention be paid to education in schools, inculcating in it especially the filial and fraternal duties, and grey-haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying burdens on their backs or on their heads. It never has been that the ruler of a State, where such results were seen, -- persons of seventy wearing silk and eating flesh, and the black-haired people suffering neither from hunder nor cold, -- did not attain to the royal dignity.\n5. 'Your dogs and swine eat the food of men, and you do not make any restrictive arrangements. There are people dying from famine on the roads, and you do not issue the stores of your granaries for them. When people die, you say, \"It is not owing to me; it is owing to the year.\" In what does this differ from stabbing a man and killing him, and then saying -- \"It was not I; it was the weapon?\" Let your Majesty cease to lay the blame on the year, and instantly from all the nation the people will come to you.'"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f1b06432-ba8f-4597-b6da-0ca170347072>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm interested in light therapy treatments - how do phototherapy for jaundice in infants and photodynamic therapy for macular degeneration compare in terms of their light activation mechanisms and treatment targets?","answer":"Phototherapy for jaundice and photodynamic therapy (PDT) for macular degeneration use light in different ways. In infant phototherapy, light waves are directly absorbed by the skin and blood to break down bilirubin, with the breakdown products being eliminated through the liver and kidneys. In contrast, PDT requires injecting a special light-activated drug that accumulates in abnormal blood vessels under the macula, and then using a low-intensity laser light to activate the drug specifically in the affected area, damaging abnormal blood vessels while leaving normal ones intact.","context":["Jaundice is one of the common conditions in full term and premature babies and appears usually in the first week of birth. Jaundice is caused due to the increased levels of bilirubin in the blood, where processing of the compound is slow as the infant’s liver is immature in the first week of birth. Jaundice in infants can be classified into physiological jaundice, breast-feeding jaundice, breast milk jaundice, and jaundice caused as a result of blood group incompatibility with the mother. Physiological jaundice is the most common form of jaundice in infants and is observed in more than 50% of the newborns. Phototherapy is a common mode of treatment in infants affected with jaundice. The treatment involves a process of using light waves which are absorbed by the skin and blood, resulting in the breakdown of bilirubin. The breakdown products of bilirubin after phototherapy do not cause any effects on the central nervous system. They are rapidly eliminated through the liver and kidneys.\nThe global infant phototherapy lamp market is anticipated to grow during the forecast period owing to the common presence of jaundice in neonates. In addition, low cost and ease of the treatment contribute to the growth of the market. However, alternate modes of treatment such as biliblanket, IVIG treatment, and exchange transfusion are projected to hinder the growth of the market. Furthermore, the phototherapy lamp treatment is anticipated to be associated with long-term effects such as testicular effects, transient DNA damage, and melanoma. This factor might drag the market growth. In addition, lack of research that accurately proves the negative effects of the phototherapy treatment is estimated to negatively impact the infant phototherapy lamp market.\nThe global infant phototherapy lamp market can be segmented based on product type, modality, end-user, and geography. On the basis of product type, the market can be segmented into conventional phototherapy devices and fiber optic phototherapy devices. Conventional phototherapy devices can be further sub-segmented into fluorescent lamps and light-emitting diode (LED) lamps. On the basis of modality, the market can be segmented into mobile phototherapy unit and fixed phototherapy unit. Based on the end-user, the market can be segmented into hospitals and neonate clinics.\nA fiber optic phototherapy device comprises a pad of optic fibers that include a fiber optic bundle through which the light passes. This pad is placed close to the trunk of a neonate and hence does not require shielding of the eye. As a result, retinal injury and other eye complications can be prevented, making it the preferred choice of product for the treatment of jaundice in infants. Among the conventional phototherapy devices, fluorescent bulb is a commonly used device for the treatment. In terms of end-user, the neonate clinics segment of the market is anticipated to record a high growth during the forecast period.\nOn the basis of geography, the market can be segmented into North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Middle East & Africa. North America is anticipated to be a high revenue generating region of the infant phototherapy lamp market in the near future. However, the Asia Pacific market is anticipated to expand at a high CAGR during the forecast period owing to increase in birth rate, focus on enhancing the health care facilities by governments, and growth in awareness among the population.\nThe leading global players operating in the infant phototherapy lamp market include Natus Medical Incorporated, GE Healthcare, Philips Lighting Holding B.V., Ibis Medical Equipment & Systems Pvt.

The macula is a small area at the center of the retina in the back of the eye that allows us to see fine details clearly and perform activities such as reading and driving. In the wet form of AMD, abnormal blood vessels may grow in a layer beneath the retina, leaking fluid and blood and creating a large blind spot in the center of your vision.\nWhat is photodynamic therapy (PDT)?\nPhotodynamic therapy is an outpatient procedure involving the use of a special light-activated drug. The inactive form of the drug is usually injected into a vein in the arm, where it travels to and accumulates in abnormal blood vessels under the center of the macula. A special low-intensity laser light targeted at the retina activates the drug only in the affected area, damaging the abnormal blood vessels under the retina and leaving normal blood vessels intact. The benefit of PDT is that it inhibits abnormal blood vessel leakage associated with wet macular degeneration without damaging the retina.\nWhen can PDT be used in treating macular degeneration?\nPDT therapy is indicated for the treatment of abnormal new blood vessels under the center of the macula associated with age-related macular degeneration. These blood vessels must be predominantly well-defined on fluorescein angiographic photographs. PDT therapy is not effective for the treatment of the dry form of AMD, caused by aging and thinning of the tissues of the macula.\nHow successful is PDT?\nPhotodynamic therapy may preserve and, in some cases, improve vision. Repeat treatments are usually needed for optimum results. Photodynamic therapy may be used to treat some patients with the wet form of AMD with fewer visual side effects than other treatments.\nWhat other laser treatment is available?\nIf the abnormal new blood vessels are not under the center of the macula, they may be treated with thermal laser surgery, using a focused beam of high-intensity light to seal the abnormal blood vessels. A small, permanent blind spot is left at the point of laser contact.\nWhat precautions are associated with PDT?\nPatients who are treated with PDT will become temporarily sensitive to bright light (photosensitive). Care should be taken to avoid exposure of skin or eyes to direct sunlight or bright indoor light for 5 days. Patients who go outdoors in daylight during the first 5 days after treatment must protect all parts of their skin and their eyes by wearing sunglasses and protective clothing. UV sunscreens are not effective in protecting against photosensitivity reactions.\nIs PDT a permanent cure for macular degeneration?\nWhile photodynamic therapy may preserve and, in some cases, improve vision for many people, PDT may not stop vision loss in all patients. The abnormal blood vessels may regrow or begin to leak again. Every three months, a repeat examination including a fluorescein angiogram (the dye test) is required. Multiple PDT treatments may be necessary."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:07d2ca63-b2ac-445e-b42d-e92754d5ee9c>","<urn:uuid:09a6ff16-066d-4bed-880a-59905d16a335>"],"error":null}

Creator also earned $800,000 in the 2016 Belmont Stakes, but this was from a larger total purse of $1.5 million.","context":["Too many chefs certainly did not spoil the soupy final leg of the Triple Crown season, as Creator became the third horse to win one of this spring's three jewel races.\nWith a minority interest purchased in him earlier this week by celebrity chef and restauranteur Bobby Flay, Creator emerged victorious among 13 horses – including Preakness winner Exaggerator – on Saturday in the 148th running of the Belmont Stakes.\nIn a wild stretch run and photo finish, Creator caught and barely edged out Destin by a nose — with Lani finishing third in the grueling 1.5 mile track known as \"The Test of the Champion\" — before the Long Island skies opened up with heavy rain as Creator made his way back to the winner's circle.\n\"I shouldn't even be sitting here,\" said a drenched Flay, who purchased a piece of the winning three-year-old colt from WinStar Farm in the days leading up to the race. \"The only thing I did was I certainly was cheering the loudest in the entire racetrack.\n\"And maybe that gave him that last little head bump.\"\nThe photo finish marked just the fourth in the history of the Belmont. Ridden by Irad Ortiz Jr. and trained by Steve Asmussen, Creator had finished 13th in the Kentucky Derby and didn't run in the Preakness, entering Saturday's race as a 16-1 longshot.\n\"It's the best feeling right now. The great thing about racing is you can have a bad day, a bad week, a bad month,\" Asmussen said. \"They don't put you behind the gates; they line you up and give you a chance to prove yourself.\"\nExaggerator — ridden by Hall of Fame jockey Kent Desormeaux, who recently began alcohol rehab, and trained by his brother Keith – went off as a 7-5 favorite but faded late and finished a disappointing 11th.\n\"Approaching the half-mile pole, we started racing…I couldn't believe we were going so slow for such an animal, such a talent, such a horse with expeditious speed,\" Kent Desormeaux said. \"I just know there was nothing left. The horse was empty…When I picked him up at the quarter pole to go ahead and try to win the race, there was nothing there.\"\nNyquist had defeated Exaggerator by 1.5 lengths at Churchill Downs last month, with the runner-up returning two weeks later to take the Preakness. After finishing third at Pimlico (also behind Cherry Wine), Nyquist was held out of the Belmont due to illness.\nOn the same track one year ago, of course, American Pharoah gloriously became the first horse since Affirmed in 1978 to capture the Triple Crown — while also winning the Breeders' Cup Classic in the fall before retiring to stud.\nThere were 90,000 admissions sold for Pharoah's historic run in 2015, but there were believed to be barely half of that in attendance on Saturday, although Flay was prominent among multiple celebrities spotted among the crowd.\n\"The truth was, I had planned to bring about 15 to 20 people to the Belmont Stakes, which I do every year,\" Flay said, when asked how he got involved with Creator. \"I had a horse named America, a filly, who was going to run, but I retired her. I really had nothing to run. I wanted to make sure my guests had a very enjoyable experience, so I wanted to purchase a horse to run. Not necessarily the Belmont Stakes. Then (WinStar) told us we could get involved in Creator.\n\"To have the chance to be involved with a horse like that, a farm like that and the people that are involved in it, it was a no-brainer.\"\nThe outcome of the race hardly was that easy. Destin, which came in with 8-1 closing odds, ran in the top two positions from the starting gate until the finish. He still led at the 1 ¼-mile pole, with Creator lagging in the middle of the pack in sixth position, one spot behind Exaggerator, before catching and nudging past Destin just before the finish line to earn $800,000 of the $1.5 million total purse.","Here are some career highlights for champion race horse Funny Cide (see Joe Palladino’s article on the phenomena that was Funny Cide in the Friday Republican-American).\nBorn: April 20, 2000\nBred: WinStar Farm in Versailles, Ky.\nFoaled: McMahon Thoroughbreds of Saratoga Springs, N.Y.\nSire: Distorted Humor\nGrandsire: Forty Niner\nDam: Belle’s Good Cide\nHeight: 16.2 hands (a hand is 4 inches)\nOwner: Sackatoga Stable\nTrainer: Barclay Tagg\nAugust 2001: Purchased as a yearling for $22,000 by Tony Everard at Fasig-Tipton New York-bred yearlings sale, and trained at New Episode Training Center in Ocala, Florida.\nMarch 2002: Purchased in a private sale by Tagg for Sackatoga Stable.

{"question":"What are the health benefits of turmeric's curcumin compound, and what is the recommended method for maximizing its absorption in the body?","answer":"Curcumin has anti-inflammatory properties that work by inhibiting enzymes like COX-2, LOX, and iNOS, while also enhancing wound healing through faster reepithelialization and increased migration of myofibroblasts. To maximize absorption, curcumin should be consumed with black pepper and fat. Black pepper contains piperine which increases curcumin bioavailability by 2000% by slowing liver metabolism and increasing intestinal absorption. Since curcumin is fat-soluble, it needs fat to be dissolved and absorbed directly into the bloodstream. The recommended daily intake is 1-3g of powdered turmeric with just 1/20th of black pepper being sufficient to enhance bioavailability.","context":["Flavoring byproduct (hydrolyzed pork liver and yeast), fish oil.\nNatural products: Curcuma longa L.: Turmeric extract – 25 000 mg/kg; Flavourings: Piperine – 250 mg/kg; Vitamins: Vitamin C – 29 375 mg/kg, Calcium-D-pantothenate – 3 750 mg/kg, Vitamin E – 25 000 IU/kg, Biotin – 250 mg/kg, Niacinamide – 18 750 mg/kg; Trace elements: Zinc (zinc chelate of glycine) – 2 500 mg/kg.\nCrude protein 20.35%; Crude fibres 0.00%; Crude fat 40.94%; Crude ash 9.01%; Omega 3 fatty acids 6.80%; Omega 6 fatty acids 1.40%\nHow do its active ingredients work?\nIt is essential in the formation of coenzyme NADPþ and takes part in biosynthetic reactions, such as in the synthesis of fatty acids, thus playing a key role in the synthesis of epidermal lipids.\nIt is present throughout the body in the form of coenzyme A. Coenzyme A plays a role in the formation of a number of essential fats and sterols. As such, it is important in the formation of the lipids that form the lamellar components of the skin barrier.\nIt acts as a cofactor of carboxylase synthetase enzymes. This group of enzymes catalyzes the biosynthesis of fatty acids, being this vitamin crucial in the maintenance of the dermal-barrier health.\nThe inflammation generates a large amount of free radicals, which themselves accelerate the inflammatory process. Vitamin E is one of the most effective antioxidants for protecting polyunsaturated fatty acids of cell membranes from oxidation. Vitamin E inhibits lipid oxidation by scavenging peroxyl radicals much faster than these radicals can react with fatty acids or proteins from adjacent cell membranes.\nThe excess of histamine aggravates inflammatory conditions of the dermis and respiratory tract. Most histamine is stored in tissue mast cells and blood basophils. After the release of histamine by these cells or by de novo synthesis, histamine triggers inflammation. Vitamin C spontaneously degrades histamine, being tissue histamine levels inversely related to vitamin C status.\nNumerous reports have linked zinc deficiency to many dermatoses in dogs and cats, since it is needed for wound healing and the replacement of epithelial cells.Moreover, zinc deficiency accelerates the development of clinical signs due to lack of essential fatty acids, because it reduces ∆-6-desaturase enzyme activity. This enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of EPA and DHA from other simpler fatty acids.\nOmega 3 fatty acids\nThey modulate eicosanoid production. Eicosanoids resulting from omega-3 fatty acid metabolism are less stimulants of the inflammatory response than those resulting from omega-6 fatty acids. Moreover, they are the precursors of resolvins and protectins, counter-regulatory inflammatory substances that serve as agonists for endogenous anti-inflammatory mechanisms and significantly act in the resolution of inflammation.\nIts anti-inﬂammatory properties appears to be mediated through the inhibition of induction of important enzymes that mediate inﬂammatory processes like COX-2, LOX, and iNOS production of cytokines such as interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor, and activation of transcription factors like NF-κB and AP-1. Moreover, curcumin acts at multiple points, helping in enhancing wound-healing. Curcumin treatment results in faster reepithelialization of the epidermis, increased migration of myoﬁbroblasts, ﬁbroblasts, and macrophages in the wound bed, extensive neovascularization, and greater collagen deposition.\nIt increases curcumin bioavailability (by 20-fold), due to piperine’s inhibition of hepatic glucuronidation and intestinal metabolism of curcumin.","Improve the Benefits of Turmeric by Adding Black Pepper\nThis article looks at turmeric and why we should be including black pepper in our meal, to increase the benefits associated with using turmeric.\nTurmeric is increasing in popularity for its health benefits, having been used in Ayurvedic medicine over 5,000 years ago!\nBlack pepper in its own right, also, has an abundant amount of health benefits. It is a great source of manganese, which helps the body form connective tissues, bones and sex hormones. However, there is also another beneficial function of black pepper, when you combine it with turmeric, which we will now look at.\nTurmeric contains a compound called curcumin, a bright yellow chemical, which gives turmeric its vibrant colour. Curcumin has been identified as being beneficial for its anti-inflammatory properties.\nWhen you ingest turmeric with black pepper, you are increasing the amount of the curcumin you can absorb and your body can use.\nCurcumin has been associated with numerous health benefits including anti-inflammatory and an antioxidant, protecting healthy cells from free radicals which can cause damage.\nThe reason that black pepper enables this increase in our body using curcumin, is due to piperine a compound found in black pepper, which slows our liver from metabolising the curcumin too quickly and removing it through urine.\nBy slowing this process our body is able to utilise more of the curcumin and its beneficial effects!\nCurcumin is quickly metabolised and removed from the body by the liver and the intestinal wall, due to its poor bioavailability.\nWhat is ‘Bioavailability’?\nThe bioavailability of a food is the amount of a nutrient which is available and readily absorbed by the body to use for metabolic purposes in the body, from the food that we ingest.\nSome nutrients have a high bioavailability and can be digested, absorbed and metabolised by the body with ease, however, when it has a poor or low bioavailability (certain vitamins and minerals) the process of digestion, absorption and metabolism can vary and this can also be impacted by other vitamins and minerals that we consume these can either inhibit or facilitate these processes.\nTo facilitate our body to increase the bioavailability of curcumin it has been found that adding black pepper enables this increase in bioavailability.\nA 6 month randomised, double-blinded and placebo controlled (high standard for testing) study, on subjects diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, found that those who were not taking the placebo and had 3 capsules twice a day of curcumin, had a lower atherogenic risk, and an improvement in their metabolic profile (Chuengsamarn et al., 2014).\nPiperine in Black Pepper\nThe compound, piperine, found in black pepper is what gives black pepper its taste.\nPiperine has been shown to increase the bioavailability of nutrients in both food and supplements. This includes selenium, the B vitamins, and beta-carotene.\nPiperine has also been found to support and enhance the liver’s detoxification process (Murray et al., 2005).\nThe way that piperine enables the increase of bioavailability of nutrients and in this case curcumin, is that it inhibits the rate of metabolism of curcumin by increasing the time it resides in the intestines to increase intestinal absorption, and inhibits some of the enzymes (which are drug detoxifying enzymes) in the intestines that would usually break down and metabolise the curcumin (Ajazuddin, 2014).\nThis process of inhibiting enzymes is beneficial in the case for increasing the bioavailability of curcumin and another compound called EGCG (a polyphenol found in green tea which has been linked to certain health benefits). However, this can also negatively implicate the process in which our body excretes excess drugs through urine, halting the process, leading to elevated levels of the drugs in our system. This excretion of drugs helps to protect us from toxic chemical substances.\nA study found that when participants took a 2g capsule of curcumin alone, it was found at undetectable or very low levels in the serum levels in the blood (Shoba et al., 1998).\nWhen it was accompanied with 20mg of piperine, a higher concentration of serum levels was found from 0.25 to 1-hour post administration, the researchers found an increase in bioavailability of 2000%. It was found that piperine increases the bioavailability of curcumin with no adverse effects (Shoba et al., 1998).\nIt was also found that when curcumin and piperine are administered together, the intestinal absorption rate increased, and stayed significantly longer in the body tissue than when curcumin was administered alone (Suresh and Srinivasan, 2010).\nHow Much Black Pepper Do You Need?\nAlthough there is limited information on how much black pepper is required to aid bioavailability, it is advised that we eat between 1 to 3g of powdered turmeric a day.\n5% of turmeric is composed of curcumin, and 5% (varies between 4.6%-9.7%) of black pepper (by weight) is composed of piperine. Sources state that even just 1/20th of black pepper can increase the bioavailability, and just 20mg of piperine is effective in enhancing bioavailability.\nAddition of Fat\nThe curcumin is also fat-soluble, which means that it needs fat to be dissolved and then absorbed directly into the bloodstream, where it does not need to be metabolised by the liver.\nIn meals where turmeric is used, there is usually a fat and black pepper in the meal, which aids the bioavailability and absorption of the turmeric. This is why in our turmeric latte, we include both black pepper and Lucy Bee Coconut Oil.\nStorage and Use of Pepper and Turmeric\nTo get the best flavour from your pepper, you should buy whole peppercorns, and grind them up yourself. This means that you will just be receiving peppercorns, and not pepper with other spices, which can happen when you purchase pre-ground pepper.\nYou should store pepper in a cool, dark and dry place. It is also best if you add pepper towards the end of cooking, as the oils in the pepper lose their flavour and aroma if heated for too long.\nYou can get turmeric in powdered form or fresh. When fresh it should be kept in the refrigerator, where it can last for a month. You can also slice it and store it in an airtight container for 3 months.\nIf using powder, you should store it in a tightly sealed container in a cool, dark and dry place, where it will last for up to a year.\nPoints to Note\nIf you suffer with a history of oxalate-containing kidney stones, you should avoid over consuming black pepper as it contains low amounts of oxalates (these prevent the absorption of calcium) (Murray et al., 2005).\nAs black pepper slows down the rate that the liver clears drugs, it is advised not to consume over 1tsp. a day with certain medications – please consult your health advisor if you are considering consuming over 1tsp. a day and on medication including digoxin or phenytoin (Turmeric for Health, 2016).\nUnless advised or discussed with your health professional, there is no need to take turmeric capsules. You can use the powered or fresh turmeric within meals and drinks.\nLong term ingestion of turmeric capsules may lead to nausea, diarrhoea, stomach ulcers, and other problems.\nResearch has shown that turmeric may slow blood clotting, so if you’re taking medication for blood thinning you should talk to your health advisor as well, before considering taking turmeric supplements.\nIt is also recommended that pregnant women do not take turmeric supplements as it can stimulate the uterus which can cause menstrual flow, but is safe to use when seasoning foods.\nBoth turmeric and black pepper have been used in Ayurvedic medicine. Black pepper is indigenous to Kerala, and in Ayurvedic medicine it was known as an important healing spice. It was combined with long pepper and ginger, forming a herbal blend called trikatu, an important ingredient in Ayurvedic formulas.\nBlack pepper was highly prized within trading and expensive to buy – it was even found stuffed in Ramessess II nostrils as part of the mummification process.\nIn Ayurvedic medicine, turmeric was believed to balance the three doshas, and was taken both internally and externally to help with a variety of ailments (Gallant, 2016).\nTurmeric has an abundance of beneficial health effects that you can research and read up on, especially with more research being conducted on just how powerful it is.\nJust be warned when it gets onto your hands it can stain them yellow!!\nI even put it on my fried egg (cooked in Lucy Bee Coconut Oil) in the morning, with some black pepper, delicious!\nAjazuddin.

{"question":"How do marine vessel emissions and ecosystem services both impact human health and wellbeing?","answer":"Marine vessel emissions and ecosystem services have contrasting impacts on human health and wellbeing. Ship emissions contribute to climate-related illnesses including air-quality related heart and lung disease, heat-stroke, malnutrition, and casualties from fires, storms and floods. In contrast, biodiversity and ecosystem services provide essential benefits including potable water, food and fibers, soil fertility, climate regulation, and recreational and aesthetic values that are crucial to human dignity and wellbeing. Both factors affect food security, with shipping pollution threatening marine ecosystems while biodiversity supports food provision.","context":["A coalition of environmental advocates filed a petition today with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), asking the agency to set pollution rules for large, ocean-going marine vessels. These vessels include cargo and cruise ships. Earthjustice, the leading U.S. public interest environmental law firm, filed this first ever petition on behalf of Oceana, Friends of the Earth and the Center for Biological Diversity.\nCalifornia Attorney General Edmund G. \"Jerry\" Brown, Jr. also filed a petition to U.S. EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson on behalf of the state of California today, with a similar request.\nThe petitions would require the EPA to assess ships' contributions to global warming, seek public comment and issue rules to reduce this pollution or explain why it will not act.\nThe April 2007 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court clearly established that the Clean Air Act gives the EPA authority to address global warming. The EPA must act immediately and issue regulations to limit pollution that contributes to global warming. The petitions filed today begin the process of imposing mandatory regulations on the marine transportation sector. The petitioners asked the EPA to respond within 180 days.\nThe Climate Change Problem\nThe science is unequivocal. Global climate change is real, occurring at an alarming rate with catastrophic consequences, and is caused primarily by human activity. Ships are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The global fleet of marine vessels releases almost three percent of the world's carbon dioxide, an amount comparable to the emissions of Canada. Because of their huge number and inefficient operating practices, marine vessels release a large volume of global warming pollutants, particularly carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and black carbon (or soot).\nDespite their impact on the global climate, greenhouse gas emissions from ships are not currently regulated by the United States government. In addition, these emissions are not limited under the Kyoto Protocol or other international treaties that address global warming.\nShips' Contribution to the Climate Change Problem\nGlobal shipping activity has increased by three percent per year for the last three decades and this rate of growth is projected to increase. If fuel use remains unchanged, shipping pollution will increase substantially, potentially doubling from 2002 levels by 2020 and tripling by 2030.\n\"Global warming pollution from ships is a substantial problem. But fortunately, it's one that can be solved,\" said Danielle Fugere of Friends of the Earth. \"Slower speeds, cleaner fuels, better ships -- the steps that the shipping industry must take are clear. It's up to the EPA to ensure these steps are taken.\"\nWhy We Should Care\nClimate change is already causing widespread melting of Arctic glaciers and sea ice, shortening the snow season and raising global temperatures.\nThe resulting sea level rise could eliminate up to 22 percent of the worlds coastal wetlands and as much as 43 percent of U.S. wetlands. Wetlands provide habitat, protect against floods and storm surges and contribute to local economies.\nOur oceans and freshwater environments, including organisms at the bottom of the aquatic food chain, are already under stress from climate change. Ranges of algae, plankton and fish have shifted in response to changes in water temperature, ice cover, oxygen content, salinity and circulation. If they die off, entire aquatic ecosystems will follow.\nAmong the species that are struggling to adapt to rapidly changing habitats are cold-water fish, such as salmon and cod, polar bears, walruses, seals, whales, caribou, reindeer, corals, turtles and countless species of migrating sea birds.\n\"If we're going to slow the Arctic melt-down and save Arctic species, we must control global warming pollution from ships,\" said Kassie Siegel, Climate Program Director for the Center for Biological Diversity. \"Implementing the solutions in the petition is the first step toward slowing warming and protecting these species' future.\"\nHuman health is also impacted by climate change caused by global warming pollution. Climate-related illnesses include air-quality related heart and lung disease, heat-stroke, malnutrition, and casualties from fires, storms and floods.\n\"Climate change is threatening ocean life from the Arctic to the tropics. Shipping pollution has been given a free pass so far and it's way past time to fix that,\" said Dr. Michael Hirshfield, Oceana's Senior Vice President for North America and Chief Scientist.\nThe coalition's petition asks the Environmental Protection Agency to:\n- Require marine vessels to increase their fuel efficiency, thereby reducing carbon dioxide and other pollutants\n- Require marine vessels to use cleaner fuels to reduce greenhouse gas and soot emissions\n- Extend these new regulations to all marine cargo vessels operating in U.S. waters, whether they are registered in the United States or another country, to avoid disproportionate burdens on U.S. ships and to reduce pollution emitted in U.S. waters\n\"Halting and reversing global warming will require innovation across every sector of the global economy,\" said Tim Ballo, attorney for Earthjustice. \"Today, we are asking the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to begin regulating global warming pollution in earnest.

It underpins human wellbeing in the present and in the future, and its rapid decline threatens nature and people alike. According to reports released in 2018 by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the main global drivers of biodiversity loss are climate change, invasive species, over- exploitation of natural resources, pollution and urbanization.\nBiodiversity loss implies the reduction and disappearance of species and genetic diversity and the degradation of ecosystems. It jeopardizes nature’s vital contributions to humanity, endangering economies, livelihoods, food security, cultural diversity and quality of life, and constitutes a major threat to global peace and security. Biodiversity loss also disproportionally affects the most vulnerable exacerbating inequality.\nTo halt or reverse this decline it is vital to transform people’s roles, actions and relationships with biodiversity. Many solutions exist for stopping and reversing the decline in biodiversity. UNESCO’s diverse networks, programmes and partners have observed positive and inspiring seeds of change around the world. UNESCO also accompanies Member States and their people in their efforts to halt biodiversity loss by understanding, appreciating, safeguarding and using biodiversity sustainably.\nUNESCO’s unique contribution to the conservation and sustainable and equitable use of biodiversity supports and complements the work of other organizations and UN agencies working at the international and local level. Its role is founded on a number of key strengths:\n- UNESCO supports the study and observation of biodiversity in oceans, arid zones, mountains, wetlands and agricultural systems, in addition to remote sensing in support of World Heritage sites, biosphere reserves and UNESCO Global Geoparks, and work in the area of biotechnology and related capacity building.\n- UNESCO’s convening power and role as an honest broker with a holistic perspective combines expertise in the natural and social sciences, culture, education and communication.\n- UNESCO’s normative instruments safeguard the planet’s most exceptional biodiversity areas and recognize the intrinsic relationship between people, culture and nature, including intergovernmental conventions intended to safeguard and nurture tangible and intangible heritage.\n- UNESCO has a multidisciplinary mandate encompassing education and public awareness of biodiversity and sustainable development. It emphasizes links between cultural diversity and biodiversity, and societal aspects and ethical issues.\n- UNESCO has an important track record in advancing the science of biodiversity through pioneering work in the ecological sciences on ecosystems, biosphere reserves, biodiversity-related projects, capacity building, scientific assessments and policy briefs to assist decision-makers.\n- UNESCO mobilizes the knowledge, know-how and practices of local communities and indigenous peoples to support their inclusion in environmental decision-making, particularly with regard to biodiversity and climate change; through its Local and Indigenous Knowledge Systems (LINKS) programme. LINKS aims to build dialogue among indigenous knowledge holders, natural and social scientists, resource managers and decision-makers to secure an active and equitable role for local communities in resource governance.\n- UNESCO supports gender-responsive and gender-transformative approaches to biodiversity conservation and sustainable development and the promotion of knowledge held by women in biodiversity conservation.\n- UNESCO develops information and communication tools and works with broadcast media to support biodiversity education.\nHalting biodiversity loss is a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 15), one that is strongly linked to all other SDGs. Keeping ecosystems resilient and safeguarding our planet’s biodiversity is fundamental to poverty eradication, human health and wellbeing.\nBiodiversity is essential not only to the proper functioning of Earth systems, it is also key to the delivery of ecosystem services that are crucial to human dignity and wellbeing.\nThese biodiversity-dependant ecosystem services include the provision of potable water, food and fibres, soil fertility, maintenance of the genetic databank of biodiversity, climate regulation, and recreational and aesthetic values among others. Biodiversity and cultural diversity are intricately linked.\nA diverse world gives us the flexibility to adapt to change, including climate change. Biodiversity therefore underpins most SDGs and its loss constitutes a threat to both security and peace.\nClimate change is a major driver of biodiversity erosion. Changes in the temperature of the atmosphere and precipitation, ocean acidification, sea level rise and the nature of some extreme events adversely impact biodiversity and ecosystem services. In addition, climate change amplifies the impacts of other drivers such as habitat degradation, pollution, invasive species, over-exploitation, population displacement and migration. Loss of biodiversity also accelerates climate change processes, as the capacity of degraded ecosystems to assimilate and store CO2 tends to decrease, reducing the available adaptation options. Humanity therefore has a global responsibility to address these two challenges and the interactions between them.\n- Biodiversity erosion is a reality and needs to be tackled urgently. Climate change is a key driver and acts synergistically with land degradation and population growth to accelerate loss of biodiversity.\n- Biodiversity conservation will contribute to achieving the targets set by the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n- Stopping biodiversity loss is essential for climate change mitigation and achieving transformative sustainable development.\n- Current and future environmental migration depends to a large extent upon the implementation of adaptation strategies in vulnerable regions in conjunction with efforts to mitigate environmental degradation and climate change.\nIn line with its Strategy for Action on Climate Change (2018-2022), UNESCO provides data and climate information services on water security, Earth sciences, biodiversity and the ocean through the International Hydrological Programme (IHP), the International Geoscience and Geoparks Programme (IGGP), the Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), the Management of Social Transformations (MOST) Programme, the Local and Indigenous Knowledge Systems (LINKS) Programme and the World Heritage Convention.\nThe combined output of these programmes ensures the strengthening of the interdisciplinary climate change knowledge base.UNESCO also recognizes and promotes the importance of cultural knowledge and diversity as crucial drivers for the societal transformation and resilience needed to respond to climate change.\n- 1 of 5\n- next ›"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2e38f768-df5e-4830-8f11-25cbba6fafd2>","<urn:uuid:39b30852-b420-4ef3-a0e1-0071a7d5da81>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿En qué se diferencian los métodos para encontrar una función inversa y calcular el valor futuro en un problema de crecimiento exponencial?","answer":"Finding an inverse function involves a specific procedure where you write y=f(x), solve for x in terms of y, and then swap x and y to get f^(-1)(x). This requires checking for injectivity using the horizontal line test. In contrast, calculating future values in exponential growth problems uses the formula y=ae^(kt), where you plug in the time (t), initial amount (a), and growth rate (k) directly. For inverse functions, you must ensure the original function is injective and solve an equation algebraically, while exponential growth calculations are more straightforward, requiring only substitution into a standard formula to find values at any point in time.","context":["What is inverse function?\nFirst of all we should define inverse functions and explain their purpose. You must be aware that only injectiv functions can have their inverse.\nInjectivity of a function\nWe say that a function has an injectivity property or that it is injection if it is valit that:\nThat means that the function is injection if it maps different numbers of its domain to different members of codomain. This property is equivalent to the following:\nMeaning: function is injection if the equality of function values implies the equality of arguments.\nThere exists a very simple way of finding out whether a certain function is injective or not. We’ll use a simple method called the horizontal test.\nHorizontal test- injectivity criteria\nFunction is injective if a line parallel through x- axis intersects its graph in one point at the most.\nWe’ll show you how to use horizontal test on the following functions:\nThe horizontal test shows that if we can draw as any horizontal line and if that line intersect the graph with in just one point, the function will be injection.\nNow we’ll simply draw few horizontal lines and see what happens.\nWe can notice that if we take function and draw horizontal lines through it, those lines intersect the function in two points. Every line we draw on a positive part of will intersect this function in two points. Thus that function is not an injection.\nOn the same way we can test function . This function will be injective because we can’t draw a horizontal line that will intersect this function in two points.\nThe function can’t have inverse function if it is not an injection. Thus if function is an injection, then for a given from the image of the function there exists unique from the domain of the function such that and it is valid that . This uniqueness is provided by the injective property, otherwise there would exist two numbers and that map into the same which means that function could not be an injection.\nThis means that we can find mapping which maps into , . For that pair of mapping and it is valid that:\nOr, written in another way:\nFunction is an inverse function of a function if it is valid that:\nIn the same way is inverse function of a function and is the inverse function of a function and is also valid that .\nBecause of that we say that functions and are mutually inverse.\n, for every x∈\n, for every x∈\ncan also be written as:\nIf function maps element into element , inverse function will map element into element .\nFor example, we can take function . This function defined like this doesn’t have an inverse function because it’s not injection.\nThe graph of this function is a parabola positioned mainly on the positive part of -axis. Every line we draw parallel to the – axis will intersect the graph in two points. But, if we limit the domain we can have injective domain.\nWe’ll observe functions and defined on the interval . Those two functions are mutually inverse because for every positive number x it is valid that:\nFinding inverse function\nFrom the equation we have to clalculate the value of variable in relation to variable . If we could do that, we could get equation of inverse function.\nExample 1. Find the inverse function of a function .\nFirst we’ll write this equation as if .\nNow we’ll solve this equation with unknown .\nFrom here we get that:\nAfter we got the rule of maping of an inverse function, its argument can be replaced with , as it is common to do so:\nDo not mistake notation for inverse function for the negative power . Those are two very different things!\nCalculating Inverse function\nInverse function is found using the followin procedure:\n- Write .\n- Solve the equation by the unknown .\n- If there is an unique solution of that equation, then the function has an inverse function .\n- Switch the names of the unknowns x and y so you can get a notation\nLet’s try this procedure on different functions.\nExample 2. Find the inverse function of a function , x≠3.\nExample 3. Find the inverse function of a function .\nFrom the equation we get .\nFrom one value of variable we get two possible values for variable : .\nHere is where you should sense that the inverse function of this function does not exist, because this function is not injection. To check that, we can take for example and two different values for , according to this formula:\nthis means that and this function is not an injection.\nGraph of an inverse function\nCan we determine the graph of an inverse function of a function if we know a graph of a function ?\nWe’ll start, again, from the basics: we can read the following:\nPoint lies on a graph of function f if and only if point lies on a graph of a function .\nNotice that points and are symmetrical according to the line is the bisector of the first and third quadrant.\nGraphs of a function and its inverse function are symmetrical according to the line .\nFor example we’ll use the function from the first example: .\nNow, you can draw graphs of these two function and examine them.\nFrom this drawing you can see that if you take any point on a graph of a function point will be symmetric to the line and will lie on the graph of a function .\nExample 4.

Suppose a radio active substance decays at a rate of 3. What percent of substance will be left after 6 hours? Since the initial amount of substance is not given and the problem is based on percentage, we have to assume that the initial amount of substance is We have to use the formula given below to find the percent of substance after 6 hours.\nHere, the value of \"r\" is taken in negative sign. Because the initial amount of substance is assumed asthe percent of substance left after 6 hours is Problem 4 :. The number of bacteria in a certain culture doubles every hour. If there were 30 bacteria present in the culture initially, how many bacteria will be present at the end how to install ram mount on boat 8th hour?\nNote that the number of bacteria present in the culture doubles at the end of successive hours. Since it grows at the constant ratio \"2\", the growth is based is on geometric progression.\nWe have to use the formula given below to find the no. So, the number of bacteria at the end of 8th hour is Problem 5 :. A sum of money placed at compound interest doubles itself in 3 years.\nIf interest is being compounded annually, in how many years will it amount to four times itself? Let \"P\" be the amount invested initially. From the given information, P becomes 2P in 3 years. Since the investment is in compound interest, for the 4th year, the principal will be 2P. And 2P becomes 4P it doubles itself in the next 3 years. Therefore, at the end of 6 years accumulated value will be 4P. So, the amount deposited will amount to 4 times itself in 6 years.\nRelated Topics :. Doubling-Time Growth Formula. Half-Life Decay Formula.

{"question":"How did the European colonization of Newfoundland affect the indigenous Beothuk people, and what evidence remains of their presence?","answer":"European colonization severely impacted the Beothuk people, who withdrew from the coast and its resources to avoid contact with European fishermen and colonists. Archaeological evidence of Beothuk presence has been found at the Colony of Avalon site, where excavations have uncovered Beothuk hearths and materials dating to the 16th century. This discovery is particularly significant as few traces of this now extinct group have been found in eastern Newfoundland. While the French had little recorded interaction with the Beothuk, they developed stronger relations with the Mi'kmaq, who became important trading partners and military allies.","context":["Description of Historic Place\nThe Colony of Avalon Special Preservation Area is located within the municipal boundaries of the Town of Ferryland, NL. It encompasses an area of the community known as The Pool, taking in the present day beach and extending to the base of rolling lands at the foot of The Downs. The principal physical elements of the district are the heritage resources and historic features that have been, and continue to be, uncovered through archaeological exploration, a collection of traditional fisheries buildings and late 19th to early 20th century vernacular style houses. The Colony of Avalon Special Preservation Area begins at the tip of the arm forming The Pool, then to the northeast and southwest along the beach to a privately owned meadow, then southwest to the road to The Downs, along this road to the west and southwest and west to The Pool Road, then northwest along this road for a short distance, then north back to the tip of the arm forming The Pool.\nThe Colony of Avalon Special Preservation Area was designated a municipal heritage district by the Town of Ferryland due to its historic, scientific, cultural and aesthetic values.\nThe Colony of Avalon Special Preservation Area has historic value due to its age, its role in historic developments in the New World and its connection to well-known historical figures. At the lowest levels of the excavations, Beothuk hearths and materials used by seasonal European fishermen have been identified, dating the site to the 16th century. Permanent settlement occurred in 1621, when settlers sponsored by Sir George Calvert, later Lord Baltimore, arrived to establish a colony. Within a few years the settlers built a small village, complete with a cobblestone street, parlour, bakery, brew house, forge, waterfront premises and defensive works. Calvert called his colony \"Avalon\" after Avalon in Somerset, England and hoped his colony would be a place of religious tolerance. In 1637, a syndicate headed by David Kirke was granted the island of Newfoundland as a reward for taking Nova Scotia and Quebec from the French. The Kirkes arrived in Ferryland and deposed Calvert’s representative. As governor of Newfoundland, David Kirke oversaw a lucrative mercantile operation at the settlement, making it the de facto capital of the island. Kirke was an unwavering Royalist, and following Parliament’s victory in the English Civil War of the mid 1600s he was called back to England by the Commonwealth and jailed. He died there in 1654, but his wife Lady Sarah Kirke went on to run the plantation until she died sometime in the 1680s. Her sons continued at “The Pool Plantation” until 1696, when French forces attacked, taking the Kirkes hostage and deporting the settlers to Appledore, England. Many of the settlers returned the next year, making the winter of 1696-97 the only time since 1621 that the settlement was unoccupied.\nThe Colony of Avalon Special Preservation Area is scientifically valuable for the information the excavation has yielded and its rarity as an archaeological site. Millions of artifacts have been unearthed at the site, dating from the 16th century onward. These artifacts provide insight into the groups that frequented the site in the past, including Beothuk Indians, European migratory fishermen and English settlers. The evidence of the Beothuk presence is of particular note, as few traces of this now extinct group have been found in eastern Newfoundland. The site is also rare due to the materials used in its construction. Most of the buildings dating from the 1600s were constructed of stone, which is reminiscent of the building tradition in England but was not a technique widely transferred to the New World.\nThe cultural value of the Colony of Avalon Special Preservation Area is most obvious in the continued use of the space. For centuries, The Pool has been the site of traditional fisheries activities. Its expansive beaches were useful fish drying spaces for European migratory fishermen. Its sheltered inner harbour proved to be an ideal location for a fishing plantation. Into the 18th century, English and Irish settlers and their descendants continued to use The Pool as a place to set up fishing premises, a practice which continues into the present.\nThe Colony of Avalon Special Preservation Area has aesthetic value as a landmark in the community and the region. The Pool’s well defined inner harbour, abutting the gently sloping hills of The Downs, is a distinctive landscape feature along a shore typified by deep harbours. It is visible from many vantage points in the community, including the Southern Shore Highway, The Downs and The Gaze.\nSource: Town of Ferryland Municipal Plan, November 1998.\nAll those elements that embody the historic, scientific, cultural and aesthetic value of the Colony of Avalon Special Preservation Area, including:\n- in-situ archaeological remnants of early 17th century plantation life in their location, form and materials;\n- continued public use of traditional fishing premises;\n- new uses restricted to archaeology, interpretation and visitor services;\n- form, small scale and low, simple massing of traditional fisheries buildings;\n- form, size, massing and style of remaining houses;\n- use of traditional materials on existing buildings, and;\n- unobstructed view planes to and from the district.","By Valerie Casbourn\nLibrary and Archives Canada (LAC) holds records related to the French colonial period in early Canada, and some of these records are available online. Included are records about the French cod fishery in the Atlantic region and the French colony of Plaisance in Newfoundland (1662–1713).\nDuring the 17th century, the cod fishery in Newfoundland became increasingly important to the European fishing industry. France was one of several European countries competing for a share of this fishery, and in 1662, the French established a garrison town at Plaisance, on the western side of Newfoundland’s Avalon Peninsula. The French wanted to secure their merchant fishing fleet’s access to the fishery and their share of the European market for cod.\nThe site of Plaisance was chosen for its proximity to rich fishing grounds, its sheltered and relatively ice-free harbour, and its strategic location. Eventually, the colony of Plaisance grew to have a small permanent population, with military fortifications, and served as a base for the French Atlantic cod fishery.The French and English established colonies along the southeastern coast of Newfoundland, which encroached on the Indigenous territory of the Beothuk and the Mi’kmaq. The French had little recorded interaction with the Beothuk, who withdrew from the coast and its resources to avoid contact with the European fishermen and colonists. Before the arrival of the colonies the Mi’kmaq navigated the waters between Cape Breton and Newfoundland by canoe. They established friendly relations with the French, becoming important trading partners and military allies.\nThe colony of Plaisance encountered many difficulties, particularly during its first few decades. Its population was small and poorly supplied, and its early governors were ineffective. However, in the 1690s, the colony became stronger, and the French administration highly valued the Atlantic fishery.\nThe economy of Plaisance was largely based on the cod fishery. The colony’s small permanent population with its “habitants-pêcheurs” was bolstered each year with the arrival of a large seasonal workforce on the merchant fleet from French ports. All worked intensely to catch and preserve cod during the summer months. The residents of Plaisance relied on the merchant fleet to bring extra labourers, food and manufactured goods, and to ship their dried catch back to Europe to be sold.\nDuring this period, there was ongoing conflict between the French and the English, as well as between the Mi’kmaq and the English. In the 1690s and early 1700s, both the French and the Mi’kmaq conducted raids, sometimes jointly, on English settlements on the Avalon Peninsula. The War of the Spanish Succession culminated in the Treaty of Utrecht, signed in 1713, in which France ceded its claim to Newfoundland to England. The English took over the settlement of Plaisance, changing its name to Placentia. Most of the French colonists moved south to the colony of Ile Royale (now Cape Breton). There they established themselves in the new French settlement of Louisbourg and continued their work in the French cod fishery. The French also retained the right to fish off the coasts of Newfoundland and to process their catch along stretches of the shoreline, known as the French Shore.\nRecords at Library and Archives Canada\nLAC holds records related to the colony of Plaisance, among other topics, in the Fonds des Colonies (MG1). This fonds includes copies and transcriptions of selected records related to the French colonial period in early Canada. The records are in French, and the original documents are held at the Archives nationales d’outre-mer in Aix-en-Provence, France. The Fonds des Colonies consists of records including correspondence, reports, journals, instructions, records of fortifications and commerce, civil registers, and notary documents.\nMany records in the Fonds des Colonies have been digitized and are available directly on the LAC website. Use LAC’s Collection Search to search for records about the colony of Plaisance. Try keyword searches, such as “MG1 Plaisance” or “MG1 pêche” (without quotation marks), and use the drop-down menu to search “Archives.” Including “MG1” will limit your search results to records in the Fonds des Colonies; you can search more broadly by not including it.

{"question":"What are the main objectives of the 1890 ARD Consortium's food safety research program? Please list them in detail.","answer":"The research program has three main objectives: 1) Develop and evaluate effective methods of intervention for foodborne microbial contamination on targeted foods, including meat, dairy, organic foods, and fresh produce; 2) Develop and evaluate methods of detection and monitoring of foodborne pathogens in targeted foods; and 3) Evaluate food quality, regulatory compliance, economic feasibility, and sustainability of intervention and detection methods.","context":["Strategies that reduce food-borne pathogens in the animal prior to processing for meat could reduce incidences of human exposure to these organisms. The gastrointestinal tracts of sheep and goats are natural reservoirs of E. coli. Fecal shedding in live animals is correlated with carcass contamination. Lambs are often fed a finishing grain-based ration in order to improve productivity. However, meat goats are predominantly fed a roughage diet until slaughter. Shedding of E. coli by ruminants is influenced by the diet and therefore dietary changes in food animals during the days prior to slaughter may reduce fecal shedding of bacteria.\nPre-harvest dietary management will serve as a cost-effective decontamination strategy in small ruminant production systems, particularly for goat processing enterprises, since most of the goat processors in the southern states operate with moderate resources and limited technology. Research conducted at FVSU include manipulating pre-harvest feed deprivation time, diet (concentrate vs. roughage), and diet change from hay to concentrate. Pre-harvest management methodologies can be implemented with virtually no additional operational costs to the farmers. These management methods are also expected to enhance marketability and profitability by improving the shelf life of carcasses and products.\nFVSU researchers are also studying other cost-effective pathogen reduction strategies that can be adopted by small and very small processing facilities. Our goal is to determine and compare the microbiological characteristics of spray washing live goats and goat carcasses with ozonated water, electrolyzed oxidizing water, or salt water, as well as to determine the effects of such treatments on subsequent meat quality characteristics. Scientists are also conducting feasibility and economic cost-benefit analyses of introducing these technologies into goat slaughter establishments and meat processing facilities as strategies to inactivate foodborne microorganisms.\nIn FVSU’s food engineering laboratories, researchers are working on finding novel methods to kill pathogens without using heat. Using non-thermal methods for destroying pathogens allows us to decontaminate food without damaging the products. The food industry wants to ensure the safety of its products while maintaining quality. FVSU scientists applied low voltage electric current to meat samples contaminated with E. coli, covered with a thin film of table salt solution. Exposure of contaminated meat to electric current destabilized bacterial cell membranes, and with sufficient current intensity and duration of treatment, cell membranes were irreversibly damaged, important cellular compounds leaked out, and the E. coli organisms were killed. The low voltage current reduced E. coli by 98.9% in 16 minutes. Further research is required to see how this technology can be implemented in commercial operations such as meat processing plants.\nFVSU is a part of the 1890 ARD (Association of Research Directors) Consortium entitled “Prevention of Microbial Foodborne Outbreaks: Food Safety Research, Teaching and Outreach Program for 1890-Land Grant Universities”. The objectives of the research project are to:\n- Develop and evaluate effective methods of intervention of foodborne microbial contamination on targeted foods (meat and dairy, organic foods and fresh produce)\n- Develop and evaluate methods of detection and monitoring of foodborne pathogens in targeted foods\n- Evaluate food quality, regulatory compliance, economic feasibility, and sustainability of intervention and detection methods\nThe consortium includes researchers from FVSU, North Carolina A&T, Delaware State, Florida A&M, Langston, Tuskegee, University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, University of Maryland at Eastern Shore, Virginia State, Alabama A&M, and Lincoln University."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3ddac916-745d-4c80-8895-c053e594573f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I want to use library apps for teaching. How can these tools enhance student engagement while ensuring data privacy?","answer":"Library apps can enhance student engagement in several ways while maintaining privacy. For engagement, tools like Flipgrid allow students to create lesson reflections, connect with other schools, make book recommendations, and discuss topics. Canva helps students create promotional posters, while Do Ink enables creative projects like sock puppet poetry cafes with green screen backgrounds. However, regarding privacy, it's crucial to verify if apps clearly state their data collection practices and comply with regulations like GDPR or COPPA. You should check if the app developer allows personal data removal and properly encrypts sensitive information. Additionally, schools must ensure proper data management within the school environment and on school devices, while teachers need training in digital citizenship and student online safety.","context":["Tech tools and tips librarians can’t live without\nCreative and fun ways to use Clubhouse, Flipgrid, Green Screen and other tools with students and teachers.\nSLJ montage using app icons and artwork from Getty Images\nLouisiana teaching librarian Amanda Jones pulls out a tech tip to get families to visit the Live Oak Middle School library during her school’s open house. She creates photos with Green Screen by Do Ink. The photo of students with their families includes their names, school name and year. Jones then directs families to the library’s Facebook and Instagram accounts, where they can find their photos to upload.\nJones’ image project not only introduces families to the library, but also familiarizes them with school technology and gives them an ongoing connection to the library through social media.\n“School libraries should be places of innovation,” says Jones. “It is worth investing our time in teaching our students the latest edtech tools and the responsible use of these tools. A school library program should include a balance between promoting the enjoyment of reading and collaborative lessons using the best edtech tools available.\nSo what are the best tools for librarians today, and how are they using them? We asked a few tech-savvy librarians to share the tools everyone needs to know.\nThe tools librarians use the most fall into four main categories: content curation, design, increased engagement, and collaboration support. Wakelet is everyone’s favorite tool for resource conservation, according to the FLS short poll, with Padlet a close second. canvas and Twitter followed closely as tools librarians use most often.\nWakelet and Padlet digital curation charts are gaining popularity as tools for library resource guides, whether for parents, teachers, or students. Links can be added directly from YouTube, Twitter, Flipgrid or other platforms, and guides can be easily embedded on the school website for sharing.\nThe canvas is the design tool that many turn to when it’s time to promote the book fair or announce new books. It is also useful in tandem with other tools. Jones uses it to make his Instagram posts livelier or design headers for Google Classroom or Wakelets.\nKC Boyd, Library Media Specialist at Jefferson Middle School Academy in Washington, DC, has students use Canva to create their own celebrity “Read” promotional posters. “My students are also celebrities, so I put their posters on Twitter, and the kids are going crazy,” Boyd explains.\nFlipgrid is another longtime favorite that librarians can’t live without.\n“I use [Flipgrid] in various ways with my elementary students,” says Lauree Moore, Media Specialist at Earhart Environmental Magnet Elementary School in Wichita, KS. “They create lesson reflections, chat and respond to each other, connect with other schools, make videos for their teachers, review books and discuss favorites, make book recommendations, identify facts about topics , teach each other about topics they’ve become an expert on, and more.\nIt’s no secret that school librarians have a great social media presence to connect with the wider school community and promote their libraries. Overall, Twitter was the most mentioned platform in the survey, with active librarian communities on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Clubhouse.\nTexas College Librarian Media Specialist Karina Quilantán-Garza, also known online as Cue the Librarian, suggests librarians take social media inspiration from Librarian of Congress (LOC) Dr. Carla Hayden. When Hayden Live-Tweeted the Musical hamiltonevery few minutes she posted a main LOC resource related to something in the musical.\nQuilantán-Garza adds that librarians don’t need to master the latest tool to have an impact; it is more important that they know how to use it well. “Try to master one tool at a time before picking up another,” she says. “Just because it’s popular doesn’t mean you have to use it. Everyone’s libraries are different.\nTo connect with each other, librarians are also turning to social media. Clubhouse, Twitter and Facebook are favorites. Boyd hosts his show “Boss Librarian” on Clubhouse. This audio social networking app allows people to host real-time group conversations.\n“If you want to stay up to date with what’s happening in the field and connect with people who are doing dynamite work in their field, [social media] that’s where they hang out,” Boyd said.\nHannah Fjeld, Library Media Specialist at Neshobe School in Brandon, VT, wishes there was a better tool to help elementary students understand information literacy. She was among the 40% of respondents who want to find better tools for finding and reading information to help teach these life skills.\nFor news literacy, Quilantán-Garza recommends Pear Deck’s Be Internet Awesome, which offers interactive courses in English and Spanish. Resources has a library of lesson plans and templates that provide scenarios and activities.\nPennsylvania librarian Beth Cohen uses Nearpod’s Time to Climb feature with her ninth and tenth graders to assess their understanding before and after a lesson. She also asks students to respond to specific scenarios on a whiteboard or asks them to vote on whether a social media post or news story is real.\n“I’ve found that they’re much more willing to share their use of technology and their opinions about online content when they can do so anonymously,” she says.\nBoyd recommends the News Literacy Project’s (NLP) Checkology site, which provides real-world examples of social media and news resources to help students understand what’s right and wrong. Boyd, an ambassador for NLP News Literacy, also enjoys the weekly NLP Sift newsletter as a real-time tool that offers examples, lessons, and discussion questions on hot topics. NLP also has an app, Informable, and a podcast, Is it a fact?\nJones uses Do Ink for creative spaces, video making, podcasting, photo projects, and student lectures. Since Do Ink can include images from up to three different sources, Jones uses a template created in Canva and records the children’s book discussions in front of a green screen. Then she uses Do Ink to add images of the book and the author in the background. For students who are reluctant to share their poetry with others, she hosts a sock puppet poetry cafe. The children use the sock puppets in front of the green screen, with Do Ink in the background.\nScreencastify is a useful tool for creating videos with students who need a little help with presentations, says Amanda Hunt, library media specialist at Oak Run Middle School in New Braunfels, TX. Screencastify allows students to record, edit and share; it also allows users to manipulate the screen while talking. Students can then pitch projects without the pressure of in-person public speaking. For students who prefer podcasting, Streamyard allows users to record or live stream to Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or other platforms.\nHunt also loves Mote, a Chrome app or extension that lets him embed voice feedback for students into Word documents, Google Forms, or spreadsheets.\n“In our digital world, characters get a bit lost in translation,” she says. “Children don’t always receive humor or sarcasm when writing. When they hear me say exactly what I want them to do, they’re able to make those adjustments a little easier with that voice ability.\nFor librarians looking for tools to make learning more fun and engaging, Hunt suggests Edpuzzle. Educators can create their own videos or embed videos from Khan Academy, YouTube, or other resources, making this a great resource for flipped teaching.\nQuilantán-Garza students are very interested in esports, organized multiplayer video game competitions. Minecraft for education is another favorite. A well-established gaming community provides a sense of belonging to many of its students.\nWhile school libraries are often technology hubs in schools, the benefits will go far beyond the library, Boyd says.\n“As librarians, we need to be in the driver’s seat in our school to support innovation,” she says. “It’s going to take time out of all of our schedules to learn and master these apps so kids and teachers can be ready to use them. The big picture is that I have a more informed school community thanks to the information I have passed on to them. Get on board and don’t be left behind.\nJennifer Snelling is an education journalist who focuses on the transformative power of technology to engage students.","In our society, few folks actually take the time to read the terms of service before installing apps on their devices. This is true for students and adults alike. If we find an app that looks like it will meet a need, we typically install it without considering what we might be giving up. Here are five questions to ask before installing apps, and then we’ll look at several helpful resources to expand your understanding of the critical nature of data privacy.\n|Q1:||Does the app developer clearly state what data they collect and how they use that data on its website?|\n|Q2:||Does the app developer share what permissions are granted to use the app BEFORE installing the app?|\n|Q3:||Does the app identify a relatively recent date of its last update?|\n|Q4:||Does the app developer give information on their website if they handle data in accordance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)?|\n|Q5:||Does the app developer allow you to request that your personal data be removed?|\nIf you realize that these five questions reveal you need to brush up on data privacy concerns, here are some resources to help bring you up to speed. These resources make the biggest impact when you provide opportunities for discussion with peers, parents, and leaders in your school/district.\nData Quality Campaign\nThe Data Quality Campaign (DQC) is a national nonprofit policy and advocacy organization dedicated to ensuring that education data works for individuals, families, educators, communities, and policymakers. They provide many helpful resources that you might consider sharing with your peers, parents, and leaders in your district.\nEncryption is a common method often used to protect sensitive student information. Encryption is a common security practice, but privacy policies rarely mention it. Most commonly, encryption is mentioned in connection with billing information. Without examining its policy, there is no way to tell which data a service encrypts. De-identification is another important aspect of student data privacy on apps. Almost half of the privacy policies mention de-identification as a primary reason for collecting data. These policies are almost exclusively used for analyzing user behavior and reporting on student performance within districts.\nIf you are looking for more information or need help, go to Terms of Service; Didn’t Read. They may have reviewed the app already. If not, you can submit a request to help answer your question.\nParental Responsibility in Data Privacy\nParental responsibility for student privacy is a crucial responsibility. In addition to protecting their children’s privacy, parents must educate themselves about the technology their children are using. If parents allow their children to use technology without parental supervision, they could be agreeing to data tracking. In addition to educating themselves, parents should always check the privacy practices of the websites and apps they use. By ensuring these services are transparent about their data collection practices, parents can rest assured that their children’s privacy is protected.\nParents who want to learn more about taking a proactive role in protecting children’s privacy can go to one of these sites for relevant help.\n- Connect Safely – A nonprofit dedicated to educating users of connected technology about safety, privacy, and security. You can easily explore information sorted by topics and access quick guides, news, and podcasts on their website.\n- Parent Coalition for Student Privacy – This coalition focuses on being advocates with parents in helping keep their child’s data safe. Check out their website for an interactive state student privacy report card, an educator toolkit, and a parent toolkit.\n- The Education Cooperative – Helpful information to support parents in understanding legal issues such as COPPA, PPRA, CIPA, and FERPA and how it relates to the safety of their child.\nTeachers, too, need to educate themselves about the privacy practices of third-party developers. Connecticut has passed a law establishing a task force to study student data privacy on apps. The task force will explore whether local boards of education should adopt data contracting policies, and they will train employees on best practices. The law will also develop a list of websites and software approved by the state and approved by school districts. By providing more information about the privacy practices of third-party providers, parents will feel more comfortable with these platforms.\nEach district is responsible for managing student data generated within the school environment and on school devices. The following points can help teachers know how they play a critical role in ensuring student safety. Ignorance of your responsibilities as an educator does not protect you. Seek out the information to be an informed and proactive educator and advocate for your students.\n- Contact your Technology Department and ask where they provide training for educators on digital citizenship, student online safety, and best practices in relation to using apps and digital devices in the classroom.\n- Contact your Professional Development Department (or HR) to find out what resources are available to help teachers better understand their role when using technology with students.\n- Contact your local educational service center (or state education association) for information on student data privacy they’ve already prepared and made available. Sometimes this is posted on their respective websites; sometimes, you will need to call and track down the person with the information.\nWhile most students are comfortable sharing their social-emotional learning survey results, they may be less comfortable sharing their social-emotional learning results with a school or other third party, for example. Regardless of the level of privacy concerns, a student’s privacy is the most important thing parents, teachers, schools, and he or she can protect."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f2829d78-0660-4fb5-b5ed-13e0c6391815>","<urn:uuid:d19cfadf-652c-45a3-9a03-cff466680729>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Is finding the North Star equally important for wilderness survival navigation and star trail photography?","answer":"Yes, finding the North Star (Polaris) is crucial for both activities. For wilderness survival, people have historically used the stars, particularly the North Star, to figure out their destinations before modern navigation tools like GPS and compass were available. For star trail photography, locating the North Star is essential because all other stars appear to move in circular motions around it during long exposures, creating different visual effects depending on camera orientation relative to Polaris. The North Star can be found by locating the Big Dipper constellation and following the line from the end of its ladle.","context":["Wilderness Survival has articles about staying alive in the outdoors.

So a star-trail image is essentially a long exposure ranging from minutes to hours during the night with your camera left pointed at the sky. The stars leave long beautiful streaks across the sky.\nCayo Costa State Park Florida, ISO 200, F5.6, 25min, 17mm\nSome things to consider when shooting a Star-Trail Image:\nBeing able to find the North Star is essential because all the stars move around Polaris. This is important when composing your image because you can end up with a large bulls eye design in your sky or if your shooting more in a southern direction you will get what looks like a rainstorm of falling stars in your image. Any direction you point your camera is OK, but I usually like to keep my North Star off-center for a more interesting image unless something in my foreground strongly suggests a symmetrical composition.\n*More often than not anti-symmetry is what you want for an attention-grabbing composition.\nSo how do you find the North Star? First look for the Big Dipper, which is one of the easiest constellations to find in the night sky. The end of the ladle on the Big Dipper will point you directly to Polaris.\nI like to get a free sky map every month from www.skymaps.com.\nWhen and where to shoot a Star-Trail:\n· I try to get as far away from city lights as possible, even miles away city lights will show up in your exposure illuminating your horizon.\n· Cities also cause “light pollution”. Light pollution is when streetlights and other sources of light keep you from clearly seeing the stars in night sky.\n· Elevation is also a factor in seeing the stars; the higher in elevation you are the clearer the night sky.\n· If you are near civilization it is also a good idea to wait till after 11pm to start shooting your star-trail because of air traffic. Airplanes will put many a blinky light across your frame.\n· Clear nights are good, check the weather forecast.\n· Civil Twilight can also be a factor, the hour after Sunset (dusk) and the hour before Sunrise (dawn) are times when there is still light in the sky that can be picked up by your exposure even if it is not visible to you. This can be a positive or a negative. For example, an exposure taken around 1 am will usually give you a dark sky and foreground but an exposure taken closer to dusk or dawn can add some pretty interesting colors to your sky or foreground, essentially adding a little of that colorful sunrise or sunset light to your exposure.\nSome Equipment and Camera Settings to consider:\nFocal Length of your lens; The wider the better for me when shooting a star-trail and that is because the further away I get from the north star, the farther the stars appear to move in a shorter amount of time, so less time is needed to create that surreal image. If I take a 30 minute exposure; stars closest to the North Star will not appear to travel very far in my image but the further away from it I get the longer the trail of light is on my image.\nExposures can range anywhere from 5 minutes to all night long (depending on battery life) so you will probably need a Shutter Release Cable (or Cable Release). Most cameras are set so that 30 seconds is the longest exposure you can take and after that comes the “bulb” setting. This is the setting you want, it basically means as long as you hold down the button the camera, the camera will take an exposure. But if you’re like me you probably have better things to do than hold that button for and hour without letting go. So getting a good cable release with a shutter lock on it is important. A shutter release cable can range from $10 for the off-brand EBay variety to $100, depending on the bells, whistles and brand. My only recommendation is NOT to buy the wireless versions; they seem like a great idea but often do not have that shutter lock feature that is so important. How else can you walk away from you camera and have some hot cocoa or a nip of Scotch?\n*Remember to make sure you camera has that “bulb” feature if you want to shoot star trails.\nTripods are essential and the sturdier the better. These are long exposures and you do not want your camera to move at all, which makes another great argument for the shutter release cable in that it keeps you from touching (and moving) your camera when you press the shutter.\nIf it is really windy weigh your tripod down. This can be done with a rope, a carbineer and something heavy like a rock or your camera backpack. Tie the rope into one large loop and set it on the outside of each tripod leg, between each tripod leg pull the rope into the center of the tripod and clip it with the carbineer, then set something heavy in the center to weigh down your tripod.\nAnother thing that I never leave home without when I am shooting a star trail is a hand warmer (that’s right those little pocket sized hand-warmers that hunters use). Often between 3-4 am or on really humid or moist nights you can have a big problem with condensation on the lens. To solve this problem, I take a hand-warmer and wrap it once in a hand towel and wrap that around the barrel of my lens secured with a rubber band. Problem solved, no condensation on the lens.\nWith such long exposures you may get some pretty heavy noise in your image. So you may have to consider turning your noise reduction on in the camera menu. Noise reduction takes a second blank frame or in camera dark frame, analyzes the frame for hot or stuck pixels, and then applies that dark frame to areas of your images that need it. This can often help your images out tremendously, but for an hour-long exposure your camera will take a dark frame of equal time making it a two-hour exposure. However, if you choose to leave the noise reduction mode off in your camera you can then use Photoshop, Lightroom and other software programs. They do a pretty good job of noise reduction. Choices!\nYou never know when a car will drive by or you forget your headlamp is on while checking your camera settings, so ALWAYS keep your lens-hood on to avoids lens-flares.\nShoot in RAW! There is a lot of information in a RAW file and therefore a lot of room to play around. If you shoot in JPEG mode you cannot adjust your settings such as temperature. Color temperature is a big one, you can leave it on auto or set your camera to a precise temperature but in the evening the color temperature changes dramatically from the day and it’s a good idea to have the ability to play around with it after the fact.\nI also like to play with the Fill Light slider, Recovery slider and the Blacks slider, these can really bring out a lot more information in exposures that are too dark or light. All other processing for RAW star-trail files is normal.\nIf you are adjusting your exposure or levels using a Histogram it is ok to clip your highlights, as most of these will be stars and it is acceptable if they are blown out. This will help the contrast in your scene overall.\nISO 100 at F4\nISO 200 at 5.6\nYou can play around with this formula but I find this to be a good starting point. It is best to use your camera’s native ISO or the ISO that your camera performs its best at. For many Nikon cameras it is ISO 200 for other cameras it is ISO 100, you can find out in your camera manual.\nThe moon will greatly affect your exposure time with a DSLR; here is my rough guide on exposure times.\nFull Moon Up to 10 Minutes\nHalf Moon 15-25 Min.\nQuarter Moon 30-40 Min.\nNew Moon 50-120 Min. or until your battery runs out.\nTry to train your eye to look for ambient light in the scene, wait for your eyes to adjust if you have to. In this image I saw just a hint of green light in the fog below and it adds a great eerie element to the photo.\nRed River Gorge, Kentucky ISO 200, F5.6, 25 Minutes\nIf you don’t have any ambient light you may want to create some to add an interesting foreground element to scene. This can be done with flashlights, fires, strobe lights and don’t forget some colored gels. The night is like a blank canvas for photographers and lights are our paints.\nIn this image taken at Red River Gorge in the fall, my LED headlamp gave off such a cool blue that the color temperature of the night sky becomes a warm orange.\nISO 200, F5.6, 25 min, 17mm\nThis was quite a dark night on a rocky ledge in a small campsite so I made sure to find my composition during the day so that I was not fumbling around at night.\nRemember to bring a flashlight; this will help you to find the hyper-focal distance on the distance scale in your lens at night. The hyper-focal distance is the distance on your lens where you have the most in focus at one time. To find it set the distance scale on your lens to just inside the infinity symbol (it looks like and 8 that got drunk and passed out). This will help you get the most in-focus in your image instead of relying on your eyes or auto-focus at night. The wider the lens, the more distance you can keep in focus. Remember you can always set everything up during the day and come back to your camera at night if you are worried about the focus or any other settings on your camera.\nDigital vs. Film when shooting Star-Trails:\nWhile most of us have sold or packed up our film cameras there are some unique differences when shooting a star trail on film. The biggest differences is time, here is a 4-hour exposure done on a medium format Mamiya 7 film camera.\nISO 100, F4, 4 hours\nAs you can see it was nice not to have to worry about battery life, I got some nice long star trails and a little bit of residual dawn light coming into my sky. I was also able to do a 4-hour exposure during a quarter moon (light on the trees) because of something called “Reciprocity Failure”. Reciprocity Failure is any exposure over a second long has to be doubled to compensate for how long it takes the light to reach the film. So I could leave my camera out as long as the battery was good and let the exposure “soak” in light all night long.\nDigital sensors do not have reciprocity failure, if your meter says it will take 1 hour to reach middle grey on an exposure then it will take 1 hour. Although most of our meters do not work well in the dark so we end up guessing exposures when in the dark.\n*It is also important to remember that each “stop” or change in exposure time is double the amount of light than the previous one, so the difference between a 1 hour exposure and a 2 hour exposure is really only one stop. Overexposure is not something we really need to worry about when the exposure is that long.\nList of things to remember:\n· Camera with a wide lens\n· Shutter Release Cable\n· Lens Hood\n· Extra Camera Batteries, freshly charged\n· Memory Cards\n· Hand Warmer, Hand towel, Rubber-band\n· Rope and Carbineer\n· Bubble level\n· Flashlight or other light-sources with extra batteries\n· Watch with Alarm for timing exposures\n· Turn off image stabilization/vibration reduction, it will drain your battery and does not work on long exposures, it can cause your image to drift left.\n· Find your Hyper-focal Distance\n· Remove camera straps and anything else that can blow around on your camera and cause your tripod set-up to move.\n· Turn on long exposure noise reduction if you don’t mind doubling your exposure time. It will help any pixel problems due to long exposures.\n· RAW image format\n· Camera on Manual Mode\n· Shutter speed on Bulb\n· Look for ambient light that may be in your exposure\n· Check the weather report and sky map.\n· IPod or other entertainment source (hey, sometimes it’s scary out in the woods alone).\nRemember to experiment a lot and bring some coffee.

{"question":"I've heard about major government changes in South Africa - were Nelson Mandela and South Africa both liberated from their respective restrictions in the same year?","answer":"No, Nelson Mandela's release and South Africa's return to the Olympics happened one year apart. Mandela was released from prison on February 11, 1990, after 27 years of imprisonment, and the ban on the ANC was lifted in the same year. South Africa's return to Olympic participation came in 1991, when the International Olympics Committee lifted their 21-year ban on South African athletes. This timing aligned with South Africa's broader transition away from apartheid, as Mandela became president of the African National Congress (ANC) in 1991 and would later become South Africa's first black president in 1994.","context":["Has A Country Ever Been Banned From The Olympics? Oh Yeah\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) dropped a bombshell on Dec. 5 when they announced that they were outright banning Russia from participating in the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The ban comes after the IOC found Russia guilty of running an extensive, state-sponsored doping program and interfering with the anti-doping lab in the 2014 Sochi games. The punishment is definitely harsh, but Russia isn't the first country banned from the Olympics. Not even close.\nAs recently as 2016, countries have been barred from participating in the Olympic games. Kuwait, for example, was banned from the 2016 summer games in Rio de Janeiro after the country passed a law allowing interference with national sports federations, an IOC \"no-no,\" according to The Washington Post. Kuwaiti athletes were able to participate as neutrals under the Olympic flag — similar to stipulations for Russian athletes, though admittedly the requirements for Russia are much stricter due to the extent to which the country went to cheat in the 2014 games.\nSimilarly, India was banned for the first few days of the 2014 games in Sochi for corruption, according to the BBC.\nBut the practice of banning individual countries isn't anything new.\nIn fact, it dates back almost 100 years.\nThe 1920 games in Antwerp, Belgium — right after World War I ended — included 29 countries, according to the Olympic Games website. What they fail to mention, however, is who was barred from participating. According to Canadian Olympic Team's official website, the aggressors who started WWI — Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey — were not invited to the games.\nSimilarly, Germany and Japan, the Axis powers in World War II, were not invited to the 1948 games in London.\nThe longest ban probably goes to South Africa, which was banned from competing in any Olympic games for 28 years due to apartheid. In 1963, the committee announced that South Africa had until the end of the year to address racial discrimination in their country, or they would not be allowed to participate in the 1964 games in Tokyo. South Africa wasn't invited to participate until 1991 — just before the 1992 games in Barcelona.\nThe (kind of) country formerly known as Rhodesia, now known as Zimbabwe, was also banned from the Olympics in 1972. Rhodesia was formed as a whites-only government, and their racist politics led the IOC to outright ban them from the 1972 games in Munich, four days before the games began — thanks to uproarious protests from African countries. The country was dissolved and reformed as Zimbabwe before they had had a chance to compete again.\nPlenty of other countries have been banned at various times in Olympic history, as well, including Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, which banned women from participating, and so was banned, in turn, by the IOC from the 2000 Sydney games. After the fall of the Taliban, Afghanistan was invited back to the 2004 games in Athens.\nThe IOC has a habit of using bans to respond to social ills.\nThis is perhaps why they felt it necessary to not only ban Russia, but to pass other sanctions, including a $15 million fine (which will reimburse the IOC for the investigation and contribute to the creation of an Independent Testing Authority). The IOC is making no secret of the fact that they are trying to send a message about doping.\nSeveral officials associated with the 2014 doping scandal have been banned from participating in the Olympic games ever again. Numerous Russian athletes who were found to have been using performance enhancing drugs have had their medals vacated. Russian athletes who wish to participate in the 2018 games may only do so after going through a rigorous application process, proving they're clean, and they may only compete as neutrals, under the Olympic flag.\nIt may seem harsh on the face, but according to the IOC, Russia's cheating is \"unprecedented.\" Russia has been found guilty of funding a large, state-sponsored doping program, the likes of which the world has never seen. The Russian Ministry of Sport was additionally found to have put together a team that, in the dead of night during the 2014 games, \"tampered with more than 100 urine samples to conceal evidence of top athletes’ steroid use throughout the course of competition,\" per The New York Times.\nAfter the IOC announced that it would ban Russia from the 2018 games, quite a few Russian athletes and government officials said the punishment was too severe, per both The Washington Post and The Moscow Times. For example, national ski jumping champion Irina Avvakumova reportedly said, “I don’t know how other athletes will react, but I haven’t trained for years to go somewhere to not compete on behalf of my country. It’s not sportslike to go to the Olympics just in order to be there.\"\nIOC President Thomas Bach said of Russia's cheating, \"This was an unprecedented attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and sport.\" He called the sanctions \"proportional\" to the crime, \"while protecting the clean athletes.\"","|1918 || |\n- July 18\n- Rolihlahla Dalibhunga Mandela is born into the Mabida clan.

{"question":"When comparing the construction complexity of basic Eddy kites versus tetrahedral kites, what are the key differences in materials and assembly requirements?","answer":"Eddy kites are relatively simple in construction, requiring primarily spars (which can be made of wood, dowelling, bamboo, or fiberglass) and a sail, with the main challenge being ensuring even bowing of the cross-spars. In contrast, tetrahedral kites are more complex, requiring multiple identical cells each made with 6 sharpened skewers, vinyl tubes, sail material, and various adhesives. The tetra construction involves more intricate assembly steps including making precise joints, creating multiple sails, and carefully connecting cells together. Additionally, tetrahedral kites require special consideration for dismantling, with specific joints left unglued to allow the structure to fold flat for transport.","context":["A kite may be made convex to the wind by either of two methods:\nWilliam Eddy, a journalist from New Jersey, was motivated by the desire to lift meterological and photographic equipment, for which he needed a good steady flyer. He seems to have been aware of the existance of bowed kites from Java (the Malay kite) but, being unable to obtain reliable information about them, reinvented the form himself. His kite rapidly superceeded McAidie's flat barn door kite for meterological purposes.\nModern diamond kites may be either bowed or dihedral, and may have a keel both to aid stability and to avoid the need for a bridle. Such kites are sometimes loosely refered to as Eddys or Malays even though they may differ significantly from their antecedants. In particular, Eddy's kite had a bowed cross-spar and a loose sail, the sail folding back against the spine so as to form a keel at its lower end. This also aided stability, but Eddy's seminal contribution was that he was apparently the first person to explain (and so exploit) the stabilising effect of a bow or dihedral.\nMalays and Eddys are good light to moderate wind flyers. However, the smaller toy shop examples often need a stiff breeze to fly well since with a smaller sail area the lift to weight ratio is less favourable; a minimum size of spar is required to survive enthusiastic handling by children. Another factor is that some such kites rely on wind pressure to induce the bow, without which they tend to fly in circles, or more often a semicircle ending in a meteoric collision with a used planet, inconsiderately left in their path by a profligate civilisation!\nCharlie Charlton gives a very simple plan entitled \"So you want to make a kite\".\nThe bow and the large sail area make it an excellent stable lifting kite, which, together with its simple construction, make it a favourite amongst enthusiasts today, whether for lifting parachuting teddybears, displaying \"line laundry\" (windsocks etc), providing a canvas for an artistic talent, or simply for drying the kids' swimsuits on the line!\nThe lower cross-spar is bowed slightly more than the upper one for stability. Although wood, such as dowelling or bamboo, can be successfully used for spars, care has to be taken to ensure that it bows evenly along its length. An unevenness not easily measured, was sufficient to make my first rok (39k) fly at 45 degrees. This applies to a greater or lesser extent to all bowed kites; use of fibreglass for the cross-spars overcomes this problem, but it's still important to make the kite symetrical and evenly balanced.\nSeveral sets of plans are available on the net, probably the most detailed being Charlie Charlton's 1.2m Rok ©Charlie Charlton.\nIn 1901, Marconi used a Levitator kite to lift his aerial to some 400ft for his historic first transatlantic radio tests. The choice of kite was plainly not ideal since his first attempt resulted in the loss of a kite, and he barely succeeded with the second, faced with violent instability.\nIt's a good light wind kite which flies with the line at a high angle on account of its high aspect ratio. Cheap plastic deltas are often seen for sale at beach kiosks, and seem to fly well in hardly any wind. In fact, I've often seen them still flying when I couldn't find anything in my kite bag that would stay up!\nAn excellent site dedicated to delta kites is well worth a visit. It also includes fascinating details of how they have been used with great success in training falcons!\nEden gives plans for several variants of the delta. Online plans for several variants are also available. Charlie Charlton has plans for yet another delta variant. Here is a picture ©Charlie Charlton (10k) of it.\nPlans are given by Pelham but in greater detail by Eden. Thomas-Michael Rudolph gives online plans, and the same site also gives plans for the original Roloplan, which give an interesting insight into where the Pearson roller came from even if you have no intention of building one.\nHere is a roller (11k) built to TMR's plan by Patrick Mann.\nIn the East, fighter kites are used in battles, with lines impregnated with ground glass (known as manja) in order to cut opponents' kites out of the sky. It is by no means unusual for someone to put up a kite from the roof of his house and to be engaged in battle by another flyer from a distance of 1000 yards (yes, a thousand!) Nor is it unusual for people to fall off their roofs in the excitement, or for children to get injured by traffic as they run through the streets after defeated kites. And in Afganistan, kite-flying has been banned because of the danger to children chasing kites across minefields.\nThese kites are controlled entirely by line tension. As the flying line is allowed to relax the kite becomes flat and flies in circles, but as soon as tension is applied, the cross-spar bows and the kite flies off in whatever direction it was pointing at that instant. With a well balanced kite and a little practice, it is possible to set it in rotation in either direction at will since it always tends to start rotating in the direction which takes it quickest to 12 o'clock. Although becoming an expert takes years of practice, you can master the basic technique in ten minutes, and it won't be long before you can impress your friends. They won't know whether it's going where you intend it too! Flying a fighter is like nothing else; someone (I forget who) compared it to having a leaf, dancing in the wind, on the end of your string. Even though you may have no hope or ambition of becoming an expert, a fighter is so easy and cheap to make or buy that no kite flyer should miss the experience.\nOne man launching is tricky for a beginner, and if you have to learn by yourself, your first fighter is likely to take a beating. Launching from your hand is possible but difficult because control is very hard on a short line. The alternative is to make or improvise a launching stand to hold the kite upright and facing the wind but leaning back, while you unwind 30 - 50ft of line. A firm pull will then launch it straight up. Concentrate on maintaining altitude while you get the hang of it. Normal practice is to use a spool from which you can pull line continuously as you need it. As you pull the line in, you let it drop at your feet in a pile from which it can be let out again as needed.\nPlans are available on the net for several fighters, such as this Indian Fighter, and this Hata (both in French, English translations available for the Indian Fighter and Hata). Patrick Pann has some useful tips on splitting bamboo.\nIf fighters intrigue you, there is an excellent fighter kites web site with many pictures.\nIt was invented by Alexander Graham Bell, better known for his other invention, the telephone. Some have suggested that he should have stuck to kites and saved the world from a veritable scourge, but in fact, his kite experiments post-dated the telephone and were funded by the modest wealth the earlier invention brought him.\nBell's kite, often simply known as the Tetra, is a real head-turner, and is highly stable, given a fresh wind, on account of the large dihedral content of its structure. However, it requires a lot of sparing, and the weight of this together with the high angle at which the lifting surfaces are set to the wind result in a low angle of flight.\nAnother unusual feature of the tetra is that it can be made in any size simply by combining a suitable number of identical cells. A single tetrahedral cell is a poor flyer, but a 4 cell tetra flies reasonably well, if a bit wobbly. In fact, the performance improves progressively as you increase the number of cells.\nIn 1907, Bell built a tetrahedral kite which he called the \"Cygnet\", consisting of 3393 cells, with an opening in the centre to carry a man. Equipped with floats and towed by a steamer, it flew beautifully for 7 minutes over Baddock Bay, Nova Scotia, carrying Thomas Selfridge of the US Army. The descent was so gentle that, with his vision obscured by the structure around him, he was unaware that he was coming down until the kite touched the water. Unfortunately, the line from the steamer was not released quickly enough and the kite was destroyed as it was dragged through the sea. Nevertheless, Selfridge escaped with nothing worse than a dunking.\nThe hardest part in building a tetra is in joining the spars. Three different types of joint are required, and if each is designed to hinge in a particular way, the whole structure can be folded flat - a big advantage for transportation.\nA tetra may seem a formidible kite to build, but in fact you can make your own very easily out of drinking straws and mylar gift wrap, held together with thread and sticky tape. Rob and Tony have plans for more robust tetra, using rigid spars, which is hardly more difficult, though rather more costly and time consuming. Their site also has pictures of their creations. An interesting alternative method of construction using internal bracing for the cells is given by Eden, although this doesn't allow easy collapsing for transport. Here is a picture of one of Anthony Thyssen's tetras.","Tetrahedron Box Kite\nThe Tetrahedron Box Kite was originally designed by Alexander Graham Bell. It has a beautiful geometric structure made up of identical tetrahedron pyramids. It can be made of four, sixteen cells or MORE! With sixteen cells it is a very stable flyer. This design can be collapsed down to an easy to transport, flat triangle. Note to educators: One tetrahedron per student can then be combined to make a fantastic kite which then becomes a great geometric sculpture.

{"question":"How do successful postal modernization efforts align with the '3Bs' framework for digital strategy implementation?","answer":"For postal services like NIPOST, modernization efforts align with the '3Bs' framework in several ways. For Buyer, postal services must understand new customer needs in the digital era, including e-commerce and financial services. For Brand, they need to reposition from traditional mail delivery to a digital-age service provider. For Build, they require new infrastructure development, including e-commerce platforms and digital payment systems. This matches the framework's emphasis on understanding customer needs, aligning business solutions with those needs, and building proper infrastructure for delivery - all while maintaining coordination between digital and manual processes.","context":["Written by the Editorial board of The Guardian Newspaper\nWith the emerging challenges facing postal services as a result of digital era technological developments, the plan by the Federal Government to upgrade the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) into a “mega-conglomerate” is worthwhile. That, indeed, may be the only way to ensure the survival of the organisation.\nConventional postal service, today, is confronted by many new competition and threats from technological as well as lifestyle developments. With the growth in e-commerce that has made shopping online more convenient, even packages and parcels hitherto conveyed by post have become the forte of sundry courier services. Also digital services of mails, and other e-messaging channels on mobile phones or other devices have drastically reduced the number of letters sent through the post. So, the old style post office in Nigeria, as in any other country, faces a bleak future. The implication is that only a postal service willing to adjust to the emerging reality can remain in business.\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that Minister of Communications Adebayo Shittu, disclosed recently, while receiving Acting Director-General of the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), a plan by NIPOST to expand its services into e-commerce, e-learning/library services and issuance of Nigerian passport and driver’s licence, among other security documents.\nBut the pertinent questions are: how does his ministry intend to do this and what would be the role or the impact of the plan on some of the agencies already responsible for these services?\nThe minister said that to achieve the objective, government will constitute a technical committee to proffer solutions to the issues militating against the Nigerian Postal Service and enunciate a policy direction to harness the economic potentials of the organisation. The hope is that the committee will be thorough in its assessment and recommendations.\nWhile it must be acknowledged that there are yet untapped potentials in NIPOST, that even though the agency is in a near comatose state, it has sufficient assets to generate viable economic and commercial services. For instance, according to the minister, the new NIPOST would be equipped to deliver financial services to remote areas currently excluded by financial institutions. This is commendable, given the agency’s antecedents and age-long reach.\nWhile the plan to reposition NIPOST is absolutely in order, however, it is not clear how it intends to re-invent itself under the proposed new “mega” structure? Truth is that most of the services within the proposed framework of the new NIPOST are privately driven and owned. This would be a challenge to such framework as is being envisaged for NIPOST, as the services hardly lend themselves to the lethargy or bottlenecks of the civil service.\nWhat NIPOST wants to do requires a different infrastructure with different skills and patterns of employment for employees. Certainly, a large chunk of NIPOST’s existing staff may not be versed in the kind of technology that is crucial in e-commerce. The organisation would, therefore, have to enhance staff capability through training; otherwise, a new crop of employees may be required entirely for effective transition. The challenge is not only in coping with new developments in service delivery but also in the quality of those services. Now, NIPOST needs to function properly in its current state before even contemplating a transition to more sophisticated operations\nNIPOST is still largely an anachronistic organisation whose operations now are far from satisfactory. This must first change before thinking of a leap into digital, highly sophisticated areas of commerce, documentation and others. Certainly this can be achieved if properly planned and executed. But first things first. The agency should make plans as appropriate and should also consider going into the proposed new areas as business. Civil servants cannot provide the efficient services required in the new regime.\nNo doubt, NIPOST served useful purposes in the past, with its very wide network. NIPOST used to provide post office savings account for its customers. And of course, the use of Money or Postal Order as a means of payment was well-known then. It can leverage on this network to create a niche for itself. But it should not raise hope except it is ready to effectively retune itself. This re-invention should start from the law establishing NIPOST. Afterwards, it has to develop a business mindset, institutionalise it and get removed from the civil service mode to make the ventures profitable. Then, the appropriate investments should be made on infrastructure and human capital before NIPOST can make the most of the new age business it seeks to venture into.","To risk becoming obsolete, companies around the world are pouring millions into digital transformation initiatives. Many, though, are putting the proverbial cart before the horse— investing in technologies rather than doing what’s needed first: changing their overall business strategy.\nA smart digital strategy is the foundation of a successful digital transformation. That means aligning tech investments with business goals and then using digital and manual processes to facilitate change. It’s about making wise non-digital choices to maximize competitive advantage, growth, profit, and value and then implementing them with the right digital tools.\nThe Evolving Definition of Digital Strategy\nJust as the definition of a business strategy has evolved, so, too, has the meaning of a digital strategy. Though digital transformation initiatives and digital strategies are related, the two terms and concepts are vastly different.\n- A digital transformation is about taking traditional, manual processes within a business and then using digital technologies to create better efficiency and scalability. This is typically accomplished by replacing old manual techniques and processes with new digital ones.\n- A digital strategy is based on the entire business perspective or the “roll-out” of a digital transformation. For instance, what is your plan to go from where you are to where you want to be?\nIn terms of marketing, which is where we sit, a digital strategy can be viewed as a microcosm or core business function that’s intended to undergo some form of digital transformation.\nIf you’re new to the idea of developing a digital strategy, the distinction can be a little confusing. Adding to the confusion is explaining what “a digital strategy” is can depend on who you ask. Some people use John Godfrey Saxe’s analogy of the elephant and blind men where each man touches a different part of the elephant, so each describes the animal differently. A true digital strategy is made up of many parts that you must see in totality if you hope to make it a successful one.\nCreating a Strong Digital Strategy Foundation\nBusinesses in every industry are using digital technologies like automation to speed up processes, remove manual efforts like data entry, and reduce repetitive tasks. Done right, this approach makes processes faster, more scalable, and more efficient.\nYour professional services organisation has digital requirements that differ from other providers, even within your sector. But there are certain digital strategy rules organisations consistently use to gain a competitive advantage. We’ll go over the rules first and then discuss where they fit in with a digital marketing strategy.\nRule 1: Assess Digital Impact\nAll good digital plans start with a deep understanding of the market and your place in it. It’s also important to consider how adopting digital strategies will change your organisation and the marketplace at large. What new services can digital enable? Will it empower competitors in new ways? It’s crucial to open your mind to all the possible ways digital can be used strategically in your business. Can it shorten delivery times? Might you be able to create proprietary software to offer your customers and clients?\nRule 2: Set Digital Ambitions High\nOrganisations that succeed in the digital sphere do it by thinking big. That doesn’t mean it has to be expensive. Still, your digital strategy should aim to strengthen existing offerings and tap into new ones. This can be significantly profitable if you’re one of the first in your sector to invest in digital strategies. Two great examples of established market leaders who failed to dream big when it came to digital are Kodak and Blockbuster. Kodak actually invented digital photography but did not foresee the virtual death of film. Blockbuster’s online movie platform predated Netflix, but the company prioritized its franchises.\nOn the flip side, when Starbucks’ same-store sales started to lag, the company embraced digital. It developed new ways for customers to order and pay for their purchases and rolled out a digital loyalty program. It wasn’t long before mobile sales were increasing twice as fast as in-store ones.\nRule 3: Manage Priorities\nWhen choosing which areas to focus on, a customer-centric approach based on competitive advantage and value creation is critical. To figure out where to place your priorities, ask yourself: of all the customer pain points that a digital strategy can address, which ones are your professional services organisation positioned to meet? Which of those offerings have the greatest value potential to your organisation?\nIn general, focusing on two or three pain points to start often leads to greater clarity of what can be accomplished. Short-term wins like digital marketing can help your organisation achieve specific digital goals while winning new business and increasing your bottom line.\nRule 4: Increase Digital Capabilities\nBuilding a digital strategy calls for an open mind and cultural shifts. Professional services organisations must build new “strategic muscles” that strengthen their traditional offerings and ensure old and new processes work together in a coordinated way. Adopting a digital culture is essential to a successful digital strategy. Leadership and staff must work as one to meet the challenges a digital transformation brings.\nRule 5: Actively Manage Digital Strategies\nWhile you don’t need to transform your entire operation when building a digital strategy, some issues should be considered, such as industry and market trends. As with any organisational changes, a digital strategy must be tracked for success and processes adjusted as needed.\nWhere A Digital Strategy Fits in Your Business Strategy\nFrom a marketing point of view, a digital strategy is simply a plan:\n- What is our goal?\n- What do we want to improve in our marketing function?\nOnce there’s a defined goal, we focus on what we here at Dash refer to as “The 3Bs.”\n- B is for Buyer. Who is the buyer? What are their needs? What is their buyer’s journey, and how do they go through making a purchasing decision?\n- B is for Brand. What is your brand or message? How will we align your business and your solutions to your buyer at every stage of their journey?\n- B is for Build. This is where digital transformation comes into play in the marketing function. What core infrastructure needs to be in place to allow you to consistently showcase and deliver your brand and its message to your buyers at the right stages over the course of their journeys?\nYour organisation’s core infrastructure can include things like:\n- A website.\n- Lead generation, capture, and nurturing methods.\n- How subscriber, customer, member, and lead data is automatically collected, stored, and maintained.\n- How content is distributed to buyers.\n- How digital processes are integrated with necessary manual ones, such as the sales process. For instance, can your digital infrastructure notify someone in sales or in business development when a lead should be manually called?\nDo some digital strategies work better than others? For certain organisations, yes. But what all successful professional services digital strategies have in common is they focus more on new customers and new services and less on cost-efficiency.\nMany professional services organisations find that one of the most effective digital tools is their website. Yet most firms miss out on the major opportunities a website offers, using it instead as an expanded Yellow Pages.\nEighty-five percent of consumers say they conduct online research before making a purchase. For professional service organisations, that number is greater than 60 percent. In a digital world where customers are in control, your organisation’s website can be an incredibly powerful tool for driving new business relationships and connecting with more clients.\nWhen Digital Strategies Fail\nWhen a digital strategy fails, it’s generally because there was a failure to plan. To return to our website discussion:\n- Has your site been designed to capture new clients or just feed people information?\n- Does your website look like your competitors’ sites? Was it built with a generic template?\n- Can visitors to your site immediately tell what sets your organization apart?\n- Is your site set up to close deals?\nSo, again, it’s important you:\n- Have a clear goal, a singular vision for what you want your digital strategy to achieve.\n- Define what a successful digital strategy looks like.\n- Build a consistent brand.\n- Decide which channels to invest in.\n- Invest sufficient time and money to make the strategy work.\n- Be willing to take the competition head-on with a competitive positioning strategy.\n- Track and measure your efforts.\nA digital strategy that lacks stringent planning is like throwing darts blindfolded. You can’t see where you’re aiming, and you can’t see if your darts are hitting their mark. Developing a solid digital marketing plan helps you identify what makes your professional services organisation unique and makes sure your message is delivered to the right audience at the right time on the right channels.\nAssessing Digital’s Strategic Impact\nWhen it’s time to evaluate your organisation’s digital strategy, we can circle back around to where we began: with the 3Bs.\n- Buyer. Are you reaching your ideal client, or is it time to reexamine your target customer profiles? Have you clearly articulated how your solutions can solve their pain points? Are your messaging strategies working? Are key words and phrases hitting their mark?\n- Brand. Are you digitally present in the right places? Are you marketing your brand where your audience hangs out? Is it time to reevaluate how you’re positioning your brand?\n- Build. Is your message reaching potential leads at the right stage of their journey? What is your overall ROI?\nIf you want to see a return on your digital transformation and digital strategy goals, they should align with your business priorities. Put another way, your digital efforts should always aim to advance significant organisational goals and solve problems for your customers.

{"question":"What are the key differences between xeriscaping and hot composting techniques for gardening in challenging conditions?","answer":"Xeriscaping and hot composting are distinct gardening approaches for different conditions. Xeriscaping is recommended for very dry or extreme climates, involving growing plants in gravel or small pebbles without soil, particularly suitable for drought-prone gardens. In contrast, hot composting, specifically the Berkeley Method, is an 18-day process of creating nutrient-rich soil by mixing green and brown materials in a 50:50 ratio, requiring frequent watering and turning every 2 days. While xeriscaping focuses on drought-resistance and using plants that tolerate low-fertility soils, hot composting aims to create rich soil through decomposition at high temperatures (55-65 degrees Celsius) to support plant growth.","context":["As every gardener knows, one of the key things you need if you are going to grow plants is good soil. When using permaculture this necessity can sometimes be challenged; for example, in very dry or extreme (very dry/very wet) climates such as Mediterranean, some people recommend using no soil at all but instead growing all of your plants in gravel or small pebbles. This technique, suggested by for example Hemenway (1), is known as xeriscaping and might be worth a try if your garden is particularly prone to drought. On the other end of the spectrum, aquaculture is a technique that involves one’s crops being entirely submerged in water, which has been used for centuries in Asia and whose modern proponents include Christenson (2015) (2).\nIf you prefer to plant your crops in the ground, however, it is definitely worth adding compost to them to aid their growth by enriching the soil and adding much-needed nutrients. One of the most fulfilling (and cheapest!) ways to do this is to make the compost yourself. Below I will share some tips on how to create top-quality compost in an easy way.\nGreen and Brown\nProbably the most important thing to remember when you are making compost is getting the proportion of materials right so that the decomposition will happen in a way which keeps the nutrients alive. Usually this is spoken of as the relation of “green” to “brown” materials; green being anything fresh with a generally higher balance of nitrogen, such as freshly cut plants and grass, and brown being dry, more carbon-rich materials such as straw, sawdust and ash. To get rich compost you need around a 50:50 ratio of brown: green. This is by necessity a rough guide as you are not expected to be closely measuring the materials as you add them, but is useful to remember. For more detailed suggestions on the exact ratios of carbon to nitrogen and how much of each material is present in many commonly-found materials, try checking out (3) and (4).\nOne thing that is worth getting hold of if you can is some manure, which is very high in nitrogen and so can be added in small quantities as the kind of ‘spice’ of the compost recipe.\nHot and Cold\nThere are two main techniques for making home-made compost. Cold compost means gathering the materials together in a pile and leaving them to decompose naturally at their own rate. For this technique you still need to get the ratio of “green” to “brown” to be about even but there is less work involved as once you have mixed the materials together you simply need to leave it to its own devices. This technique is useful for a small kitchen compost pile which you can add kitchen waste to on a daily basis, balancing it out with carbon-rich “brown” to keep the ratio healthy. A slightly more complicated method is that of hot compost, which I will concentrate on in this article.\nThe Berkeley Method\nThe style of hot composting with which I am most familiar is known as the Berkeley Method as it was apparently first developed at the University of California in Berkeley (3). There are a number of reasons why you may want to utilise this method instead of cold composting:\n– It is much quicker than cold composting so you can use your compost more immediately\n– The high temperatures produced by the decomposition kill any unwanted seeds which may be present, so the compost is safe to use on your garden\n– If you want to get really technical and “multiple functions for each element”, you could use it as part of a water-heating system (see for example 5)\nSome things to consider about this style of hot composting:\n– It uses a lot of material right at the beginning so you need to have access to a large amount of organic matter all at once\n– It also uses a fair amount of space – 1m x 1m x 1m is the usual recommended minimum – so is maybe not that practical if you are just planting up your back garden\nHaving taken these factors into consideration, if you feel the Berkeley Method is for you then read on!\nHow it works\nThe idea of hot compost is that you collect enough green and brown material (in the correct ratio) together that when you pile it up in a heap which you then aerate by turning it creates really great conditions for speedy decomposition to happen. This is due mainly to the presence of aerobic bacteria, which are the fastest digesters of organic matter (6). They are the reason for the need to create the right balance of carbon to nitrogen, and they also need a significant amount of oxygen to survive, which is why hot compost is turned to aerate it. The Berkeley Method has developed an exact time period when it’s best to do your aerating, which culminates in finished compost in just 18 days.\nYou will need:\n– A space to put the pile which is over 2m x 2m\n– A mix of green and brown materials\n– Lots of water ready to hand (if you have a hose that will reach the pile this is probably easiest)\n– Tarpaulin or other material to cover the pile when you leave it to rot\nStep 1: Gather materials and choose space\nAs with any task which involves creating something, the first step is to source what you will use and choose where you will place it. As mentioned, the hot compost pile you are creating needs to be at least 1m x 1m x 1m square, and you will be turning the compost so ideally you need enough space for 2 compost piles, plus manoeuvring space to give you the chance to turn it. It can be bigger, but you will probably want to keep it in a cube-like shape when first creating it (though the sides will inevitably slip down as the decomposition takes hold) so bear this in mind when siting the pile.\nNext you need to find what you will put in the hot compost pile. In order to maximise efficiency, it is probably best to start your pile immediately after doing some kind of big weeding/grass cutting/pruning/woodwork/fire making/all of the above; as all of these activities create by-products which are perfect materials to make compost with. Gather all of the materials together next to where you will place the pile so that it is easy to pile them on top of each other. Remember that very roughly, you want about a 50:50 mix of green (e.g. fresh plant matter and especially nutrient-rich plants such as clover, nettles, comfrey, alfalfa) to brown (e.g. sawdust, ash, straw, and dry plant matter). The other essential thing you will be adding is water, and lots of it, so if your pile is within reach of your garden hose this will make creating the compost a lot easier than if you have to bring water in from afar.\nStep 2: Mix ingredients\nUsing the pitchfork and/or shovel, begin layering up your ingredients in the space you have chosen. Just start piling them on top of each other, a few pitchfork-fulls at a time – going from the ‘brown’ material to the ‘green’, to ensure an even mix. You can also add the manure ‘spice’ every few layers.\nOnce your pile is big enough you can begin to shape it. The most optimum shape is as close to a cube as you can manage; the corners ensure that the pile can stay relatively intact as the decomposition takes hold. You can create the corners by taking your pitchfork, sticking it into the middle of the pile, and then moving it gently up and down as you pull back from the centre to the edge. Do this on all corners, anytime you see that the pile is beginning to slip.\nAlong with your plant-based materials, key ingredients are air and water. To aerate the compost pile, again use the pitchfork by sticking it into the pile at regular intervals to ensure there is some air flow needed.\nAs the pile grows, you need to be adding water every couple of layers, or every 4 inches (10cm) or so. When adding the water, pour it liberally onto the pile, ensuring everything gets saturated. The pile will soak up a lot of water before it begins running out of the bottom, but even when it does, you can still keep adding more as you pile up more dry ingredients.\nStep 3: Cover and leave\nOnce the pile is at least 1m tall, 1m wide and 1m long it is ready to leave. Douse the pile once more with water, and do some final shaping with the pitchfork to ensure the form is capable of optimum conditions. Then take the tarpaulin, and cover the compost pile. You may wat to weigh the tarpaulin down with rocks, tyres, bricks, pallets or other heavy items.\nNow it is time for the first period of decomposition. This is four days. It is probably a good idea to note down the date when you will need to turn it. Then just leave the pile for the microbes to get on with their work.\nStep 4: the Turning\nAfter 4 days have passed it’s time to turn the compost over. Before taking any action, you may wish to test the efficacy of your pile by sticking your hand into the centre, or (if for some reason you don’t feel like getting half-decomposed material all over your hand), poking a stick inside to make a hole. The hole should be steaming, or your hand should be hot. When you turn the pile over you will move all of the really hot central material to the edges so that the whole pile will become evenly rotten. It also allows for more aeration to add oxygen to the mix.\nTo turn the pile, take it apart from the top down, layer by layer in the opposite way from which you built it. A pitchfork is probably the handiest tool to do this with. Ensure that much of the thick, hot stuff gets moved outwards and the things which have not begun fully rotting yet go into the centre where they can get in on the heat action. Every few layers, add water again as previously. As with when first creating the pile, try to make the corners as accented as possible by wiggling the pitchfork from the centre to the edges.\nOnce you have rebuilt the pile next to the place where it originally was, cover it with the tarpaulin again. The next times you have to turn the compost are every two days for fourteen days.\nStep 5: rest and repeat\nOn day six, 2 days after the first turning, when you come to your compost pile the centre should be between 55 and 65 degrees Celsius. If it is too cool you will not see steam rising when you put your hand inside and if it is too hot it may develop a kind of white mould (3). You may wish to use a thermometer to check the temperature. If it is too hot, make sure you move all of the central material to edges and the edge material to the centre, and aerate the entire pile with your pitchfork. The mould should disappear once the compost cools down enough.\nEvery time you turn the compost, follow the same guidelines as step 4. You need to turn the compost every 2 days after the first turning, so on day 6, day 8, day 10, day 12, day 14, day 16 and day 18.\nStep 6: Enjoy your new compost\nAfter 18 days, when you come to turn the compost, you ideally want to be encountering rich, dark brown earth, with all the materials fully broken down. This compost is now ready to use. As with all compost, it may be a little strong to place directly onto seedlings and young plants, but is an ideal addition to potting mix or can be used on trees or in garden beds.\nCreating healthy soil is one of the most basic and rewarding things we can do. As well as benefiting our plants and helping us to grow things for food and other uses, we are contributing to the wider ecosystem and helping the earth to regenerate. An enjoyable task indeed.\n1.

These three factors support a wide range of landscaping ideas.\nDrought-Resistant Native and Local Plants\nIn parts of North America, where drinkable water is becoming scarce, the archetypal turf lawn's days are numbered. In the southwest USA, they are nearly extinct already. Plants that can survive on low quantities of water are the most popular for xeriscape gardens. Among these are varieties of ornamental grass like maidengrass, northern sea oats, and blue fescue.\nFlowering plants that are water-misers include lamb's ears, coneflower in various colors, bluebeard, coreopsis \"moonbeam,\" and stonecrop. They have tiny clustered blooms instead of large, wide-open flower heads. Many types of native daylily and iris, along with California poppy also resist drought well, and have the large, colorful heads that most garden lovers consider true flowers, instead of herbs.\nDecorative leaf plants that can manage on little water include cosmos and hosta. Both have been popular for edging of gardens of all kinds for decades.\nTIP: Our expert gardening advisor, Susan Patterson adds, \"New plants require water to set roots, consider a rain barrel to conserve water.\"\nTolerance of Low-Fertility and Sandy Soils\nAlong with low water demand, many xeriscape plants flourish in soils low in humus. In fact some, like maidenhair and northern sea oats, prefer well-drained, sandy soils.\nBeneficial and Aesthetic Wildlife Garden Design\nMany xeriscape plants are beloved by butterflies and hummingbirds, who feast on the nectar of the tiny flowers. Among these are the Autumn Joy variety of stonecrop, bluebeard, and coreopsis. The dark heads of coneflowers draw dazzling goldfinches to your garden. Lamb's ear, on the other hand, proves helpful in keeping deer away from your xeriscape garden. The soft fuzzy texture of the leaves is reportedly repellent to deer.\nTIP: Susan suggests, \"Choose plants that are appropriate for your growing region.\"\nTraditional Row Design\nXeriscape gardens can be laid out in traditional rows, with tallest plants at the back, intermediate height plants in a center row, and a short-growing type in the front. Alternate the rows with grasses, shrubs and flowering plants. Leave room between for sunlight to reach the stalks and leaves, but shade the roots.\nClump and Scatter Design\nOn a site that gets full sun, group the plants that love the light. Place bluebeard in the centre of a circle. Orbit it with hosta and edge with a low grass like blue fescue.\nRock Garden Design\nXeriscape landscaping also complements a rock or terrace garden on a slope. Plant the least thirsty on the highest terrace or slope of the rock garden, in clumps rather than ruler-straight lines. On lower levels, place the ground cover that needs more water.\nMonochrome Rock Garden Design\nCoordinate foliage with rock color for a xeriscape that highlights texture rather than color, using non-flowering plants and grasses with silver or pale green leaves among light and dark gray river-smoothed rocks.\nHandkerchief Lawn Design\nOn your tiny inner-city front lawn, remove the turf grass altogether and plant coneflowers, iris, poppy, and lavender in a border around an ornamental grass like maidenhair. Your neighbors will stop to chat more often."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0f0a34d9-1d3a-4f05-b0f0-e74d975a4c50>","<urn:uuid:b902fc13-0fe2-4885-b613-1f86ac8e8444>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm making both a slipcover and doing embroidery - which one requires more precise measurement and marking?","answer":"Making a slipcover requires more precise measurement and marking. For slipcovers, you need exact measurements with specific additions (4 inches to width and length measurements, plus 1/2-inch seam allowances) and precise marking with tailor's chalk to follow existing seams. Multiple pieces must be carefully measured and marked, including the back, sides, seat area, armrests, and cushion covers. In contrast, embroidery marking mainly involves transferring patterns and doesn't require such precise dimensional measurements, focusing instead on stitch placement and technique.","context":["How to Make Slipcover Patterns\nYou can go to the store and buy a slipcover pattern that loosely conforms to the dimensions of your piece of furniture, but making your own pattern allows you to get your slipcover’s curves, contours, width, and length just right. Muslin is a terrific fabric for slipcover planning:\nBuy more muslin than you think you’ll need, even as much as one-third more.\nTake off the chair’s cushion.\nStarting with the outside back of your chair, measure the width and length.\nIf you want the slipcover to go all the way to the floor, measure to the floor.\nAdd 4 inches to your width and length measurements and cut your muslin piece.\nThis extra amount allows adequate muslin to create your seam allowance.\nPin it to the back of the chair with straight pins.\nWith tailor’s chalk, carefully follow the seams that are already on your armchair, tracing lines with your chalk right on your pinned muslin.\nMake sure your lines are straight; use your ruler or L-square if that helps you.\nRemove the muslin and using your fabric marker and ruler, draw another line a 1/2-inch to the right from the chalk line that you traced in Step 5.\nThis mark is the cutting line and reflects your 1/2-inch seam allowance.\nWith your scissors, cut the muslin piece out using the second line you drew in Step 6.\nWith your fabric marker, write on the back: Back, Cut 1.\nMeasure your chair’s side.\nFollow the same instructions in Steps 1 through 7. Add 4 inches to each measurement, measure and pin the muslin to the chair, chalk around the seams to get the shape, add your 1/2-inch seam allowance in fabric marker, and cut out your piece. This piece is your side pattern; mark it Side, Cut 2, reversing one. To get a mirrored pair of sidepieces, you must flip the pattern over when you cut the second piece unless your pattern piece is truly rectilinear.\nFor the inside seat area, measure from the bottom of the seatback up and over the top of the chair, to the back area (where you made your first pattern), and be sure to add 4 inches to each measurement.\nChalk a line on the top where the fabric bends to meet the chair back pattern.\nPin, chalk, remove your muslin, add a 1/2-inch seam allowance line around your chalk marks using your fabric marker, label it Seatback, Cut 1, and cut out your pattern.\nFor the inside armrest area, you have to go over the top to meet your side pattern, and make sure to chalk a line at the bend.\nPin, chalk, remove, add your 1/2-inch seam allowance line, cut out your pattern, and label it Inside arm rest, Cut 2, reversing one.\nCreate your seat pattern.\nStart at the crease where the seat meets the seatback and go down to the floor in front of the chair. Repeat the steps as previously to create your muslin pattern and label it Seat, Cut 1.\nCreate a pattern for the front of the armrests.\nRepeat all the previous steps to create your muslin pattern, and label it Front armrest, Cut 2, reversing one.\nYou also need to cover your seat cushion.\nThis cushion cover looks like a tube, and it’s easy to make. To make the first pattern:\nMeasure the cushion’s width and the circumference and add a 1/2-inch to each measurement. Create your pattern in muslin and label it Cushion top, Cut 1.\nMeasure the cushion’s front and back. If your cushion is square, these measurements are equal. Add a 1/2-inch to each measurement. Create your pattern and label it Cushion sides, Cut 2.\nPin the muslin pieces together working right on the armchair.\nA 1/2-inch in from the cut edge of the muslin fabric is where the pieces need to join. Use straight pins, or safety pins, the latter for more hold.\nAfter you pin your muslin, remove the muslin and, using a baste stitch, start sewing your pieces together, making sure to check the slipcover as you sew every few seams to make sure the fit is correct.\nHem the bottom.\nFor your cushion, sew the two ends of the long piece of muslin into a tube.\nStarting at the corner, pin in one rectangular piece of muslin into the open area, or the tube’s mouth, and stitch it in using a 1/2-inch seam allowance.\nStitch only one long seam on the other side so you can insert your cushion to check for the fit.","Want to learn the basics of hand embroidery with an easy online workshop – totally free?\nSign up for Embroidery 101 here.

I have the top finished and I was wondering–what do you recommend–embroidering before I make the quilt sandwich, and then do the actual quilting–stitch in the ditch etc, or do you think it is better to do the embroidering as actual hand quilting and pull it all the way to the back. I am not sure, as I haven’t embroidered on any of the quilts I have made. The quilt is a combo of flying geese and Chinese coins patterns and the focus fabric has chattering birds on a telephone line–so I think random pairs of embroidered birds will be great. Thanks for your help with this question!!\nSandy emailed me a while ago with this question. As is almost always the case – my answer is longer than you might expect. (I ended up doing a full-blown tutorial showing you how to start and stop without knots, hide your tails, and carry thread invisibly from place to place. Keep reading and you’ll get there.) I’ve actually done both methods – and like them both – but they do look very different. So. . . it depends. . .\nIt depends on what design you want to stitch, what stitch you’ll be using, and how much interior detail there is.\nI thought the best way to illustrate this would be to show the backs of some of my embroidered pieces.\nRunning stitch looks the same back and front – so it’s a good candidate for something you’ll see from both sides. Read on and I’ll share a tutorial for hiding your threads when you carry from place to place (like between the eyes and mouth).\nBackstitch doesn’t look bad either. It’ll be chunkier on the back than on the front, but with some care on your carrying and hiding thread tails, it can look pretty good.\nNotice – what the image above has is nice, simple, open shapes. Not a lot of detail. Now for the opposite. . .\nAaaaack! Run away! This is quite ugly from the back – and that’s because the shapes are filled with cute chain stitches, French knots, and lazy daisies. Here’s another. . .\nAgain, this one has lots of detail inside the main shapes and it looks bad, bad, bad from the back.\nSo, quilting first and then embroidering through all three layers can be nice. Choose a nice, simple shape to stitch and stitch it in running stitch, backstitch, or split stitch. The quilt will “puff” nicely around the stitching and in the larger open areas of the design.\nIf you want to do some fancier embroidery – like the owls or the birds – embroider first and then layer and quilt. Otherwise the embroidery will be hideous from the back – and it will also compress the layers of your quilt too much and can distort the whole lay of things.\nSo – about that carrying? I said if you’re careful with carrying your thread and hiding your tails you can have something that looks pretty nice. Well, I ended up doing a full-blown tutorial on this.\nThis is a quilt sandwich, ready for quilting. Instead of the usual quilting thread, I’m going to embroider one pink line with running stitch, and the other with backstitch and split stitch. I’ll use 4 strands of embroidery thread. I won’t use any knots, there will be no hanging tails, and you won’t see the thread carried from one line to the other. Ready to learn some sneaky magic?\nStart by inserting your needle about an inch from where you want to start stitching. The needle goes in just through the top layer of fabric, then travels between the two layers of fabric (and the batting) until I bring it up where I want to start visible stitching. So if I flipped this over right now you wouldn’t see any needle (or thread) at all from the back.\nPull the thread until the tip of the tail just disappears into the starting hole your needle made. Careful! Don’t pull it all the way through!\nNow – take a tiny stitch through all layers. This is going to secure the thread instead of a messy knot.\nBring the needle back up through the start of that tiny stitch. I should have photographed this better, but that needle is pointing up.\nNow the thread is coming back up at the original desired starting point. There’s no knot, but that tiny stitch is holding it in place. You can yank really hard on this and it’s not coming loose. The tail of the thread is buried in the batting between the two layers of fabric. Neat!\nOK. I stitched a whole bunch of running stitches and I’m ready to jump over to the other line. But I don’t want anyone to be able to see the thread between the two lines! So I get sneaky again and thread the needle between the two layers of fabric, right there in the batting. Easy peasy! The only drawback is that you can’t carry the thread any farther than the length of your needle. (Actually, there is a way. But I find it so tedious and irritating to do that I’d rather just tie off here and start over in the new space.)\nOK. I did some more stitching. Some backstitches and then some split stitches. Now I’m ready to tie off. I take another tiny stitch. See how the needle is coming up really close to the end of that stitch? I’m talking that tiny of a stitch. Tiny is what makes it tight and work like a knot.\nI put the needle back in at the end of the stitching (really close to where it came up – remember – tiny!) but only through the top layer of fabric. Carry your tail through the batting for about an inch, then bring the needle back up and out.\nThere’s the thread tail, veering up off the top, waiting to be cut.\nSnip it off really close to the surface of the fabric. Careful! Don’t cut your fabric. It’s ok if a tiny bit of thread shows above the surface.\nRub your finger over it once and it will pop right into the batting and disappear from the front.\nSo here’s the finished stitching from the front. That’s running stitch on top, backstitch on the lower left, and split stitch on the lower right.\nAnd here they are from the back. Again – running stitch on top, but now the back of the backstitch is in the lower right and the back of the split stitch is in the lower left.\nNo knots, no tails, and no thread carries. Neat and tidy. 🙂\nWhew! That answer was even longer-winded than I expected. And I know how I can be. 🙂 I hope you all find it helpful!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4b3a11fc-eb42-4986-9a10-afb1754f492a>","<urn:uuid:fd316a36-3041-4978-9b3d-739c930ce8e1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do indoor and outdoor air quality control methods compare in industrial settings - natural vegetation outside vs filtration systems inside?","answer":"For outdoor air quality, adding plants and trees near factories and pollution sources can reduce air pollution by 27% on average. For indoor air quality, industrial air filtration systems are implemented within existing ventilation systems to remove dust and harmful particles from workspaces. While vegetation is often cheaper for outdoor pollution control, indoor filtration is essential for specific requirements like dust-free environments in electronics manufacturing and meeting occupational safety standards for indoor air quality in commercial and industrial buildings.","context":["Nature might be better than tech at reducing air pollution\nRestoring native vegetation could cut air pollution and costs, study finds\nAdding plants and trees to the landscapes near factories and other pollution sources could reduce air pollution by an average of 27 percent, new research suggests.\nThe study shows that plants – not technologies – may also be cheaper options for cleaning the air near a number of industrial sites, roadways, power plants, commercial boilers and oil and gas drilling sites.\nIn fact, researchers found that in 75 percent of the counties analyzed, it was cheaper to use plants to mitigate air pollution than it was to add technological interventions – things like smokestack scrubbers – to the sources of pollution.\n“The fact is that traditionally, especially as engineers, we don’t think about nature; we just focus on putting technology into everything,” said Bhavik Bakshi, lead author of the study and professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at The Ohio State University.\n“And so, one key finding is that we need to start looking at nature and learning from it and respecting it. There are win-win opportunities if we do – opportunities that are potentially cheaper and better environmentally.”\nThe study, published today in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, found that nature-based solutions to air pollution might, in many cases, be better than technology at combating air pollution.\nThe analysis found that for one specific sector – industrial boilers – technology is cheaper at cleaning the air than ecosystem upgrades. And for the manufacturing industry – a broad sector – both ecosystems and technology could offer cost savings, depending on the type of factory.\nTo start understanding the effect that trees and other plants could have on air pollution, the researchers collected public data on air pollution and vegetation on a county-by-county basis across the lower 48 states. Then, they calculated what adding additional trees and plants might cost.\nTheir calculations included the capacity of current vegetation – including trees, grasslands and shrublands – to mitigate air pollution. They also considered the effect that restorative planting – bringing the vegetation cover of a given county to its county-average levels – might have on air pollution levels. They estimated the impact of plants on the most common air pollutants – sulfur dioxide, particulate matter that contributes to smog, and nitrogen dioxide.\nThey found that restoring vegetation to county-level average canopy cover reduced air pollution an average of 27 percent across the counties. This figure varies by county and region – consider, for example, a county in the desert of Nevada and a county in the farmlands of Ohio. Even if the counties were the same size, the county-average land cover in Nevada would be smaller than that in Ohio, because the desert could not grow as much vegetation as farmland.\nTheir research did not calculate the direct effects plants might have on ozone pollution, because, Bakshi said, the data on ozone emissions is lacking. The analysis also didn’t consider whether certain species of trees or plants would better “scrub” pollution from the air, though Bakshi said it is likely that the species of plant would make a difference in air quality.\nThey found that adding trees or other plants could lower air pollution levels in both urban and rural areas, though the success rates varied depending on, among other factors, how much land was available to grow new plants and the current air quality.\nReducing air pollution is critical to public health. The American Lung Association estimates that 4 in 10 people in the U.S. live in areas with poor air quality, leading to health issues including asthma, lung cancer and heart disease.\nBakshi said their findings indicate that nature should be a part of the planning process to deal with air pollution, and show that engineers and builders should find ways to incorporate both technological and ecological systems.\n“The thing that we are interested in is basically making sure that engineering contributes positively to sustainable development,” Bakshi said.\n“And one big reason why engineering has not done that is because engineering has kept nature outside of its system boundary.”\nThis work was funded by the National Science Foundation.","Global Industrial Air Filtration Market: Snapshot\nOccupational safety norms and policies regulating the quality of indoor air in various commercial and industrial buildings have led to the evolution of industrial air filtration market.

{"question":"Which ecosystem shows more severe long-term effects from oil contamination: the Gulf coast marshes after the Deepwater Horizon spill or Prince William Sound after the Exxon Valdez spill?","answer":"Prince William Sound shows more evident long-term effects from oil contamination. While the Deepwater Horizon spill caused significant marsh erosion that could be permanent in some locations, the Exxon Valdez spill's impacts are still clearly visible decades later. Oil continues to leach from beaches in Prince William Sound, intertidal animals remain contaminated, clam beds haven't recovered to pre-spill levels, and some cleaned rocky sites are still bare. In contrast, Gulf coast marshes with low or moderate oiling didn't erode faster than usual, though heavily oiled areas (90% or more coverage) did show significant erosion for up to two years after the spill.","context":["The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill has been called one of the worst environmental disasters in American history — and more than six years later, scientists are still investigating how much damage it actually caused. Now, a new study suggests the spill may have permanently marred one of the Gulf shore’s most important ecosystems.\nThe study, published Tuesday in the journal Scientific Reports, finds the oil spill caused widespread erosion in the salt marshes along the coasts of Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi. And the researchers say there’s a chance these marshes might never completely grow back.\nMarshes “provide a variety of important services,” said lead study author Brian Silliman, a marine conservation biologist at Duke University. “They benefit humans, including acting as pollution filters, absorbing nutrients as they run off from the land before they get into the estuary, helping to suppress harmful algal blooms. They also act as breakwaters and buffer the shoreline from erosion.”\nThey’re also important carbon sinks — in fact, research suggests that coastal wetlands may absorb several times more carbon per unit of area than tropical forests do. And they also provide habitat to a wide variety of animals that are staples of human fisheries, including shrimp, crabs and small fish.\nSo scientists have been concerned about how the marshes fared after the oil spill, believed to have affected at least 1,300 miles of shoreline from Texas to Florida.\nFor the new study, the researchers investigated the relationship between the amount of oil that ended up on marsh grasses following the spill and how much these marshes eroded in the years since. Specifically, they looked at the height of the grasses and how high on the stems oil was found at each location. They analyzed data taken from more than 100 sites in Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi.\nThe researchers found that marshes with low or moderate levels of oiling did not erode any faster than usual. But in places where oil covered at least 90 percent of the plant stems, erosion rates accelerated significantly. The study suggested that erosion in these places was more than three times higher than in marshes with no oil at all, and on average was about 1.4 meters per year higher than normal. These elevated erosion rates persisted for up to two years following the spill.\nThe results suggest that marshes have a kind of threshold beyond which the effects of the oil begin to manifest themselves. And in the places that are hit the hardest, the effects can be significant.\n“Identifying thresholds is something that ecologists and conservation biologists and policymakers are focused on in all ecosystems right now,” Silliman said. “Understanding that breaking point can help them in restoration, conservation. We know some of these systems will be able to take some disturbance, but that threshold — that’s where it can break down and the losses can be permanent.”\nAnd at some of the study sites, these changes may very well be irreversible, Silliman noted. Past a certain point of erosion, the edge of the marsh moves beyond the low-tide point, and it becomes difficult for the grasses to grow back.\nActive restoration efforts — that is, physically restoring the sediments that were eroded away — could give the marshes a shot at returning. But otherwise, Silliman said, “the chance of natural recovery is very slim at best.”\nThe study “documents one of the largest declines in an ecosystem following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill,” Silliman said. But other research suggests that marsh grasses certainly aren’t the only organisms that have suffered.\nA report released by conservation organization Oceana earlier this year synthesized research pointing to a wide range of effects. Endangered sea turtles, bottlenose dolphins, coral reefs, shorebirds and all kinds of fish suffered increased mortality, developmental defects or reproductive declines as a result of exposure to the oil. And our understanding of these consequences may continue to grow, as there are still scientists conducting ongoing research on the changes along the Gulf shore.","Prince William Sound is a beautiful complex of deep, glacially-carved fjords on the north Gulf of Alaska. Enclosed by high mountains and glaciers, and protected from the high seas by barrier islands, the area is a boater’s paradise. Fiords, bays, coves, lakes, glaciers, mountains and hundreds of islands provide a rich and unspoiled beauty. The area’s vast size and limited development provides a true wilderness setting.\nPrince William Sound is also widely used for marine commerce. Oil tanker vessels, log transport ships, fuel barges, freighters, oil industry work boats, ferries, and cruise ships make routine stops at ports in Prince William Sound. Commercial fishing boats, sport fishing charter boats, sightseeing tour boats, and privately-owned vessels also use local the harbours and docks of Prince William Sound. Communities on Prince William Sound include Whittier, Valdez, Tatilek, Cordova, Port Chalmers, and Chenega.\nBecause the Sound and Resurrection Bay is surrounded by mountains filled with glaciers adjacent to a relatively warm ocean current, the weather tends to be quite wet and cool. The weather is unpredictable, and although the sound is protected, it can still become a flurry of whitecaps.\nHistorically, Prince William Sound was a meeting place of diverse cultures, including the resident Chugach Eskimos and Eyak Indians, and Asian and European explorers and pioneers.\nThe location of Prince William Sound, where north temperate and sub-arctic conditions overlap, results in a wealth of natural resources\nLocation: Prince William Sound is an inlet of the Gulf of Alaska, located east of the Kenai Peninsula in South Alaska. Valdez and Cordova are the largest towns on Prince William Sound.\nGlaciers: Prince William Sound has the highest concentration of glaciers in Alaska, and the densest concentration of tidewater glaciers in the world, some flowing a dozen miles from ice-capped peaks to terminate in cliffs of ice towering hundreds of feet above the water. Visitors can spend an afternoon cruising through glacier-carved fjords, watching glaciers calve, and experiencing the untamed wilderness and calm waters of Prince William Sound. Visitors will also view the abundant marine wildlife and learn about the natural history of the Prince William Sound. Columbia Glacier, with a three-mile wide face, is the second largest tidewater glacier in North America, extending 40 miles (64 kms) out of the Chugach Mountains. Columbia Glacier is located about 25 mile (40 kms) west of Valdez. Hubbard Glacier in the Gulf of Alaska is the largest tidewater glacier on the North American continent.\nWildlife: Prince William Sound and Resurrection Bay are premier ecosystems with a diversity of wildlife and habitat. Prince William Sound’s waters and its roughly 3,000 miles of shoreline support large numbers of sea birds, marine mammals and, until recently, some of the world’s richest herring and salmon fisheries. Five major salmon hatcheries operate in the Sound. Other important fisheries include dungeness crab, shrimp, halibut and other groundfish. The Sound is home water to one of the world’s densest populations of sea otters and killer whales. Seals, sea lions and other cetaceans are also residents and, when combined with the otters and orcas, may represent the most profuse population worldwide of marine mammals.\nPrince William Sound is the northern boundary of the world’s farthest north temperate rainforest. This coastal forest strip, primarily comprised of slow growth Sitka spruce, mountain hemlock and western hemlock, is critical habitat to Sitka black-tailed deer, mountain goats and is home to a wide variety of other animals. Two hundred and forty species of birds, including about 3,000 bald eagles and a dozen major seabird colonies, are found in the Sound and the adjacent Copper River Delta region.\nThe Copper River Delta is a two-million acre complex of sedge marshes, braided glacial streams, intertidal sloughs and shallow ponds. Approximately 60 miles (96 kms) across, the Delta is ringed by glaciers and snowcapped peaks in the Chugach Mountain Range. The Delta is prime habitat for waterfowl, salmon, bear, wolves, goats, coyotes and a healthy population of transplanted moose. The Delta’s mudflats and sandbars support the largest concentration of shorebirds in the Western Hemisphere when these small birds migrate through the area each spring, some coming from as far away as Chile. The Dusky Canada goose and Trumpeter swan are just two of the bird species which nest in the Delta.\nThe small boat harbour at Whittier is the Gateway to Prince William Sound from Anchorage. Established during the Second World War as a military supply port, Whittier is located on the west side of Prince William Sound. Whittier is a year round ice-free port and is a focal point for marine activity and freight transfer from sea train barges serving South Central Alaska.\nValdez is located on the north shore of Port Valdez, a deepwater fjord in Prince William Sound. The crashing glaciers and towering Chugach mountains rising from the sea make Valdez absolutely picturesque. The growth and settlement of Valdez was attributed to fur trading, salmon canning, and gold and copper mining. During the Klondike Gold Rush of 1897-98, prospectors came to Valdez believing the Copper River and Valdez Glacier to be the entry to the interior gold fields. From 1910 to 1916, copper and gold mining flourished in the area. In the early 1970’s, Valdez became the staging area for work on the lower portion of the Trans Alaska Pipeline. Today, Valdez hosts the Valdez Marine Terminal, which is the southernmost end of the 800-mile pipeline. Valdez is situated 120 air miles (192 kms) east of Anchorage, or 305 miles (488 kms) by the Richardson and Glenn Highways.\nCordova is a community of 3,000 year-round residents on the eastern shore of Orca Inlet, offering good access to both Prince William Sound and the adjacent Copper River Delta, the largest contiguous wetlands in the Western USA. Once a railroad gateway to Alaska’s interior, Cordova today is a hub of commercial fishing activity with a growing tourism industry, a modern airport with daily jet service to Anchorage and Seattle, and regular ferry service to Valdez, Whittier and Seward. Access to Cordova is limited to airplane and ferry – no roads connect the town to the rest of the state.\nState Marine Parks in Prince William Sound\nParks near Whittier: Many of the parks in Prince William Sound can be reached from Whittier. There are seven parks near Port Wells and another further south on Latouche Island. These parks offer the weekend boater plenty of options for protected anchorages in forested or glaciated surroundings. Special attractions include wildlife viewing, good camping areas, historic sites and one of the world’s largest fish hatcheries. Decision Point State Marine Park is located at the eastern end of Passage Canal approximately eight miles from Whittier. Entry Cove State Marine Park is located two miles directly east of Decision Point on the northeast corner where Passage Canal and Port Wells meet. Surprise Cove State Marine Park is located on the western side of the mouth of Cochrane Bay. Ziegler Cove State Marine Park Ziegler Cove is located on of northern side at the mouth of Pigot Bay 18 miles from Whittier. Granite Bay State Marine Park is located on the northwest corner of Esther Island about 25 miles from Whittier. South Esther Island State Marine Park is located on the southern end of Esther Island. Bettles Bay State Marine Park is an excellent anchorage near the mouth of Bettles Bay. Horseshoe Bay on Latouche Island is located three miles northeast of the new town of Chenega Bay.\nParks Near Valdez: Sawmill Bay, Shoup Bay and Jack Bay parks offer a variety of recreational opportunities within an hour’s boat ride from Valdez. While located next to the main shipping channel to the Valdez Oil Terminal, these parks offer excellent opportunities for a wilderness experience. The serene, forest-ringed Sawmill Bay SMP offers protected anchorages and good camping. For island camping and a fair-weather anchorage, visit Jack Bay SMP. Shoup Glacier spills into an iceberg-filled saltwater lagoon accessible on most high tides by small shallow-drafted boats. Visitors will enjoy views of the glacier, interesting geologic features and a large kittiwake rookery. Shoup Bay State Marine Park is located five miles southwest of the Port of Valdez. Sawmill Bay State Marine Park is 15 miles from Valdez and three miles west of Valdez Narrows. Jack Bay State Marine Park is located 15 miles from Valdez, southeast of Valdez Narrows.\nParks near Cordova: Three diverse marine parks are located near Cordova. Canoe Passage SMP is a shallow wetlands passage cutting through Hawkins Island. Boswell Bay SMP, adjacent to the Copper River Delta Critical Habitat Area, contains vast tidelands and high energy beaches. Beachcombers and wildlife watchers will find this area an excellent spot for exploring. Kayak Island SMP is located at the approximate site of the landing of the Bering Expedition in 1741 – the first Europeans to set foot in Alaska. A large dagger of land thrust out into the cold, unpredictable waters of the Gulf of Alaska, it offers a rare adventure to the few who visit it. Canoe Passage State Marine Park is located on Hawkins Island, eight miles west of Cordova. Boswell Bay State Marine Park is located on the eastern tip of Hinchinbrook Island. Kayak Island lies in the Gulf of Alaska some 50 miles southeast of Cordova.\nOn 24 March 1989 the Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, spilling approximately 11 million gallons of crude oil into the previously pristine and biologically rich area. More than 700 miles of Alaska shoreline were covered with crude oil, which fouled the waters and shorelines of both National Wildlife Refuges and National Parks. As a result, more than 36,000 migratory birds were killed, including at least 100 bald eagle, along with numerous other varieties of wildlife.\nThe images of heavily oiled shorelines, dead and dying wildlife, and the thousands of workers mobilized to clean beaches, were viewed with horror around the world. Since the spill, teams of biologists, geologists, and chemists have monitored and studied the affected shorelines of Prince William Sound to assess its recovery from the environmentally devastating accident.\nThe plant and animal populations of the sound are still adjusting themselves in response to the spill, but many haven’t yet completely recovered. Impacts from the spill remain in Prince William Sound, in the form of oil still leaching from beaches. Although little of the spilled oil remains, oily vestiges are still evident on many beaches. Beaches that had been denuded of plants and animals by the toxic effects of oil and by the intense cleanup efforts show extensive recolonization and are similar in appearance to areas that were unoiled. In some areas, intertidal animals such as mussels are still contaminated by oil, and rich clam beds that suffered high mortalities from oil and extensive beach cleaning have not repopulated to their previous levels. Some rocky sites that were stripped of heavy plant cover by high-pressure, hot-water cleaning remain mostly bare rock.\nExxon Corporation and Exxon Shipping Company agreed with the US Department of Justice to pay a record one billion dollars in criminal fines and civil damages in connection with the oil spill, by far the largest single environmental criminal recovery ever exacted. Exxon has also spent approximately $2.2 billion to clean up Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska. In February 2007, Exxon reported the largest annual earnings ever of a US company: $39.5 billion. The penalty and cost of the oil spill was relatively minor compared to their earnings.\nA tsunami caused by the Good Friday Earthquake (also called the Great Alaska Earthquake) in 1964 killed a number of Chugach villagers living on the shores of Prince William Sound in Chenega. The tidal wave also destroyed the town of Valdez. The magnitude 9.2 earthquake, which resulted in 131 deaths, was centered in Prince William Sound."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0a971eae-7fa6-49dd-8452-13ffdc1a53fe>","<urn:uuid:e0a5c705-4f7d-4241-9796-adb5e866966f>"],"error":null}

During this time, Britain revolutionized technology, transportation, and communication. It increased its trade across the globe and sent many British explorers on expeditions across the African and Asian continents.\nThe Victorian Era was a time of significant change—good and bad—but it represented what the future looked like for the rest of the world.\nWhen was the Victorian Era or Time Period?\nThe Victorian Era specifically refers to the time between 1837 and 1901. This time period covers the moment when Queen Victoria ascended to the throne and became the monarch of Great Britain and Ireland in 1837, as well as Empress of India in 1877. It then ends with Queen Victoria’s death in 1901.\nFollowing Queen Victoria’s death, King Edward VII took the throne. The period in which King Edward VII reigned is referred to as the Edwardian Era. The ascent of Edward VII clearly ended the Victorian Era.\nWhy Was It called the Victorian Era?\nThese 64 years in the United Kingdom were called The Victorian Era after Queen Victoria. Since she was Queen during this great revolutionary time in Great Britain, her name has been applied to describe the era. Simply, Queen Victoria’s name is applied to the historical era in which she reigned.\nWho were the Victorians?\nVictorians are the subjects who lived under Queen Victoria’s rule. Victorians are usually considered those who were born in and lived in Great Britain during Victoria’s reign.\nThe British empire did spread into, and control places like India, but those under the rule of the British Empire are generally not referred to as Victorians. Instead, Victorians usually refers to the citizens born on the British Isles and those were not colonized by the British Empire.\nWhere Were They From?\nThe Victorians were from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland or the British Isles.\nWhat was the Victorian Era Like?\nEngland was changing drastically during the Victorian Era. Britain became an industrial superpower and produced significant amounts of the world’s iron, steel, cotton, textiles, and coal. Due to the growth of the industry, British citizens began to move from the country to the cities to find work.\nThe population began to spike, but Great Britain saw a drastic rise in poverty. Working conditions in industrial cities were dangerous, and the environment was polluted by these industries. Railways grew, and so did commerce.\nHowever, there was a rise in deep concern for social issues and reform. The British government passed acts that limited the amount of work for certain workers, and younger employees were provided with clothing and some education. Factory Acts banned children under nine from working in factories and limited the number of hours children can work.\nThere were great strides made in science, literature, and technology during this era. Charles Darwin published his theory of evolution in 1859. Literacy rates began to rise, and literature was more readily mass-produced. With the publication of Frankenstein in 1818 by Mary Shelley, the genre of horror was born.\nIn terms of technology, electric lights were installed on different London streets in 1877-78.

{"question":"How do probe length requirements differ between smiFISH and standard RNA probes used in in situ hybridization?","answer":"In standard in situ hybridization, RNA probes should be 250-1,500 bases in length, with probes of approximately 800 bases showing highest sensitivity and specificity. In contrast, smiFISH uses shorter oligonucleotides, with primary probes typically being 26-32 bases in length plus a 28-base FLAP sequence.","context":["In situ Hybridisation\nFluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) is a widely used method that has been used for decades. Due to its high specificity and sensitivity, FISH can analyse structures at subcellular level or even identify and localise individual cells in large cell aggregates.\nThe detection method is based on hybridising fluorescent-labelled oligonucleotides with cell´s own nucleic acids. The probe may detect DNA or RNA thus allowing not only information about the presence of a particular gene, but also the gene product (RNA) - and thus gene activity - can be detected.\nFor the analysis of microorganisms short, fluorescent-labelled oligo probes are used, which hybridise to the cell´s ribosomal RNA. The high copy number of ribosomal RNA per cell allows extremely sensitive detection. Due to the high sensitivity of fluorescence in situ hybridisation, analyses of rare and non-culturable samples are also possible, allowing a wide range of analyses (e.g. marine microbiology, analysis of microbial colonies in biofilms or biogas plants, microbiome analyses, etc.).\nIn addition to the subcellular resolution of RNA in cells, also a quantitative measurement of RNA in cells via in situ hybridisation is possible.\nFluorescence probes for FISH analysis\nFor fluorescent-labelled oligonucleotide probes, stable and high-intensity dyes from the entire spectrum of visible light can be used (see fluorescent dyes). Thus, suitable combinations can also be found in autofluorescent environments or for multiplex analyses.\nDepending on the assay, different degrees of labelling are available:\nThe classic FISH probes are labelled with one fluorescent dye at the 5'-end of the oligonucleotide.\nA nearly twofold increase in sensitivity may be achieved in in situ hybridisation experiments (DOPE-FISH) by using double labelled probes. Due to the additional sensitivity, this approach can also be used for very rare targets.\nThe biomers.net dopeProbes are labelled with an identical fluorophore at the 5´- and 3´-end of the oligonucleotide.\nAn advancement of these are tetraProbes, which have up to four dye molecules on one oligonucleotide and are therefore highly sensitive. Here, the fluorescent dyes are coupled to the oligonucleotide backbone. The signal intensity of the hybridised probe nearly increases linear with the number of fluorophores per oligo. According to this tetraProbes may be two times brighter than dopeProbes and four times brighter than monoProbes under identical conditions.\nIn addition to the commonly used attachment to the 2´-group of the sugar, the click reaction via the base\n5-ethynyl-dU allows a nearly direct modification of the oligonucleotide.\nThe internal click modification is not only used in the synthesis of tetraProbes. Rather, they enable new opportunities to label oligonucleotides several times with identical biomolecules.\nUsing these so-called multiProbes, for example, oligos with nine internal fluorescent dyes are conceivable.\n1. A Straightforward DOPE (Double Labeling of Oligonucleotide Probes)-FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) Method for Simultaneous Multicolor Detection of Six Microbial Populations. Behnama F, Vilcinskasb A, Wagnera M, Stoeckerb K; Appl. Environ. Microbiol. (2012), vol. 78 no. 15 5138-5142.\nAn enormous increase in sensitivity is achieved by the use of HRP probes. Here, instead of a dye, the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP = horseradish peroxidase) is coupled to the oligonucleotide probe. After hybridisation of the oligos to their target sequence in cell, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), a 45 kDa large enzyme, can convert specific dyes and thereby leads to an amplification of the light signal at the binding site.\nThe combination of HRP probes and the tyramide signal amplification system (TSA) leads to 10-20-fold increased signal intensities in comparison to fluorescein monolabelled probes. This \"Catalysed Reporter Deposition - Fluorescent in situ hybridisation\" (CARD-FISH) method represents an excellent tool for quantitative detection of microorganisms.\nDuring the synthesis, an oligonucleotide, usually 18 - 25 bases long, is modified with an aminolink at the 5’-end. This primary amino function is coupled to a reactive bi-functional crosslinking reagent, resulting in an activated oligonucleotide, which can react in a further step with a free amino function of the horseradish peroxidase molecule. Thus, a stable covalent coupling is achieved. The appropriate choice of reaction conditions and excess of reagents leads to 1:1 connection between oligonucleotide and HRP.\nPurification and isolation of the HRP oligonucleotide is best achieved by using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).\nUsing alternative coupling strategies enable diverse and flexible ways to insert modifications into oligo sequences.\nOf particular note is the technology of internal click modification of nucleic acids, the so-called click-FISH. The coupling occurs via the heterocyclic pyrimidine bases 5-octynyl-dC, 5-octynyl-dU or 5-ethynyl-dU. These modified bases are cytidine and thymidine nucleoside analogs and are introduced into the growing oligo sequence at the appropriate position during synthesis.\nThe actual binding of the marker molecule (e.g. fluorescent dyes) occurs with the azide-labelled markers reacting with the alkyne of the modified, clickable pyrimidines via the copper-catalysed click reaction. The dyes may bind to the target molecule before or even after hybridisation of the probe.\nThis form of internal coupling can be used also, for example, for multiple fluorescence-labelled oligo probes, such as the so-called tetraProbes.\nsmiFISH for in situ RNA detection\nIn gene expression analysis in cells and tissue, in situ RNA detection is becoming increasingly important. For detection of individual RNA molecules with high sensitivity, modified FISH approaches have been developed to detect single molecules.\nIn single molecule FISH (smFISH), many short oligonucleotides (typically 24-48 oligo probes) are designed specifically against the RNA target sequence so that they can hybridise side by side on the sequence of interest.\nThis large number of oligos (oligo pool) results in highly specific signal for each RNA, which can then be detected on standard wide-field microscopes as a diffraction limited spot.\nBackground signal stemming from individual oligonucleotides is usually substantially weaker compared to the accumulated signal of many oligonucleotides at the target RNA.\nIn the original smFISH approaches, the oligonucleotides of the oligo pool were directly labelled. A recently presented method called smiFISH method (single molecule inexpensive fluorescence in situ hybridisation) provides more flexibility at reduced cost, by using unlabelled RNA-specific primary probes.\nEach primary probe consists of a target-specific part (approx. 26-32 bases in length) and a so-called FLAP or read-out sequence (28 bases in length). All primary probes share the same FLAP sequence, allowing the binding of a fluorescently labelled secondary probe (FLAP). This secondary FLAP probe has a fluorescent dye at both the 5´-and the 3´-end.\nPrimary and secondary probes can be pre-hybridised, and the resulting duplex used for the RNA detection. A key advantage of this smiFISH approach is its enormous flexibility. Primary probes can be readily labelled with secondary probes with different colours, and a set of secondary probes can be used to label different primary probes.\nFurther, the above-mentioned pre-hybridisation allows performing simultaneous visualisation of several target genes – even if the primary probe sets carry the same FLAP sequence. Each RNA species is pre-hybridised with a secondary probe with a distinct colour. These labelled probe-sets can then be used to visualise these targets in the same cell (Multi-colour imaging assays).\nsmiFISH has been successfully used in different cultured cells, embryos, and tissue.\nFor detection of specific RNA in a cell, biomers.net offers three different double-labelled FLAP probes (FLAP X,\nFLAP Y or FLAP Z). These probes can be labelled with a variety of possible fluorescent dyes at the 5´- and 3´-end\n(e.g. Fam, Cyanine 3, Cyanine 5, etc.).\nMany further possible fluorescent dyes can be found here.\n|Name||FLAP Probe Sequence (5´-3´)||Length|\n|FLAP X||CAC TGA GTC CAG CTC GAA ACT TAG GAG G||28 nt|\n|FLAP Y||AAT GCA TGT CGA CGA GGT CCG AGT GTA A||28 nt|\n|FLAP Z||CTT ATA GGG CAT GGA TGC TAG AAG CTG G||28 nt|\nThe set of the appropriate unlabelled, target-binding primary probes comprises 24 or 48 unlabelled oligonucleotides, respectively.

Due to the peptide backbone, PNA are extremely resistant to nuclease digestion, which distinguish them from natural nucleic acids. PNA oligos have a higher binding affinity, so that even very short PNA oligonucleotides guarantee good specificity. PNA probes are therefore optimal for long-term routine studies.\nLinks für Probe Design\nFor the design and application of probes in the field of in situ hybridisation we suggest the following links:\nThe SILVA rRNA database is a project of Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology, Bremen.

A labeled RNA or DNA probe can be used to hybridize to a known target mRNA or DNA sequence within a sample. This labeled RNA or DNA probe can then be detected by using an antibody to detect the label on the probe. The probes can therefore be used to detect expression of a gene of interest and the location of the mRNA.\nYou can also access our most popular protocols straight from your phone with the Abcam app, which features protocols, scientific support and a suite of useful tools that are handy for any bench scientist. Learn more.\nPreserving RNA is made difficult due to presence of RNase enzyme. This enzyme is found on glassware, in reagents and on operators and their clothing. RNase quickly destroys any RNA in the cell or the RNA probe itself so users must ensure they use sterile techniques, gloves, and solutions to prevent RNase contamination of the probe or tissue RNA.\nGeneral sample storage when using frozen sections\nFor best results on older slides, do not store slides dry at room temperature. Instead, store in 100% ethanol at -20°C, or in a plastic box covered in saran wrap at -20°C or -80°C. Such storage preserves slides for several years.\nRNA probes should be 250–1,500 bases in length; probes of approximately 800 bases long exhibit the highest sensitivity and specificity. Transcription templates should allow for transcription of both probe (antisense strand) and negative control (sense strand) RNAs. Clone into a vector with opposable promoters to achieve this. Circular templates must be linearized before making a probe, though PCR templates can also be used.\nDNA probes provide high sensitivity for in situ hybridization. They do not hybridize as strongly to target mRNA molecules compared to RNA probes, so formaldehyde should not be used in the post hybridization washes.\nProbe specificity is important. If the exact nucleotide sequence of the mRNA or DNA in the cell is known, a precise complementary probe can be designed. If >5% of base pairs are not complementary, the probe will only loosely hybridize to the target sequence. This means the probe is more likely to be washed away during wash and detection steps and may not be correctly detected.\nThis protocol describes the use of DIG-labeled single-stranded RNA probes to detect expression of the gene of interest in paraffin-embedded sections.\nFor frozen sections, start at Step 2. If using formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded sections, continue with this step.\nBefore proceeding, slides must be deparaffinized and rehydrated. Incomplete removal of paraffin can cause poor staining of the section.\nPlace the slides in a rack and perform the following washes:\nKeep the slides in the tap water until antigen retrieval. From this point onwards the slides cannot dry as this will cause non-specific antibody binding and high background staining.\n2) Antigen retrieval\nDigest with 20 µg/mL proteinase K in pre-warmed 50 mM Tris for 10–20 min at 37°C. Incubation time and proteinase K concentration may require optimization.\nWe recommend trying a proteinase K titration experiment to determine optimal conditions. Insufficient digestion will reduce hybridization signal and over-digestion will result in poor tissue morphology, making localization of the hybridization signal very difficult. Optimal proteinase K concentration will vary depending on the tissue type, length of fixation and size of tissue.\n3) Rinse slides 5x in distilled water.\n4) Immerse slides in ice-cold 20% (v/v) acetic acid for 20 sec. This permeabilizes the cells to allow access to the probe and the antibody.\n5) Dehydrate the slides by washing for approximately 1 min per wash in 70% ethanol, 95% ethanol and 100% ethanol, then air dry.\n6) Add 100 µL of hybridization solution to each slide.\n|Reagent||Final concentration||Amount to use per 1 mL of solution|\n|Denhardt's solution||5x||50 µL|\n|Dextran sulphate||10%||100 µL|\n|Herapin||20 U/µL||10 µL|\nSalt solution (20x)\nDenhardt’s solution (100x)\n7) Incubate the slides for 1 h in a humidified hybridization chamber at the desired hybridization temperature. Typical hybridization temperatures range between 55–62°C.\n8) Dilute the probes in hybridization solution in PCR tubes. Heat at 95°C for 2 min in a PCR block to denature the RNA or DNA probe. Chill on ice immediately to prevent reannealing.\n9) Drain off the hybridization solution. Add 50–100 μL of diluted probe per section, covering the entire sample. Incubate in the humidified hybridization chamber at 65°C overnight. Cover the sample with a cover slip to prevent evaporation.\nDuring this step, the RNA probe will hybridize to the corresponding mRNA, or the DNA probe will hybridize to the corresponding cellular DNA. Optimize the hybridization temperature depending on the sequence of the probe used, as well as the cell or tissue type. This temperature should be optimized for each tissue type analyzed.\nOptimal hybridization temperature for probes depends on the percentage of bases present in the target sequence. The concentration of cytosine and guanine in the sequence are important factors.\n10) Stringency washes\nSolution parameters such as temperature, salt and detergent concentration can be manipulated to remove non-specific interactions.\nTo prepare 1 L of 20x saline sodium citrate (SSC)\nWash away excess probe and hybridization buffer with higher temperatures (up to 65°C) for short periods of time. If left too long this can wash off too much of the hybridized probe RNA/DNA.\nThis step removes non-specific and/or repetitive DNA/RNA hybridization.\nFollow these guidelines to optimize temperature and salt concentration for stringency washes:\n11) Wash twice in MABT (maleic acid buffer containing Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature. MABT is gentler than PBS and is more suitable for nucleic acid detection.\nTo prepare 5x MABT stock\nBring the pH to 7.5 by adding Tris base. About 100 g will be required. Bring final volume to 1 L.\n12) Dry the slides.\n13) Transfer to a humidified chamber and add 200 µL blocking buffer to each section (MABT + 2% BSA, milk or serum). Block for 1–2 h at room temperature.\n14) Drain off the blocking buffer. Add the anti-label antibody at the required dilution in blocking buffer. Check the antibody datasheet for a recommended concentration/dilution. Incubate for 1–2 h at room temperature.\n15) Wash slides 5x10 min with MABT at room temperature.\n16) Wash the slides 2x10 min each at room temperature with pre-staining buffer (100 mM Tris pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2).\n17) For fluorescence detection, proceed to Step 18. For other forms of detection, return the slides to the humidified chamber and follow manufacturer’s instructions for color development.\n18) Rinse slides in distilled water.\n19) Air dry the slides for 30 min.

{"question":"Which natural formation is deeper: Lake Tanganyika or Ludchurch chasm?","answer":"Lake Tanganyika is significantly deeper, with a maximum depth of 1,470 meters (4,820 feet) and an average depth of 570 meters (1,870 feet). While the exact depth of Ludchurch is not specified in the documents, it is described as a chasm created by a landslip where a chunk of rock slid a few meters downhill, making it considerably shallower than Lake Tanganyika.","context":["The ‘Dark Peak’, the land to the south and east of Macclesfield rising up above the Cheshire plain, is a wild place. We are in England though, and even here in the North, things are only mildly wild. This is no wilderness, we are only 25 miles from Manchester, once the ‘workshop of the world’. The area is criss-crossed with (exciting narrow) roads and dotted with farms, but is not totally domesticated or defined by human control. Some 600 years ago its primary purpose was for hunting, as the place name Wildboarclough reminds us. I recently visited a wild place here which is geologically interesting but also spooky, with echoes of medieval violence.\nThe primary colour of this land is green. Note how even the stone walls are green, because the sandstone rock is covered with moss. The wooded hillside you see is a dip-slope – the slope follows the upper surface of a layer of durable coarse sandstone. The woods contain a magical secret place, which is where we are headed.\nOur destination is best reached via Gradbach. This contains an old silk mill, where in the 19th Century water-power was used to drive machinery to weave silk. Such places (more usually involving cotton weaving) were the nursery of the industrial revolution. Water power was soon replaced by coal-fired steam power and production shifted from rivers in the middle of nowhere into big cities such as Manchester. Though far from rivers, the new buildings full of looms were still called mills. The Gradbach mill is now a Youth Hostel, giving children a taste of the wild.\nOnce across the river and in the woods, everything seems normal. You walk up some muddy paths and you reach a set of small crags. Carboniferous sandstone, coarse grained and with cross bedding – very typical of the area. Note the green algae staining.\nSitting within these woods, almost hidden amongst the undergrowth is an entrance to another world.\nYou walk down a little way and you are in a deep dark space like nowhere else I’ve ever been. The air is cool, muffled and moist. Every surface is damp and green. The sky above seems a very long way away, peeking down between two great walls of sandstone, covered in ferns, moss and liverworts. A place that is neither underground or above ground, a chasm not a cave, a rocky place full of plants. This is Ludchurch.\nGeologically, this is a large landslip, of unknown age. The bedding planes in the rock, the Roaches Grit, are sloping down hill. A weak layer, probably shale, allows movement sideways and the rock parts along vertical joint planes. A chunk of rock 100s of metres long has slid a few metres downhill, creating a hole in the ground that’s filled with plants and mystery.\nWhat did the medieval inhabitants of the land make of it? Without our modern day paths, the most obvious way to encounter Ludchurch is to ride over the top and fall to your death into it. Even now dead sheep can be found at the bottom. Over the years Ludchurch has gathered many myths and stories and inspired a great work of literature.\nSir Gawain and the Green Knight is a complex story from the late 14th Century. Sir Gawain, of King Arthur’s court, gets involved in a ‘beheading game’ with a mysterious Green Knight (like you do). The climax of the story takes place in a Green Chapel. The story is written in a Cheshire dialect, now extinct but recognisable only a few generations ago. Many scholars have linked the Green Chapel directly to Ludchurch itself. That a local man writing a story of the supernatural would be inspired by Ludchurch makes perfect sense to me.\nThe Green Knight has been linked to the Green Man, a common carved or painted figure in old English churches. It represents a pagan vegetative deity, a figure who embodies the growth cycle of plants. Such a figure would certainly like Ludchurch, covered with plants as it is. The fact that it is made of Carboniferous rocks is appropriate too. This was a time when the air was rich in oxygen, supporting vigorous forests – a golden time for a Green Man. How appropriate then that a block on the base of Ludchurch shows a plant fossil, partly covered in moss and liverworts.\nI visited Ludchurch during a week’s holiday based in the area. On an earlier day I’d visited the Manifold valley in search of interesting rocks to tell you about (watch this space).\nOn this other trip I photographed a crag of massive reef limestone. When later researching the link between the Green Chapel and Ludchurch, I found a website that decided that a limestone cave at Wetton Mill was a better fit for the Green Chapel. The name sounded familiar – I clicked on their photo and found a picture of the same crag from the same spot!\nThis is purely a coincidence of course. The nature of things is that wildly improbable coincidences happen all the time. It still made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.\nA note on nomenclature. Ludchurch is more popularly known as Lud’s Church, but my father, who holidayed here in the 1940s and has always lived nearby, knows it by the non-possessive version that I’ve used. There are many suggestions as to who Lud was, which means no-one knows, but for sure it is nothing to do with the Luddites. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.","Lake Tanganyika from space, June 1985\n|Coordinates||6°30′S 29°50′E / 6.500°S 29.833°ECoordinates: 6°30′S 29°50′E / 6.500°S 29.833°E|\n|Lake type||Rift Valley Lake|\n|Primary outflows||Lukuga River|\n|Catchment area||231,000 km2 (89,000 sq mi)|\n|Max. length||673 km (418 mi)|\n|Max. width||72 km (45 mi)|\n|Surface area||32,900 km2 (12,700 sq mi)|\n|Average depth||570 m (1,870 ft)|\n|Max. depth||1,470 m (4,820 ft)|\n|Water volume||18,900 km3 (4,500 cu mi)|\n|Residence time||5500 years|\n|Shore length1||1,828 km (1,136 mi)|\n|Surface elevation||773 m (2,536 ft)|\n|1 Shore length is not a well-defined measure.|\nLake Tanganyika is an African Great Lake. It is estimated to be the second largest freshwater lake in the world by volume, and the second deepest, in both cases, after only Lake Baikal in Siberia; it is also the world's longest freshwater lake. The lake is divided among four countries – Tanzania, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Burundi, and Zambia, with Tanzania (46%) and DRC (40%) possessing the majority of the lake. The water flows into the Congo River system and ultimately into the Atlantic Ocean.\nLake Tanganyika is situated within the Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East African Rift, and is confined by the mountainous walls of the valley. It is the largest rift lake in Africa and the second largest lake by volume in the world. It is the deepest lake in Africa and holds the greatest volume of fresh water, accounting for 18% of the world's available fresh water. It extends for 676 km (420 mi) in a general north-south direction and averages 50 km (31 mi) in width. The lake covers 32,900 km2 (12,700 sq mi), with a shoreline of 1,828 km (1,136 mi), a mean depth of 570 m (1,870 ft) and a maximum depth of 1,470 m (4,820 ft) (in the northern basin). It holds an estimated 18,900 cubic kilometres (4,500 cu mi). This is equivalent to about 16% of all fresh water on Earth. It has an average surface temperature of 25 °C (77 °F) and a pH averaging 8.4.\nThe enormous depth and tropical location of the lake can prevent 'turnover' of water masses, which means that much of the lower depths of the lake are so-called 'fossil water' and are anoxic (lacking oxygen). The catchment area of the lake is 231,000 km2 (89,000 sq mi). Two main rivers flow into the lake, as well as numerous smaller rivers and streams (whose lengths are limited by the steep mountains around the lake). There is one major outflow, the Lukuga River, which empties into the Congo River drainage.\nThe major river flowing into the lake is the Ruzizi River, formed about 10,000 years ago, which enters the north of the lake from Lake Kivu. The Malagarasi River, which is Tanzania's second largest river, enters the east side of Lake Tanganyika. The Malagarasi is older than Lake Tanganyika and, before the lake was formed, directly drained into the Congo River.\nThe lake has a complex history of changing flow patterns, due to its high altitude, great depth, slow rate of refill and mountainous location in a turbulently volcanic area that has undergone climate changes. Apparently it has rarely in the past had an outflow to the sea. It has been described as 'practically endorheic' for this reason. The lake's connection to the sea is dependent on a high water level allowing water to overflow out of the lake through the Lukunga into the Congo.\nDue to the lake's tropical location, it suffers a high rate of evaporation. Thus it depends on a high inflow through the Ruzizi out of Lake Kivu to keep the lake high enough to overflow. This outflow is apparently not more than 12,000 years old, and resulted from lava flows blocking and diverting the Kivu basin's previous outflow into Lake Edward and then the Nile system, and diverting it to Lake Tanganyika. Signs of ancient shorelines indicate that at times Tanganyika may have been up to 300 m lower than its present surface level, with no outlet to the sea. Even its current outlet is intermittent and may not have been operating when first visited by Western explorers in 1858.\nThe lake may also have at times had different inflows and outflows: inward flows from a higher Lake Rukwa, access to Lake Malawi and an exit route to the Nile have all been proposed to have existed at some point in the lake's history.\nThere are several islands in Lake Tanganyika. The most important of them are\n- Kavala Island (The Democratic Republic of the Congo)\n- Mamba-Kayenda Islands (The Democratic Republic of the Congo)\n- Milima Island (The Democratic Republic of the Congo)\n- Kibishie Island (The Democratic Republic of the Congo)\n- Mutonowe Island ( Zambia)\n- Kumbula Island ( Zambia)\nThe lake holds at least 250 species of cichlid fish and 75 species of non-cichlid fish, most of which live along the shoreline down to a depth of approximately 180 metres (590 ft). The largest biomass of fish, however, is in the pelagic zone (open waters) and is dominated by six species: two species of \"Tanganyika sardine\" and four species of predatory Lates (related to, but not the same as, the Nile perch that has devastated Lake Victoria cichlids). Lake Tanganyika is considered the oldest of the East African lakes, and has the most morphologically and genetically diverse groups of cichlids. This lake also has the largest number of endemic cichlid genera of all African lakes. Almost all (98%) of the Tanganyikan cichlid species are endemic to the lake, and Lake Tanganyika is thus an important biological resource for the study of speciation in evolution. Among the non-cichlid fish, 59% of the species are endemic. Lake Tanganyika is the most diverse extent of adaptive radiation.\nMany species of cichlids from Lake Tanganyika, such as fish from the brightly coloured Tropheus genus, are popular fish among aquarium owners due to their bright colors. Recreating a Lake Tanganyika biotope to host those cichlids in a habitat similar to their natural environment is also popular in the aquarium hobby.\nLake Tanganyika is home to a large number of invertebrates, including many endemics:\n- Molluscs and crustaceans\nA total of 68 freshwater snail species (45 endemic) and 15 bivalve species (8 endemic) are known from the lake. Many of the snails are unusual for species living in freshwater in having noticeably thickened shells and/or distinct sculpture, features more commonly seen in marine snails. They are referred to as thallasoids, which can be translated to \"marine-like\". All the Tanganyika thallasoids, which are part of Prosobranchia, are endemic to the lake. Initially they were believed to be related to similar marine snails, but they are now known to be unrelated. Their appearance is now believed to be the result of the highly diverse habitats in Lake Tanganyika and evolutionary pressure from snail-eating fish and, in particular, Platythelphusa crabs. A total of 17 freshwater snail genera are endemic to the lake, such as Lavigeria, Reymondia, Spekia, Tanganyicia and Tiphobia. There are about 30 species of non-thallasoid snails in the lake, but only five of these are endemic, including Ferrissia tanganyicensis and Neothauma tanganyicense. The latter is the largest Tanganyika snail and its shell is often used by small shell-dwelling cichlids.\nCrustaceans are also highly diverse in Tanganyika with more than 200 species, of which more than half are endemic. They include 10 species of freshwater crabs (9 Platythelphusa and Potamonautes platynotus; all endemic), at least 11 species of small atyid shrimp (Atyella, Caridella and Limnocaridina), a palaemonid shrimp (Macrobrachium moorei), and several copepods.\nAmong Rift Valley lakes, Lake Tanganyika far surpasses all others in terms of crustacean and freshwater snail richness (both in total number of species and number of endemics). For example, the only other Rift Valley lake with endemic freshwater crabs is Lake Kivu with two species.\n- Other invertebrates\nThe diversity of other invertebrate groups in Lake Tanganyika is often not well-known, but there are at least 20 described species of leeches (12 endemics), 9 sponges (7 endemic), 6 bryozoa (2 endemic), 11 flatworms (7 endemic), 20 nematodes (7 endemic), 28 annelids (17 endemic) and the small hydrozoan jellyfish Limnocnida tanganyicae.\nIt is estimated that 25–40% of the protein in the diet of the approximately one million people living around the lake comes from lake fish. Currently, there are around 100,000 people directly involved in the fisheries operating from almost 800 sites. The lake is also vital to the estimated 10 million people living in the greater basin.\nLake Tanganyika fish can be found exported throughout East Africa. Commercial fishing began in the mid-1950s and has had an extremely heavy impact on the pelagic fish species; in 1995 the total catch was around 180,000 tonnes. Former industrial fisheries, which boomed in the 1980s, have subsequently collapsed.\n- The port town of Kigoma is the railhead for the railway from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.\n- The port town of Kalemie (previously named Albertville) is the railhead for the D.R. Congo rail network.\n- The port town of Mpulungu is a proposed railhead for Zambia.\nIt is thought that early Homo Sapiens was making an impact on the region already during the stone age. The time period of the Middle Stone Age to Late Stone Age is described as an age of advanced hunter-gatherers. It is believed they would have caused megafaunal extinctions.\nThere are many methods in which the native people of the area were fishing. Most of them included using a lantern as a lure for fish that are attracted to light. There were three basic forms. One called Lusenga which is a wide net used by one person from a canoe. The second one is using a lift net. This was done by dropping a net deep below the boat using two parallel canoes and then simultaneously pulling it up. The third is called Chiromila which consisted of three canoes. One canoe was stationary with a lantern while another canoe holds one end of the net and the other circles the stationary one to meet up with the net.\nThe first known Westerners to find the lake were the British explorers Richard Burton and John Speke, in 1858. They located it while searching for the source of the Nile River. Speke continued and found the actual source, Lake Victoria. Later David Livingstone passed by the lake. He noted the name \"Liemba\" for its southern part, a word probably from the Fipa language, and in 1927 this was chosen as the new name for the conquered German First World War ship Graf von Götzen which is still serving the lake up to the present time.\nWorld War I\nThe lake was the scene of two celebrated battles during World War I.\nWith the aid of the Graf Goetzen (named after Count Gustav Adolf Graf von Götzen, the former governor of German East Africa), the Germans had complete control of the lake in the early stages of the war. The ship was used both to ferry cargo and personnel across the lake, and as a base from which to launch surprise attacks on Allied troops.\nIt therefore became essential for the Allied forces to gain control of the lake themselves. Under the command of Lieutenant Commander Geoffrey Spicer-Simson the British Royal Navy achieved the monumental task of bringing two armed motor boats HMS Mimi and HMS Toutou from England to the lake by rail, road and river to Albertville (since renamed Kalemie in 1971) on the western shore of Lake Tanganyika. The two boats waited until December 1915, and mounted a surprise attack on the Germans, with the capture of the gunboat Kingani. Another German vessel, the Hedwig, was sunk in February 1916, leaving the Götzen as the only German vessel remaining to control the lake.\nAs a result of their strengthened position on the lake, the Allies started advancing towards Kigoma by land, and the Belgians established an airbase on the western shore at Albertville. It was from there, in June 1916, that they launched a bombing raid on German positions in and around Kigoma. It is unclear whether or not the Götzen was hit (the Belgians claimed to have hit it but the Germans denied this), but German morale suffered and the ship was subsequently stripped of its gun since it was needed elsewhere.\nThe war on the lake had reached a stalemate by this stage, with both sides refusing to mount attacks. However, the war on land was progressing, largely to the advantage of the Allies, who cut off the railway link in July 1916 and threatened to isolate Kigoma completely. This led the German commander, Gustav Zimmer, to abandon the town and head south. In order to avoid his prize ship falling into Allied hands, Zimmer scuttled the vessel on July 26, 1916. The vessel was later raised in 1924 and renamed MV Liemba (see transport).\nIn 1965 Argentinian revolutionary Che Guevara used the western shores of Lake Tanganyika as a training camp for guerrilla forces in the Congo. From his camp, Che and his forces attempted to overthrow the government, but ended up pulling out in less than a year since the National Security Agency (NSA) had been monitoring him the entire time and aided government forces in ambushing his guerrillas.\nSince 2004 the lake has been the focus of a massive Water and Nature Initiative by the IUCN. The project is scheduled to take five years at a total cost of US$27 million. The initiative is attempting to monitor the resources and state of the lake, set common criteria for acceptable level of sediments, pollution, and water quality in general, and design and establish a lake basin management authority.\nEffects of global warming\nBecause of increasing global temperature there is a direct correlation to lower productivity in Lake Tanganyika Southern winds create upwells of deep nutrient-rich water on the southern end of the lake. This happens during the cooler months (May to September). These nutrients that are in deep water are vital in maintaining the aquatic food web. The southernly winds are slowing down which limits the ability for the mixing of nutrients. This is correlating with less productivity in the lake.\n- Yohannes, Okbazghi (2008).

{"question":"What are the medical challenges faced by orphanage children, and how does the ASF production of Annie portray the transformation of institutionalized children?","answer":"Orphanage children often face severe medical challenges including developmental delays from poor pre/post-natal care, nutritional inadequacies, and medical neglect. Once institutionalized, they may be misdiagnosed with mental deficiencies and experience physical and cognitive regression. The ASF production of Annie portrays this theme through the story of an orphan who overcomes her challenging circumstances. The musical shows how Annie transforms from life in an orphanage to finding hope and a new family with Warbucks, demonstrating that positive change is possible. As director Christopher Windom notes, every character undergoes growth or transformation throughout the story, paralleling how institutionalized children can improve with proper support and care.","context":["Iconic 'Annie' brings message of hope to ASF\nHear from Annie (Vivian Poe), Charles E. Wallace (Oliver Warbucks), director and choreographer Christopher Windom, and of course from movie star dog Marti, who plays Sandy in Alabama Shakespeare's new production of \"Annie.\" It runs July 4-Aug. 5. Shannon Heupel/Advertiser\nNew production opens July 4 at Alabama Shakespeare Festival\nOne of the world’s most beloved musicals is coming to Montgomery.\n“This show is so iconic because it has a really good message, like hope and optimism and perseverance. It’s really a good message that everybody needs,” said Vivian Poe, who plays the title role in Alabama Shakespeare Festival’s new production of “Annie.” The production opens July 4 and runs through August 5 on ASF’s Festival Stage.\nThe characters are memorable, and so is the music, with song-and-dance numbers like “It’s the Hard Knock Life,” “Easy Street,” and, of course, “Tomorrow.”\n“I love singing ’Tomorrow.’ I like to take my time to really convince every spot in the theater that they will live on. They can do this! There’s hope for tomorrow. It’s such a beautiful song,” said Poe, who has played Annie before at Olney Theatre Center. “The songs are super good, and really fun to sing. We have a great cast.”\nShe’s not the only one who’s played in “Annie” before. Her canine sidekick and best friend on stage is actually a movie star. Marti played Sandy in the 2014 “Annie” movie with Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz.\nWhile the movie was a modern take on the tale, ASF’s production of the Tony Award-winning musical sees Annie on an adventure in the 1930s during the Great Depression.\nAnnie’s goal is to to find her parents, who abandoned her years earlier on the doorstep of a New York orphanage run by Miss Hannigan. Annie foils Miss Hannigan’s schemes, befriends President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and finds a new family and home with billionaire Oliver “Daddy” Warbucks.\n“The staying power of it is because it’s such a good and well-written show. It’s just a pleasure to do it,” said Charles E. Wallace, who plays Warbucks. He said Annie changes everyone around her with her optimism and her spirit. “It hasn’t changed. It hasn’t been updated. It doesn’t need to be updated because it’s a classic.\nAnnie director and choreographer Christopher Windom, a St. Louis native who now lives in New York, is his first production at ASF.\n“It’s a pleasure to work outside of New York City area, and to be in communities that are as specific as Montgomery, Alabama,” Windom said. “One of the pleasures has been to learn about the community here. The people who live here and the people who come to see shows.”\nWindom said one of the goals is to reflect the local community from the stage to the audience as much as possible.\n“When I was hired to direct and choreograph ‘Annie,’ I promised Rick Dildine the artistic director that I would not take the production too far off the mark of what we know ‘Annie’ to be,” Windom said. “A joyful and warm and optimistic production. But my goal has been to make it very specific for this theater and for this community, and find way to honor the classic songs, the classic storytelling. But also make it a production that you might not be able to see anywhere else.”\n“Our director is super amazing,” Poe said. “I really like the flow of the show. It’s very heartwarming and it’s really true to the story.”\nWindom said he wanted to pull together a company of actors that are as diverse as New York City.\n“The production is set in New York City in the depression era. We wanted people who can embody that time period and the devastation that was going on at that time. But also the diverse communities that were affected by it,” Windom said. “We have a very nontraditional casting of our Oliver Warbucks, being played by a person of color. That is something that I think is very significant to this production. That representation in the production I think is a gift to the Montgomery community as well.”\n“With Warbucks, you see how no matter how old you are, that change can still occur,” Wallace said. “I’ve heard people say, ‘You can’t teach an old dog new tricks. But certainly when the right influence comes into your life and you’re open to it, it can affect you, and it can affect change in you.”\n“I want (the audience) to take away the lesson of humanity,” said Windom. “The lesson that we learn through Annie. She’s someone who has this dream of finding her parents. And in the end, she’s open to finding a family structure in a very unique and surprising way. We see every character, from Oliver Warbucks to even Miss Hannigan (Alicia Irving) and Grace Farrell (Rebecca Covington), everyone goes through growth or some sort of transformation throughout the story.\nTickets are available at asf.net or through the ASF box office at 1-800-841-4273.

These reasons range can from illness or untimely deaths of biological parents, to the parents’ inability to care for the child’s basic needs necessary for survival. Over the past 15 years there has been a dramatic rise in the number of children who are internationally adopted and a majority of these children have been raised in an institutional care facility.\nIn countries from the Eastern European block such as Russia, Romania, Ukraine and Moldova, children are still being placed into orphanages at an alarming rate. Reasons for abandonment stem from the fact that since the fall of the Communism, democracy and freedom have left many people poverty stricken and homeless. The lower socioeconomic class no longer has the social support of the government to help with their survival. Because of the poor economic situations of these people, families are no longer able to care for the medical, physical and psychological needs of their young. Families that are condemned to a life of poverty find orphanages to be the only viable alternative that their children have for survival and maybe even a future. Strange as this may sound it does occur all too frequently.\nHospital-based institutions are still state-run facilities with little or no resources. Children who have any type of medical condition (even minor problems) are placed in institutions, which also house patients with the more severe and sometimes neuropsychiatric conditions that no child should ever be exposed to. Children with more complicated or chronic medical conditions (such as blood disorders; infectious disease, congenital malformations and classic autism) are doomed to a forgotten life behind closed cold walls of the institutions.\nThe biggest problem that I personally have with the institutional setting is medical diagnoses that are given to these children. These diagnoses often are false, exaggerated and unfortunately sometimes very real. The disparity to the severity of the medical problems found in these children is is sometimes incomprehensible. They mix the severely mentally retarded, autistic, and handicapped patients with the relatively normal child who is abandoned, with mild developmental delay or the child who required minor surgery that is unable to acquire the procedure in order to lead a normal and healthy life..\nUnfortunately, once a child was placed in a orphanage, that label follows the child for years, especially in countries like communist Romania during the 1980s. These children were fated to remain there for a life without appropriate medical care or even the possibility of having a family to care for their needs..\nDevelopmental delays are frequently found in many of the orphanage children, even before they are placed in the institution. This is usually a direct result of poor pre-natal and post-natal factors, nutritional inadequacies and medical neglect. Once placed in an institutional care setting, these minor delays are often misconstrued as a metal deficiency or mental retardation.\nDuring the critical years of neurobiological development of the child’s brain, orphanages are notorious for being deficient in providing the social, emotional and cognitive stimulation required for normal development of the child. Many children are starved, neglected, and forced to stay in their cribs in order to follow safety protocols.\nChildren are frequently and repetitively moved from one age group to another. As the child ages out, he can no longer learn anything new for the younger children in the group and often regresses to a more immature behavior.\nAll of these factors, combined with profound medical, nutritional, and physical neglect cause these children to revert back to a more primitive state in the child’s mental development. Speech, language, and intellectual abilities languish, and over time developmental milestones deteriorate to levels where the child may appear to be truly mentally delayed or retarded.\nAs a defense mechanism, in order to maintain the child’s own inner well being, neglected children generally shut out all environmental and interpersonal contact that could cause them harm. There is sometimes a component of learned helplessness. It is this type of behavior that often gets labeled as Institutional Autism. Once this pattern of regression occurs, it tends to be insidious and progressive.\nThe following is a list of characteristics that children with Instititutional Autism exhibit:\nLoss of physical height and weight. These children look much younger than their chronological age.\nSevere language delay which can regress to infant babbling\nLack of eye contact, aloofness\nFailure to orient to child’s name\nLack of interactive play\nLack of interest in peers\nFailure to use gestures to point or show\nSometimes there are severe issues with bedwetting and soiling\nBehavioral control issues and lack of social development\nAttention and concentration problems. Example: ADHD-like behavior\nDeficient in learning and memory\nInstitution-acquired autistic behaviors\nSome of the most worrisome and disturbing characteristics of children afflicted with Institutional Autism are that when they have complete regression, they resort to self-stimulating behaviors in order to fill the lapses regarding loneliness, deprivation and despair.\nExamples of these behaviors are:\nRocking and head banging\nUncontrollable outbursts of rage and aggression\nBody thrusting into inanimate objects such as walls\nSelf-mutilating behaviors such as hair pulling and picking at the body\nDuring the adoption process many parents are faced with the dilemma of acquiring a child who exhibits some or all of the above mentioned characteristics. Parents become saddened when the child does not come running or show any type of emotion towards them when they arrive to meet the child. During the first hours to days for these children to be withdrawn, exhibit lack eye contact and lack of communication with the families. Observation over time is the best means to differentiate adjustment problems versus more severe conditions.\nAfter the adoption process is complete and the child returns to the United States, some of these children continue to display some quasi-autistic behaviors learned from in the institution for a period of time after the adoption is completed.\nIt must be remembered that all orphan children have significant impairment in both communication and their social skills. These children cannot be expected to come home, put on a pair of blue jeans and function immediately in our society. There is a great deal of work that is required to rehabilitate these children. In contrast to true Autism, Institutional Autism tends to improve with time and proper interventional services. It has also been found that some children who arrive with severe mental impairment upon arrival have a dramatic improvement in their IQ points in the first years post-adoption.\nI must once again stress the importance of rehabilitation, education and a great deal of work on behalf of the parents in order to obtain these results.\n*Institutional Autism is not a term found in your everyday Pediatric Textbook. It is a term described by Ronald Federici, Psy.D who has done extensive research and was the first to write about this subject in his book “Help for the Hopeless Child: A Guide for Families (With Special Discussion for Assessing and Treating the Post-Institutionalized Child), Second Edition, by Dr. Ronald S.

{"question":"Do both the Autumn Equinox ritual and Samhain celebrations involve food offerings?","answer":"Yes, both celebrations involve food offerings but in different ways. In the Autumn Equinox ritual, apples are shared among participants as a symbol of the harvest and connection to nature.

Of course, there are some significant differences between the Pagan celebration and the commercialized event. But, there are also some traditions the commercialized holiday shares with the way pagans celebrate Halloween today.\nOne main difference is the heavy spending occurring each year. In the United States alone, 179 billion people celebrated Halloween in 2017. On average, each person spends over $80.00 on holiday needs. The total amount of money spent for the year? (Can I hear a drumroll, please… Would you believe people in the US spent over $191 billion in 2017 alone? It’s true! But, you can rest assured knowing the ancient cultures didn’t have that kind of holiday budget!\nAncient Roots of the Pagan Halloween Holiday\nThe way Pagans celebrate Halloween varies, but many of the traditions stem from ancient practices. So, what was Halloween like in ancient times? What cultures honor the holiday and why?\nEver wonder what would happen if there were only two seasons for the whole year? The Wheel of the Year still turns. It’s true! In fact, the ancient Celts saw the yearly division in two seasons, not four. The division of the year is simple. One half of the year was the light half. The other remaining six months was dark. The existing seasons were summer and winter. The celebrations corresponding to the seasonal divisions were Samhain and Beltane. These two days are holy dates in the year where the days shift from light into darkness and vice versa.\nSamhain: The End of Summer\nThe Samhain holiday was the “marker” or “time milestone” indicating the conclusion of the summer season. Samhain marks the time when the daylight hours shorten, and night becomes longer. Samhain marks the midpoint between Autumnal Equinox and Winter Solstice. The people residing in the Isle of Man, Scotland, and Ireland celebrated the holiday. There’s some historical evidence the holiday was something people honored all the way back to Neolithic times. Some landmarks align with the sunrise and sunset on Samhain.\nSamhain is the final harvest for the year. It is the Festival of the Dead and the New Year for some Pagans. The holiday’s pronunciation is “SOW-en” or SAH-when.” The holiday, being a fire festival is a two-day celebration. It runs from sunset on Oct 31 until sunset November 1st.\nThe ancient Celts not only acknowledge the changes of light and dark during the year. The time of year was important because of agriculture and farming responsibilities. The Celts understood when it was light it was the time to prepare for the when the dark half of the year rules. Harvesting foods and preparing for winter was imperative for surviving the brutal winter.\nSamhain and Sacred Cows\nFor the Celts, there were two high fire festivals. The ancients saw Samhain and Beltane as the major Sabbats and Imbolc and Lammas as the minor Sabbats. The two high Sabbats have traditions surrounding the care of cattle. During the summer, Celts brought the cows to the hills where they had summer-time pastures. When the dark half of the year begins at Samhain, they brought the cows back home. It is here in enclosures the cows remain for the duration of the winter if the Celts did not slaughter them for food.\nThe Celts had ritualized the practice of bringing the cows out to pasture and home again. When Beltane time arrives, the cows receive a blessing through ritual practices. They would have the cows pass through two fires. But, why did they do this ritual?\nThe cows are an animal the Celts consider as lunar creatures. Cows offer nourishment through milk, cheese, and butter. The nourishment the animal gives aligns it with the Mother Goddess and water element.\nThe Celts also saw the elements of water and fire as magical. They held the belief the two elements were what created the entire world. By passing the cows through two sacred fires, the Celts believe magick is afoot. It is the act of bringing fire and water together. Doing so was to work magick for change, creation, and transformation.\nAncient Samhain Traditions & Beliefs\nIn ancient times Halloween is known as Samhain. Other names for the holiday include Sauin, Samhainn, and Samhuinn. There is a connection between modern-day Halloween and Samhain. The event is one the Celts consider a sacred day as it marks the division of the year. The Celts had several traditions NeoPagans include in their Sabbat celebrations too. They would honor the day with ritual practices, feasting, divination, and guising.\nAos Sí: Visiting Spirits from the Otherworld\nAncient myth tells us that Samhain is a time when Spirits roam the world free. They can cross over from one plane of existence to the other because the veil thins or lifts. The Celts believed that both fairies and spirits can crossover from the other side. These spirits are the Aos Sí. It was an appropriate time to satisfy the Aos Sí and pagan deities. It was necessary to ensure the health of the livestock during the cold winter season. It was a normal practice to leave out offerings for the spirits.\nThe Dumb Supper\nPagans would place beverages and food outside to satisfy the Aos Sí. NeoPagans celebrating Samhain have revived many of the old practices. There was a ritual to honor patron deities and to acknowledge the change of the seasons. Then there is often a feast. Once the circle closes, remaining libations is for spirits. An invitation to spirits is open this night. A practice called “The Dumb Supper” has practitioners putting out a dinner plate. For who is this place setting, you ask? For the deceased. During the celebratory meal, the practitioner will include some quiet time. The stillness is necessary in hopes of hearing the ancestor’s voice.\nModern Day Translation for Honoring the Ancestors Today, some pagans have ritual and feasts: here, the practice of putting out a place setting for spirit ancestors is still in practice. Others might stage a special altar dedicated to ancestors and those who have passed on. On top of the altar, images of ancestors, and perhaps small tokens or items once belonging to the ancestors can be placed.\nDuring Samhain, the mini-altar can be decorated with appropriate seasonal colors, flowers, fruits, and vegetables from the harvest, nuts, stones, crystals, and the like. Candles are lit to light the way for ancestors. The idea is to invite the spirit of ancestors to join in the festivities of the evening and to spend time remembering those who have gone before us. It’s a time when we can thank our ancestors for all they’ve done while they were alive, and all they continue to do in the way of offering protection and guidance from the other side.\nSince Samhain is the time of the thinning of the veil, it is one where modern pagans practice divination. Some feel the thinner veil makes it easier to get results from divinatory methods at this time. Other practices include spell casting and meditation, with the idea of using the powerful energies of the time to empower one’s magickal workings.\nMumming and Guising\nAs a part of ancient festivals, the Celts engaged in a practice called “mumming and guising.” It is from this practice that modern-day trick-or-treating originates. The practice involves people putting on costumes. Once in disguise, they go about reciting verses as they go from one home to another. In return, they receive food. The idea was to wear a costume to confuse the Spirits roaming free. Games and divination were also common during this Samhain celebration. Neopagans also play games. It is also a time to conduct divination sessions with an array of divinatory tools. Such tools include the Tarot, pendulum, and scrying are among the most popular.\nThe Sacred Samhain Bonfire\nThe Celts celebrated Samhain with bonfires serving as imitations of the Sun. As mentioned before, they saw the two forces of water and fire as magickal. Bonfires were lit to perform sympathetic magick. Ancient cultures belief it intensifies the power to fend off the darkness. The magick empowers the Sun and helps grow excellent crops. The fire is a purifying element seen as burning away all negativity in a person’s life. Fire scrying was not unusual on this holiday. Many NeoPagans have or enjoy a bonfire on Samhain. If not, candles are something to enjoy while invoking the power of the fire element on a smaller scale.\nThe Witches’ New Year\nIf we base our division of the year on the way the ancient Celts did, then Samhain is not only the end of summer but the beginning of the New Year. Modern Pagans and Witches consider Samhain a lot like January 1, of the Gregorian Calendar. It’s, therefore, an evening for contemplating all we’ve accomplished, and what we want for the year ahead. As we ready ourselves for the colder season, we also consider the “seeds” we want to plant when the appropriate time comes to do so.\nSamhain versus Halloween: Is There a Difference?\nOver the course of time, many of the practices stemming from Samhain rituals and traditions have melded into Halloween customs. But, make no mistake about it, there is a HUGE difference between Samhain and Halloween. The distinction is identified in the “meaningfulness” of the day.\nYes, Samhain is fun with ritual, feasts, and the present-day witches’ balls are a blast! Yes, Halloween is fun too, with trick or treating, costume parties, haunted hayrides, and the works. There’s plenty of fans of Halloween; that’s why it is widely celebrated, highly commercialized, and why there are so many fans of Jack Skellington from Tim Burton’s famed “Nightmare Before Christmas!” And, let us not forget the magic of a little peanut butter and chocolate: whoever came up with that idea definitely had some knowledge of the magical arts (wink)!\nUltimately, the big difference between Samhain and Halloween is the significance of the day. Halloween is a fantastic celebration, but Samhain is a day where Pagan’s celebrate things both religious and sacred: It is one where Pagans honor the dead, celebrate the living, and look with joy to the year ahead!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bdd1bd4b-ace3-403a-9787-2a99b43693e7>","<urn:uuid:4b11ce29-d92e-499b-be2c-e1294ee38a67>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Looking to understand the environmental impact - how do NuScale's SMR technology and traditional fossil fuel power plants differ in their contribution to carbon emissions in the United States?","answer":"Nuclear energy, including NuScale's SMR technology, provides carbon-free electricity generation, making up 20 percent of the United States' electricity production. This stands in stark contrast to fossil fuels, which are currently the largest electricity-producing source in the United States, the world's second-largest energy-consuming country. NuScale's SMR technology is specifically being developed as a clean energy solution to replace retiring coal-fired power plants, helping combat climate change through carbon-free power generation. This is evidenced by various agreements, including those in Poland, where NuScale is exploring SMR deployment as a coal repowering/repurposing solution for existing coal-fueled power plants.","context":["Poland has become a focus of interest for companies seeking to develop small modular reactors (SMRs).\nOn 23 September, Canada’s Cameco, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH), GEH SMR Technologies Canada, (GEH SMR Canada) and Synthos Green Energy (SGE), a member of the Synthos Group signed a non-exclusive and non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to evaluate the potential establishment of a uranium fuel supply chain in Canada capable of servicing a potential fleet of BWRX-300 SMRs in Poland.\nThe BWRX-300 is a 300MWe water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems that leverages the design and licensing basis of GEH’s US NRC-certified ESBWR.

In addition to this MOU, SGE is working closely with GEH to identify supply chain opportunities in Poland that complement the export capabilities being developed in Canada for the BWRX-300, which could enable us to successfully deliver carbon-free electricity to the grid.”\nGEH President & CEO Jay Wileman said GEH “is honoured to be working with Cameco and Synthos Green Energy to deploy the BWRX-300”, adding: “Through our collaboration we look forward to the opportunity to bring carbon-free energy generation to Poland and support the creation of valuable uranium supply jobs in Canada.” By leveraging the existing ESBWR design certification, utilising the licensed and proven GNF2 fuel design, and incorporating proven components and supply chain expertise, GEH believes the BWRX-300 can become the lowest-risk, most cost-competitive and quickest to market SMR.\nIn a forward looking statement, the companies noted that the project was subject to a number of risks, “including: the risk that a uranium fuel supply chain to service SMRs in Poland may not be successfully established; the risk that the BWRX-300 may not be commercialised and deployed within the expected time and at the expected costs, or at all; the risk that nuclear energy and SMRs may not contribute to decarbonisation to the extent expected; and the risk that it may not prove possible for the parties to provide carbon-free electricity in Poland or create additional employment opportunities in Canada.”\nNuscale inks MOUs with Polish companies\nThe same day, another MOU was signed by US-based NuScale Power, KGHM Polska Miedz, and Piela Business Engineering (PBE) to explore the deployment of NuScale’s small modular reactor (SMR) technology as a coal repurposing solution for existing coal-fired power plants and electricity and heat for KGHM’s industrial processes in Poland. KGHM is a Poland-based leader in copper and silver production and PBE is a Poland-based consultancy which specialises in business engineering advisory.\nNuScale’s light water SMR aims to supply energy for electrical generation, district heating, desalination, and other process heat applications. It features a fully factory-fabricated NuScale Power Module capable of generating 77MW of electricity using pressurised water reactor technology. NuScale's scalable design—a power plant can house up to four, six, or 12 individual power modules reduces the financial commitments associated with gigawatt-sized nuclear facilities. In August 2020 it became the first SMR design to receive approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. NuScale and Fluor are currently working for Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems to commercialise the plant. NuScale has signed and announced memoranda of understanding with potential customers interested in considering a deployment of its SMR technology in 12 countries.\nUnder the MOU, NuScale will support KGHM and PBE’s examination of NuScale’s SMR technology as a coal repowering/repurposing solution for existing coal-fuelled power plants and more broadly for new nuclear plant implementations, as well as for energy in support of industrial operations in Poland. The examination will include an analysis of technical, economic, legal, regulatory, financial, and organisational factors.\n“NuScale is thrilled to partner with KGHM and PBE on the potential deployment of NuScale Power plants in Poland,” said John Hopkins, Chairman and CEO of NuScale Power. “The retirement of ageing coal-fired power plants is leading to changes in power generation, infrastructure needs, and workforce opportunity. NuScale’s SMR technology is an ideal flexible clean energy solution to repurpose retiring coal fuelled power plants and most importantly, retain and retrain the skilled power plant workforce already in place in these Polish communities.”\nMarcin Chludzinski, President of the Management Board of KGHM Polska Miedz said changes in the climate required decisive actions. “We are already feeling the impact, including in a financial sense, connected among others with the increases in energy prices. The construction of small nuclear reactors by 2030 is a solid declaration and an element of our energy transformation. We are pioneers in Poland, as we expect that the first of our NPPs will come online in 2029. SMR technology will not only help us to protect the environment but will also substantially reduce the costs of operating our business.” He added that the company planned to generate power commercially in order to assist in the green transformation of Poland and bring down costs for the average household.\n“With the future energy sector, design modular energy sources will play an exceptionally important role,” said Piotr Piela, Founder and Managing Partner of PBE. “This is why the SMR, which is not competitive but truly complementary to big nuclear reactors, is not only a crucial component fitting energy transformation of Poland and many others fossil fuels dependent European Union (EU) countries, but also considered the ‘technology of common interest’ essential to successfully implement the Pan European Green Deal.”\nAlso on 23 September, NuScale Power, Getka Group (Getka) and Unimot had signed an MOU with business purposes including to explore the deployment of NuScale’s SMR technology as a coal repurposing solution for existing coal-fired power plants in Poland. Getka is an Oklahoma-based integrated energy company providing construction, and delivery of petroleum, refined products, and alternative energy. Through its Zero Impact Strategy, Getka is focused on reducing emissions output through renewable energy. Unimot is a Poland-based multi-energy Capital Group that offers its wholesale and retail customers fuel products, gas and electricity, including renewable energy. NuScale will support Getka and Unimot’s examination of NuScale’s SMR technology as a coal repowering/repurposing solution for existing coal-fuelled power plants and more broadly for new nuclear plant implementations in Poland.\n“NuScale is excited to partner with Getka and Unimot on the potential deployment of NuScale Power plants in Poland,” said NuScale CEO John Hopkins. Dariusz Cichocki, Chairman and CEO of Getka Group said the project aligns with Getka’s commitment to decarbonise and diversify Poland’s energy infrastructure. “Through our ongoing partnership with Unimot, we are pleased to partner with NuScale to bring innovative solutions to market in Central Europe,” he added.\nAdam Sikorski, President of the Management Board of Unimot said this is another area to develop low-emission projects in Poland. “Our role will be promoting SMR technology as a reliable alternative for coal technologies, and acquiring business partners in the Polish market. Ultimately, we also intend to create a platform of collaboration with Polish academic centres and potential Polish component suppliers to develop this technology in our country. Because of this, we can actively support the energy transformation of Poland, simultaneously diversifying our Group’s business.”\nAccording to the Polish government's Energy Strategy, Poland plans to construct six nuclear power units. In 2033, Poland should launch the reactor generating some 1-1.6 GWe. Subsequent reactors should be constructed every two to three years until the target of six units is reached. US companies Bechtel and Westinghouse Electric Company in July announced that they had formed a team to pursue NPP projects in Poland. France’s EDF has opened an office in Warsaw in order to prepare a comprehensive proposal for construction of Poland's first NPP. South Korea’s Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power have also expressed interest.","Date of Award\nMaster of Science in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics\nMechanical, Industrial and Systems Engineering\nNuclear energy is the largest source of carbon-free electricity in the United States, making up 20 percent of the electricity generated in the United States. The United States is the second-largest energy-consuming country globally, with fossil fuels being the largest electricity-producing source. With Climate Change at the head of the world’s most difficult circumstances, it is evident that nuclear power is a crucial and significant source of carbon-free energy to combat this crisis. The NuScale Power SMR can provide a cost-effective and safe solution to further the expansion of nuclear energy throughout the United States and the world. The nature of the buoyancy-driven natural circulation cooling design of the reactor primary systems and the modularity and scalability power plant system provide the innovations and technology needed to do so. There are few tools like RELAP5-3D that allow for the thermal-hydraulic transient analysis of nuclear reactors. Due to the minimum amount of open literature available on the transient analysis of the NuScale Power SMR, RELAP5-3D has been utilized to perform the steady-state and a steam generator tube-rupture transient calculation. The benchmark experiment for thermal-hydraulic calculation codes, called Edward’s pipe blowdown experiment, was first modeled to understand the basics of a transient two-phase flow model. This experiment was performed to acquire the essential modeling skills and techniques to build the model and perform the calculations of the NuScale Power SMR using RELAP5-3D.\nThe NuScale Power Small Modular Reactor (SMR) relies on buoyancy-driven natural circulation cooling to cool the reactor core and extract thermal energy for electricity generation. The natural convection phenomenon has been of research interest for many years. NuScale Power LLC has only developed the SMR in recent years, and this integral Pressurized Water Reactor (iPWR) is the first nuclear reactor to utilize this phenomenon. Therefore, there is an increased interest in performing the transient analysis of the thermal-hydraulics of this reactor to understand conditions in which the natural circulation cooling inside the reactor system may be disrupted. There have been minimal published resources on this topic to date, making this research necessary for the growth and future of SMRs and natural circulation cooling of nuclear reactors. The innovations and designs of the NuScale Power SMR have allowed for enhanced safety, cost, scalability, modularity, time of construction, ease of transportation, and standardized manufacturing process of SMRs and nuclear power plants. RELAP5-3D was utilized to develop the model of the NuScale Power SMR and perform steady-state and transient analysis calculations of the reactor. This model was developed using the publicly available design data and parameters released by the U.S. NRC for the NuScale Power Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). The steady-state conditions of the reactor were modeled to simulate the reactor operation conditions in preparation for the transient analysis calculation. A tube rupture of the secondary steam generator was simulated for the transient analysis calculation to understand if the natural circulation cooling would be disrupted and if the secondary coolant would rise to dangerous levels proposing system failures.\nThe steady-state model simulated the proper reactor operational conditions, exhibiting higher mass flow rates than the best estimate flow rate specified in NuScale FSAR. The core temperatures were on the higher end of the temperature range but were still within the operational conditions, with the pressure controlled at 1850 psia. The forward flow energy loss coefficients proposed a particular issue in manipulating the code to obtain the core's correct mass flow rates and temperatures. It was found that the loss coefficients could be changed in a manner that lowered the mass flow rates closer to the best estimate flow rate, but the temperatures would, in turn, increase. Because the mass flow rate specified in NuScale FSAR was the best estimate value, the author concluded that the steady-state model was sufficient for the tube rupture model. The tube rupture was modeled using a single junction that connected the primary and secondary steam generators. The model was created to simulate a single helical coil steam generator tube being ruptured. Depressurization was not seen on the primary because the pressurizer was modeled as a pressure boundary condition at 1850 psia. A mass flow rate of approximately 36 lbm/s was seen through the tube rupture to the secondary side of the system. The water level did not increase significantly, but the liquid void fraction increased slightly. The flow through the rupture was choked because of the flashing of the liquid at high temperature and pressure to vapor at the lower pressure. It was found that instabilities and oscillations occurred very quickly on the primary and secondary sides, but the natural circulation flow was not disrupted.\nJohnson, Kyle P., \"TRANSIENT ANALYSIS OF THE NUSCALE POWER HELICAL-COIL STEAM GENERATOR TUBE RUPTURE USING RELAP5-3D\" (2021).

{"question":"What are the environmental implications of poverty, and how does the Kiva loan funding process address sustainable development?","answer":"Poverty and environmental degradation are closely linked, with the poorest people often forced to degrade natural resources through overuse, such as depleting soil nutrients through excessive farming. Improving conditions for those in poverty helps both people and their environment. Kiva addresses this through a loan funding process where borrowers can receive funds for sustainable projects, either through field partners or direct loans. Most field partners pre-disburse funds to enable immediate impact. Loans typically have 30 days to fundraise on Kiva, with two funding models: fixed funding requiring full amount raised, and flexible funding allowing partial funding to be combined with other resources. This system supports sustainable development initiatives while providing immediate assistance to those in need.","context":["What Are Social Justice and Microlending?\nOne way to reduce poverty and encourage social justice is through microlending. Social justice is the idea that the world has enough resources to meet the needs of everyone but that financial inequality and unequal resource distribution result in hunger, poverty, violence, and environmental damage. Many environmental scientists believe in social justice. Social justice advocates that the earth’s resources be managed in a way that provides for everyone’s basic needs.\nAs the human population grows and nations continue to seek increased wealth, considering how earth’s resources are cared for and conserved for future generations becomes even more important. Preindustrial nations, where many of the poorest people live, can learn from the mistakes of more developed nations. Lifting people out of poverty through sustainable development is a powerful way to create a brighter future for everyone.\nPoverty and the environment are closely linked. Reducing poverty and increasing sustainable development all over the world result in healthier ecosystems and wealthier societies.\nAlmost 2 billion people live in poverty around the world. People living in extreme poverty don’t have the option of choosing the more sustainable path; they’re struggling each day just to get enough clean water and food. (When economists speak of poverty, they’re referring to people who are unable to meet their basic needs for food, fresh water, and clean living conditions.)\nOften, these poorest of the poor are the ones who degrade natural resources through overuse — farming until the soil is completely emptied of nutrients, grazing cattle until no grassland remains, and so on.\nEnvironmental scientists and social scientists realize that improving conditions for people living in poverty improves not only those people’s lives but also their environment. Examples of such simple ways to improve the lives of those living in poverty include the following:\nProviding basic education for children\nBattling malnutrition and disease\nEducating women about family planning to reduce birth rates\nInvesting in local-scale sustainable infrastructure such as solar-powered energy grids and sustainable agriculture\nIncreasing human populations, just like populations of other organisms, can put a strain on their environment. More people mean the need for more resources. Educating women and improving health conditions leads to slower population growth. Couple these advances with investing in sustainable infrastructure, and you pave the way for a sustainable and much improved way of life for those struggling to meet basic daily needs.\nSocial justice is related to environmental justice. Environmental justice means that all people have a right to be equally involved in making decisions about their environment. Advocates of environmental justice work to ensure that poor people and minorities are not disproportionately burdened with pollutants and other environmental damage.\nOne way to reduce poverty and encourage social justice is through microlending. The idea of microlending is simple: Rather than depend on large investments in national infrastructures to change living conditions for poor people, microlending offers small loans that can be used to make small changes with large impacts.\nFor example, a woman who sells eggs in a village market can use a microloan to purchase more hens or build a larger henhouse to protect her chickens. The amount of money required for this small improvement is tiny, but it can have dramatic results, bringing more wealth to this woman and her family.\nMicrolending got started in the 1980s and is still a relatively new concept for many people. Microloans are risky because you’re lending money to people who don’t have the wealth to ensure they’ll pay you back anytime soon.\nOne reason that microloans are successful is that average people in wealthier, industrialized nations can afford to offer microloans; a minimum loan amount may be $25. Organizations such as Kiva help lenders locate borrowers in need around the world and coordinate loan disbursement and repayment.","Your way of the Kiva loan. a debtor is applicable for the loan\nAzi in istorie\nHow can the amount of money for the mortgage arrive at each debtor?\nLoan funds reach borrowers through KivaвЂ™s Field Partners, or through the funds transfer platform PayPal. For many loans on Kiva, our neighborhood Field Partners are accountable for dispersing the funds to borrowers. With regards to the Field Partner, the funds can be directed at each debtor before https://titleloansusa.info/payday-loans-ut/, during or following the specific loan is published on Kiva. Many lovers supply the funds out before the loan is posted ( everything we call pre-disbursal) as it permits borrowers to make use of the funds instantly. Then when a loan provider supports somebody loan on Kiva, the borrower may have those funds at hand. Nonetheless, help for the loan continues to be required and also as the borrower makes repayments, they truly are passed along towards the specific Kiva loan providers whom supported the mortgage. For direct loans, after the loan is completely crowdfunded on Kiva, funds are sent towards the debtor via PayPal.\nWhat’s the research procedure on Kiva loans?\nBorrowers on Kiva are vetted or endorsed by either a local industry partner, Trustee or people in the city. For partner loans, Kiva conducts research on the local Field Partners which is administering the loans. All Field Partners must make provision for leadership information, monetary paperwork and step-by-step plans for making use of KivaвЂ™s money for loans with a high social effect. Partners who post more loans distribute extra documents and a Kiva analyst conducts a visit that is on-site conduct interviews with leadership, administration and borrowers. For direct loans, Kiva staff simply take a few actions to validate the borrowerвЂ™s identification and borrowers are endorsed with a Trustee company or people in their community in an ongoing process we call social underwriting. a debtor must either have the recommendation of the Kiva Trustee, a company or person who works for connecting borrowers with Kiva, or effectively invite people in their very own internet sites to help their loan ahead of the loan has the capacity to fundraise publicly on Kiva. Because their own connections, relatives and buddies are placing their particular bucks in, we think social underwriting increases borrowersвЂ™ commitment to repaying their loans. Extra information can be acquired on our homework web web web page.\nWhat the results are if that loan does not completely fund on Kiva?\nOften, loans on Kiva have actually 1 month to effectively fundraise. However in many cases, if that loan does not completely fund on Kiva the specific debtor is in a roundabout way impacted. ThatвЂ™s since most of KivaвЂ™s Field Partners give borrowers usage of credit before publishing their loans from the Kiva internet site (that which we call pre-disbursal), therefore the debtor can utilize the funds instantly. The crowdfunded money raised on Kiva can be used to backfill the mortgage quantity, as soon as the debtor makes repayments they truly are passed away along towards the certain Kiva loan providers whom supported the mortgage. You can find 2 capital models on Kiva: Fixed: the total loan quantity should be raised to enable funds become delivered to the Field Partner. In the event that loan just isn’t funded in complete in the fundraising duration, the mortgage will expire and any funds raised are going to be gone back to loan providers’ Kiva records. Flexible: any funds raised within 1 month is going to be passed away along towards the Field Partner facilitating the mortgage and additionally they shall show up along with other resources of financing to pay for the remainder loan quantity. You will find a few circumstances where borrowers are straight impacted and wonвЂ™t get their loan if it doesnвЂ™t fund on Kiva. This occurs with direct loans and partner loans that aren’t pre-disbursed, which may have a fixed financing model. We all know it may be difficult to see some loans skip their financing objectives, which is the reason why we have expanded the money options as they are spending so much time to attain brand brand brand new loan providers who is able to help create more positive effect.\nJust how do repayments return to lenders?\nLoan funds are paid back from borrowers to loan providers through KivaвЂ™s Field Partners, or with the use of the amount of money transfer platform PayPal. For partner loans, KivaвЂ™s Field that is local partners repayments through the borrowers, predicated on each loan payment routine additionally the borrowerвЂ™s ability to settle. The partner then repays Kiva and repayments are deposited into the specific Kiva loan provider account. Lenders probably know that this presents a layer of danger: payment of Field Partner loans depends on the borrower repaying the Field Partner, while the Field Partner repaying Kiva. For direct loans, borrowers utilize PayPal to transfer repayments and Kiva deposits repaid funds to your specific Kiva loan provider account. Loan providers must be aware that this model presents a kind that is different of: there’s no Field Partner taking care of the floor to follow up utilizing the debtor and encourage or collect repayments. In any case, you can withdraw your money, donate it to Kiva, or relend it to another borrower as youвЂ™re repaid. Find out about the potential risks of financing.\nWhat the results are if your debtor canвЂ™t repay the loan?\nThe Field Partner or Kiva (in the case of a direct loan) may try to reschedule repayments on the delinquent loan in order to make it possible for the borrower to eventually repay if a borrower is behind on paying back a loan. This really is practice that is common microlending. But often, despite having these efforts become versatile, borrowers simply canвЂ™t repay and loans end up in standard. Whenever a Kiva loan defaults, we notify all adding loan providers by e-mail and these loan providers can look at the amount that is remaining as a loss. Field Partners may decide not to ever provide up to an individual that is specific if they arenвЂ™t in a position to repay, as well as in the actual situation of direct loans, borrowers canвЂ™t submit an application for another loan on Kiva unless theyвЂ™ve paid back past loans."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:39371631-e70b-446c-ac6e-2d3e0f72c7b9>","<urn:uuid:c4e82d82-8bbe-4e33-991c-0fb564502ee0>"],"error":null}

Similarly, the Dakota Bioprocessing Consortium (DakotaBioCon) aims to develop sustainable chemical transformations, though their focus is on biomass processing to produce high-value chemicals and materials from renewable resources as alternatives to petroleum-based chemicals. Both initiatives share the core goal of understanding and developing sustainable chemical processes, though in different contexts.","context":["The role of the National Science Foundation (NSF) in supporting the ocean sciences in the United States is examined here by Open Access Government\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal agency in the U.S. that supports fundamental research and education across all fields of science and engineering.\nThis article looks at the work of NSF’s Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE), within the NSF, who exist to support research, education and infrastructure that advance our understanding of the global oceans and ocean basins, including their interactions with the integrated Earth system and human beings. Within this division is the Marine Geosciences Section, which has a Chemical Oceanography section and one for Marine Geology and Geophysics (MG&G).\nFirstly, the Chemical Oceanography Program supports research into the chemistry of the oceans and the role of the oceans in global geochemical cycles. Areas of interest here include:\n- Chemical exchanges between the oceans and other parts of the Earth system;\n- Chemical composition, speciation and transformation;\n- Internal cycling in oceans, seas and estuaries plus and;\n- The use of measured chemical distributions as indicators of biological, physical and geological processes.\nSecondly, the Marine Geology and Geophysics Core Program is concerned with all aspects of research around the geology and geophysics of the present ocean basins and margins, plus the same for the Great Lakes. This Program supports science that includes the following fascinating areas, to name a few:\n- The structure, composition, evolution and tectonics of the oceanic lithosphere;\n- Marine hydrogeology, seeps and gas hydrates, water-rock interaction and hydrothermal vent and fluid formation and geochemistry;\n- Marine sedimentology and coastal processes, stratigraphy, sediment transport and diagenesis;\n- Paleoceanography, paleoclimate and sea level change;\n- Submarine volcanology, petrology and geochemistry of the oceanic crust and upper mantle and;\n- Marine geohazards (such as earthquakes, mass wasting, geological aspects of tsunamis).\nAdded to this, we know that the Marine Geology and Geophysics Program is concerned with supporting new ideas and cutting-edge research. Field, analytical, and laboratory experimental projects; methods development; modelling; and the re-analysis and/or synthesis of existing data are supported by this Program. Also, the Program interfaces with NSF programs across the geosciences and across the Agency. (1)\nNew connections between climate change and warming oceans\nIn recent news from the field, NSF recently highlighted the work of scientists from the University of Toronto who have drawn new connections between climate change and the warming oceans.\nUli Wortmann, a professor in the Department of Earth Sciences in the Faculty of Arts & Science at the University of Toronto and co-author of the study explains more about what this study reveals in his own words. “Our study shows that global warming is not only about extreme weather events, or hotter summers, but it has the potential to alter the ocean structure with unknown consequences for fisheries.\n“We show that the last time large amounts of CO2 were injected into the atmosphere, not only did the planet get hot – which is known as the so-called Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, about 55 million years ago – but it also changed the chemistry of the ocean quite markedly.”\nHow calcifying organisms will respond to ocean acidification\nAnother piece of research highlighted by NSF’s Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) suggests that size is the key factor that predicts how calcifying organisms will respond to ocean acidification. Allison Barner, who carried out the research while completing her PhD in integrative biology at Oregon State University shares her thoughts on ocean acidification. “Decades of research have shown that calcifying species are negatively affected by ocean acidification…But even closely related species can have different responses to acidification and not much was known about the drivers that shape this variation.”\nAdded to this, we learn that around 30% of the carbon dioxide in the air ends up in the sea, where it causes a reduction in carbonate ions – a key building block for a variety of calcifying organisms, including not only the algae in the study but also animals such as oysters, mussels, sea stars and corals. As well as running experiments that simulated future ocean acidification conditions, Barner and colleagues measured a suite of properties for each species, including its habitat distribution along the Oregon coastline and its size, surface area and shape.\n“All of the species had declining calcification with short-term increases in acidification,” says Barner, who now works as a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. “And the findings supported the hypothesis that organismal size is the best predictor of an individual’s physiological performance under acidified conditions. Importantly, we can rule out the scenario that each species might have a different response to ocean acidification.” (3)\nThe links between carbon and plankton\nOne project, announced in June this year concerns a joint project between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) which aims to study the life and death of microscopic plankton, tiny plant and animal organisms that play a vital part in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and the oceans.\nWhile the major pathways of how carbon moves through the ocean are known, how much of it is transferred along these pathways and how much they depend on ecosystem characteristics, are not as well known. Providing us with more detail on this, Mike Sieracki, a Biological Oceanography program director in NSF’s Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) says: “The carbon that humans are putting into the atmosphere is warming Earth…Much of that carbon goes into the ocean and is transported to the deep sea, where it will not return to the atmosphere for a long time. This project will help us to understand the biological and chemical processes that remove that carbon, and to monitor these processes as climate changes.” (4)\nMany further examples of NSF supported research could be discussed here if space allowed, such as how a new study challenges scientists’ presupposition about the carbon cycle (5) or how nutrient pollution makes ocean acidification worse for coral reefs (6). In closing, we have seen some fantastic examples of just one area that the NSF supports when it comes to basic research and the people to create knowledge that transforms the future of our world.

These sensors will yield information about the export of carbon and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus from the watershed over time, including periods of high or low water flow associated with the storms and droughts that are predicted to become more frequent as climate changes.\nAt the same time, the researchers will conduct a series of laboratory and field experiments and agent-based modeling to determine how stakeholders will accept and use the data collected by the sensor network. The overarching goal is to assist stakeholders in their policy-making by linking the results of experimental economics analysis of environmental data to environmental governance and market mechanisms designed to sustain and improve water quality and quantity.\nSource: National Science Foundation"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e5ca6cca-f19a-474e-95f6-54395608d4d1>","<urn:uuid:ba912985-4952-4045-91a8-3969a859a093>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can choir staging accommodate both seated and standing performers, and how can meditation help manage physical fatigue during long performances?","answer":"For choir staging, seated performers need 1m deep decks with kick plates to prevent chairs from falling, while standing performers need 0.5m deep decks. In terms of capacity, 2 members can be seated per 1m of deck, while 2-2.5 members can stand in the same space. As for managing fatigue, meditation can help by reducing stress levels and improving energy levels. Specifically, body scan meditation helps release physical tension, while breath-focused meditation induces calmness and relaxation. Regular meditation practice has been shown to reduce fatigue and improve overall emotional well-being.","context":["A guide to buying staging for a choir or Choral group. Things to consider when planning to buy portable staging for a choir.\nIt probably goes without saying that you will have already considered applying for a grant to fund your platforms.\nThere are a few things to consider when planning to buy a portable stage for choir use:\nModular staging is usually more economic using the biggest pieces available to create your area. Although this creates a trade off between transport-ability and cost.\nSo with this in mind. Answer these questions and you’ll be able to fine tune your requirements.\nWill you be seated or stood on the deck platforms?\nSeated – you need 1m deep decks with a kick plate attached to the rear to stop chairs falling off.\nStood – you need 0.5m deep decks – depending on the drop at the rear, you may want to consider handrails.\nDo you have access to a van or will it be transported in members cars?\nVan – go for the 2m long decks – these are more economic\nCar – you’ll need 1m long decks to fit in the cars\nWill you use the floor as the front row?\nHow many members do you have?\nYou can gauge a rough idea of how many metres wide, and tiers are required.\nIn comfort you can seat 2 members per 1m on a deck platform – but you can probably stand 2 to 2.5 members depending on whether they are moving about or not.\nSo for instance a 5m wide tier would seat approx 10 members, but may stand 12.\nFrom a weight capacity point of view, most staging nowadays takes at least 900kg per sq/m – some up to 2 tonnes p/sqm.\nIf you are using the front row on the floor then a typical 5m wide configuration with 3 tiers would easily fit 40 members.\nWhat about heights?\nGenerally choirs want an even rake – so we suggest from the front row on the floor going to the first tier at 200mm then 400mm, 600mm and maybe even 800mm (4th level) and 1000mm (5th level) if required. Bespoke heights will cost you more so trying to stay within the industry stock standards is better for the pocket.\nDont forget to add the thickness of the deck to the finished height, lots of which are around 30mm thick.\nSo now you have a rectangular tiered configured for your members amount and style. What if you require a curve or arc to the layout?\nYou can obtain wedges, these wedges are specifically designed to be placed in between rectangular decks to create a curve. The more wedges you add the more of a curve is created, balancing the curve means adding an EVEN number of wedges for ODD width metres, and ODD number of wedges for EVEN width metres.\nFor instance if you have 5 x 1m wide tiers, you could add either 2 wedges or 4 wedges to keep the balance.\nLastly consider the back tier safety?\nHandrails would be sensible for 2 or 3 foot high tiers. However if the back tier is against a wall or the members on the back tier are seated then simple chair stop plates should be used. The chair stop and the chairs themselves provide a natural barrier.\nAll decks and risers join together using the locks associated with each individual brand. Modular portable staging is rapid fit, and a stage to house 50 members can be assembled within 15 minutes by a handful of the choir. Its also very light so anyone can help.\nThe tiers are fixed together so they don’t come apart using the riser clamps, at intervals along the run of modules.\nIf you have found this article helpful, leave us a comment.","Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or pleasure in activities. It goes beyond temporary feelings of sadness that everyone experiences from time to time. Depression affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves, and it can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems.\nThe symptoms of depression can vary from person to person, but some common signs include:\nPersistent sadness or emptiness\nLoss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\nChanges in appetite and weight (either significant weight loss or weight gain)\nDifficulty sleeping or sleeping too much\nRestlessness or irritability\nFatigue or loss of energy\nFeelings of worthlessness, guilt, or hopelessness\nDifficulty concentrating or making decisions\nThoughts of death or suicide\nDepression can be caused by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. It is a complex condition, and the exact causes can vary from person to person. Some common risk factors for depression include a family history of the disorder, certain medical conditions, traumatic life events, chronic stress, and certain medications.\nIt is important to note that depression is a treatable condition. Treatment options may include psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy), medication (such as antidepressant medications), or a combination of both. Lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep, can also be beneficial in managing depression.\nMeditation can be a helpful tool in managing and reducing symptoms of depression. Here are some of the benefits that meditation can offer:\nStress reduction: Meditation has been shown to reduce stress levels by activating the body’s relaxation response. This can help alleviate the physical and emotional symptoms of stress that often accompany depression.\nImproved emotional well-being: Regular meditation practice can enhance emotional well-being by increasing positive emotions and reducing negative emotions. It can promote feelings of calmness, inner peace, and contentment, which can be particularly beneficial for individuals struggling with depression.\nIncreased self-awareness: Meditation cultivates a sense of self-awareness, allowing individuals to observe their thoughts and emotions without judgment. This heightened self-awareness can help identify negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to depression, enabling individuals to develop healthier coping mechanisms.\nEnhanced focus and concentration: Depression often affects concentration and cognitive function. Meditation practices, such as mindfulness meditation, can improve focus and concentration by training the mind to stay present and redirect attention to the present moment. This can help counteract the cognitive difficulties associated with depression.\nRegulation of mood: Regular meditation practice has been shown to positively impact mood regulation. It can help individuals develop skills to navigate and regulate their emotions, reducing the intensity and duration of depressive episodes.\nImproved sleep: Depression can disrupt sleep patterns, leading to insomnia or excessive sleep. Meditation techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation or guided imagery, can promote relaxation and better sleep quality, which can indirectly alleviate depressive symptoms.\nIncreased self-compassion: Depression often involves self-critical thoughts and feelings of low self-worth. Meditation practices, such as loving-kindness meditation, can foster self-compassion and self-acceptance. This can counteract the negative self-perception common in depression and promote a more positive relationship with oneself.\nIt’s important to note that while meditation can be a helpful adjunct to treatment for depression, it is not a substitute for professional help. If you’re experiencing symptoms of depression, it’s essential to consult with a mental health professional for a comprehensive evaluation and appropriate treatment plan.\nIn addition to mindfulness meditation, which is commonly associated with depression, there are several other types of meditation that can be beneficial for managing depression. Here are a few examples:\nLoving-Kindness Meditation (Metta): Loving-kindness meditation involves directing positive thoughts, well-wishes, and compassion towards oneself and others. It can help cultivate feelings of love, kindness, and empathy, which can counteract the negative self-perception and social isolation often experienced in depression.\nTranscendental Meditation (TM): TM is a form of meditation that involves the use of a mantra, a specific word or sound, repeated silently to oneself. It aims to quiet the mind and access deeper levels of consciousness. TM has been found to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety and improve overall well-being.\nYoga and Yoga Nidra: Yoga combines physical postures, breath control, and meditation to promote relaxation, flexibility, and mental clarity. It can help alleviate symptoms of depression by reducing stress, improving mood, and enhancing self-awareness. Yoga Nidra, also known as “yogic sleep,” is a guided meditation technique that promotes deep relaxation and can be particularly helpful for individuals with depression-related sleep disturbances.\nBreath-focused Meditation: This type of meditation involves focusing on the breath as a point of concentration. It can help bring the mind to the present moment, reduce rumination on negative thoughts, and induce a state of calmness and relaxation.\nBody Scan Meditation: Body scan meditation involves systematically directing attention to different parts of the body, noticing physical sensations without judgment. It can promote relaxation, body awareness, and release tension, which can be beneficial for individuals with depression-related physical symptoms or somatic complaints.\nWalking Meditation: Walking meditation involves bringing mindfulness and awareness to the experience of walking. It can be done indoors or outdoors and can help promote relaxation, grounding, and a sense of connection with the body and the environment. Walking meditation can be particularly useful for individuals who find it challenging to sit still for traditional meditation practices.\nIt’s important to remember that different types of meditation work for different individuals, and it may be helpful to explore and experiment with different techniques to find what resonates best with you. It is also recommended to learn meditation techniques from qualified instructors or through guided meditation resources such as books, apps, or online programs."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:250d6bbe-dd35-45f0-9bd2-4a359d8076cf>","<urn:uuid:76f248bd-2697-43e4-b96e-77d227b79446>"],"error":null}

{"question":"As a road maintenance engineer, I'm wondering what are the life-extension benefits of non-structural overlays and their environmental impact?","answer":"Non-structural overlays extend pavement life by 7-8 years and have low life-cycle costs. They restore skid resistance and require no curing time, minimizing traffic delays. From an environmental perspective, they contribute to sustainable infrastructure by helping preserve existing roads rather than reconstruction, which is significant considering that the building sector accounts for 30% of global CO2 emissions and 40% of global resource consumption.","context":["While the term preservation may conjure up images of an old mummy or a Twinkie with its rumored indefinite shelf life, roadway preservation looks at how best to preserve the usefulness of the roads, and therefore the dollars invested in roadway infrastructure. In today’s lean economic climate, pavement preservation has an elevated level of focus, and in particular is getting an increased proportion of funding when compared to new construction projects. Pavement preservation programs provide funding for various rehabilitation techniques to help prolong the usability of existing infrastructure. In this edition of the RoadReady newsletter, we will focus on structural and non-structural methods for the rehabilitation of asphalt pavements.\nThe difference between reconstruction and rehabilitation\nReconstruction is the process of creating an entirely new pavement structure – tearing out the roadway and beginning construction from step one. Rehabilitation is the improvement, strengthening, or salvaging of a pavement structure so that it can continue successful service.\nStructural overlays make the layers of asphalt pavement thicker, adding structural support to the pavement. In addition to structural benefits, there are performance increases associated with a structural overlay, such as additional smoothness, better aesthetics, and an extended service life.\nStructural overlays are normally over 1.5 inches in depth, while non-structural overlays are from 0.5 inches to 1.5 inches thick.Structural overlays have been shown to extend pavement life on average by about 12 years according to data taken from multiple DOTs.\nNon-structural overlays can also be called thin asphalt overlays, and are not intended to add structural support. Instead, these overlays improve the wearing course, or top pavement layer, and are thinner than structural overlays, typically between 0.5 to 1.5 inches thick. Non-structural overlays should be placed before extensive rehab is required, for example, when potholes or cracks are small and not very deep, before deep cracking occurs or pieces of asphalt come loose. Choose a non-structural overlay for safety and smoothness improvements, in order to maintain grade and slope, and to seal the surface.\nBenefits of choosing a non-structural overlay include their long service life, extending the life of the pavement by about 7-8 years, and their low overall life-cycle cost. Construct a non-structural overlay as you would any other hot mix asphalt, but consider milling beforehand, to roughen the surface of the existing pavement for better grip between the overlay and existing pavement. Patch minor cracks or potholes to prevent reflection cracking.\nA non-structural asphalt overlay is a good choice for rehabilitation, because there are no loose stones or dust, as in a bituminous surface treatment (see the following section.) There is no curing time, as with Portland cement concrete. The absence of a cure cycle minimizes traffic delay. Non-structural overlays also restore skid resistance to aging pavement.Non-structural overlays can be a challenge, though, because of the short compaction window due to the quick cooling of thin asphalt overlays.Visit our blog to use a nifty web-based tool to calculate the time available for compaction for different job scenarios.\nBituminous surface treatments (BSTs)\nBituminous surface treatments, also called chip seals, seal coats, or BSTs, are a thin protective wearing surface that is applied to a pavement or base course. BSTs can provide all of the following:\n- A waterproof layer to protect the underlying pavement.\n- Increased skid resistance.\n- A filler for existing cracks or raveled surfaces.\n- An anti-glare surface during wet weather and an increased reflective surface for night driving.\nHot in-place recycling\nAnother less frequently used rehab technique is hot in-place recycling. This technique is good for rural roads, but not necessarily practical for urban environments. There are three basic hot in-place recycling construction processes in use, all of which involve a specialized plant in a continuous train operation. Hot in-place recycling is not for heavily damaged roads, but some cracking, potholing, raveling, etc can be repaired by using hot in-place recycling.\nHeater scarification uses a plant that heats the pavement surface, scarifies the pavement surface to rough it up, adds a rejuvenating agent to improve the recycled asphalt binder viscosity, then mixes and levels the recycled mix. The recycled asphalt pavement is then compacted using conventional compaction equipment. This method is limited to pavement that is not severely rutted.\nRepaving removes the top 1 to 2 inches of the existing HMA pavement, adds a rejuvenating agent to improve the recycled asphalt binder viscosity, places the recycled material as a leveling course using a primary screed, and simultaneously places a thin HMA overlay. Conventional equipment and procedures are used immediately behind the train to compact both layers of material.\nRemixing is similar to repaving but adds new virgin aggregate or new HMA to the recycled material before it is leveled.\nCold in-place recycling\nCold in-place recycling is meant for moderate to low volume roadways in good structural condition, but with minor distress such as shallow potholes, weathering, and bleeding. First, the pavement is milled 2 to 4 inches, then the cold milled material is mixed with an emulsified recycling agent, spread and compacted, and finally the recycled surface is overlaid with a new layer of hot mix asphalt.\nRehab versus rebuild\nIn financially challenging times, the name of the game goes from building shiny new roads to ensuring the roads we have continue to serve the public well. Within pavement rehab, decision makers are utilizing rehab options like the ones we’ve discussed to add service life to our infrastructure while stretching the dollars in the budget. In doing so, if our roads outlast our Twinkies, we know we’re on the right track.","Green building method, sometimes known as sustainable building or even green building, is an approach to building and architecture that favors environmentally sound and resource-efficient methods that last through a building’s lifecycle.\nBenefits of green building: 30-50 % water saving, 20-30 % energy saving, conserves natural scarce resources and generates less waste, enhanced air quality and excellent day-lighting and provides healthier space for occupants.\nThe building sector has the greatest potential to reduce CO2 emissions. Currently, 30% of global CO2 emissions and 40% of global resource consumption is a result of constructing buildings.\nOur main goal is to optimise the environmental performance of a building using a life cycle approach, in which the materials and products used in a building are compared and evaluated for best performance at the building level (life cycle assessment).\nOur expertise spans all phases of a project from conceptual design through construction to project hand-over; in addition to continuous operation and maintenance.\nThe built environment has a vast impact on the natural environment, human health, and the economy. By adopting green building strategies, we can maximize both economic and environmental performance. Green construction methods can be integrated into buildings at any stage, from design and construction, to renovation and deconstruction. However, the most significant benefits can be obtained if the design and construction team takes an integrated approach from the earliest stages of a building project.\nGreen infrastructure can be broadly defined as a strategically planned network of high quality natural and semi-natural areas with other environmental features, which is designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services and protect biodiversity in both rural and urban settings.\nGreen infrastructure is effective, economical, and enhances community safety and quality of life.\nMore specifically green infrastructure, being a spatial structure providing benefits from nature to people, aims to enhance nature’s ability to deliver multiple valuable ecosystem goods and services, such as clean air or water.\nExperience has shown that investing in green infrastructure can contribute to the recovery of Europe’s economy by fostering innovative approaches and creating new green businesses. Green jobs already represent around 5% of the job market.\nGreen infrastructure and sustainability goals are our specialty, and achieving these goals requires technical knowledge and training in varied fields.\nPotential benefits of green infrastructure can include:\n- Provision of clean water\n- Removal of pollutants from air and water\n- Improved air and water quality\n- Protection against soil erosion\n- Improvement of land quality\n- Enhanced and protected biodiversity and ecosystems\n- Reducing waste streams\n- Conserved and restored natural resources\n- Creation of jobs\n- More energy solutions\n- greener cities\n- Better health and human well-being\n- Diversification of local economy\n- Minimized strain on local infrastructure\n- Improved overall quality of life\nClimate change adaptation and mitigation benefits\n- Disaster prevention\n- Flood alleviation\n- Strengthening ecosystems resilience\n- Ecological corridors\n- Landscape permeability\n- Improved habitats for wildlife\n- Reduced operating costs\n- Improved occupant productivity\n- Optimized life-cycle economic performance"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a27f3725-b946-4e41-855a-ddfc85885408>","<urn:uuid:888f4a5f-235e-46c4-907a-3e8da92ff1d6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which project received more public attention: the Newark shipping container housing competition or the Fab Lab House in Barcelona?","answer":"The Fab Lab House in Barcelona received more public attention, with over 20,000 visitors during its exhibition at the Solar Decathlon Europe Contest. In comparison, while the Newark shipping container housing competition drew international participation from 13 countries, the specific public attendance or visibility wasn't mentioned, and the project remained theoretical without advancing beyond the design stage.","context":["THE idea came to Christopher Stone as he was looking out the window of his office near Newark Liberty International Airport one day, and his eye fell on shipping containers. Lots of huge, empty industrial containers stacked high, row after row.\n“It seemed like they were just waiting there for some new purpose,” said Mr. Stone, an architect. He thought, “Why not create something with them that would benefit people?” And, “how about housing for the poor?”\nBut when he got a group together from the local chapter of the American Institute of Architects to talk it over, they quickly came to the conclusion that this would be presumptuous.\n“So often, those with limited means feel they are being sequestered and forced into something substandard,” Mr. Stone said. “Why would they want to live in shipping containers if no one else does?” And then it occurred to the architects: “We should figure out how to create housing so cool that everybody would want to live in it.”\nWhat followed was more than a year of intellectual ferment, during which the group roped in various Newark officials as well as the architecture school at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. The result was “Live the Box: An International Design Competition.”\nToni L. Griffin, the director of community development for Newark, came up with a site in downtown Newark for those who submitted design proposals: the big empty lot opposite the Broad Street train station where the Westinghouse Electric Company building stood until it was demolished last year.\nA construction company, Skanska USA Building, became a sponsor and put up prize money; the National Portable Storage Association, whose members manufacture containers, followed suit, and other companies made smaller donations.\n(Despite the competition, however, the plan to build on the site has not yet advanced beyond the theoretical stages.)\nKim de Freitas, an instructor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, coordinated the contest, which was run entirely online, for three months last summer, drawing 150 entries from architects around the world.\n“We were incredibly surprised,” she said. “First, we started to hear from students in California, so we knew we’d reached across the country. Then, some people from Italy asked, ‘Can we join?’ Then, people from Pakistan, Turkey, South Korea 13 countries in all.”\nMr. Stone learned that some of the architects had already thought about using prefabricated containers as housing “modules” before the idea ever popped into his head.\nIn 2004, for instance, the New Jersey architect Adam Kalkin created his own “Quik House” design using five shipping containers as a base. The next year, a European contest, “Living Box,” was held on a similar theme.\nBut “Live the Box” posed a new and more extensive challenge: creation of an urban multifamily mixed-use project, using the containers as building blocks.\nArchitects were encouraged to study the neighborhoods around the Newark site, and to reflect planners’ desire for open walkways and green space.\n“People really put their hearts into it,” said Ms. de Freitas, who supervised a jury kept “blind” to the identities of entrants.\nIn December, when the awards ceremony was held, the winners were Felix Heidgen and Thomas Nagy, architects working for RMJM in Princeton, N.J. They shared a $10,000 prize for their design of “NewPark Station,” a complex of nine buildings connected by bridges and pathways.\nThe stacked containers in their entry are elevated on pillars so that the ground level becomes “a stage for social and commercial interaction for the residents and the city at large,” said Mr. Heidgen, who explained that he had once worked in Newark and sees it as a multifaceted community. Mr. Nagy, who was born in Japan and researched Newark before embarking on the container project, said he envisioned the open plaza as an urban park.\nThe individual units in their entry vary widely in size (one container makes a small studio; four of them are used to create a 1,200-square-foot apartment), but large and small units are scattered throughout the complex.\nCirculation would be improved with a system of air pockets between units, the architects said. They did not formulate a solution to “building block degradation,” or rust. “You could leave the containers as they are,” Mr. Heidgen said, “and live with the patina; that could be quite interesting.

Also, it incorporates state-of-the-art machinery which can build tools and everyday objects by using the very same parametrical designs used in the general design of the space.\nThe house has been designed by architects of over twenty different countries and developed by the Institute of Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC), The Center for Bits and Atoms of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the world network of Fab Labs, along with an important group of private firms. According to Vicente Guallart, Director of the IAAC, “the form of the house responds to its energy production potential.\nWhile in the 20th century form followed function, in the 21st century, form will follow energy. Buildings must be like trees, which are self sufficient, and must follow natural principles. Rather than built, the project was manufactured, as digital manufacturing machine tools (known as 3D printers) were used in the construction process. This process partakes on the humanistic idea, advocated by Guallart, that things must be again produced in cities. Says Guallart “We produced our solar house with researchers, in accordance with medieval principles: the designer and the builder are the same person.”\nThe Fab Lab House is not only a piece of social and technical engineering but also a design in full coherence to its immediate environment. The design is conceived to create a flexible structure which adapts to the climate of its location and is both visually and environmentally respectful towards its surroundings. It makes the most out of solar rays and natural drafts, and cuts therefore with the need for artificial heating or AC.\nA prototype of the Fab Lab House was exhibited recently at the Solar Decathlon Europe Contest held in Madrid last month, and over 20.000 people visited it. The house was awarded the Public’s Choice Award at said contest, which showcases cutting edge sustainable architecture. The house is currently on the market, and its prize starts at 45.000 € for the smallest version.\nLocation: near Barcelona, Spain\nThe FabLab house was first exhibited at SOLAR DECATHLON EUROPE, an international competition for universities from all over the world; geared towards advancing knowledge on industrialized and sustainable homes, with a particular emphasis on high efficiency and energy self-sufficiency. The first Solar Decathlon Europe Competition, which took place in Madrid in June 2010, was based upon the US Solar Decathlon and consisted of the assembly and exhibition of 17 houses designed and built by the different participating universities from around the world. The FabLab House was visited by over 20.000 visitors during the Decathlon and was awarded the People’s Choice Prize.\nPhotographer: Adrià Goula\nSolar house images / information from Institute of Advanced Architecture of Catalonia\nFurther information at:\nInstitute of Advanced Architecture: www.iaac.net\nFab Lab House: www.fablabhouse.com\nLocation: Barcelona, Catalunya, Spain, western Europe\nArchitecture in Barcelona\nContemporary Architecture in Barcelona\nimage from architect\nCasa 205, Vacarisses, Catalunya\nDesign: H ARQUITECTES\nphoto : Starp Estudi\nArchitecture Walking Tours – city walks\nComments / photos for the Fab Lab House Barcelona – Solar Energy Home Spain page welcome"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:003efc74-915e-425d-8573-134cf4edbca7>","<urn:uuid:7dadf025-c526-4caa-8a55-14eaa4275564>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the principal methods for water treatment in homes, and what signs indicate a water heating system needs replacement?","answer":"The main water treatment methods are boiling (which kills bacteria but doesn't remove chemicals), filtration (which removes harmful substances and odors through processes like reverse osmosis), and purification (which uses multiple treatments to remove toxins, metals and chemicals). Regarding water heater replacement signs, key indicators include: age over 10 years, rusty or reddish-brown water coming from the heater, gurgling sounds inside the tank (indicating sediment buildup), leaking from the bottom of the tank, and complete loss of hot water production. These issues often signal that replacement is needed rather than repair, especially if the tank is leaking internally.","context":["The human body loses water daily through breathing, sweating, urinating, and bowel motions. About 50% to 70% of an adult human’s body weight is water, the body’s principal chemical constituent. That being stated, water is essential for the survival and health of the human body. One can also refill their body’s water supply by ingesting liquids and meals containing water to function correctly; however, it is best to consume plain water.\nAs the water supply comes from different sources in Malaysia, it is essential that the water we are drinking is clean and does not contain any impurities. There are different types of water, such as boiled water, filtered water and purified water. This article will discuss these types of water and their advantages and disadvantages.\nWater heated to the boiling point of 212 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 degrees Celsius is considered boiled water. Boiled water is water that has undergone the process of boiling, as is a traditional way of removing impurities from water. The boiling process occurs by placing a heat source beneath a container filled with water and letting it rest on the heat source until it bubbles.\nThe boiled water is then left to cool before individuals can consume it. Water that has been boiled is free from harmful bacteria and viruses that can cause harm to our health; however, boiling does not remove chemical pollutants such as metals, chlorine, salts, and even pesticides.\nAdvantages & Disadvantages of boiling tap water\n|Simple to do as it does not require intricate equipments||Time-consuming as boiling takes several minutes before it is fully boiled.|\n|Kills harmful bacteria and viruses in the water||Does not remove chemical pollutants such as chlorine, pesticides and metals|\n|Retains essential minerals that are found in tap water||Quantity of water may be reduced as some of the water that is boiled may become vapour|\nFiltered water is water that goes through filtration using water treatment technologies. Filtered water can effectively remove harmful substances and impurities from the water while also removing the odour of tap water so that it is easier to consume.\nFiltered water can undergo different filtration processes, such as reverse osmosis, activated carbon, ion exchange, distillation and other methods. Even though filtered water does go through its own filtration process, it may not be suitable for drinking as the filters cannot fully remove all the impurities that are in the water, which can cause infections in our bodies.\nAdvantages & Disadvantages of Filtered water\n|Convenient to use as the filtered water is available on tap to use whenever you need it for cooking or drinking||Needs to be stored in the refrigerator to avoid recontamination|\n|Removes harmful substances such as bacteria, viruses, chlorine, heavy metals, salts and fluoride||Filters need to be maintained and replaced frequently and depending on usage|\n|Environmentally friendly as it reduces plastic waste||Filtration process can only work properly if there is pressure in the water|\nPurified water involves several chemical treatments and mechanical filtrations to produce clean and drinkable water that is safe to consume for all. Purified water does not contain any toxic substances such as soil particles, heavy metals, mineral residues, and chemicals due to the water’s purification process, such as coagulation, sedimentation, filtration, and distillation.\nA water purifier can efficiently purify the water due to filters such as a nano-positive membrane, sediment filter, and activated carbon filter that effectively remove large impurities, unwanted chemicals, and viruses from the water.\nAdvantages & Disadvantages of Purified Water\n|Eliminates all forms of physical, bacterial and chemical contaminants such as large particles, rust, heavy metals, bacteria, viruses and chlorine||Regular maintenance and replacement of filters are needed to remove all the harmful metals and organisms that get stuck on the filter|\n|The quantity of water does not change when it undergoes purification process||May not be able to remove some forms of organic wastes and pesticides|\n|Easy to access the water for the convenience of drinking, making drinks, cooking, and more.||Increases energy consumption due to the processes that occur.|\nSummary (Best Way)\nAs there are different ways to consume clean water in Malaysia, it is also essential to consider how much water you drink daily. Studies have shown that eight glasses of water may not be enough for an individual. The daily water intake is highly dependent on the individual and their lifestyle. Whether it is boiled water, filtered water, or purified water, it is crucial to have a healthy water supply.\nThe best way to make sure you are drinking a clean supply of water is to test your drinking water and look out for signs of contamination. In a nutshell, the best water to consume without compromising your health and well-being is purified water. Purified water removes impurities and chemical compounds that are unhealthy for the body, plus it is easier to access clean water using a water purifier.","Whether you are buying a house or your water heater is not producing hot water, water heater replacement may be on the horizon. Often, homeowners are not prepared for water heater replacement. When a water heater quits, it can become a shock to us and our wallet.\nPart of preparing and budget for a water heater replacement is knowing how long a water heater will last.\nAn electric tank water heater lasts 10 to 15 years. A gas tank water heater lasts 8 to 12 years. With routine maintenance, tank water heaters can last 20 years or more. Tank water heater repairs cost $200 to $300 while replacement costs $1500 to $2000. Tankless water heaters can last 15 to 20 years. With more functional parts that can fail, tankless water heater repair costs about $575, and replacement costs $1500 to $3000.\nDo you need a Licensed Plumber? We can help!\nGet a free estimate from top-rated, screened, and licensed plumbers in your area!\nA well-maintained gas or electric water heater can last 20 years or more. Water heater maintenance includes annual water heater flushing maintenance and replacing the anode rod every 2-3 years to protect the inner tank lining.\nIn this article, we will focus on tank-style water heaters. You can get details on how long a tankless water heater lasts here. Many factors go into determining how long a water heater will last. The number one factor in extending the life of a water heater is proper maintenance. Even inexpensive water heaters can outlast more expensive models provided it’s properly maintained.\nHowever, if the water heater is not maintained well, you can expect the lifespan to be shorter, and you could risk sudden failure or damage to your house.\nMost inexpensive water heaters come with a 6-year manufacturer warranty. However, some better quality models can have manufacturer warranties of 10 to 12 years. In contrast, a few high-end models offer lifetime warranties on the water heater.\nWater heaters with a fiberglass tank tend to last considerably longer than water heaters with steel tanks. Regardless of type, it is essential to remember that all tanks eventually fail no matter how well it’s maintained.\nCost to Repair a Tank Water Heater\nIf caught in time, most water heater repairs are relatively inexpensive and easy to do. However, this may not always be the best option. Here are some things that you should consider:\nYou should consider the repair cost and whether you can do that repair yourself or if you need to hire a licensed plumber. A plumber will cost about $50 to $150 per hour and often carries a minimum trip charge. If the water heater is experiencing a higher maintenance level, a replacement water heater will be your best option.\nThere’s no point in throwing good money after bad. If your repair cost will be 50% the cost of a new water heater and will only provide a small amount of remaining life expectancy, then replacement would be your best option.\n|Water Heater Repair||Part Cost||Repair with Labor|\n|Thermocouple||$20||$70 to $170 (1 hour)|\n|Gas Control Thermostat||$80||$130 to $210 (1 hour)|\n|Heating Elements||$40||$210 to $360 (2 hours)|\n|Electric Thermostat||$20||Included in Heating Element Replacement|\n|Leaking||Varies||Up to $1000|\nCost to Replace a Tank Water Heater\nNow that you’ve determined it’s time to replace your water heater, there are some things you need to consider:\n- Will you be replacing the water heater with a similarly sized unit? When you decided that it’s time to replace your water heater, it may be an excellent time to make an upgrade or to switch to a tankless system. If your house is damaged by a leak or needs to move the water heater, replacement is recommended.\n- Do you need a larger tank to meet your family’s needs? If your family has grown since you installed the water heater last time, a larger water heater may be desired. However, there are limitations to size when choosing tank water heaters, depending on where you live.\n- Will you install the water heater yourself or hire a licensed plumber? It is always recommended that you hire a licensed plumber to install a new water heater. Licensed plumbers in your area will know local building codes that you may not be aware of. However, depending on your skill level, you can install a new water heater yourself.\nNew Water Heater Tank and Installation Costs\nAccording to HomeDepot.com, the average cost of a new water heater installation is approximately $1,308. Nationwide costs typically range from $952 to $2,098. This replacement estimate includes the following components:\n- Traditional tank water heater – typical water heater size is 40 or 50 gallons.\n- Permits to install new water (some locations do not require this).\n- Installation materials such as fittings, shut-off valves, piping, etc.\n- Installation labor by a local, licensed, and insured plumber.\n- Removal of the old unit following local laws.\nIf you choose to purchase and install a water heater yourself, you can expect to pay between $350 to $2000 depending on the size and type of water heater you decide to purchase.\n|Water Heater Type/Size||Average Cost||Installed|\n|Electric, 40 Gallon||$400 – $450||$600 – $1050|\n|Electric, 50 Gallon||$450 – $1000||$650 – $1600|\n|Electric Hybrid, 50 Gallon||$1000 – $1500||$1200 – $2100|\n|Electric Hybrid, 80 Gallon||$1500 – $2250||$1700 – $2850|\n|Gas, 40 Gallon||$460 – $550||$660 – $1150|\n|Gas, 50 Gallon||$560 – $1200||$760 – $1800|\n|Gas, 75+ Gallon||$1400 – $1900||$1600 – $2500|\nBe Aware of Hidden Installation Costs\nWe touched on building codes and number three in the previous section. When you replace a water heater, you will be required to meet all current building codes.\nThere may be costs greater than just the water heater itself. Some of the hidden costs you may see when installing a new water heater include:\n- Expansion tanks – expansion tanks are used to help control pressure inside and water heater.\n- Seismic strapping – depending on where you live, you may need seismic strapping if you live in an area prone to earthquakes.\n- Drain pans – drain pans are placed under the water heater to catch leaks and discharge water to the exterior to protect the structure of your home.\n- Plumbing pipe upgrades – Depending on the type of plumbing supply pipes you have in your house, you may need upgrades. For example, if your home has polybutylene piping, you will likely need to replace all accessible piping during installation.\nWhy Hot Water Heaters Fail\nA water heater may seem to fail out of nowhere, but that’s not the case. Water heaters fail over time. It is recommended you drain and flush your water heater annually. It would be best to replace the anode rod every 2-3 years. This sacrificial rod protects the interior tank lining.\nYou can often predict water heater failure if you are aware of the signs. There are two main reasons why tank water heaters fail:\nToo much pressure inside the tank\nAs the water heats up, it expands, creating pressure inside the tank. If the water inside the tank heats up to the point that it exceeds the tank’s pressure specification, it could explode. One of the ways to avoid this is keeping your hot water temperature setting under 140°F.\nModern water heaters are equipped with a temperature and pressure relief valve (T&P valve). The temperature and pressure relief valve open when the pressure inside the tank reaches the tank’s temperature threshold. This valve expels hot water through a discharge pipe to relieve the pressure inside the tank.\nAnother safety feature that you can add is an expansion tank. Expansion tanks help control pressure inside the water heater tank by providing a place for hot water to expand. In a 50 gallon tank, hot water expands to 52 gallons. A 2-gallon expansion tank can store the expanded water.\nOne of the problems with old water heaters is that they lack a T&P valve and an expansion tank to help control the water heater’s pressure. With nowhere to expand, the pressure inside the tank can cause the water heater to explode, turning many old water heaters into a ticking time bomb.\nFlush Sediment Buildup Inside the Water Heater\nThe second leading cause of water heater failure is sediment buildup inside the tank. Chemicals and contaminants found in the water supply cause corrosion inside the tank, eventually rusting the tank, causing it to leak.\nExplosions occur when a flaw develops inside the tank. The tank’s pressure builds and forces water through these weak areas.\nAs part of your annual maintenance on your water heater, you should drain and flush out any sediment inside the tank. Tank water heaters have a drain valve at the base of the tank to do this. Here’s a quick rundown of how you can drain and flush your water heater.\n- Turn off the water supply before working on the water heater.\n- Turn off power or gas to the water heater before starting work.\n- Attach the hose to the drain valve and run it to the exterior to drain freely and safely. Remember the water will be hot.\n- Open hot water tap at a nearby sink.\n- Open the drain valve on the water heater to begin draining.\n- Once the water heater has drained, turn the water supply back on the flush the tank.\n- Close the drain valve once the water heater has been flushed and water running from the hose is clear.\n- Allow the water heater tank to refill.\n- Turn the power or gas back on to the water heater back. If you have a gas water heater, you’ll likely need to light the pilot.\nFor a more detailed step by step guide see, Water Heater Maintenance Tips to 2X Your Tanks Lifespan.\nReplace Your Anode Rod\nWater heaters with glass liners are equipped with an anode rod that attracts contaminants in water. Over time the contaminants will eat away at the anode rod protecting the tank’s liner. Once the anode rod has deteriorated, contaminants begin attacking the liner, weakening the water heater. You can expect anode rods to last 3-5 years, depending on the water quality and the type of anode rod installed.\nAnode rods are made from magnesium, aluminum, or aluminum/zinc alloy. Replacement anode rods can be purchased at local home improvement stores and are relatively easy to install.\nIt would help if you replaced your anode rod every 3 to 5 years. You can do this during your annual flushing maintenance of the water heater. You may want to replace a low-quality anode rod with a better quality one that will last longer.\nFor a more detailed step by step guide see, Water Heater Anode Rods: What it is & How to Replace it\nSigns You Need to Replace Your Water Heater\nAge of the Water Heater\nAge is a significant factor in your water heater’s performance. If your water heater is over ten years old, you should expect to have higher maintenance costs or to replace it in the near future.\nIf you’ve properly maintained your water heater, you may get up to 12 to15 years of life from a gas water heater and 10 to 15 years from electric water heaters. Beyond that, replacement is recommended mainly due to tank condition, rapid advances in safety, and improvements in energy efficiency.\nEnergy efficiency is crucial when it comes to gas water heaters. Energy consumption is higher in older water heaters versus newer models, which will pay for itself over time.\nRusty Water From Water Heater\nIf you see rusty or reddish-brown water from your water heater, that’s an indication that rust is mixing with water inside your tank. It’s a clear indication that your water heater needs replacement.\nIf the water heater is not leaking, you may be able to buy some time by performing a drain and flush maintenance on the water heater to remove loose sediment and change your anode rod. However, depending on the condition of the tank’s interior, this service may not be sufficient.\nUltimately, if the tank is damaged or starting to leak, there is no other option but replacement.\nGurgling Sounds Inside Your Water Heater\nAs your water heater gets older, sediment begins to build up at the bottom of the tank. When the sediment is heated and reheated over time, it begins to harden.\nBanging, crackling or gurgling sounds from inside your water heater indicates a sediment buildup inside the tank. It is recommended that you try to flush and drain your water heater. Depending on the amount of sediment build-up inside the water heater, the drain valve may be clogged or blocked, preventing it from draining water properly. One option would be to try replacing the drain valve to clear sediment from the water heater.\nIf all attempts to drain and remove the sediment fails, then replacement is the best option. In this case, the water heater’s replacement is recommended before a catastrophic leak occurs, which could cost thousands of dollars of damage to your house.\nLeaking from the Bottom of a Water Heater Tank\nIf your water heater is leaking, that is a good indication that there is something wrong. See our How to Repair a Leaking Water Heater – Complete Step by Step Guide for steps to repair a leaking water heater. You need to contact a licensed plumber to have them examine your water heater for repair or replacement.\nSome leaks can be repaired while others can’t. Leaks located around the top of the water heater, such as around the supply pipe fittings or the T&P valve, are likely repairable. However, this is not always the case and still an indication that something is going wrong internally that needs to be addressed.\nIf you’ve noticed water on the floor around your water heater, then you could have a severe problem. You can’t repair internal leaks in tanks. If water is leaking from the bottom of your tank, you should plan on an immediate replacement and call a licensed plumber.\nThe Water Heater Stops Producing Hot Water\nHot water is a daily luxury we’ve all become accustomed to. No hot water can be an inconvenience. If the electric water heater has no hot water, many things could be the cause. One is there is likely a bad heating element or a bad electric thermostat.\nAnother possibility is a broken drip tube. The drip tube is a plastic pipe that runs from the cold water inlet to the tank’s bottom. If this pipe is broken, cold water and hot water mix resulting in lukewarm water from the tank.\nThese items do commonly fail over time and can be repaired by a licensed plumber. These items are relatively easy to replace for the handy do-it-yourself person."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f3992a6b-5cb3-4282-aa06-0fa67ff0d039>","<urn:uuid:6bd65563-e38d-437b-9468-f0cdda09b846>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a desert plant enthusiast, I'm curious: do desert cacti and desert beetles use similar mechanisms to collect water from their environment?","answer":"Yes, both desert cacti and desert beetles have evolved mechanisms to collect water from their environment, though they use different specific approaches. Desert beetles have convex bumps on their shells with a special hybrid chemistry (hydrophilic tops with hydrophobic surroundings) that help attract water. Cacti, on the other hand, use V-shaped spines to direct water droplets towards their body and have shallow, spread-out roots that quickly absorb any available moisture. The spines also serve to congregate moisture from the air, allowing it to drip to the ground for absorption.","context":["There are many organisms lives in such harsh environments where normal organisms can’s survive. Nature has given them their own strength and technique to live in such arid environments. Now, a few of such organisms have inspired scientists to create something extraordinary. Researchers from Harvard University have invented a new material that could pull water droplets out of thin air.\nScientists have created the new material inspired by the mechanisms of desert beetle’s bumps on its shell, slippery surfaces of pitcher plants and V-shaped cactus spines which directs the water droplets towards its body. The invention is said to be a breakthrough in the war against growing water crisis around the world.\nThe material to promote and transport condensed water droplets is developed by a team of researchers from the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University and the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS).\nJoanna Aizenberg, the Amy Smith Berylson Professor of Materials Science at SEAS and core faculty member of the Wyss Institute, said in a statement:\n“Everybody is excited about bioinspired materials research. However, so far, we tend to mimic one inspirational natural system at a time. Our research shows that a complex bio-inspired approach, in which we marry multiple biological species to come up with non-trivial designs for highly efficient materials with unprecedented properties, is a new, promising direction in biomimetics.”\nThe new material uses the mechanism of the natural systems of cacti, desert beetle and pitcher plants to pull the water from the environment and guide the flow of condensed water droplets to collect it. Scientists have also used Slippery Liquid-Infused Porous Surfaces technology (SLIPS) developed in Aizenberg’s lab, in developing the material\nPhilseok Kim, co-author of the paper and co-founder and vice president of technology at SEAS spin-off SLIPS Technologies, Inc., said in a statement:\n“Thermal power plants, for example, rely on condensers to quickly convert steam to liquid water. This design could help speed up that process and even allow for operation at a higher temperature, significantly improving the overall energy efficiency.”\nThe major challenges in harvesting atmospheric water are controlling the size of the droplets, the speed in which they form and the direction in which they flow.\nFor years, researchers focused on the hybrid chemistry of the beetle’s bumps — a hydrophilic top with hydrophobic surroundings — to explain how the beetle attracted water. However, Aizenberg and her team took inspiration from a different possibility – that convex bumps themselves also might be able to harvest water.\n“We experimentally found that the geometry of bumps alone could facilitate condensation,” said Kyoo-Chul Park, a postdoctoral researcher and the first author of the paper. “By optimizing that bump shape through detailed theoretical modeling and combining it with the asymmetry of cactus spines and the nearly friction-free coatings of pitcher plants, we were able to design a material that can collect and transport a greater volume of water in a short time compared to other surfaces.”\n“Without one of those parameters, the whole system would not work synergistically to promote both the growth and accelerated directional transport of even small, fast condensing droplets,” said Park.\n“This research is an exciting first step towards developing a passive system that can efficiently collect water and guide it to a reservoir,” said Kim.","It's hard to love a plant that's poised for attack. But hold the disparaging remarks about cactus, please. Thrust into harsh environments and graced with some of the world's most beautiful flowers, cacti did what they could to survive. Beneath the spiny, prickly, thorny, bristly and hurtful exterior, on some, spines so thick they looks more like an inverse pincushion, lies the heart of succulence. Cacti are loved world wide and are among the most collected of plants. It is rare to find a plant person without a potted cactus on their windowsill at least part of their life.\nCacti are natives to the Americas, believed to have originated in South America with the majority of the species inhabiting regions north and south of the hot zone, the moist, humid tropics surrounding the equator. A few forest-type cacti inhabit Central America. It is thought that cacti found outside of the Americas have been introduced by birds, wind or collectors over the centuries. However, one genus, Rhipsalis, has been found growing naturally outside the Americas in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape of South Africa.\nCactaceae, the cactus family, includes anywhere from 1500 to 1800 species in about 100 to 122 genera, depending on one's source of information. They are extremely diverse in size and appearance, from the tiny button cactus, Epithelantha bokei, found in the Big Bend region to the giant saguaro, Carnegiea gigantea, the indicator plant of the Sonoran Desert. Cacti are home in the America's arid and semi arid areas that have three climatic seasons: the hot and humid season at the beginning of the year, usually February to June, when the cacti grow. The dry and hot season, July to September, when they flower and bear fruit. And the season of rest, corresponding to our fall and winter. During the period of rest, the weather turns cold, even below freezing. They've adapted to these conditions by drying out and shriveling during the dry hot season. Our cultivation of cacti should replicate these conditions for best results.\nIn North America, Mexico contains the largest number of cacti taxa: 563 species and 48 genera, approximately twice the number of taxa as in the United States. Arizona boasts the highest number of the states with 170 taxa (70 species and 60 varieties) and Texas with 136 taxa comprised of 95 species and 41 varieties. Most of our Texas cacti are native to the Trans-Pecos region of the Chihuahuan Desert. As research and exploration continue, these numbers will change.\nIn fact, it is difficult to be absolute when defining and describing cactus as more and more studies are published. For instance, “cacti do not have leaves” – not true, several genus of cacti do have leaves, particularly in the tropical regions. “All cactus are rooted to the ground” – untrue, as there are forest cerei and epiphetic cacti that attach themselves on rocks and trees by their roots, but are not parasitic, they do not obtain food directly from the plant. “All cacti have spines”, again not true, there are spineless cacti, however all cacti have areoles.\nMy favorite misconception, “cacti do not need water since they grow in deserts” is most certainly false. Although found primarily in arid and semi-arid regions, perhaps it is the lack of competition from more water-thirsty plants that left this land free for them to evolve and survive. Cacti are designed to absorb and store water quickly and for long periods of time. Spines congregate moisture from the air for it to drip to the ground to be absorbed by long spread-out, shallow roots, capturing all available drops.\nOne more misconception, “the plural of cactus is cacti.” Yes and no. It is acceptable to use cactus, cacti and cactuses when referring to the plural. Even the above statement about replicating the cactus growing conditions for best results is not totally true! Studies have shown home grown cactus from seeds in other climates, Europe, for instance, where there is great interest in all plants not European, thrived well in rich soil with ample water and humidity.\nNot all succulents are cacti, but all cacti are succulents -- again, not true. There are a few genera within the cactus family that store so little water they are not considered succulent. The succulent stem, either globose or columnar are built for water storage and minimum evaporation, ribbed or tuberculate (with round nodule or small eminence, as in Mammillaria, and our Panhandle native, Coryphantha missouriensis, the nipple cactus). The ribs and tubercles expand and contract with water availability. The more pronounced the grooves and tubercles, the less water the stem is holding. Likewise, the ribs are well rounded with ample moisture.\nSpines, always emerging from areoles (photo right), are modified leaves, providing protection from herbivores. Spines also provide shading from the sun and deflection of wind to reduce evaporation even further. Spines vary greatly in color, size and shape. Spines sometimes appear as woolly hair, offering the added protection against nighttime cold, or in combination with spines found in mostly columnar-shaped cacti found in high altitudes from Peru to Bolivia and Argentina, the Oreocereus genus.\nIf the shape and form doesn't attract, it is certainly their flowers. Cactus have the most beautiful flowers in the world. In some plants, the flowers are even bigger than the plant itself. Cacti flower every year, after reaching maturity, some species several times a year, including the Thelocactus bicolor, var. bicolor, the Glory of Texas native to Presidio, Brewster and Starr counties near Big Bend National Park. One enthusiastic reference mentioned the similarity of the cholla cactus to early roses in appeal – both have thorny canes and a single period of flowering. Driving a stretch of I-40 between Amarillo and Santa Fe one June, I noticed acres of cane cholla, Opuntia imbricata, in full rose-pink bloom – quite a sight.\nGrowing cactus is similar to growing agave, lean gritty mineralized soil with good drainage and 6 to 8 hours of sunlight for the best blooms. Afternoon shade benefits most plants, but is not required. Cacti prefer acidic water to our alkaline city water, rain water is the best. De-chlorinate a 5 gallon pail of city water by letting it sit in the sun for a day or two, adding one tablespoon of white vinegar or citrus acid to lower the pH if rainwater is not available. Spare the water in fall and winter for better survival or mound the plant to increase soil drainage.\nThe large saguaro and organpipe cactus (pictured above right) are not cold hardy in the Texas Panhandle. The largest cacti that are cold hardy this far north are some of the opuntias, prickly pear cacti, the cylindropuntias, tree chollas, and Echinocereus triglochidiatus, claret cup cactus. Sone of the most colorful are the rainbow cactus, both because of their flowers and their succulent stem or column. Unfortunately, our area is too cold for the large barrel cactus. However, two Echinocactus, E. texensis, the horse crippler, and E. horizonthalonius, the Texas blue barrel cactus (pictured at the right) will winter over, but are not true barrel cactus. Ferocactus hamatacanthus var hamatacanthus, a true barrel cactus and native to the Big Bend region is said to inhabit elevations up to 6000 and sometimes 7500 ft. That could qualify survival in the Texas Panhandle, depending on the individual specimen's providence and soil drainage (quite sharp, I'd image).\nBelow is a list of cacti I believe are reliably cold hardy for Amarillo, or down to zero degrees F. Many of these will survive colder temperatures. Populations of Opuntia fragilis grow natively in several locations in Wisconsin on rock outcrops and sandy soils. I am sure this is not a complete list of cold hardy cacti for the Texas Panhandle.\nCoryphantha echinus, sea urchin cactus, tiny orange flowers, native to the Chiso Mountains in SW Texas.

{"question":"I'm researching early American river transportation - how did river navigation methods differ between the Pearl River and other major US waterways in the pre-Civil War era?","answer":"Both the Pearl River and other major US waterways used similar transportation methods in the pre-Civil War era, but with some key differences. The Pearl River primarily relied on keel boats and steamers, with notable vessels like Harvey Gill's keel boat making monthly trips from Carthage to New Orleans at speeds of four miles downstream and two miles upstream. In contrast, other US waterways had more diverse vessel types - bark canoes, bull-boats, and pirogues used by Native Americans, as well as sailing craft on eastern rivers like the Hudson, Delaware, and Potomac. While the Pearl River saw limited steamer activity with vessels like the Choctaw and Alice Maria, other major waterways experienced more extensive steamboat development, with over 1,000 steamboats operating on the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio Rivers by 1840. One similarity was the use of flatboats, which were common across American rivers for one-way downstream transportation of goods and people.","context":["The Pearl River has its beginning in the historic area of the Nanih Waiya Indian Mounds of Winston County. There, legend has it, is where the Great Spirit told the Choctaw Indians to make their home. The river then flows southward through central Mississippi bringing with it the vast potential of an abundant water supply. Continuing through Jackson, the Pearl flows through Georgetown, Monticello, Columbia and on past NASA Test Facilities before it empties into the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe Pearl was discovered by Beinville, a French explorer. He named the river Perle (later changed to Pearl) when he supposedly found an abundance of pearls on the banks of the river. These pearls were from oyster shells which the Indians had used to clean out their canoes. Today, however, no one knows where either the shells or the pearls are. Many people have explored the Pearl. These include Louis LeFleur as he traveled the river selecting a site for a fur trading post. Indians of Choctaw, Chickisaw and Biloxi rowed up and down the river in canoes.\nThe river history and its relationship to early settlement, development and present life of the river area is one to be reckoned with. Businesses have been dependent on it for growth. When the white man came, he found savage Indians near the river. The swamps have been the hunting ground for the Indian and the white man for many years. As the area is still timbered, game is still plentiful. There are many kinds of wildlife along the river including deer, beaver, mink, turkey and various types of duck. Thirty-nine species of snakes are found in the area including six poisonous types. Also found are many numerous species of fish.\nAlong the Pearl, there have been and always will be many prominent towns. A few of those were Philadelphia, Rockport, Oma, Pearlington, Logtown and Gainesville. Philadelphia was an outlet for keel boats. Edinburg and Carthage had ferry crossing and steamboat landings. Jackson, the capital of Mississippi, was the site of LeFleurís trading post. Georgetown had a boat landing. Rockport had a ferry. Because the Pearl was so wide, it made shipping easy. Pearlington, Logtown and Gainesville became important industrial communities because of the timber along the banks. After depletion of the timber, however, these old towns have faded away and today with the Mississippi Test Facilities of NASA, the towns of Gainesville and Logtown have been completely obliterated.\nThe water history of the Pearl has also been interesting. In March of 1902, Charlie Freeny had the following entries in his diary:\nIn January 1940, the river froze over from bank to bank in the Carthage area. The older residents said this was the first time they had seen it frozen here. In strong current, the ice did not extend completely across the river, but in eddy places it did. In Edinburg, the ice was so thick, the children enjoyed skating upon it.\nKeel boats were used before and after the [Civil] war. The first one was owned by Harvey Gill. He made one trip each month from Carthage to New Orleans. The speed was slow - four miles per hour down and two, up. In the 1860ís, Sam Salter and Cap Atkinson built a keel boat for W. A. Burnisde. It was placed on the waters of Lake Burnside which runs into the Pearl in Neshoba County. It was propelled by the hook and jam method. One crew in front had a hook which was thrown around trees or roots along the banks. When the hook was pulled, the boat was propelled forward. A second crew had long poles which was used to push the boat. The trip to Jackson from Philadelphia by keel boat took about fifteen days. This keel boat took was sunk by the Yankees in 1864. Later, practically all farmers owned a boat since these transported farm products only.\nFor a number of years, the Pearl was navigable as far up the river as Edinburg. Small boats, some propelled by steam, made irregular runs to Carthage in the 1870ís. They were used to carry small cargoes to Carthage from the larger towns down river.\nThe first definite record of a steamer on the upper Pearl was found in The Mississippian on December 4, 1835. In the paper, Captain James Latham informed the public he intended to run the steamboat Choctaw from New Orleans to Jackson and return throughout the season.\nIn May of 1838, lumber was brought to Jackson on the steamer Alice Maria to build the first state capitol.\nIn 1840, there was a floating grocery store on the river. It consisted of the steamer Geneva and the barge Leman. For sale on his barge were 200 sacks of salt, fifty-three barrels of whiskey, fourteen of molasses, thirteen of sugar, fifteen bags of coffee, gunpowder and shot. Captain Winslow was willing to trade his supplies for cotton and deerskins.\nOn December 26, 1843, Marcus Hilzheim announced that he had made arrangements to run a small steamer between Hinds and Neshoba counties. On December 27, 1844, Mr. Hilzheim and A. E. Haynes announced that they would have a small steamer on the river in January. It would run from Carthage via Jackson to New Orleans. Mr. Haynes promised free passage to persons sending freight on the first trip. Thereafter, passage would be governed by the customerís freight. Cotton to New Orleans cost $1.50 a bale. To bring freight back, a dry barrel was fifty cents, 100 pounds was $2.50. General passage to New Orleans was ten dollars.\nOn January 13, 1848, Captain D. W. Boss advertised the \"Pearl River Steam Packet,\" the new steamboat Caroline. After the Caroline, no other boat was recorded on the upper Pearl until December 14, 1858. This was when Turner Ellis and J. H. Ledbetter announced that the Ranger would leave six days later for New Orleans. They said she would load there for all points between the mouth of the Pearl and Carthage. Thereafter, they stated that it would run between Jackson and Carthage. The Ranger was commanded by Ed Hart. It left New Orleans on January 7, 1859, and reached Jackson on the thirtieth. On February 22, the boat burned three miles above Grantís Mill. The boat and freight of 415 bales of cotton was lost. The boat carried no insurance and was an estimated loss of 25,000 dollars.\nAfter the Civil War, the first steamer on the Pearl was the Steadman, which ran around the 1870ís. Next on the river was the Oliver Clifton built by James Hamilton. In the 1880ís, it made weekly trips between Jackson and Carthage. It would leave Jackson every Saturday and would arrive in Carthage every Tuesday. The next day it would leave and would arrive again in Jackson on Friday.\nIn 1885, the O. R. Singleton was built. It ran from Edinburg to Jackson and in 1892 was bought by a group of Carthage merchants. Loaded with seventy-five tons, it took a week for the boat to go to Jackson and come back.\nThe first gasoline boat to serve the people of Leake County was Captain Henry Caldwellís Belle of the Bends. The late Mr. Perce Phillips, a worker on the boat said the following:\nThe boat sank when it hit a cypress snag at Buzzardís Bend. The motor, however, was salvaged and was used in the Juanita and still later in the Caldwell No. 3.\nRiver transportation was so important that the United States Government kept snagboats on the river to keep it free. The first was the Black Warrior. The last was the Pearl, which operated as far up the river as Rockport. In 1903, Dan Walker was the captain of the Pearl. The boat was thirty feet wide and about eighty feet long. It had a cabin for the workers with a private bunk and storage area for each man. it also had a steam powered crane which was used to pull objects out of the water and place them on the banks. Anything the crane could not move was dynamited out.\nIn 1844, it was announced that with about 75,000 dollars, the Pearl might be made navigable for small steamboats from the Gulf to Jackson three-fourths of the year. Also during winter and spring, this could extend 100 miles up river.\nIn 1948, the Jackson Chamber of Commerce saw the possibility of building a dam across the Pearl to provide a water supply and a recreation area.\nIn 1958, the Mississippi State Legislature created the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District and empowered them to construct and operate a reservoir on the Pearl River. Its construction was finished in 1962, and was named in honor of the former Governor Ross R. Barnett. The main dam is earth sixty-four feet high and three and one-half miles long. It has ten concrete spillways which have a total discharge of 180,000 cubic feet per second. The reservoir is a fifty square mile lake beginning just north of Jackson and ending six miles south of Carthage.\nPresently being completed on the Pearl, are many water parks. These parks will provide recreation and pleasure for local residents. Among their many features are boat ramps, picnic areas, camping spots and in some even tennis courts. These parks will be located in Philadelphia, Edinburg, Carthage, Riverside, Georgetown, Atwood, Columbia, Summit, Bogue Chitto, Walker Bridge and Walkiah.\nYes, from Nanih Waiya to NASA or from Philadelphia to the Gulf of Mexico, the Pearl River contains much history and many stories. It has fulfilled its purpose in the past and will continue to do so as it makes history.\n\"Bulldozer Canít Budge It - Observers Think Object is Old Anchor for River Ferry,\" Jackson Daily News (September 2, 1953).\nHarry and Donna Caldwell.

The continental United States is a network of water highways. Immense rivers thread the interior of the country for thousands of miles and empty into the vast seas at the nation's borders. At the time of initial contact with Europeans, Native Americans plied these rivers in bark canoes, bull-boats (tubs of buffalo hide stretched over a frame of willow), and pirogues (canoes made out of hollowed tree trunks).\nThe \"keelboat age\" began shortly after white colonists arrived on the continent. Taking its name from the long, narrow boat of shallow draft that rivermen propelled with poles, this was the period when humans had to rely on their own strength, wind, or water currents to drive their boats. Where the nature of the river permitted, the early settlers traveled on sailing craft, as on the Hudson, Delaware, and Potomac rivers; and it was often possible for ships to ascend far upstream. But on such waterways as the Connecticut and most of the western rivers,\nthey used the bateau and keelboat, because rowing or poling were more feasible than sailing. During this period, packet boats—vessels that traveled on a regular schedule between specific ports—were rare on the western rivers, and their services were not long continued, but in the East they existed on the Hudson and Delaware rivers.\nBoatbuilding was among the earliest activities of the colonists, especially in New England, in New Amsterdam, and on Delaware Bay. In fact, by the start of the American Revolution, many English merchants owned vessels built in the colonies. But these sea-faring boats were much larger and faster than the boats that settlers built to traverse the continent. The crudest river craft were log rafts, one-way carriers that floated downstream ladened with produce, furs, and other items to sell. Once all was sold, the rafters broke up the raft, sold the logs for lumber, and returned home by foot or on another boat. Keelboats could make the return voyage, but typically took twice as long to travel upstream as down.\nFlatboats, known also as arks and Kentucky boats, were the most numerous of the many types of river craft. Typically, they were larger than keelboats and could hold livestock in their hulls. Like rafts, flatboats were built at the headwaters of eastern and western rivers for downstream travel only. River crews used flatboats to transport produce, coal, cattle, and immigrants down American waterways\nuntil after the Civil War. The number of flatboats that traveled the country's rivers is incalculable, and so too is the amount of freight they carried and the number of immigrants they transported. But flatboats were certainly a vital factor in the development and peopling of the West, particularly byway of the Ohio and Tennessee Rivers.\nDuring the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, western rivers were not only important avenues of commerce and settlement, but were also important lines of defense and the sites of crucial military battles. The French and the Spanish maintained fleets of galleys, boats propelled by both oars and sails, on the Mississippi for military purposes. The colonists built a number of gunboats that plied western rivers during the Revolution and in the years following. One of the first steamboats, Fulton's Orleans or New Orleans, was of some assistance to Andrew Jackson's army in battles against the British in 1814 and 1815. The U.S. Army used gunboats and keelboats against the Indians on the western rivers as late as the War of 1812. Thereafter steamboats took their place. During the Civil War, few steamboats moved in civilian occupations on the lower Mississippi River, because the waters ran red from the fires of burning boats and human blood as soldiers fought for control of the river and the forts and towns on its banks.\nLong before the military battles of the Civil War, however, Americans engaged in competition of a different sort on the commercial inland waterways. When Robert Fulton launched the Clermont on the Hudson in 1807, he initiated a battle royal between river steamboats and coastwise sailing packets, with the former destined to eventual victory. Although the first steamboat on western waters was Fulton's Orleans, it could not travel far upstream and other boats built on Fulton's patents had deep hulls, which were unsuited to the shallow western rivers. It was not until Henry Shreve's Washington was launched in 1816, with its boilers on the deck, that a craft was found suitable for western river navigation. In 1820, more than sixty steamboats were working the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio Rivers; two decades later, there were more than one thousand. By the 1840s, steamboats had also become much larger and evolved into floating entertainment palaces that boasted ornate cabins and private staterooms, bars, barbar shops, elegant food service, calliopes, bands, orchestras, and gambling tables. The largest boats could carry several thousand bales of cotton and several hundred passengers at the same time. But despite the advances in design, during the antebellum period, the title \"packet\" as applied to the western passenger steamboat was a misnomer, as they rarely operated on schedule. The eastern river steamboats were more reliable.\nNineteenth-century river travel was a dangerous enterprise. Swirling currents, bad weather, and underwater obstructions such as sunken tree trunks threatened to spin boats into river banks or rip holes in their hulls. Steamboats also brought onto the rivers high-pressure boilers that too frequently exploded. Early boilers were often defective. And boat captains and owners sometimes asked too much of the boilers by overloading the boat or trying to travel too fast. Between 1836 and 1848, there were approximately seventy-six steamboat explosions on western rivers. The use of high-pressure boilers resulted in so many explosions that in 1852 Congress set up a system of licensing and inspection. The average life of a western steamboat was about four years.\nBy 1850, the railroads had begun to sap the trade from the steamboats and from the canals both in the East and West. But, the tremendous volume of transport needed during the Civil War gave the steamboats a new lease on life. This continued for a couple of decades, since most railroads crossed rather than paralleled the rivers. During this second great age of the steamboat, lines of packets were formed and schedules became more honored by observance. \"Low water boats\" were even developed to cater to mail and passenger needs during the summer. And steamboats towed barges (the modern form of flatboat) laden with coal, oil, and other heavy goods. By the 1880s, however, the competition of the railroads parallel to the rivers was rapidly displacing steamboats in the West and had won a victory in the East.\nIt was partially in a desperate sectional effort to block the railroads that the federal government was pushed into western river improvements after 1879. A magnificent system of dams and other water controls have made the rivers of the Mississippi Basin important highways for heavy freight, carried chiefly in barges pushed in the early 2000s by tugboats fueled by diesel rather than steamboats. The Mississippi River system is connected with the Saint Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes by the Illinois Waterway, completed in 1933, and the Ohio River system, and it extends to the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. This system—including the Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois rivers—saw a great increase in commercial traffic in the second half of the twentieth century.\nOn the Atlantic coast, the Hudson, Delaware, and Savannah rivers are linked to the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, which connects Boston and New York City with Key West, Florida. This system was especially important during World War II, since it enabled navigation to continue to and from Florida and Massachusetts unmenaced by German submarines. Commercial traffic on the Atlantic coastal rivers and canals also increased significantly in the second half of the twentieth century.\nBaldwin, Leland Dewitt. The Keelboat Age on Western Waters.

{"question":"I'm worried about flooding in my area. What are the benefits of rain gardens for flood prevention, and what safety measures should be taken during heavy rainfall?","answer":"Rain gardens provide significant flood prevention benefits by acting as a living sponge around homes, reducing flooding potential and drainage problems. They create a barrier between rainwater and your home, while allowing natural filtration of stormwater through loose, deep soil. As for safety measures during heavy rainfall: avoid driving through flooded roads, slow down while driving as roads need 2-3 times more stopping distance when wet, disengage cruise control, and watch for pedestrians and cyclists in poor visibility. Additionally, clear storm drains of debris and leaves to prevent localized flooding, park vehicles away from unstable trees, and stay at least 35 feet away from fallen power lines, assuming they're live and dangerous.","context":["What Is a Rain Garden and How Does it Work?\nRain gardens are shallow depressions filled with loose, deep soil to allow for the natural filtration of stormwater. They are planted with low maintenance native plants that attract pollinators. By adding rain gardens to your landscaping you can significantly reduce the risk of flooding on your property while preventing water pollution and supporting the biodiversity of our Toronto neighborhoods.\nBy putting in that rain garden, you are basically putting in a living sponge around your home and building a little line of defense that again really helps to offset the stormwater that flows in the lake with a great force.\n– Marc Yamaguchi, Rain Gardens United\nCheck out this video by Rain Gardens United about making Toronto rain garden friendly:\nThe Many Benefits of Building a Rain Garden\nSignificant Reduction of The Potential of Flooding in Your Home\nAside from making your property more attractive, a rain garden is also a practical preventative measure that can greatly benefit your home. The garden greatly reduced the potential of flooding, drainage problems, and stream bank erosions by acting as a barrier between rainwater and your home.\nPreserves the Natural Water Cycle and Protects Local Rivers, Lakes, Fish and Drinking Water Sources\nCanada has 7% of the world’s renewable fresh water.\nAside from benefiting your own property, these gardens are ecologically friendly and help build resiliency for cities by combating the effects of climate change. The filtration process helps the natural water cycle as well. By limiting the amount of water that enters the local storm drain system, the garden reduces the number of pollutants from yards and roads that run into waterways.\nCreates a Diverse and Healthy Ecosystem\nImproving the health of bees and other pollinators is a necessity. Without pollinators, much of the food we eat and the natural habitats we enjoy would not exist.\nNative plants attract pollinators which helps regulate the ecosystem by maintaining a diversity of plants and can help improve the health of Toronto’s pollinators by making your outdoor space pollinator-friendly.\nLow Maintenance solution\nRain gardens are planted with beautiful and hardy plants which don’t require a lot of upkeep because they require little to no watering which results in a low maintenance garden that looks beautiful. Native plants are perennials that will return every year, making your landscaping look more luscious as time passes.\nhow to Build a Rain Garden\nStep i: Dig a depression.\nMake sure to call Ontario One Call before you dig! Once your locates are marked, and you’ve decided on the location, the size and the style of your new garden, it’s time to start digging! Ideally, rain gardens should be dug to a depth of approximately 85cm or deeper if you want a smaller garden.\nStep ii: create a soakaway & connect the downspout\nA soakaway area balances your garden and is a key to the effectiveness of your garden. A soakaway pit is a hole in the ground filled with a permeable material like gravel to allow for water to percolate through into the soil.\nFirst, we add a layer of ¾ crushed stone wrapped in filter cloth landscaping fabric. Then we top this with an absorbent soil mix which usually contains a combination of compost and sand. This mix is designed to allow water to infiltrate the garden easily and quickly.\nStep iii: add plants & river rock\nThis is the fun part! There is a range of native plants to choose from that are both water-tolerant and drought-tolerant. You can choose the plants that fit your aesthetic! We then add river rocks and boulders on the top layer of the garden to help slow the velocity of water coming out of the downspouts.\nIf you’re looking for plants in the GTA, we highly recommend the nursery Native Plants in Claremont, they’re committed to promoting Ontario’s native plants and specialize in seed grown native perennial wildflowers, grasses, and shrubs.\nStep iv: top with Mulch.\nOnce all of the plants are in, we cover your new garden with a layer of mulch or wood chips. This layer is from 5-10cm and is an essential part of the process. The mulch helps with the filtration and absorption of rainwater and assists in keeping out weeds while also resisting drought. Lastly, it ties your garden together by giving it a neat and tidy appearance.\nDon’t Want to Build it Yourself?\nLet Us Do the Heavy Lifting!\nSchedule a rain garden consultation\nIf you live in Toronto or the GTA and would like to hire someone to install your rain garden get in touch with us to schedule a consultation and estimate!

Travelers in the region should use extreme caution and check for conditions on their route at ODOT’s www.tripcheck.com\nThe City of Wilsonville reminds residents to rake storm-drains clear of debris and leaves to prevent localized flooding or high water. Additionally, residents should consider parking vehicles away from any leaning or unstable trees. Downed power lines should be assumed to be charged with electricity, avoided and reported to PGE. PGE’s 24-hour line to report power outages or downed power lines is 800-544-1795.\nTo report problems with downed trees or flooding, the City’s Public Works 24-hour emergency line is toll-free 866-252-3614.\nODOT is gearing up for this round of heavy rain and flooding and will close any flooded highway presenting a safety hazard. Travelers should also expect road closures due to downed trees.\nTravelers must obey road closure signs for their own safety and for the safety of highway workers. Traveling through flooded roads could cause you to be swept away or stall in high water. Heavy rain often means limited visibility, reduced tire traction and less predictable car handling.\nODOT recommends that as you travel in hazardous weather conditions:• Watch out for pedestrians and bicyclists during conditions of poor visibility when it may be harder to see people walking or biking.• Slow down. Allow more time to get where you are going and allow for plenty of distance between cars, which need two or three times more stopping distance on wet roads. • Look out for downed trees and other debris in the road.• Don’t travel through high water and flooded roads. Driving through several inches of water can cause you to lose control of the car and could splash water into the engine and stall it. Lowering your speed helps you prepare for sudden stops caused by debris and other wet-weather hazards.• Disengage the cruise control.• Expect power outages. Traffic signals affected by power outages are treated as a four-way stop.• Allow more time to reach your destination. In severe weather, closures and crashes can cause long delays.• Plan ahead by leaving extra time when driving in heavy rain and windy conditions.\nPGE recommends that downed power lines are dangerous and to never touch them; report downed lines to 800-544-1795, or www.portlandgeneral.com/outages/outage-map.\nFor safety’s sake, always assume that a fallen power line is live, and follow these guidelines:• Avoid touching the downed line with your hand or an object, such as a stick, broom or pole.• Avoid touching anything, such as a car, object or equipment, or anyone who is in contact with a fallen power line.• Keep children and pets at least 35 feet away from fallen electric lines.• Avoid driving over a fallen power line.\nThe City’s Public Works Department provides residents free sand and sandbags for filling at the Community Garden, located at 7524 SW Schroeder Way, off of Wilsonville Road just east of Memorial Park."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b7144706-01ba-4534-b459-e0910a843c10>","<urn:uuid:66ca66b3-091c-4d48-bf74-3122e7bfbc32>"],"error":null}
