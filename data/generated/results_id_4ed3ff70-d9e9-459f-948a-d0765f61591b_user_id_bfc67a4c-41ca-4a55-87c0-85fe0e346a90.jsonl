{"question":"Are transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and spinal cord stimulation both effective treatments for chronic back pain?","answer":"Both TENS and spinal cord stimulation can help manage chronic back pain, but they work differently. TENS is a non-invasive treatment using a battery-operated stimulator that sends energy pulses through the skin at the pain site. Spinal cord stimulation is more invasive, requiring surgical implantation of a device under the skin near the spine that delivers electrical impulses to block pain signals before they reach the brain. Spinal cord stimulation is typically reserved for cases that haven't responded to other treatments and requires a trial period to verify at least 50% pain reduction before permanent implantation.","context":["What are my options for managing chronic pain?\nChronic pain is a common condition that affects 1 in 5 Australians aged over 45. Chronic pain can be difficult to cope with on your own, so it is important that you work with your doctor to develop a tailored plan for managing your pain.\nMedicines alone are not the most effective way to treat chronic pain. It is best managed using a combination of different approaches, which might include pain-relief medicines, but will most likely also include management alternatives such as physiotherapy, relaxation techniques and building stress-management skills.\nPeople who actively manage their pain in these ways see more improvements in their mood, overall health and ability to function, compared with those who only use medicines to manage their pain.\nWhen you experience chronic pain, it might seem natural to avoid too much standing, bending or moving around. However, exercise and stretching can often decrease your pain and improve your ability to function as you normally would.\nIf you are less active over time, you may start to lose muscle mass, flexibility and strength. This makes it more difficult to carry out regular daily activities, particularly as you become weaker as time goes on. Your doctor may recommend physiotherapy, massage or exercise as ways of helping you to manage your pain.\nPhysiotherapists and exercise physiologists can help teach you how to move your body safely, and pace yourself throughout the day by doing tasks in smaller steps — rather than all at once.\nAs mood and mindset can influence the way people experience their pain, it's helpful to include mood and social goals in your pain-management plan. Psychological techniques can help you limit or eliminate unhelpful thoughts and change the way you behave as a response to pain.\nFor example, one goal that a person might set as part of psychological therapy is to spend 30 minutes a day socialising with friends or family, or resuming a hobby after a month of treatment.\nMind-body therapies include yoga, relaxation and meditation. These therapies can help you to reduce your stress levels, which may in turn reduce your experience of pain. Yoga and Tai Chi can also be a part of your physical therapy program.\nBiofeedback is a skill that involves learning to recognise and control body processes. Biofeedback can involve an instrument (for example, to measure muscle tension) or you can learn to do it yourself.\nWith biofeedback therapy, you learn relaxation and visualisation exercises designed to increase your control over bodily functions such as your heart rate and muscle activity. These techniques help induce relaxation, lower your muscle tension, and can be used, for example, to reduce the frequency of headaches and pain.\nBecause everyone's experience of pain is different, individuals need different treatment plans to help manage their own chronic pain.\nAs well as the above, some complementary therapies may be useful, including:\n- Learning strategies to improve your sleep can help improve your ability to function well during the day and feel less pain.\n- Joining a support group, where you can share your experiences and hear how others in similar situations manage their pain. (See 'Find a health service', below.)\n- Seeking advice from an expert in pain management.\nFIND A HEALTH SERVICE — The Service Finder can help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services.\nWatch this video from NPS MedicineWise: Australians talk about their experiences with a range of different pain management options.\nCan medicines be used to manage chronic pain?\nIn some cases, medicines can be helpful in managing chronic pain. These could include over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, supplements and prescription medicines. OTC pain medicines, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, can be accessed without a doctor’s prescription.\nBefore taking any pain medicine, talk to your doctor or pharmacist about whether the medicine is suitable for you, and whether it's likely to help you manage your specific type of pain.\nSome 'combination' pain medicines can also be helpful in treating pain. These are medicines that contain more than one active ingredient, such as paracetamol with caffeine, or ibuprofen with paracetamol.\nIf you are using OTC pain medicines to help you manage your pain, tell your doctor so they can better understand which treatments are working well for you. Your pharmacist can also advise you on whether an OTC or complementary medicine is safe to take alongside your prescribed medicines.\nAre there pain medicines that should not be used to treat chronic non-cancer pain?\nOpioids (such as oxycodone, morphine and codeine) can be used to treat short-term (acute) pain, such as pain after surgery or an injury, or chronic pain in people with cancer. However, there is no clear evidence that opioids are useful in managing chronic non-cancer pain.\nPrescription opioid medicines can be dangerous and may be addictive, especially when used regularly for an extended period of time.\nEvidence shows that the longer a person takes an opioid, the less pain relief they will receive. This is because the body gets used to the dose of opioid that's being taken — known as ‘tolerance’. When a person has tolerance to opioid medicines, they need higher doses of the medicine to produce the same effect. But higher doses increase the risk of serious side effects.\nLong-term use of opioids can also make someone more sensitive to pain — this is known as ‘opioid-induced hyperalgesia’.\nWORRIED ABOUT YOUR OPIOID USE? — The Opioid Risk Indicator can help you find out if you may be developing a problem.\nWhat is interventional pain management?\nInterventional pain treatments are usually reserved for people who haven't responded well to other pain management methods. These treatments are usually recommended after consultation with a pain specialist.\nYour doctor or pain specialist can discuss with you the risks and benefits of these treatments and whether they’re suitable for you. In most cases, interventional pain treatments provide short-term pain relief, allowing you to modify your lifestyle and develop good habits. This makes it easier to cope with chronic pain if it returns.\nInterventional pain treatments for chronic pain include:\n- Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS): a battery-operated stimulator sends a pulse of energy through the skin at the site of your pain. TENS can help manage a range of pain types, including back and neck pain, arthritis, migraine headaches and post-operative pain.\n- Spinal-cord stimulation: similar to TENS, this involves planting an electrical device under your skin near the spine. The device applies a current to the spinal cord, which interrupts the pain signals being sent to the brain. A hand-held control allows you to adjust the intensity of the charge.\n- Radiofrequency ablation: this is a procedure performed by a doctor that targets joint- and nerve-based chronic pain. Needles are placed directly onto pain-inducing nerves, and heat is produced at the tip of the needle to interrupt the signals to the brain.\n- Nerve block: this intervention is used to treat intense chronic nerve pain — for example, as in Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). A local anaesthetic is injected to stop the nerves from transmitting pain signals.\n- Epidural injections: medicines such as corticosteroids and a local anaesthetic can be administered to the epidural space (between the vertebrae and spinal cord in the spine) to reduce pain.\n- Surgery: some types of chronic pain may respond to surgical treatment.\nWhen should I see my doctor?\nIf you experience chronic pain, you should ask your doctor about the pain management options that could be suitable for you.\nChronic pain is best treated using a combination of physical therapies, relaxation techniques and stress-management strategies. Your doctor can help you create a chronic pain management plan that includes some or all of these methods.\nASK YOUR DOCTOR — Preparing for an appointment?

In this interventional pain management treatment, a permanent spinal cord stimulator is implanted under the skin. This spinal cord stimulator delivers regular electrical impulses to the spinal nerves that are causing pain, blocking these pain messages before they can reach the brain. The implanted device is small, like a pacemaker, and does not interfere with normal daily activities. Spinal cord stimulation therapy may help to reduce dependence on oral pain medications.\nConditions treated by spinal cord stimulation\nSpinal cord stimulation is used in the treatment of several pain conditions, including:\n- Failed back surgery syndrome\n- Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)\n- Chronic low back pain that does not respond to other therapies\n- Chronic arm and leg pain\nYour Henry Ford Pain Management specialist will work with you to determine whether a neurostimulation therapy (spinal cord stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation or peripheral field stimulation) or other interventional pain management treatment is best for your pain condition.\nSpinal cord stimulation is performed in two separate procedures\nThe two spinal cord stimulation procedures include:\n- Initial trial electrodes: An initial procedure to connect an external, trial pulse generator. This is used to test the effectiveness of the spinal cord stimulation treatment before proceeding to the permanent spinal cord stimulator.\n- Permanent spinal cord stimulator implant: If your pain is reduced by 50 percent during the initial test period, you will undergo a second procedure to implant a permanent spinal cord stimulator under your skin for long-term pain management.\nProcedure 1: Initial trial electrodes\nDuring this minimally invasive procedure:\n- You lie on your stomach.\n- Your skin is sterilized at the injection site.\n- You are administered a local anesthetic to numb the injection area.\n- Your pain management physician inserts wires (leads) through a needle, under your skin and into the spinal cord space near the targeted spinal nerves.\n- These leads are then connected externally to a smartphone-sized electrical pulse generator that you carry with you during the initial test period.\nProcedure 2: Implanting the permanent spinal cord stimulator\nThis surgery is performed under general anesthesia. During this procedure:\n- You lie on your stomach.\n- Your skin is sterilized at the surgical site.\n- You are administered general anesthesia.\n- Your pain management physician connects the existing leads from the test pulse generator to a smaller spinal cord stimulator and implants this permanent device under your skin.\nFollowing each spinal cord stimulation procedure\nYou will be moved to a recovery room and monitored by your care team. In most cases, spinal cord stimulation procedures are performed on an outpatient basis and you will go home the same day, although in rare cases some patients may require admission to the hospital following the procedure.\nThe Henry Ford Pain Center approach\nAt the Henry Ford Pain Center, pain treatment begins with a thorough medical history and physical exam. All patients are evaluated by board-certified pain medicine physicians, physician assistants and certified nurse practitioners to identify the cause of their pain. Following initial assessment, we work with you to develop a personalized treatment plan that may include interventional pain procedures, medication therapy, physical therapy, massage and other complementary options."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:74bd4190-e8e3-4a31-88b0-1ee9bff1948d>","<urn:uuid:c6d1a8dd-0f1c-40b9-8a59-fea6e0429ced>"],"error":null}

Or are you despairing at how hard it is to keep your 1980s home cool during a summer heatwave?\nIn many cases, older homes trap the heat in summer and lose precious warmth in winter. In other words, they are usually inefficient.\nNew homes, on the other hand, must comply with rigorous standards around energy efficiency. Builders and architects have learnt a lot about house design and how things like orientation and choice of materials can create comfortable homes that don’t cost the earth to heat and cool.\nWhat is an energy efficient home?\nEnergy efficient homes use less energy to run things like heating, cooling, lighting and appliances – generally because of the way these houses have been designed and built. The appliances used in the home also influence energy efficiency, to learn more read our article on appliance energy star ratings.\nGiven that heating and cooling are the main users of energy in the average house, these are the two real focus areas when it comes to energy efficiency. A well-designed home, for example, will require a lot less air conditioning over summer – benefitting both the environment and your back pocket.\nHouses get star ratings, too!\nJust as a fridge or washing machine comes with an Energy Rating Label to show how energy efficient it is, homes today are rated using a star system, too. And these star ratings tell a very positive story about how homes around Australia are becoming more and more energy efficient.\nAccording to the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS), which rates a house’s heating and cooling efficiency out of 10 stars, the average home built in 1990 just scraped onto the chart with one star.1 To maintain a comfortable temperature within, these houses would have been greedy guzzlers of energy.\nBefore 2003, when the government introduced energy efficiency regulations, less than one per cent of homes scored six stars.1 Today, every new home must attain six stars; some achieving even higher ratings with a few simple upgrades.\nEnergy saving features in new homes\nIf you’re planning a build or renovation, there are many things you can speak to your builder or architect about to make your home more energy efficient and help you save on heating and cooling costs into the long term.\nAn energy efficient new home construction will include things like:\n- North facing living areas to capture more sunlight in winter\n- Internal doors to close off areas that don’t need to be heated or cooled (i.e. zoning)\n- Thermal mass (e.g. concrete, brick) to absorb heat\n- Good insulation in your walls, ceiling and floors\n- Draught-proofing to close any gaps and cracks\n- Double glazing on your windows or thick curtains\n- Energy efficient heating and cooling appliances\nMany of these things can be retrofitted to your existing home to upgrade its energy efficiency, too.\nEach state and territory has specific regulations around energy efficiency. Talk to a local building assessor about how to make sure your plans comply; and you can also apply for a NatHERS star rating to see for yourself just how efficient your new home will be.\nThe final word\nIt’s an exciting time to build or renovate a home. With energy efficiency a mandatory consideration these days, know that new homes are highly likely to outperform older homes when it comes to heating and cooling efficiency.\n- \"Star rating scale overview | NatHERS.\" http://www.nathers.gov.au/owners-and-builders/star-rating-scale-overview.

{"question":"What regulatory tools does the Fed have to protect the financial system, and what oversight is missing in the crypto-asset market?","answer":"The Federal Reserve has several regulatory tools to protect the financial system, including requiring banks to maintain certain capital levels, conducting stress tests to assess banks' resilience to economic shocks, and requiring 'living wills' from large financial institutions detailing how they would handle bankruptcy. In contrast, the crypto-asset market largely lacks regulatory oversight, creating significant vulnerabilities. Crypto-asset providers are mostly unregulated, meaning there's no protection for investors who fall victim to fraud or theft. The lack of proper regulation, combined with high volatility and cybersecurity vulnerabilities, makes these investments particularly risky for retail investors. Without regulatory standards, crypto-assets are also vulnerable to misuse for criminal activities and lack the transparency and investor protections that exist in traditional financial markets.","context":["Federal Reserve chairs love to talk about their toolkit. But what’s in it?\nShare Now on:\nBonus audio: Check out the tools Federal Reserve chair, Jay Powell has at his disposal and how he can use them individually or in concert together, much like a musician writing a song. Listen using the player above. (Featuring music composed by Ben Tolliday and Daniel Ramirez.)\nAmerica’s central bankers love to talk about their toolkit. Tune in to any of their testimonies, speeches or public appearances and chances are it will come up. Ben Bernanke did it. Janet Yellen did it. Current Fed Chair Jerome Powell does it, too.\nTalking about the Fed in this way makes them seem like the plumbers or construction workers of the economy. That image is not far from reality. The Fed’s main job — its dual mandate as it is often called — is to keep inflation low and to maintain full employment. That means that many of the things that fall under the Fed’s purview have to do with patching up leaks in the economy and ensuring that things are flowing smoothly. And since the Great Recession, the Fed has also been tasked with making sure that many of America’s financial institutions have a strong enough foundation to weather another economic downturn.\nSo is Powell walking around the Fed wearing a hard hat, tools in hand?\nLet’s take a peek into the Fed’s toolkit …\nAll those bills in your wallet? They are made by the Fed.\n“It’s a very good business to be a central bank because you can create money out of thin air,” said Frederic Mishkin, who previously served as a Federal Reserve governor from 2006 to 2008 and is now a professor of banking and financial institutions at Columbia University. “If I was the Frederic Mishkin central bank, what I could do is I could actually take pieces of paper and write Frederick Mishkin notes. I can hand them to you and buy things from you. I could buy bonds, I can buy new Federal Reserve buildings, whatever … In a sense, the Federal Reserve is actually able to do the same thing. In fact, when you look at those little pieces of paper in your pocket that you use as currency, they all say Federal Reserve Notes and the Federal Reserve can basically just print them up.”\nThe Federal Reserve doesn’t just make sure that we have nice fresh crisp bills in circulation. It also ensures that there is enough money flowing into the economy to keep it chugging along.\nThe Fed’s ability to create money out of thin air is one of its core tools – it’s kind of like the various building materials such as putty, metal or screws that are used to fix whatever is wrong.\nNot only does the Fed decide how much money to print but it also decides how much it should cost to borrow money.\nOne of the main ways the Fed carries out its dual mandate is by setting short-term interest rates. The short-term interest rates determine how much interest banks pay to borrow from each other overnight.\nThink of interest rates as a wrench that the Fed uses to either open or close a valve that controls the flow of money in and out of the economy.\nIf interest rates are high, fewer people are likely to take out loans and invest back into the economy. High interest rates also make saving more appealing as the money you’ve put away tends to grow faster. On the other hand, if the interest rates are low, money sitting in the bank is not really growing and low interest rates make borrowing money seem more appealing. So people and businesses are more likely to take out loans and put money back into the economy.\nUsually, the Fed lowers interest rates during an economic downturn to revive the economy.\nThen when the economy is doing better, the Fed has to make sure that there is not too much money in the economy because that could cause the economy to overheat – with too much money flowing into the economy, prices could go up causing inflation to rise at a higher pace. In that case, the Fed would increase interest rates in hopes of encouraging people to save and to discourage high volumes of loans, limiting the flow of money into the economy.\nWhat if the wrench doesn’t work?\nUsually lowering short-term interest rates used by the banks also has downward pressure on long-term rates.\nDuring the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates from more than 5 percent to near zero percent. Interest rates remained near zero percent for about seven years, before the Fed finally raised them in December 2015.\nOnce the Fed got to zero on short-term interest rates, it had to come up with a different way to put pressure on long-term interest rates. Essentially, the central bankers used the wrench to open up the valve as far as it would go and had to come up with a plan B if they wanted to open it up further.\n“In a way, this was like they were going and looking for different tools,” Miskin said. “They found that their usual socket wrench wasn’t working, so then they had to look for different kind of wrenches and screwdrivers and other things in order to get it to work and, in a sense, there was a lot of experimentation.”\nThat’s when they turned to non-conventional monetary policy, including quantitative easing.\nRemember that money that the Fed can make appear out of thin air? Well, after the Great Recession, the Fed took that money and bought assets that are directly tied to long-term interest rates such as government and agency securities and mortgage-backed securities.\n“The idea was that by purchasing these securities, we’d reduce the supply of the securities in the market, driving up the prices, and pushing the interest rates on long-term securities down,” Mary Suiter, the Economic Education Officer for the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said in a “Feducation” video about the Fed’s toolkit. “The purpose was to help the economy, and, by pushing long-term interest rates down, it would benefit people buying houses or cars — long-term kinds of lending.”\nIt’s as if the Fed was drilling holes into specific markets and then pushing money in through them. By buying government backed securities, the Fed gave money to the U.S. government that could then be invested back into the economy. Similarly, by buying mortgage-backed securities from banks, the Fed increased their cash reserves making it easier for them to lend to their customers.\nThe Fed is often described as “data centric.” To figure out what to do, the U.S. Central bank looks at inflation data, unemployment, spending, lending, etc. The data — which is collected by various government agencies — serve like measurements that help to create a detailed blueprint of the economy.\n“It’s like a blueprint although it would be nice if it was that easy: you just look at the blueprint and know what to do,” Mishkin said. “It’s much harder than that. There’s a real art to central banking, to what the Federal Reserve does. They get information but what they really care about is what’s going to happen several years into the future because when they set monetary policy today it doesn’t have an immediate effect. We think it takes around a year to have a full effect on unemployment and output and maybe two to three years to have its effect on inflation.”\nIn order to figure out what to do, the central bankers then forecast what the economy will look like in the future and use that along with the data to figure out what tools to use.\nIf you woke up one day to find a bunch of construction workers walking around your home tightening and loosening a bunch of screws, you’d probably be a little alarmed (fine, maybe more than a little). Same goes for financial markets. That is why one of Fed’s most important tools is forward guidance.\nForward guidance is a simply jargon for communication.\nIn order not to spook the markets, the Fed regularly releases notes from its meetings, holds a handful of press conferences a year and even releases its economic forecasts.\nThink of the forward guidance as a work notice. Just as your landlord might notify you that the water might be shut down in a week for construction, so does the Fed try to give advance notice to the markets about how many rate hikes it expects each year, how much quantitative easing it plans to do or when it plans to start shrinking its balance sheet.\nIf the Fed communicates consistently and accurately, the markets should barely blink when the Fed uses any of its tools.\nIn addition to having monetary tools, the Fed also has regulatory tools at its disposal.\nThanks to Dodd-Frank, the Fed is tasked with making sure that financial institutions are prepared for potential future crises. Since the Great Recessions, different types of requirements have been imposed on banks. For example, banks now have to maintain certain amount of capital — or deposits — in case of emergencies. And if they have more riskier assets, they have to hold more capital. These new capital requirements were put in place to minimize the need for future bailouts.\n“The other part of Dodd-Frank was that some of the big banks and systemically important financial institutions had to submit living wills and some of those have actually been rejected on the grounds that this isn’t good enough it’s not strong enough,” said Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute. “So so far I think there are some encouraging signs that the Fed is taking this seriously.”\nThe living wills are detailed plans that outline how banks and other large financials institutions would enter bankruptcy and liquify their assets if something were to go wrong. The idea is that if these institutions have viable plans for worst case scenarios, then the failure of one financial institution might not bring down the whole economy.\nAnother regulatory tool at the Fed’s disposal is the stress test. Every year, the Fed takes a look at large financial institutions and their balance sheets and subjects them to hypothetical “shocks” — nightmare economic scenarios like a huge drop in housing prices, a huge jump in unemployment or a stock market crash. If the banks don’t survive the hypothetical shocks, they could receive a failing grade and be told to get more capital onto their balance sheet.\nHowever, as the month of May came to a close, Congress passed a bill repealing parts of Dodd-Frank, including a requirement that small and mid-size banks (banks with less than $250 million in assets) be subject to stress tests.\nLiving wills and stress tests are like a hammer that the Fed uses to squash certain risks within the financial system.\nDoes the hammer work?\nIt’s too early to tell, according to Bivens. “It’s basically like they’ve been handed these tools and whether they use them aggressively enough to restrain genuinely speculative risky behavior, I don’t think they’ve been put to that iron test yet,” he explained. “We’re getting close. Financial markets are very much recovered. Some of them are even looking a little expensive — if not bubbles, at the moment. So in the next couple of years we might really start to see the Fed have to decide about how strict they are going to be about these but I’m afraid we have not tested them yet and I’m a little afraid it’s taken so long for financial markets to recover that people have already forgotten about the last crisis.”\nThere is one main difference however, Bivens said from the last crisis.

World Investor Week is a global campaign to raise awareness about the importance of investor education and protection, and to highlight the investor education and protection initiatives of securities regulators.\nVirtual and digital currencies/assets are gaining popularity. However, it should be underscored that consumers need to assess the risks associated with holding and/or investing in virtual or digital assets prior to investing in these assets. In particular, consumers should be aware that providers of virtual or digital assets are mostly unregulated. Regional and global regulators emphasize that consumers should know the potential risks of buying or investing in virtual currencies and assets. High volatility, the lack of (proper) regulation, vulnerabilities concerning cybersecurity, misuse for criminal and fraudulent activities, and lack of transparency makes these types of high risk investments unsuitable for retail investors, or investors other than professional, accredited, or sophisticated investors.\nTogether, we are committed to helping you protect yourself and the integrity of our markets.\nEducation is essential to understanding these types of products, so please read the following and\njoin us with your PLEDGE at the end.\nKEY FINTECH CONCEPTS\nCrypto-assets are products that have captured the attention of media, both experienced and inexperienced investors, financial regulators, and governments. But what are they? How can they impact our lives?\nThis section will help you to better understand the key fintech concepts, and the concerns that regulators may have with people investing their savings in them. Click on the terms below to learn more.\nThe term “fintech” is simply a merger of the words “financial” and “technology”. It refers to the use of technology, including computer programs, to deliver or improve banking and financial services.\nThere have been many traditional financial services that have drawn the attention of fintech developers. Mobile banking and software apps that let you buy insurance online, or that provide investment advice over your mobile phone, are a few examples. When crypto-assets are used to meet financial services needs, they are considered fintech as well.\nAdvances in technology can bring new solutions that forever change the way that people do things. New technologies, like crypto-assets, often bring new risks, and it usually takes some time to understand how best to protect consumers and the public from those risks without stopping progress.\nCrypto-assets is a term that captures a wide range of products. Examples include cryptocurrencies, crypto-coins, exchange tokens, non-fungible tokens, security tokens, utility tokens, and virtual currencies. Common to all of these is their reliance on distributed ledger technology (DLT), like the blockchain, to track and record key details, such as the ownership history of the crypto-asset.\nExamples of crypto-assets that you may have heard of include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin.\nHow distributed ledger technology (DLT) is defined varies. However, the key concept with DLT is that a number of participants on a network of computers use cryptography (secret coding) to control the generation of units of digital assets and to record and verify transactions. In the case of cryptocurrency, the DLT used is called the blockchain.\nWith DLT, transactions are recorded digitally across the users on the network and the collective records must all match to be accepted. This is one of the key innovations of DLT. There is no centralised government authority or middleman, such as a Central Bank, involved in the process. The network is the first and final authority.\nThe lack of a central government authority may appeal to different users for various reasons. However, in some cases, it also attracts people with criminal intentions. In fact, crypto-assets have become a popular payment method for some frauds and other crimes which could impact you. For example, they are often used to facilitate ransomware payments.\nAlthough the usage and acceptance of many crypto-assets and ways to exchange them for “real” money are increasing, by no means should you expect to go to the grocery store with your cryptocurrency, or that your landlord or the local power company must accept it from you.\nBecause “currency” is in the name, many people think that a cryptocurrency is a “currency” like US dollars, or euros. US dollars and euros are known as “fiat currencies”. Fiat currencies are backed by the governments that issued them and are legal tender in the countries where they are issued – meaning that everyone in that country accepts them as a means of payment. Cryptocurrencies are not backed by an issuing government. They are not legal tender.\nCryptocurrencyprices are usually based on supply and demand, and they can have very large price swings as a result. This makes them a poor way to measure or store value.\nThere are developers working on cryptocurrencies that maintain stable prices. These cryptocurrencies, known as ‘stablecoins’, have prices that are connected to the prices of stable assets, such as US dollars or gold. Unfortunately, they are often complex and still subject to supply and demand forces that reduce the stability of their prices.\nCryptocurrencies, crypto-coins and crypto-tokens are very similar terms, whose meanings are still not universally defined. ‘Token’ is the term many experts and regulators use more and more frequently when discussing cryptocurrencies and crypto-coins.\n“Tokens” can be divided into three categories, depending on their features:\n1. Exchange tokens\n- intended for use as a means of exchange\n- not issued or backed by a central authority\n- used as a means of trade outside of the central payments and banking system\n2. Security tokens\n- features of securities\n- may be regulated just like securities\n3. Utility tokens\n- grant access to an existing or prospective product or service\n- do not qualify to be regulated like securities\nWhen public companies need to raise capital, or a private company makes the decision to “go public”, they may sell shares of their company in an initial public offering (IPO). Similarly, developers looking to raise money for a project or new venture may use an initial token offering (ITO), where tokens are offered in exchange for money or other assets. ITOs are also known as an initial coin offerings (ICOs), token sales or a coin sales.\nIn well regulated capital markets, the promoter of an IPO must meet strict regulatory standards regarding the information they are required to share with the public about the investment. However, ITOs/ICOs are often unregulated, in which case the supporting documents of the ICO are not required to be reviewed by a regulatory body, or to meet the high standards for disclosure of material information as would be required for an IPO.\nOnce an ITO/ICO is complete, tokens may be traded on a cryptocurrency exchange. A cryptocurrency exchange is an online platform that allows you to buy, sell or exchange cryptocurrencies for other cryptocurrencies, or for fiat currency. In many instances today, cryptocurrency exchanges are still unregulated. As a result, investors do not have the same protections as they would on regulated securities exchanges.\nCryptocurrency exchanges are also frequently the target of digital theft. Many have been hacked and suffered notable losses.\nTokens are stored in digital wallets, or e-wallets, that require a password for access. These passwords are often very long and complicated, to reduce the chance of theft or hacking. However, if an investor loses his or her password or the wallet is hacked, the investor could permanently lose access to the wallet’s contents.\nE-Wallets can be hot or cold. Hot wallets are online and connected to the Internet, so the user can access them to do transactions. However, as they are online, hackers may be able to access them too. To combat theft by hacking, some investors put their tokens into cold wallets. Cold wallets are stored offline and are away from exchanges. People who invest in cryptocurrencies usually have both cold and hot wallets.\nYou may have heard about people investing in cyrpto-assets and making lots of money quickly. While people have made fortunes on risky investments, like crypto-assets, many have lost fortunes and their life’s savings pursuing them. If you do not have a lot of investment expertise or you cannot afford to take heavy financial losses, there are some crypto-asset risk features that you need to know and understand.\n- Risks of financial crime: digital assets can be used by criminals for illicit activities through their lack of transparency. More and more, crypto-asset investors have been the target of outright scams and have lost their entire investment as a result. Without regulation, these investors have no one to turn to.\n- Risks in cybersecurity: tendency to cyber threats and attacks which means investors lose their investments or their assets are transferred out of the owners’ accounts and into others. Some investors have even had their e-wallets hacked or forgotten their passwords, and lost their investment as a result. Without regulation, investors have no one to turn to, for help to retrieve their lost assets.\n- Risks to investing individuals/consumers: One of the most important tools any investor has is information that is accurate, timely, and fairly obtained, which helps them to make sound investment decisions. Unfortunately, there is a lot of hype and often misinformation surrounding crypto-assets, particularly during initial token offerings, when a digital token is first offered for sale to the public. If the token offering is not regulated, a regulator may not be able to help you, even if you were intentionally misled. Without proper knowledge about these products, the concepts and the risks, you may become a victim of a fraudster who will try to get you to invest in a system of unregulated digital assets.\n- Risks to market integrity: increased vulnerability and abusive practices as a result of transparency and lack of regulation, may lead to financial losses and loss of market confidence with adverse financial stability implications."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:beda5e17-2db1-4ceb-b26b-e4b81951f2c4>","<urn:uuid:6553d850-a050-4343-a349-2ecf497e5d6c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does a metal halide lamp differ from an HPS lamp in terms of light spectrum and starting mechanism, and what maintenance considerations are unique to each?","answer":"Metal halide lamps produce light in the white-blue spectrum by arcing electricity through metal halides, which promotes vegetative growth and bushiness while discouraging upward growth. In contrast, HPS lamps emit light in the yellow/red/orange regions by igniting sodium, mercury and xenon gases, which stimulates flowering and fruit production. Regarding starting mechanisms, HPS lamps require an ignitor component in their ballast, while metal halide lamps do not. For maintenance, HPS lamps require monitoring for cycling issues and capacitor failures, which can be diagnosed through power factor measurements. Both types use ballasts, but HPS systems need additional attention to their ignitor component.","context":["Post By SmokeyMacPot\nWhat Do All of Those Lighting Terms Mean?\nThis glossary will help you understand terms commonly used in the world of lighting.\nAVERAGE LIFE - The life expectancy of a lamp, based on laboratory\nAMPERE (AMP) - The unit used to measure the strength of an electric current.\nARC - The luminous discharge of electricity between two electrodes in HID lighting.\nARC DISCHARGE - A transfer of electricity across two electrodes (anode and cathode), characterized by high electrode current densities and a low voltage drop at the electrode.\nARC TUBE - The enclosure which contains the luminous gases and also houses the arc.\nBALLAST - An auxiliary piece of equipment designed to start and to properly control the flow of power to gas discharge light sources such as fluorescent and high intensity discharge lamps.

Halogen lamps are high pressure incandescent lamps containing halogen gases such as iodine or bromine which allow the filaments to be operated at higher temperatures and higher efficacies. While excellent for home lighting and similar applications, halogen lamps are not effective or efficient as grow lights due to their very poor spectrum (extreme far red) and high operating temperatures.\n(HID) HIGH-INTENSITY DISCHARGE LAMP - A general term for mercury, metal halide and high-pressure sodium lamps. HID lamps contain compact arc tubes which enclose various gases and metal salts operating at relatively high pressures and temperatures.\n(HPS) HIGH-PRESSURE SODIUM LAMP - High-pressure sodium lamps operate by igniting sodium, mercury and xenon gases within a sealed ceramic arc tube.

Most useful info.","Correcting Problems With HPS Lamps\nHigh-pressure sodium lamps are widely used in greenhouse production, but they require maintenance for peak efficiency. After visual inspection, many growers find that some lamps in their greenhouse either aren’t operating or aren’t doing so at full brightness. These lamps reduce growth and increase electric consumption. Here’s a list of the most common HPS lamp failures — and a little technical savvy to diagnose and repair them.\nOld bulbs fail by cycling on and off. When a bulb begins to fail, it is off for about 10 percent of the time and increases to about 80 percent of off-time before it fails completely. It’s easy to screw a new bulb into the fixture. HPS bulbs should last four to six years, depending on the number of on/off cycles and hours of use.\nThe second most common failure is the capacitor. If screwing in a new bulb does not solve the problem, the lamp must be taken down and disassembled. If the capacitor is enlarged, it has failed and needs replacement. Capacitors also can partially fail. Here, the fixture starts and runs continuously but comes up to only 10-60 percent of its maximum brightness. HPS fixtures with a partially failed capacitor have a lower light output, a lower power factor and reduced efficiency. Five to 10 percent of the HPS lamps we’ve purchased in the past 25 years have had partially failed capacitors. This partial failure is not always visually apparent, and lights continue to function at reduced efficiency for extended periods of time.\nHPS lamps may be dim if the supply voltage is low. First, ensure that the lamp is receiving the desired voltage. If it is, use a meter capable of measuring the power factor of the lamp, such as the Kill-A-Watt meter (about $30). This meter must be connected in line with the lamp, and the light should be at full brightness before you take the measurement. The power factor of a normally functioning lamp with a new bulb is 0.97 to 0.98. Fixtures with bulbs nearing the end of their lifetime have power factors of 0.90 to 0.94. Fixtures with partially failed capacitors have a power factor of 0.70 to 0.80.\nConfirmation of a partially failed capacitor can be made by measuring it with a capacitance meter ($20 to $80). This failure cannot be measured with a standard volt-ohm meter. In our experience, the partially failed capacitors have 50 percent of their rated capacity (13 microfarads instead of the normal 26).\nThe lifetime of a capacitor depends on how often the lamp is started and the temperature of the capacitor (the warmer the temperature, the shorter the lifetime). New capacitors are about $25.\nA less common problem is failure of the ignitor. Metal halide lamps do not require an ignitor to start, so the test for a failed ignitor for an HPS lamp is to screw in a metal halide bulb of the same wattage and see if it starts. If the MH lamp starts and a new HPS lamp does not start, the ignitor probably needs to be replaced.\nIf a new bulb, ignitor, and/or capacitor do not make the fixture work, then the ballast is probably defective. Ballast replacement kits cost $130 to $150, and it can be cost effective to replace the ballast rather than purchase a new lamp. It takes the same amount of time to replace the ballast as it does to replace the capacitor (40 to 60 minutes to take the lamp down, replace the components and rehang).\nIf you’ve invested in the lamps, you should be sure they are running effectively. Be sure to cut off power to the lamps before working with them for safety reasons. If you’re not electrically inclined, work with your lighting manufacturer or an electrician to diagnose problems and replace component parts."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a68b9da3-7385-4ee4-a0ce-404458f8f873>","<urn:uuid:731399fe-f94d-45a1-9a64-5d54d414a9f8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between the binary system structure in R Aquarii and Alcyone (Eta Tauri)? How do their companion stars and surrounding environments differ?","answer":"R Aquarii is a symbiotic binary system containing a mira variable star and a hot companion with a spectacular jet outflow, separated by 45 mas. The system features an extended emission line nebula and inner jet clouds with high-density structures (Ne ≈ 3 × 105 - 3 × 106 cm-3). In contrast, Alcyone is a more complex multiple star system with a primary triple star component. The main star is a B7IIIe giant surrounded by a gas disk, with two close companions - one at less than 1 milliarcsecond separation (orbital period ~4 days) and another at 0.031 arcseconds (orbital period ~830 days). Additional components include Alcyone B, C, and D at much larger separations (up to 117 arcseconds).","context":["SPHERE/ZIMPOL observations of the symbiotic system R Aquarii. I. Imaging of the stellar binary and the innermost jet clouds\nContext. R Aqr is a symbiotic binary system consisting of a mira variable, a hot companion with a spectacular jet outflow, and an extended emission line nebula. Because of its proximity to the Sun, this object has been studied in much detail with many types of high resolution imaging and interferometric techniques. We have used R Aqr as test target for the visual camera subsystem ZIMPOL, which is part of the new extreme adaptive optics (AO) instrument SPHERE at the Very Large Telescope (VLT).\nAims: We describe SPHERE/ZIMPOL test observations of the R Aqr system taken in Hα and other filters in order to demonstrate the exceptional performance of this high resolution instrument. We compare our observations with data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and illustrate the complementarity of the two instruments. We use our data for a detailed characterization of the inner jet region of R Aqr.\nMethods: We analyze the high resolution ≈ 25 mas images from SPHERE/ZIMPOL and determine from the Hα emission the position, size, geometric structure, and line fluxes of the jet source and the clouds in the innermost region <2'' (<400 AU) of R Aqr. The data are compared to simultaneous HST line filter observations. The Hα fluxes and the measured sizes of the clouds yield Hα emissivities for many clouds from which one can derive the mean density, mass, recombination time scale, and other cloud parameters.\nResults: Our Hα data resolve for the first time the R Aqr binary and we measure for the jet source a relative position 45 mas West (position angle -89.5°) of the mira. The central jet source is the strongest Hα component with a flux of about 2.5 × 10-12 erg cm-2 s-1. North east and south west from the central source there are many clouds with very diverse structures. Within 0.5'' (100 AU) we see in the SW a string of bright clouds arranged in a zig-zag pattern and, further out, at 1''-2'', fainter and more extended bubbles. In the N and NE we see a bright, very elongated filamentary structure between 0.2''-0.7'' and faint perpendicular \"wisps\" further out. Some jet clouds are also detected in the ZIMPOL [O I] and He I filters, as well as in the HST-WFC3 line filters for Hα, [O III], [N II], and [O I]. We determine jet cloud parameters and find a very well defined correlation Ne ∝ r-1.3 between cloud density and distance to the central binary. Densities are very high with typical values of Ne ≈ 3 × 105 cm-3 for the \"outer\" clouds around 300 AU, Ne ≈ 3 × 106 cm-3 for the \"inner\" clouds around 50 AU, and even higher for the central jet source. The high Ne of the clouds implies short recombination or variability timescales of a year or shorter.\nConclusions: Hα high resolution data provide a lot of diagnostic information for the ionized jet gas in R Aqr. Future Hα observations will provide the orientation of the orbital plane of the binary and allow detailed hydrodynamical investigations of this jet outflow and its interaction with the wind of the red giant companion.\nAstronomy and Astrophysics\n- Pub Date:\n- June 2017\n- stars: individual: R Aqr;\n- binaries: symbiotic;\n- stars: winds;\n- circumstellar matter;\n- instrumentation: adaptive optics;\n- Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics\n- 24 pages, 14 figures (accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics)","Alcyone, Eta Tauri (η Tau) is a multiple star system located in the constellation Taurus, the Bull. With an apparent magnitude of 2.87, Alcyone is the third brightest star in Taurus, after Aldebaran and Elnath, and the brightest star in the Pleiades cluster (Messier 45), one of the nearest open clusters to Earth. The star lies at an approximate distance of 440 light years from Earth.\nEta Tauri is listed as a multiple star system in the Washington Double Star Catalog (WDS) and the Catalog of Components of Double and Multiple Stars (CCDM). The latter catalog lists the primary component, formally named Alcyone, and three companions. Alcyone B (24 Tauri) is a white (A0) main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 6.28, located at a separation of 117’’ from the primary component. Alcyone C has the variable star designation V647 Tauri and is classified as a Delta Scuti variable. Its brightness varies from magnitude 8.25 to 8.30 with a period of 1.13 hours. Alcyone D is a white (F3) main sequence star with a visual magnitude of 9.15.\nThe Washington Double Star Catalog lists Alcyone D as a double star with two similar components separated by only 0.3’’. The catalog lists four other fainter stars in the system, none of them brighter than magnitude 11.\nThe primary component in the system is a triple star. The brightest component is a bluish (class B7IIIe) giant star with a mass between 5.9 and 6.1 solar masses and a radius about 9.3 times that of the Sun. With an effective temperature of 12,258 K, the star is 2,030 times more luminous than the Sun, but most of its output is in the invisible ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Alcyone is a Be star and, like all the named Pleiades except Maia, it is a very fast spinner, with a projected rotational velocity of 149 km/s. As a result, it is surrounded by a disk of gas ejected around the equator.\nThe nearest companion is a low-mass star separated by less than 1 milliarcsecond from the primary. The two components orbit each other with a period of a little over four days. The other companion is located at a separation of 0.031 arcseconds (roughly the distance from the Sun to Jupiter). It is half as massive as the primary. The two have an orbital period of about 830 days.\nAlcyone is the brightest member of the Pleiades open cluster. The nine brightest stars in the cluster are named after the Pleiades, the Seven Sisters in Greek mythology – Alcyone (Eta Tauri), Asterope (21 Tauri), Celaeno (16 Tauri), Electra (17 Tauri), Maia (20 Tauri), Merope (23 Tauri) and Taygeta (19 Tauri) – and their parents Atlas (27 Tauri) and Pleione (28 Tauri).\nThe Pleiades open cluster contains more than 1,000 confirmed members and has a total mass of 800 solar masses. The brightest members are hot blue stars of the spectral type B with an estimated age of up to 100 million years. They lie at an average distance of 444 light years from Earth.\nCatalogued as Messier 45 by the French astronomer and comet hunter Charles Messier, the cluster is exceptionally bright and large, occupying an area of 110 arcminutes. It has an apparent magnitude of 1.6 and is the most recognizable star cluster visible to the naked eye. Up to 14 members are visible without binoculars in exceptionally good conditions, but observers normally see six to eight stars.\nThe members will likely keep travelling together through space for another 250 million years and then gradually disperse as a result of gravitational interaction with the interstellar medium.\nIn Greek mythology, the Pleiades caught the eye of Orion, the hunter. After their father Atlas was condemned to carry the heavens on his shoulders, Orion began to pursue the sisters. Zeus intervened, transforming the sisters first into doves and later into stars. The constellation Orion still appears to be pursuing the Pleiades across the sky.\nThe Pleiades have been a familiar feature of the night sky in cultures around the world. The earliest discovered depiction of the cluster is the Nebra sky disk, a Bronze Age artifact found in Germany that dates back to around 1600 BCE. The stars were notably mentioned in the Bible, the Greek poet Hesiod’s Works and Days, and Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey.\nThe first astronomer to observe the Pleiades through a telescope was Galileo Galilei, who discovered that the cluster contained many other stars too faint to be visible to the naked eye. Galilei published his notes along with a sketch in March 1610.\nIn 1782, the French astronomer Edme-Sébastien Jeaurat drew a map of 64 members of the cluster and published it in 1786.\nIn Japan, the cluster was mentioned as Mutsuraboshi, meaning “six stars,” in the 8th century Kojiki (“An Account of Ancient Matters”). Today, the Japanese know the Pleiades as Subaru. The automobile company Subaru uses an image of the six brightest stars in its logo.\nThe name Alcyone (pronunciation: /ælˈsaɪəniː/) comes from Greek mythology. Alcyone was one of the Pleiades, the seven daughters of the Titan Atlas and the sea-nymph Pleione. The seven sisters were nymphs and companions of the goddess Artemis. Alcyone had three children by Poseidon: Hyrieus, Hyperenor, and Aethusa. The name Alcyone (Greek: Ἁλκυόνη) was derived from the Greek αλκυων (alkyon), meaning “kingfisher.” The Pleiad Alcyone is not to be confused with the Thessalian princess Alcyone, who was transformed into a common kingfisher along with her husband Ceyx after he had died at sea.\nThe name was officially approved for the star by the International Astronomical Union’s (IAU) Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) on June 30, 2016. It formally applies only to the component Eta Tauri A.\nThe Chinese know Alcyone as 昴宿六 (Mǎo Xiù liù), meaning “the Sixth Star of Hairy Head.” Hairy Head is a Chinese asterism consisting of the Pleiades stars Asterope, Atlas, Electra, Maia, Merope, Taygeta, and Alcyone. The asterism is one of the seven mansions of the White Tiger.\nAlcyone is easy to find because it is a member of one of the most recognizable features of the night sky. The Pleiades can be found by following an imaginary line extended from the stars of Orion’s Belt – Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka – but most observers will likely spot the cluster without any help because it is exceptionally large and bright.\nThe cluster is conspicuous in the sky from October to April. It is invisible in May and June, when it is too close to the Sun.\nAlcyone is located in the constellation Taurus. Representing the celestial Bull, Taurus is one of the largest constellations in the sky, covering an area of 797 square degrees. It is best known for its brightest star, Aldebaran, the 14th brightest star in the sky, and the two bright, large open clusters, the Pleiades and the Hyades. Aldebaran marks the Bull’s eye and the V-shaped Hyades cluster outlines its head.\nTaurus is home to several other well-known deep sky objects: the historic supernova remnant Messier 1, also known as the Crab Nebula, the reflection nebula NGC 1555 (Hind’s Variable Nebula), the planetary nebula NGC 1514 (Crystal Ball Nebula), the colliding galaxies NGC 1409 and NGC 1410, and the open clusters NGC 1647 and NGC 1817.\nThe best time of year to observe the stars and deep sky objects of Taurus is during the month of January.\nThe 10 brightest stars in the constellation are Aldebaran (Alpha Tau, mag. 0.86), Elnath (Beta Tau, mag. 1.65), Alcyone (Eta Tau, mag. 2.87), Tianguan (Zeta Tau, mag. 2.97), Chamukuy (Theta2 Tauri, mag. 3.40), Lambda Tauri (mag. 3.47), Ain (Epsilon Tau, mag. 3.53), Omicron Tauri (mag. 3.61), Atlas (27 Tau, mag. 3.63), and Prima Hyadum (Gamma Tau, mag. 3.654).\nAlcyone – Eta Tauri\n|U-B colour index||−0.34|\n|B-V colour index||−0.09|\n|Distance||443.5 light years (136 parsecs)|\n|Parallax||8.09 ± 0.42 mas|\n|Radial velocity||5.40 km/s|\n|Proper motion||RA: 19.34 ± 0.39 mas/yr|\n|Dec.: -43.67 ± 0.33 mas/yr|\n|Mass||5.9 – 6.1 M☉|\n|Radius||9.3 ± 0.7 R☉|\n|Rotational velocity||149 km/s|\n|Surface gravity||3.047 cgs|\n|Right ascension||03h 47m 29.077s|\n|Declination||+24° 06′ 18.49″|\n|Designations||Alcyone, Eta Tauri, η Tau, 25 Tauri, HD 23630, HR 1165, HIP 17702, GC 4541, GCRV 2135, SAO 76199, FK5 139, PPM 92898, BD+23 541, BDS 1875, CCDM 03474+2407, ALS 15094, IRAS 03445+2357, 2MASS J03472908+2406184, TYC 1800-2202-1, WDS J03475+2406A, Gaia DR2 66714384141781760|"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1cd12870-7e5b-4423-8967-ef72999432f9>","<urn:uuid:46409ecf-331a-4c6e-937a-e03df3bca6a9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do communication misunderstandings manifest differently in active listening versus remote asynchronous settings, and what are the mitigation strategies for each?","answer":"In active listening settings, poor listening behaviors include blocking statements like 'you should,' interrupting the speaker, and failing to acknowledge others' messages - for example, responding to 'I'm stressed' with an unrelated comment about keys. These can be mitigated through techniques like using acknowledgment responses, asking nonthreatening questions, and accurately paraphrasing content and feelings. In remote asynchronous settings, misunderstandings often stem from time zone differences and lack of immediate feedback. These can be mitigated through clear communication guidelines, cultural sensitivity training, active listening practices, and leveraging communication tools that provide clear documentation of discussions and decisions. Both contexts require establishing clear expectations and fostering open communication.","context":["Lesson 8: Listening Skills\nBy the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n- Understand the importance of listening\n- Identify ways to demonstrate active listening\nAre you a good listener?\nYou appreciate it when others listen to what you have to say, especially in the workplace. Have you ever wondered if you are a good listener?\n- Talk when others are talking\n- Often have to ask people to repeat themselves\n- Often interrupt others when they're talking\n- Let your feelings for the speaker interfere with your listening ability\n- Jump to conclusions before the speaker is finished talking\nIf you answered \"yes\" to one or more of these questions, you may need to improve your listening skills.\nCharacteristics of poor listeners\nThe following are all examples of poor listening skills.\n- Poor listeners use statements blocking the person speaking from fully explaining his or her point.\nExamples: \"The facts are...\" \"You had better...\" \"You should...\" \"It doesn't really matter...\"\n- Poor listeners interrupt the speaker, use thoughts from what the other person has just said, and express their own thoughts.\nExamples: \"Oh, well, I know. Listen to what happened to me in that situation...\"\n- Poor listeners talk about their thoughts without giving any indication that they heard what another person has said.\nExamples: Speaker: \"I am feeling really overworked and stressed out.\" Listener: \"Have you seen my keys?\"\nWhat is active listening?\nIn the workplace, people don't always say what they mean. Learning to become a better listener can greatly improve workplace communication. Active listening is listening beyond words in order to understand a deeper message. Active listeners are able to detect and reflect the feelings that give emotional energy to language.\nWatch the video below to learn some tips for active listening.\nFollow these tips to become a more active listener:\n- Focus your attention on the speaker and the topic. Find a quiet space where you can avoid distraction.\n- Set aside your own feelings and prejudices. Remind yourself that you're there to be the listener, not offer your opinion.\n- Pay attention to the speaker's body language and facial expressions. This is often the way to sense how someone is really feeling.\n- Use door openers. These statements convey interest and keep the person talking.\nExamples: \"Tell me more...\" \"That sounds interesting...\" \"When did it happen...\"\n- Paraphrase feelings accurately. The listener waits until the speaker pauses, as if expecting some sort of response from the listener. The listener makes a statement labeling the feeling he or she heard.\nExamples: \"You're saying...\" \"You feel that...\" \"If I understand you, you feel this way about this situation...\" \"You say you feel ___________, but you seem ___________ when talking about this...\"\n- Paraphrase content accurately. The listener waits until the speaker has finished speaking and repeats the content of what he or she has heard in his or her own words.\nExamples: \"In other words, it is your decision to...\" \"These seem to be the key ideas you have expressed...\"\n- Ask nonthreatening questions. Keep your questions to a minimum. Give the speaker an opportunity to think about the question before he or she responds. Try asking questions that will help the speaker arrive at his or her own conclusions.\nExamples: \"How?\" \"What?\" \"Could?\" \"Would?\" \"Is?\" \"Are?\" \"Do?\" \"Did?\"\n- Use acknowledgement responses. These statements pull together ideas and facts, as well as establish a basis for further understanding.\nExamples: \"Mmm...\" \"Yes...\" \"Right...\" \"Certainly...\"\nUsing these techniques, the listener feels validated and supported without being judged.\nBody language and listening skills\nGood listening is more than what words you use when listening. Active listeners communicate without interrupting. They use body language to demonstrate their attention and interest.\nWhile listening actively:\n- Occasionally nod your head in agreement with what the speaker is saying.\n- Don't fold your arms. The speaker may interpret it as a sign of negativity or hostility.\n- Make eye contact.\n- Smile encouragingly.\n- Lean forward slightly.\n- Give the speaker personal space.","In the rapidly evolving landscape of remote work, the adoption of asynchronous communication has become increasingly prevalent. As organizations navigate the complexities of distributed teams, embracing asynchronous communication has emerged as a pivotal strategy for fostering productivity and collaboration.\nThe shift towards asynchronous communication presents unique challenges and opportunities that demand a nuanced approach. Understanding the impact, advantages, and effective implementation of asynchronous communication is not only crucial for remote teams but also holds the key to unlocking new levels of efficiency and cohesion within organizations.\n- Asynchronous communication allows team members to work independently and contribute at their own pace.\n- It provides flexibility, efficiency, and better work-life balance, leading to increased job satisfaction.\n- Asynchronous communication reduces the need for lengthy meetings and allows for focused, uninterrupted work, leading to more thorough problem-solving and decision-making processes.\n- To overcome time zone challenges, teams can identify core working hours, utilize shared calendars or scheduling tools, establish clear communication guidelines, encourage flexibility in task prioritization, and ensure project timelines are met while accommodating diverse working hours.\nThe Impact of Asynchronous Communication\nThe impact of asynchronous communication on remote teams' productivity and collaboration has been significant. It allows team members to work independently and contribute at their own pace, resulting in greater flexibility and efficiency. The flexibility offered by asynchronous communication enables team members to manage their work around personal or family commitments, leading to a better work-life balance. This, in turn, can enhance job satisfaction and reduce stress, ultimately contributing to higher productivity levels.\nMoreover, asynchronous communication, by its nature, allows team members to carefully consider their responses and contribute thoughtful, well-considered input.

This not only enhances individual productivity but also allows team members to allocate time to deep, concentrated work, leading to higher quality outputs.\nAdvantages for Remote Teams\nIn the context of remote teams, asynchronous communication offers a myriad of benefits, including increased autonomy and enhanced productivity.\nOne of the significant advantages of asynchronous communication for remote teams is the flexibility it provides. Team members can manage their work schedules more independently, allowing for a better work-life balance. This autonomy leads to increased job satisfaction and can positively impact employee retention.\nAdditionally, asynchronous communication minimizes the need for immediate responses, reducing the interruptions that commonly occur in synchronous communication. This, in turn, enables team members to focus on deep, uninterrupted work, ultimately enhancing productivity.\nMoreover, asynchronous communication allows for the documentation of discussions, decisions, and feedback, creating a valuable knowledge repository for remote teams. This accessibility to information fosters transparency and ensures that all team members are consistently informed, regardless of time zone differences.\nOvercoming Time Zone Challenges\nAsynchronous communication's facilitation of independent work schedules and its reduction of immediate response demands exemplify its potential to address the challenges posed by time zone differences in remote teams. Managing time zones and coordinating remote teams can be complex, but with the right strategies, it is possible to overcome these challenges effectively.\nHere are four key strategies to overcome time zone challenges:\n- Overlap Hours: Identify core working hours that overlap across different time zones to ensure that team members have the opportunity for real-time collaboration and communication.\n- Transparent Scheduling: Utilize shared calendars or scheduling tools to transparently display each team member's working hours and availability, making it easier to coordinate meetings and tasks.\n- Clear Communication Guidelines: Establish clear guidelines for communication expectations, including response times for asynchronous communication, to ensure that team members understand how and when to communicate across time zones.\n- Task Prioritization and Flexibility: Encourage flexibility in task prioritization and deadlines to accommodate the diverse working hours of remote team members while ensuring that project timelines are met.\nStrategies for Effective Collaboration\nEffective collaboration in remote teams hinges on understanding the benefits of real-time versus asynchronous communication and choosing the right tools for the job. By exploring the dynamics of real-time interactions and asynchronous exchanges, teams can optimize their communication strategies to suit their specific needs.\nAdditionally, selecting the most suitable collaboration tools can significantly enhance productivity and cohesiveness within remote teams.\nReal-Time Vs. Async\nWhen considering strategies for effective collaboration, it is essential to carefully evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of real-time and asynchronous communication in remote teams. Both real-time collaboration and asynchronous productivity have their own advantages and limitations, and understanding how to leverage each method can significantly impact team productivity and satisfaction.\nHere are some key considerations for real-time versus asynchronous communication:\n- Synchronous Communication: Real-time collaboration enables immediate feedback and decision-making, fostering rapid problem-solving and team alignment.\n- Asynchronous Communication: Allows for flexibility, deep focus work, and provides time for thoughtful responses, reducing interruptions and multitasking.\n- Balancing Act: Finding the right balance between real-time and asynchronous communication is crucial for maintaining productivity and team morale.\n- Tools and Training: Providing adequate tools and training for both real-time and asynchronous communication is essential for remote teams to thrive.\nCareful consideration of these factors can help remote teams achieve effective collaboration while embracing both real-time and asynchronous communication methods.\nTools for Collaboration\nFinding the right tools for collaboration is essential for facilitating seamless communication and efficient teamwork within remote teams. In the context of remote collaboration and virtual teamwork, it's crucial to leverage tools that enable effective communication, project management, and file sharing.\nPlatforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom are popular choices for real-time messaging, video conferencing, and virtual meetings. Project management tools such as Trello, Asana, and Jira help in organizing tasks, tracking progress, and managing deadlines. Additionally, cloud storage solutions like Google Drive and Dropbox are invaluable for seamless file sharing and version control.\nThese tools not only support effective communication but also foster a sense of connectedness and productivity within remote teams. Selecting the right mix of collaboration tools tailored to the team's specific needs can significantly enhance virtual teamwork and overall productivity.\nTools for Asynchronous Communication\nSeveral digital tools are available to facilitate asynchronous communication within remote teams, allowing for efficient and organized collaboration across different time zones and work schedules. To enhance remote productivity and effective communication, consider utilizing the following tools:\n- Slack: This popular messaging app allows teams to organize conversations into channels, making it easy to categorize discussions by project, team, or topic. With features like threads, file sharing, and integrations with other tools, Slack is an excellent platform for asynchronous communication.\n- Trello: For task management and collaboration, Trello provides a visual way to organize work with boards, lists, and cards. Team members can add comments, attachments, and checklists to keep everyone informed about the progress of tasks, making it a valuable tool for asynchronous project management.\n- Google Workspace: Formerly G Suite, Google Workspace offers a suite of productivity tools including Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. These cloud-based applications enable real-time collaboration and asynchronous editing, allowing team members to work on documents at their convenience.\n- Zoom: While primarily known for video conferencing, Zoom also offers features for asynchronous communication such as chat, file sharing, and the ability to schedule and record meetings. This makes it a versatile tool for both real-time and delayed interactions within remote teams.\nSetting Clear Expectations\nTo ensure effective asynchronous communication in remote teams, setting clear expectations is paramount for fostering understanding and accountability among team members. Setting boundaries and communication guidelines helps establish a framework within which remote teams can operate smoothly. Here's a table illustrating the importance of setting clear expectations:\n|Benefits of Clear Expectations\n|How It Helps Remote Teams\n|Ensures everyone is on the same page and understands their roles and responsibilities\n|Encourages team members to take ownership of their tasks and deadlines\n|Provides a clear framework for communication, leading to fewer errors and conflicts\n|Allows team members to work autonomously with a clear understanding of what is expected\nManaging Workload and Deadlines\nBuilding on the foundation of clear expectations that fosters understanding and accountability within remote teams, effectively managing workload and deadlines is essential for maintaining productivity and ensuring timely project completion.\nTo achieve this, remote team leaders should focus on the following key strategies:\n- Prioritizing Tasks: Encourage team members to prioritize their tasks based on urgency and importance, ensuring that critical deadlines are met without compromising the quality of work.\n- Setting Clear Deadlines: Establish clear and realistic deadlines for deliverables, taking into account the availability and capacity of team members. This helps in aligning everyone's efforts towards a common goal.\n- Regular Check-ins: Schedule regular check-in meetings to review progress, discuss any challenges, and provide support to team members in managing their workload effectively.\n- Flexibility and Adaptability: Foster a culture that allows for flexibility in managing priorities and deadlines, acknowledging that remote work environments may require adjustments based on individual circumstances.\nNurturing a Healthy Work Culture\nNurturing a healthy work culture requires fostering open communication, prioritizing well-being, and cultivating a sense of belonging among remote team members. Building trust is fundamental in creating a positive work environment. It is essential to encourage transparency, honesty, and reliability within the team. This can be achieved by setting clear expectations, delivering on promises, and being open to feedback. Moreover, fostering autonomy among team members promotes a sense of ownership and accountability. Empowering individuals to make decisions and take ownership of their work not only boosts morale but also enhances productivity.\n|Key Elements of Nurturing a Healthy Work Culture\nCreating a culture of open communication involves actively listening to team members, providing avenues for sharing ideas, and ensuring that everyone's voice is heard. Additionally, prioritizing well-being involves promoting work-life balance, providing resources for mental and physical health, and acknowledging the individual needs of team members. Cultivating a sense of belonging can be achieved through team-building activities, recognizing achievements, and creating a supportive and inclusive environment.\nMitigating Communication Misunderstandings\nFostering a culture of open communication and trust within a remote team is essential for mitigating communication misunderstandings and ensuring effective collaboration. Preventing miscommunication is crucial in remote teams, where interactions primarily occur through written messages. To mitigate communication misunderstandings, remote teams should consider the following:\n- Clear Communication Guidelines: Establishing clear guidelines for communication helps team members understand the expectations around response times, preferred communication channels, and language etiquette.\n- Cultural Sensitivity Training: Providing cultural sensitivity training can help team members understand and navigate cultural differences in communication. This training can include awareness of non-verbal cues, language nuances, and differing communication styles.\n- Active Listening Practices: Encouraging active listening within the team can help prevent misunderstandings by ensuring that team members are fully engaged in understanding each other's perspectives before responding.\n- Utilize Communication Tools: Leveraging communication tools that support asynchronous communication, such as project management platforms and collaborative documents, can provide a clear record of discussions and decisions, reducing the likelihood of misinterpretation.\nAdapting to Asynchronous Workflows\nWhen adapting to asynchronous workflows, remote teams must carefully consider time zone variations to ensure effective communication and collaboration.\nClear communication expectations are essential in mitigating misunderstandings and ensuring that everyone is on the same page when working asynchronously.\nTime Zone Considerations\nAdapting to asynchronous workflows in remote teams requires thoughtful consideration of time zone differences to ensure effective communication and collaboration. Managing time zone variances and accommodating flexible schedules are crucial for maintaining productivity and fostering a cohesive team environment.\nHere are key considerations for navigating time zone variances:\n- Overlap Hours: Identify core hours when all team members are expected to be available for real-time communication.\n- Transparent Scheduling: Encourage team members to share their working hours and availability, promoting visibility and understanding across time zones.\n- Flexibility: Emphasize flexibility in meeting times and deadlines, allowing individuals to work during their most productive hours.\n- Communication Tools: Leverage asynchronous communication tools for sharing updates, insights, and decisions to bridge time zone gaps effectively.\nClear Communication Expectations\nTo ensure effective adaptation to asynchronous workflows, establishing clear communication expectations is paramount for remote teams.\nSetting boundaries and managing accountability are essential components of this process. Clear communication expectations involve defining response times for messages, outlining the preferred communication channels for different types of communication, and setting guidelines for sharing updates and progress reports.\nBy setting boundaries, team members can understand when they are expected to be available and responsive, helping to create a more structured and organized work environment.\nAdditionally, managing accountability through clear communication expectations ensures that team members understand their responsibilities, deadlines, and the consequences of not meeting expectations. This creates a sense of ownership and responsibility within the team, leading to improved productivity and overall success in asynchronous workflows.\nIn conclusion, embracing asynchronous communication in remote teams offers numerous advantages, such as increased flexibility and productivity.\nHowever, it also presents challenges, such as managing workload and nurturing a healthy work culture.\nBy utilizing effective strategies and communication tools, remote teams can successfully adapt to asynchronous workflows and mitigate misunderstandings.\nIt is through these efforts that remote teams can foster a sense of connectedness and collaboration, despite the physical distance, ultimately leading to greater success and satisfaction."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b4d95289-6c68-4f78-a17a-a0b02d35c0b5>","<urn:uuid:f2f591e5-2339-4119-9e52-44523d6c7e68>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Cuál era el objetivo principal de la historia de Abraham en el Corán?","answer":"In the Quran, the main focus was on Abraham's role in introducing monotheistic concepts to local residents, with the text showing no interest in cutting Abraham off from his family and neighbors.","context":["ご無沙汰しております。It’s been a while since my last post. In fact, if I wait two more days, it will have been two full years. I’m sorry for the long hiatus. Let’s just get right back to it.\nUpdate (Jan 6, 2017): I found the author’s English article and abstract, which I somehow missed earlier. I have added this below. Note, however, that I have kept my own translations elsewhere, especially in the outline.\nAbstract: The Hebrew Bible does not describe how Abraham, the common patriarch of the three monotheistic faiths, came to know the one God. However, literature from the Second Temple period, texts of Rabbinic Judaism, targumim (Aramaic translations of the Hebrew Bible), the Quran, and other documents abound with narratives based on a common plot that recount how Abraham came to know the one God, confronted the idolatry that had continued until the generation of his father, and broke down the practice through various schemes. This paper presents translations of passages taken from the Book of Jubilees, the Apocalypse of Abraham, Genesis Rabba, Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, and the Quran that relate the tradition of “Abraham the iconoclast,” believed to have been highly popular at the time of the writing of the respective texts. The passages are then analyzed to extract a common plot, identify different focal points, and compare in terms of Abraham’s relationship with his father, Terah. From this comparative reading, the following observations can be made: the focus is placed on the importance of knowing one God in the Book of Jubilees, and on confrontation with idolatry in the Apocalypse of Abraham; various narrative components appear evenly with similar frequency in Genesis Rabba and Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, possibly to maintain conformity as exegeses; in the Quran, the focus is on Abraham’s role of introducing the monotheistic notion to local residents.

This simply an overview, not an attempt to reproduce the author’s argument in full.\n「偶像を打破するアブラハム : 第二神殿時代文学・ラビ・ユダヤ教文献・クルアーンでの解釈の変遷」 (Abraham the Idol-Breaker: Developments in Interpretation in Second Temple Literature, Rabbinic Literature, and the Quran)\n1. Introduction・序 (38–41)\n- Katsumata briefly explains Abraham’s significance within each of the big three monotheistic religions, namely, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, as well as Abraham’s role in much inter-religious dialogue. (38–39)\n- The author briefly introduces Second Temple, Rabbinic, and Islamic traditions that developed concerning Abraham’s life before he sets out from Ur. These traditions are in stark contrast to the narrative in Genesis, which is completely silent about this period in Abraham’s life (the author notes, too, that we find relatively few references to these traditions in early Christian interpretation). (39)\n- The author argues that this study is necessary because, as a collection, these texts have received little scholarly attention in the past; and because they are largely inaccessible in Japanese translation, and thus largely unknown in Japan (mostly because these traditions do not appear in the New Testament or in many early Christian texts). (39–40)\n- The author aims:\n- to translate and introduce important texts about “Abraham the idol-breaker”\n- to analyze the major characteristics of the tradition(s) in each text\n- to learn about these rich traditions behind the biblical story\n- to recognize the shared significance of these traditions among different religious traditions\n- to achieve a better understanding of the various settings (religious and otherwise) of these texts through understanding how they were received within each tradition. (40)\n- The author concludes the introduction with a brief introduction of each primary text. (40–41)\n2. Text Translations and Compositional Elements・テキスト訳出と構成要素 (41–54)\n- Katsumata briefly explains her grouping of the texts into two time periods.\n- Katsumata has based her Japanese translations on the original Hebrew and Aramaic texts for texts which appear in those languages, and on English versions of the rest, except for the Quran, which she quotes from a Japanese translation by Toshihiko Izutsu. (Note: this may need some correction due to a possible typo in the lines explaining her sources.) (41)\nCompositional Elements・構成要素 (42–43)\nIn this section, Katsumata introduces five elements – these might be viewed as motifs, or scenes – including three variations each for B and D.\nA.

Etc.\nApocalypse of Abraham『アブラハムの黙示録』(55–56)\nAbove all, this text is chiefly interested in battling idolatry. Etc.\nGenesis Rabbah 38:13『創世記ラッバ38・13』(56)\nMore than anything else, this text appears to be interested in explaining why Haran died before his father, both in terms of time and space (i.e., “before the face of [in the presence of] Terah”; Gen 11:28). Etc.\nThis text is also concerned with explaining Gen 11:28, though Haran’s wickedness receives more emphasis here. Etc.\nThis text is especially interested in Abraham’s campaign against idolatry and his discovery of the one and only God (note that the Quran contains several other passages recounting Abraham’s opposition to idol worship). Etc.\nKatsumata concludes this section by drawing several parallels and contrasts among the various texts.\n4. Distinguishing the Traditions by Focusing on the Relationship to Father Terah and Brother Haran・伝承群の区別: 父テラ・兄ハランとの関係を中心として (57–58)\nIn this section, the author argues that the best way to distinguish the traditions from one another is to consider Abraham’s attitude, and the attitude of each “transmitter” (伝承者) or narrator (語り手), towards Terah and Haran. This is connected to their interpretation of why Abraham left home in Genesis 12.\nThe Book of Jubilees emphasizes the foolishness of idolatry without depicting any significant breach in the relationship between Abraham and his ancestors.\nThe Apocalypse of Abraham depicts a degree of warmth in Abraham’s treatment of Terah, even as Abraham points out the foolishness of his father’s idolatry. Therefore, it requires outside forces (fire from heaven) to help Abraham make a clean break from his father.\nIn Genesis Rabbah and Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, Abraham shows no affection for his father, and his brother is depicted as a wicked man. While these texts were composed chiefly to explain Gen 11:28 (see above), they effectively drive a deep wedge between Abraham and his earthly relations up this point.\nThe Quran shows no interest in cutting Abraham off from his family and neighbors. Rather, its chief interest lies in introducing monotheistic concepts.\nHere are some of the author’s main conclusions (in heavily abbreviated form):\n- Whereas the Book of Jubilees emphasizes monotheistic ideas, the Apocalypse of Abraham emphasizes putting an end to idol worship. Idolatry must have been a serious problem in the time and place in which the latter text was composed.\n- The texts depict Abraham’s relationship to Terah in various ways and for various purposes (see section 4, above).\n- Apart from their primary concern to explain Gen 11:28, Genesis Rabbah and Targum Pseudo-Jonathan appear to castigate idolators more than the practice of idolatry itself (e.g., by identifying Abraham’s father and brother with Nimrod).\n- The Quran’s use of this tradition reflects how Muslims were to dwell among idolators and direct them towards monotheistic faith.\nKatsumata closes the article by expressing her desire to achieve a more complex (in the sense of composite) understanding of monotheism by extending her research to see how Abraham’s smashing of idolatry has been received by Church Fathers and other Christian thinkers.

{"question":"What are the key differences between sequence expressions in F# and traversable operations in parallel strategies, and how do they handle collection processing?","answer":"F# sequence expressions use 'yield' keywords to create collections, with 'yield' returning a value as part of the collection and 'yield!' allowing addition of sequence elements, particularly useful in recursive expressions like flattening WPF control trees. In contrast, parallel strategies offer traversable operations through parTraverse, which works on any Traversable type and evaluates elements either in parallel or sequence using supplied strategies. While F# sequence workflows focus on collection creation and transformation through yielding mechanisms, parallel strategies emphasize control over evaluation order and parallelization of collection processing while maintaining deterministic results.","context":["Beyond Foundations of F# - Workflows\nF# is a statically typed functional programming language that targets the .NET framework. It shares a common core language with OCaml, another popular functional programming language, and draws ideas from many other programming languages, including Haskell, Erlang, and C#. In a nutshell this means that F# is a programming language that has a nice succinct syntax that feels a bit like scripting as we are able to execute the code interactively but F# has all the type safety and performance of a compiled language. This article is not indented to be an introduction to F# as there are already many resources on the web intended to make learning F# easy. See the side bar \"F# Resources\" in my previous article on F#.\nCreating a WorkflowWorkflows are composed of two parts; the code the users defines which makes up the instances of the workflow and the library component that defines what the workflow does. Let's take a look at very simple example of a workflow:\nHere we see a \"script\" workflow is bound to the identifier \"num\". The workflow is made up of an F# expression surrounded by curly braces and prefixed by the identifier \"script\" which lets one know what the workflow actually does. Now let's take a look at the library infrastructure required to make this script work:\nThis is quite a bit of code. Let's break it down piece by piece and look at how each of these pieces works with our original script. The first type definition defines the type for our script. In this case a script is a function that will yield a value. The script \"num\" we defined earlier has the type Script\nThe next major part of the library components is the ScriptBuilder class. This defines the methods that will be used handle the various expressions that make up our script. The various parts of the expressions will be handed to the methods as values. Here the \"Return\" and \"Let\" methods handle the let and return bindings in the script. The more interesting of these is the let binding. In the let binding the \"printfn\" function is used to print out the value of the parameter - meaning that as the script executes the values within the let bindings are printed to the console. The idea being that this is a very useful aid for debugging. Finally, the last item shows instancing of the ScriptBuilder class. It is in this instance \"script\" is used within the \"num\" workflow. So when \"num\" script is executed:\nthe following is output to the console:\nval it : int = 42\nThe first two values are the values of the let bindings being printed out and the final values F# interactive automatically printed out the function result along with its type.\nIn workflows it is not only possible to handle normal F# expressions such as let, as shown earlier, but also new expressions such as \"let!\" (pronounced let bang) and \"yield\" along with several others. This provides the real power of workflows, allowing library implementers to take these keywords and give new meanings to them.\nNow we will extend the example to include the \"let!\" binding expressions too. Supposing that we do not want every let binding to be printed to the console, we may just want key bindings to be printed out, implementing the \"let!\" provides a convenient way to allow programmers to choose which bindings to print. This is implemented by the addition of the following method to the \"ScriptBuilder\" class, to handle the let! binding:\nWe also need to make a small alteration to the \"Let\", to remove printing to the console:\nSo now when we define and run a script we can use the let! binding to print certain let bindings to the console:\nNow only 21 will be printed to the console:\nval it : int = 42\nHow does the F# compiler do the translation between the workflow and the final expression executed? This process is called \"de-sugaring\" and will dig into how it works in the next section.\nThe expressions in a workflow are transformed into a data structure that uses \"continuation passing style\", this process is known as de-sugaring, as the workflow is really just \"syntactic sugar\".\nA good place start understanding this is by coming back to our simple example:\nis translated into:\nThe advantage of not having to type out this structure by hand is obvious. The \"sugared\" version is shorter and much easier to understand and typing out the non-sugared version would be both difficult and error prone. The advantages of having an expression in this form, rather than just an ordinary expression, are slightly more subtle. The important point to notice is the Bind and Let methods being called. These methods are called with the parameter to the let binding as the first parameter and a continuation - a function waiting for the value - as the second. It is this that allows us to do the trick of printing out the parameter \"p\" and then passing it to the \"rest\" function to continue the computation, seen here in the definition of the \"Bind\" method:\nprintfn \"%A\" p\nThis is the very heart of workflows in F#. The continuation style passing allows developers to insert extra actions when a value is being bound. In our example these actions are somewhat trivial, but these actions can be as involved as waiting for an asynchronous computation to complete and then continuing with the action - as we will see in the next article in this series which looks at asynchronous workflows.\nSo far our little debug script may have looked like quite an unimpressive use of workflows. Let's now dig into a more realistic example using sequence workflows. Sequence workflows are a type of workflow that is available as part of the F# base class libraries. Sequence expressions are useful to create collections. For example, the following sequence expression creates a list of the first three square numbers and there square roots:\nOne of the most useful features of the sequence expressions are their use of the yield keyword, which is used to return a value that is part of the collection then carry on the computation. For example, the following code reads a text file yielding each line to produce a sequence of the lines of the text file:\nIt is also possible to use the yield!, (pronounced yield bang), keyword in sequence expressions. This allows you to add a sequence of elements to the collection and so it is often used in recursive sequence expressions. The following shows how to use a recursive sequence expression to flatten a tree of WPF controls into a sequence. This is very useful if you want to apply some operation to every item in the control tree:\nWe see that on the first line of the sequence expression we yield the first item we are given into the collection. Then, in the second half of the sequence expression we use a for loop to enumerate each of the control's child and recursively call \"treetoList\" on them. The sequence that this returns is then placed into the collection using the yield! keyword, thus flattening the tree to a list.\nTo see this sequence expression in action you need to use the following code to create a WPF window:\nWorkflows are covered in detail in chapter 9 of \"Expert F#\" by Don Syme, Adam Granicz, and Antonio Cisternino.\nWorkflows are a powerful technique that allows library designers to create libraries that have a huge amount of flexibility. Not all F# programmers will use workflows to create their own DSLs, but it is highly likely that F# programmer will use libraries written using workflows at some point, the sequence workflow are too useful to miss out on. In the next article in this series well take a look at asynchronous workflows, another innovative use of workflows that simplifies using the .NET asynchronous programming model.","Parallel Evaluation Strategies, or Strategies for short, specify a way to evaluate a structure with components in sequence or in parallel.\nStrategies are for expressing deterministic parallelism: the result of the program is unaffected by evaluating in parallel. For non-deterministic parallel programming, see Control.Concurrent.\nStrategies let you separate the description of parallelism from the logic of your program, enabling modular parallelism.\nThe original Strategies design is described in http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~dsg/gph/papers/html/Strategies/strategies.html and the code was written by Phil Trinder, Hans-Wolfgang Loidl, Kevin Hammond et al.\nLater, during work on the shared-memory implementation of parallelism in GHC, we discovered that the original formulation of Strategies had some problems, in particular it lead to space leaks and difficulties expressing speculative parallelism. Details are in the paper \"Runtime Support for Multicore Haskell\" http://www.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/multicore-ghc.pdf.\nThis module has been rewritten in version 2. The main change is to\nthe 'Strategy a' type synonym, which was previously\na -> Done and\na -> Eval a. This change helps to fix the space leak described\nin \"Runtime Support for Multicore Haskell\". The problem is that\nthe runtime will currently retain the memory referenced by all\nsparks, until they are evaluated. Hence, we must arrange to\nevaluate all the sparks eventually, just in case they aren't\nevaluated in parallel, so that they don't cause a space leak. This\nis why we must return a \"new\" value after applying a\nso that the application can evaluate each spark created by the\nThe simple rule is this: you must use the result of applying\nStrategy if the strategy creates parallel sparks, and you\nshould probably discard the the original value. If you don't\ndo this, currently it may result in a space leak. In the\nfuture (GHC 6.14), it will probably result in lost parallelism\ninstead, as we plan to change GHC so that unreferenced sparks\nare discarded rather than retained (we can't make this change\nuntil most code is switched over to this new version of\nStrategies, because code using the old verison of Strategies\nwould be broken by the change in policy).\nThe other changes in version 2.x are:\n- Strategies can now be defined using a convenient Monad/Applicative\nparList s = traverse (Par .

{"question":"What is the role of community in supporting individuals with learning disabilities, and what specific learning challenges do these individuals typically face?","answer":"Community plays a vital role for individuals with learning disabilities by providing dignity, choice, and opportunities for both giving and receiving. These individuals need friends outside their families and workplaces, and through programs like Spred, they can be integrated into faith communities where they experience love, trust, and authentic relationships. Regarding specific learning challenges, these individuals typically face difficulties in four main processing areas: Input (problems with visual or auditory perception), Organization (difficulties with sequencing and organizing materials), Memory (struggles with working, short-term, and long-term memory), and Output (challenges with language expression or motor skills). Common symptoms include short attention span, poor memory, difficulty following directions, problems with eye-hand coordination, and difficulties with sequencing and organization.","context":["S.P.R.E.D. – Special Religious Development.\ne were born into the community of a family and extended family. We depended on this community for the fulfilment of all our needs, physical, emotional, social, moral, economic, and religious. Our community of family went a long way towards making us who we are. When we grow up we can move away from home, get a job, set up a home; in other words become independent. Our friends with learning difficulties do not have these options in the same way. They really do need a community that will allow them to be individuals who have dignity, choice,and a sense of giving as well as receiving, a sense of being part of a community. They need friends outside their families and work places. The first community we experience outside the family is that of the Christian community when we are brought to church to receive the Sacrament of Baptism.\nEach Baptised person is welcomed into the community of the parish and is given the opportunity to develop his/her faith, initially by receiving the sacraments and then by ongoing attendance at the Eucharist and other liturgical events. Our aim in Spred is to integrate our friends into the liturgical life of the parish. Our faith is our greatest gift from God. Our friends have as much right as we have to grow in their faith. We, in Spred, can give them a chance to experience the spiritual in life, also a chance to grow in the faith that they received in seed at baptism. Faith education is only possible if our friends feel they are loved. We are opening a door that allows our friends to appreciate who God is for them. Often it is our friends who opens the door for us. It is by giving to those who have learning difficulties that we not only receive but also enable them to give. Then, their joy, simplicity, and honesty, for example, may be seen and experienced by others. Others are consequently modified by being with them. With them we can be weak and receive of their strengths, of their love for us, of their trust, of their approval, if we give them time and space to be with us.\nSpred is all about friendship. We are referred to as volunteers while we ourselves are known as faith companions because that is our role- to be a companion in faith to our faith friends. We all need friends outside of our family. We all need community. It takes time to build up this bond of friendship. We realise to be a faith companion we need to accept one another as we are, to be loving, sincere, honest, genuine, compassionate, kind and authentic. Our friends can easily discern if we are lacking in these attributes. We respect one another and this can be seen in the way we relate to one another. We are sharing our faith. We are faithful companions on a journey with our friends. The depth of our bonding as a small faith community is a symbol of the depth of God’s love for us. Through Spred our friends can experience the Church as a group of believers who come together to share life.\nA Christian community, is the web of relationships that provides the sacred, safe space where all members can discover and develop their uniqueness, their giftedness. It is the locus where God, acting through others, removes the scales from our eyes so that we can discover God’s presence in every respect and dimension of our lives. Through this process, we become seers of God in everything and in everyone and this vision impels us to go out of ourselves to serve others. We often forget that the English word ‘church’ translates the Greek word’ ekkl-sia’, which designates a gathering of people. A great metaphor for community is given to us by St. Paul in his first letter to the Corinthians (12:12-27). Paul uses the image of the human body to explain Christ’s relationship with believers. Paul explains the need for diversity of function among the parts of a body without threat to its unity. Community is not just ‘a place’; it is a living organism, dynamic, alive, and always changing, just like a family. In a healthy family system, the role of each member is not defined by his or her level of productivity, but by the love that is given and received.\nJesus teaches us clearly that God calls us, not just as individuals, but as a community and that how we relate to each other is just as important religiously as how we relate to God. Or, more accurately, how we relate to each other is part of how we relate to God. For Jesus, the two great commandments, to love God and love neighbour, can never be separated. In Spred we have a wonderful opportunity to reflect on some aspect of our lives each week. We also read a small section from God’s Holy Book. In Spred we share our own experiences of our daily lives. They may be little happenings that have stayed deep within us. Meaning is derived from the shared experience. The event, the experience, can be entered into time and time again. The re- telling of the story, its re-enactment, can put us in touch with the primary experience. In the theology of Karl Rahner, “God is experienced in the ‘mysticism of everyday things – not in the distilled essence of things, not the highest abstractions from the world but the experience of God’s life at the very heart of the world, in flesh, in time and in history. Presence to self, presence to the world, and presence to God are all aspects of one and the same experience, the experience of God’s real presence in the world which he created to be his real symbol”.*\nSpred companions and friends grow in faith through the process known as symbolic catechesis or the method Vivre. This process is to interpret life situations within a group, through the process of evocation, in faith, in the light of the Word, moving toward communion and witness. We recognize the gift of each other; that each of us is a gift to the other. Like any gift, none of us is perfectly wrapped – we all have our faults, failings and problems, but we are happy to be a gift to another who accepts us as we are. It is only by giving that you are able to receive more than you have already.\nWe have all come to be companions for different reason, many and varied, but at the heart of these surely must be the willingness and urge to share the gift of faith that we have by which we live our lives. All faith companions come with a wish to help, encourage, and share what they had experienced on their faith journey with others. All companions can speak of the gifts they have received on that journey and want others to be able to experience the same. Faith companions tell of how much they get from their faith friends and the other group members; about the gifts they receive which they never expected; and how they all hope that the giving and receiving of all these amazing , wonderful gifts will just go on. This experience is also felt by the families of the faith friends and their own families and the wider community because the community of Spred have become more loving people or as Pope Francis said – we are part of the ‘Revolution of Tenderness’.\nReferences: *The Achievement of Karl Rahner; W.

Gonzalez. 2009.","Specific learning disability means a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or written, which may manifest itself in an imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, or to do mathematical calculations. The term includes such conditions as perceptual handicaps, brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction, dyslexia, and developmental aphasia. The term does not include children who have problems that are primarily the result of visual, hearing, or motor disabilities, or mental retardation, emotional disturbance, or of environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage.\nThe types of LD are identified by the specific processing problem. They might relate to getting information into the brain (Input), making sense of this information (Organization), storing and later retrieving this information (Memory), or getting this information back out (Output). Thus, the specific types of processing problems that result in LD might be in one or more of these four areas.\nInformation is primarily brought into the brain through the eyes (visual perception) and ears (auditory perception). An individual might have difficulty in one or both areas.\nAuditory Perception. (Also called Receptive Language) The individual might have difficulty distinguishing subtle differences in sound (called phonemes) or might have difficulty distinguishing individual phonemes as quickly as normal. Either problem can result in difficulty processing and understanding what is said. Individuals might have difficulty with what is called auditory figure-ground. They have difficulty identifying what sound(s) to listen to when there is more than one sound.\nVisual Perception. One might have difficulty distinguishing subtle differences in shapes (called graphemes). They might rotate or reverse letters or numbers (d, b, p, q, 6, 9); thus misreading the symbol. Some might have a figure-ground problem, confusing what figure(s) to focus on from the page covered with many words and lines. They might skip words, skip lines, or read the same line twice. Others might have difficulty blending information from both eyes to have depth perception. They might misjudge depth or distance, bumping into things or having difficulty with tasks where this information is needed to tell the hands or body what to do. If there is difficulty with visual perception, there could be problems with tasks that require eye-hand coordination (visual motor skills) such as catching a ball, doing a puzzle, or picking up a glass.\nOnce information is recorded in the brain (input), three tasks must be carried out in order to make sense or integrate this information. First, the information must be placed in the right order or sequenced. Then, the information must be understood beyond the literal meaning, abstraction. Finally, each unit of information must be integrated into complete thoughts or concepts, organization.\nSequencing. The individual might have difficulty learning information in the proper sequence. Thus, he might get math sequences wrong, have difficulty remembering sequences such as the months of the year, the alphabet, or the times table. Or, she might write a report with all of the important facts but not in the proper order.\nAbstraction. A person might have difficulty inferring the meaning of individual words or concepts. Jokes, idioms, or puns are often not understood. He might have problems with words that might have different meanings depending on how they are used. For example, \"the dog\" refers to a pet. \"You dog\" is an insult.\nOrganization. An individual might have difficulty organizing materials, losing, forgetting, or misplacing papers, notebooks, or homework assignments. She might have difficulty organizing her environment, such as her bedroom. Some might have problems organizing time. They have difficulty with projects due at a certain time or with being on time. (Organization over time is referred to as Executive Function.)\nThree types of memory are important to learning. \"Working memory\" refers to the ability to hold on to pieces of information until the pieces blend into a full thought or concept. For example, reading each word until the end of a sentence or paragraph and then understanding the full content. \"Short-term memory\" is the active process of storing and retaining information for a limited period of time. The information is temporarily available but not yet stored for long-term retention. \"Long-term memory\" refers to information that has been stored and that is available over a long period of time. Individuals might have difficulty with auditory memory or visual memory.\nOne reads a sentence and hold on to it. Then the next and the next. By the end of the paragraph, he pulls together the meaning of the full paragraph. This is working memory. He continues to read the full chapter and study it. Information is retained long enough to take a test and do well. This is short-term memory. But, unless the information is reviewed and studied over a longer period of time, it is not retained. With more effort over time, the information might become part of a general body of knowledge. It is long-term memory.\nInformation is communicated by means of words (language output) or though muscle activity such as writing, drawing, gesturing (motor output). An individual might have a language disability (also called expressive language disability) or a motor disability.\nLanguage Disability. It is possible to think of language output as being spontaneous or on demand. Spontaneous means that the person initiates the conversation. Thoughts have been organized and words found before speaking. Demand language means that one is asked a question or asked to explain something. Now, she must organize his thoughts, find the right words, and speak at the same time. Most people with a language disability have little difficulty with spontaneous language. However, in a demand situation, the same person might struggle to organize her thoughts or to find the right words.\nMotor Disability. One might have difficulty coordinating teams of small muscles, called a fine motor disability. He might have problems with coloring, cutting, writing, buttoning, or tying shoes. Others might have difficulty coordinating teams of large muscles, called a gross motor disability. She is awkward when running or jumping.\nEach individual will have his or her unique pattern of LD. This pattern might cluster around specific common difficulties. For example, the pattern might primarily reflect a problem with language processing: auditory perception, auditory sequencing/abstraction/organization, auditory memory, and a language disability. Or the problem might be more in the visual input to motor output areas. Some people with LD will have a mixture of both.\nSymptoms of Learning Disabilities\nThe symptoms of learning disabilities are a diverse set of characteristics which affect development and achievement. Some of these symptoms can be found in all children at some time during their development. However, a person with learning disabilities has a cluster of these symptoms which do not disappear as s/he grows older.\nMost frequently displayed symptoms:\n- Short attention span\n- Poor memory\n- Difficulty following directions\n- Inability to discriminate between/among letters, numerals, or sounds\n- Poor reading and/or writing ability\n- Eye-hand coordination problems; poorly coordinated\n- Difficulties with sequencing\n- Disorganization and other sensory difficulties\nOther characteristics that may be present:\n- Performs differently from day to day\n- Responds inappropriately in many instances· Distractible, restless, impulsive\n- Says one thing, means another\n- Difficult to discipline\n- Doesn't adjust well to change\n- Difficulty listening and remembering\n- Difficulty telling time and knowing right from left\n- Difficulty sounding out words\n- Reverses letters\n- Places letters in incorrect sequence\n- Difficulty understanding words or concepts\n- Delayed speech development; immature speech"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7b83812e-f8e5-44c6-b657-041babb42a04>","<urn:uuid:e1b7bc04-72bd-406b-9644-d678fa782a79>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you explain difference in how telescopes like Subaru and future missions (SIM, GAIA) might detect gravitational lensing from rotating vs non-rotating black holes? Looking por la diferencia en sensibilidad.","answer":"The Subaru Telescope with its High Dispersion Spectrograph can detect basic gravitational lensing effects and outflows through multiple sight lines, as demonstrated with the quasar SDSS J1029+2623. However, detecting the specific differences between Kerr and Schwarzschild lensing would be extremely challenging even for future missions like SIM, GAIA or JASMINE. This is because the nonlinear gravitational lensing effects that distinguish rotating from non-rotating black holes are extremely small - on the order of 10^-16 for even a supermassive black hole like the one in our galactic center. These effects, while theoretically observable through changes in image positions and light curves, are too small to detect with near-future observational capabilities.","context":["3-D Observations of the Outflow from an Active Galactic Nucleus\nFebruary 18, 2013\nA Japanese team of astronomers, led by Toru Misawa (Shinshu University), has used the Subaru Telescope to observe a distant gravitationally-lensed quasar (Note 1) and probed an active galactic nucleus in its central region. Looking through multiple sight lines, the astronomers obtained a 3-D view of the quasar and discovered complex small structures inside outflows from the galactic nucleus. These outflows will spread widely and eventually affect the evolution of the host galaxy.\nQuasars are bright central regions of some distant galaxies. Their luminosities are often hundreds of times greater than those of their host galaxies (Note 2). Scientists believe that their light source is a very bright gaseous disk surrounding a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. Gas streams called \"outflows\" move outward from the disk (Figure 1) and have a substantial influence on surrounding interstellar/intergalactic regions. However, because quasars at large distances look like mere stars, their internal structures are not easy to investigate.\nThe current team used the large light-gathering power of the 8.2 m Subaru Telescope mounted with its high-resolution spectrograph HDS (High Dispersion Spectrograph) to observe the quasar SDSS J1029+2623 (from now on referred to as \"J 1029\") and examine its structure. This quasar is ~10 billion light years distant from Earth (Note 1) toward the constellation Leo, and a massive cluster of galaxies, ~5 billion light years away, lies between the quasar and Earth (Figure 2). Because astronomical objects are usually very distant, they are difficult to study from different angles. Nevertheless, gravitational lensing opens up this possibility. If a cluster of galaxies lies along the line of sight to a distant quasar, then part of the light from the distant quasar (the \"lensed quasar\") bends around the intervening cluster (the \"lensing cluster\"), and observers will see more highly resolved and brighter images of the now magnified background quasar. Due to the gravitational lensing by the cluster intervening between J 1029 and Earth, there is significant distortion in the light path from the quasar, and it splits into three images: A, B, and C (Figure 3, Note 3). The maximum separation angle, ~22\".5 (Note 4), between images A and B is a current record; it is larger than the typical separation of quasar images lensed by a single galaxy. The team hypothesized that each lensed image could contain information on the outflow from the quasar when viewed from different angles (Figures 1 and 2).\nThe team used Subaru Telescope's HDS to perform spectroscopic observations of the brightest two images A and B (Note 5), and their results supported their hypothesis. Any absorber between the quasar and Earth provides absorption features in the spectra of the quasar images. While most absorption features originate from foreground objects that are physically unrelated to the quasar, some show clear evidence of origins from the outflow, such as partial coverage by clouds (Note 6). Those features show a clear difference between the images A and B, although they are generally similar (Figure 4). This result supports the idea that the sight lines are going through different areas of the outflow from different directions. When viewed through one eye alone, an object appears to be two-dimensional, but viewing with both eyes yields a 3-D image that provides multi-directional information. This process is analogous to what occurred in the observations (Figure 2, Note 7).\nIt is surprising that the absorption profiles arising in the outflow show clear differences between them, despite the small separation angle of ~22\".5. Misawa commented on this discovery saying, \"The outflow may not necessarily be homogeneous, but could instead have a complex internal structure with a number of clumpy gas clouds like cirrocumulus clouds in Earth's atmosphere. The team plans to observe the area in image C in more detail.\" Direct observation of a clumpy structure in tandem with theoretical analysis will contribute to revealing the mysterious formation history of these outflows.\nThe team has also explored other explanations for the outflows. Because the light paths of the images A and B are different, they have a substantial time difference between them when they reach Earth (Note 8). If the internal structure of the outflow varies with time, the two images deliver information about different epochs even if they pass through the same region of the outflow. The astronomers intend to conduct observations with the Subaru Telescope in March, 2013 to test the \"time-variation\" scenario.\nThe research paper on which this release is based was published on-line in the January 15, 2013 edition of The Astronomical Journal: T. Misawa et al., \"Spectroscopy along Multiple, Lensed Sight Lines through Outflowing Winds in the Quasar SDSS J1029+2623\", vol. 145, issue 2, article id. 48 (2013).

A \"z\" or redshift value measures how much the expansion of space has stretched the light from an object. Generally, the greater the observed z value for a galaxy, the more distant it is in time and space from Earth.\n- Because their appearance is star-like, they are called \"quasi-stellar objects\" and abbreviated as quasars.\n- An international team led by Naohisa Inada and Masamune Oguri (both are members of the current research team) discovered the first quasar (SDSS J1004+4112) that is lensed by a cluster of galaxies (http://www.sdss.org/news/releases/20031217.lensing.html). Only three quasars that are lensed by a cluster of galaxies have been discovered so far (SDSS J1004+4112, SDSS J1029+2623, and SDSS J2222+2745). Among them, SDSS J1029+2623 has the largest separation angle.\n- 1 arcsec (1\") is a unit of angle, defined as 1/3600 of 1 degree. Human eyes cannot distinguish such a small angle.\n- The observed flux ratio of the three lensed images is A:B:C ~ 0.95:1.00:0.24.\n- This means that an absorber only partially covers the background light source toward the sight line. Because foreground interstellar or intergalactic media are larger than the light source of the quasar by more than several orders, only small gas clouds in the vicinity of the quasar can reproduce a partial coverage.\n- Similar observation has been also performed for the other lensed quasar DSS J1004+4112 (Green, P. 2006, the Astrophysical Journal, vol. 644, pp.733-741).\n- The image A leads the image B by 744 days (Fohlmeister, J. et al., 2013, The Astrophysical Journal, vol. 764, 186).","Separability of Rotational Effects on a Gravitational Lens\nWe derive the deflection angle up to due to a Kerr gravitational lens with mass and specific angular momentum . It is known that at the linear order in and the Kerr lens is observationally equivalent to the Schwarzschild one because of the invariance under the global translation of the center of the lens mass. We show, however, nonlinear couplings break the degeneracy so that the rotational effect becomes in principle separable for multiple images of a single source. Furthermore, it is distinguishable also for each image of an extended source and/or a point source in orbital motion. In practice, the correction at becomes for the supermassive black hole in our galactic center. Hence, these nonlinear gravitational lensing effects are too small to detect by near-future observations.\nPACS Number(s); 95.30.Sf, 98.62.Sb, 04.70.Bw\nIt is of great importance to elucidate the nature of compact objects like black holes and neutron stars. In particular, the general relativity predicts the frame-dragging effect around rotating objects, which has not been detected. A way of studying the rotational effect of the curved spacetime is measuring the light propagation as well as monitoring satellite motion. As for the gravitational lensing caused by rotating objects , it is known that at the linear order the rotational effect is not distinguishable from the translation of the center of the lens mass [2, 3]. In other words, the Kerr lens would be equivalent to the Schwarzschild lens without any knowledge of the precise position of the lens . Can nonlinear effects break the degeneracy between the Schwarzschild and Kerr lenses ? The main purpose of the present paper is to answer this. We will assume a considerably compact object to take account of a coupling between the angular momentum and the mass. Actually, recent observations [4, 5] have suggested, there might be in our universe very compact objects like a quark star whose radius is several kilometers, about a half of that of a neutron star, though some arguments are still going on .\nThe light propagation in the Kerr spacetime was formulated by using the constants of the null geodesics in polar coordinates [7, 8, 9, 10]. However, the approach is not suitable for description of the gravitational lens, which is a mapping between 2-dimensional vectors on lens and source planes . Hence, we follow another approach developed recently for the gravitational lens .\nIi Formulation of the Stationary Gravitational Lens\nFirst, we summarize notations and equations for gravitational lensing. We basically follow the notation of Ref. , but the signature is . It is convenient to express the metric of a stationary spacetime in the following form:\nThis is essentially the same as the Landau-Lifshitz decomposition of a stationary spacetime . One difference is the definition of the spatial metric. They use\nas the spatial metric. We will hereafter use the conformally rescaled , since the spatial distance defined by Eq. (3) behaves as the affine parameter of the null geodesics in this spacetime . The conformal factor corresponds to the gravitational redshift factor.\nFor a future-directed light ray, the null condition gives\nSince the spacetime is stationary, , and are functions only of the spatial coordinates . Then, the arrival time of a light ray is given by the integration from the source to the observer denoted by the subscript and , respectively:\nwhere is the unit tangent vector along the light ray. Hereafter, lowering and raising the indices of the spatial vectors are done by and its inverse .\nFermat’s principle states , which provides the Euler-Lagrange equation for the light ray, fully valid in any stationary spacetime\nThe deflection angle is defined as the difference between the ray directions at the source () and the observer () in the asymptotically flat regions,\nThe lens equation relates the angular position of the image to the source angular position\nwhere is the distance from the observer to the source, is from the observer to the lens, and is from the lens to the source, respectively. The vectors , and are 2-dimensional vectors in the sense that they are orthogonal to the ray direction within our approximation. In a cosmological situation, the unlensed position is not an observable, because we cannot remove the lens from the observed position.\nWe choose the origin of the spatial coordinate as the location of the lens. We use a freedom in choosing the origin of , so that the closest point of the light ray to the lens, denoted by , can be set at , namely . We denote the tangential vector at the closest point by . The impact parameter is the distance from the lens to a fiducial straight line which is the tangent to the light ray at the observer, while the impact parameter is defined usually at the emitter in the standard context of the classical mechanics: This is due to the geometrical configuration from which the lens equation for is derived . Hence, the impact parameter is defined as\nIii Gravitational lensing in the Kerr spacetime\nFor a slowly rotating case, the Kerr metric is written as\nwhere we used the units of .\nIn order to change this metric into a spatially isotropic form, we perform a coordinate transformation as\nso that we obtain\nwhere we introduced a 3-dimensional vector notation\nThe correspondence between the metric and our (3+1) expression given by Eq. is\nwhere is Kronecker’s delta. It is worthwhile to note\nA condition for the closest point is expressed as\nwhere we used\nThe metric is expanded as\nAt the lowest order, Eq. (7) is expanded as\nwhich is integrated immediately as\nConsequently, we obtain a straight trajectory of the light ray as\nFor a later convenience, we define and .\nUsing the parameterization of the photon trajectory at the lowest order, we obtain\nwhich is integrated as\nwhere we used . By integrating this, we obtain the light ray trajectory as\nwhere was used.\nThe deflection angle is evaluated as\nThis angle is found to agree with previous results  by noticing an identity\nIt should be noted that some of the coefficients take a peculiar form like plus a rational number.\nUp to this point, we have used which is the vector for the closest point. We are in the position to consider the impact parameter, which is defined at asymptotic regions by Eq. (10). Asymptotic expansions of Eq. (31) for a large give us the tangent to the light ray at the observer as\nwhere we denoted a signature function by . Substituting this into Eq. (10), we obtain\nwhere we used . Hence, we find\nwhere we defined . We substitute this into Eq. (34), so that we obtain\nIv Discussion and Conclusions\nAt , we find out an infinitesimal translation as \nso that the deflection angle given by Eq. (32) can be rewritten as\nThis is a global transformation, under which the lens equation is invariant. As a result, we could not separate the rotational effect without independent knowledge of the location of the lens . Namely, lensing properties caused by a Kerr lens, such as the image positions, magnifications and time delay, could be reproduced by a Schwarzschild lens at the suitable position.\nAt the next order, we can discover an infinitesimal transformation as\nso that the deflection angle in Eq. (38) is rewritten as\nHowever, is not invariant under this local transformation. As a consequence, the lens equation is not invariant, so that we can distinguish the rotational effect on multiple images of a point source, such as changes in relative positions of images. Furthermore, we can recognize it for an extended source (e.g. spherical stars, binary stars and luminous discs) and even for a point source if it moves for instance on a straight line or a Keplerian orbit.\nIn order to illustrate the rotational effects on the relative separation between images, let us consider the lens equation in the unit of the Einstein ring radius angle as\nwhere we defined \nHere, it should be noted that the rotational effect comes from which is proportional to the projection of the spin vector onto the lens plane. For a nearby stellar mass black hole and a supermassive one in our galactic center, the dimensionless parameter becomes respectively\nwhere we assumed .\nFor simplicity, we solve perturbatively Eq. for sources on the equatorial plane, namely . The solutions which are on the equatorial plane take a form as\nwhere we defined\nHence, the angular separation between the double images, which is one of the important observables, becomes\nThe term of can be absorbed into the leading term as , which corresponds to the global translation given by Eq. ). The correction due to the terms at is of the order of , which becomes for the supermassive black hole in our galactic center even if is of the order of unity. It must be interesting to study some models in detail. For instance, (1) how light curves change due to a Kerr lens?, (2) what changes occur in image positions and motions when a source is a binary star particularly a binary pulsar?, and (3) how images look like when a source is an accretion disk?\nOur result is in marked contrast to rotational effects on the polarization: The difference in the polarization angle between double images from a fixed point source appears at the exactly same order [13, 14]. In practice, however, these nonlinear gravitational lensing effects are too small to detect by near-future observations [15, 16, 17, 18].\nThis work was supported in part by the Japanese Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, No. 13740137 (H.A.) and by the Sumitomo Foundation (H.A. and M.K.).\n-  R.

{"question":"What ingredients are needed for making fruit preserves, and how quickly can botulism develop in improperly canned food?","answer":"For fruit preserves, you need 2 pounds apples, 1 pound peaches, 1/2 pound blueberries, 1/4 cup lemon juice, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and 2 cups demerara sugar (or alternative sweetener), plus sterilized mason jars and canning equipment. Regarding botulism development, symptoms of consuming contaminated food generally appear 18 to 36 hours after eating, though they can show up as soon as four hours or as late as eight days after consumption.","context":["What? Why? How?!!!\nWhat to do with an abundance of fresh fruit at their peak of ripeness?… Can it! No, not trash it… Can it, as in preserve it. Yes, imagine 6 yummy 1/2 pint jars of summer goodness in the chill of winter…\nIt’s fairly cool during the summer at 8000′ elevation in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, so any time of the year is canning time. I don’t usually worry about over heating the house with cooking and canning. Maina being in Texas might want to use a crock-pot to cook her fruit, this saves the house from excess heat. Then the canning process can also be done outside on a reliable propane heat source.\nCanning is a great option when local produce is plentiful and on sale. I bought locally grown Colorado Palisade Peaches for .99 cents a pound! The large box of blueberries was on special for $2.99, and apples were $1.99 for a 3 pound bag. We ate some of the fruit and froze some for smoothies and made preserves. What a deal! Shop the farmer markets and watch the sale papers\nEat it, Freeze it, Can it!\nApple, Blueberry, Peach Preserves\nWhat you’ll need:\n- 6 1/2 pint mason jars\n- water bath canner\n- large pot or crock-pot\n- 2 pounds apples (core and slice or cut in chunks, no need to peel)\n- 1 pound peaches (remove pits and slice or cut in chunks, no need to peel)\n- 1/2 pound blueberries\n- 1/4 cup lemon juice\n- 1 tsp vanilla extract\n- 2 cups demarara sugar (or your choice of sweetener: raw, coconut or palm sugar)\nCore and slice apples, remove pits and slice peaches, no need to peel, add blueberries and remaining ingredients to pot or crock-pot. Save the apple cores for the horses!\nDon’t freak out over the amount of sugar! If you do the math it works out to 16 tsp of sugar per 1/2 pint jar. Now think about the amount used to spread on a piece of toast… Whew, and it’s way better than store bought. Homemade with no preservatives or artificial anything.\n- Stove top: Add all ingredients to pot. Bring to boil, stirring to keep from sticking. Reduce heat to medium. Cook 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes till fruit and skins are soft.\n- Crock-pot option: Add all ingredients to crock-pot and cook 3-5 hours till fruit and skins are soft.\n- Mashing: I prefer it chunky so I use a potato masher. Immersion blender, mixer and food processor all produce different results. Mash it to your liking.\nPreserving the Harvest:\n- Water bath can: Ladle into sterilized jars leaving 1/2″ head space. Process 15 minutes for 1/2 pint jars. Adjusting head space and processing time for your altitude (high altitudes need more head space and time).\nAnother option is freezing (good for 1 year) in glass or plastic containers or freezer bags.\nRemember to label and date your jars 🙂\nMore uses: Stir into smoothies, oatmeal, yogurt, topping for ice cream, filling for cake, tarts, cobbler…\nEnjoy a taste of summer in winter!","- What temperature kills botulism spores?\n- How do I know if my home canned food has botulism?\n- Does all honey contain botulism?\n- Where is botulism found?\n- Who is most at risk for botulism?\n- Can you survive botulism?\n- Can botulism survive alcohol?\n- How long does it take for botulism to grow in canned food?\n- Does salt kill botulism?\n- Can botulism spores be killed by boiling?\n- Does microwaving kill botulism?\n- Can you see botulism?\n- Does botulism die when exposed to air?\n- How long before you know you have botulism?\n- How can you tell if food has botulism?\n- Can botulism grow in vinegar?\n- Does botulism die when cooked?\n- Does boiling tomatoes kill botulism?\n- Does frying bacon kill botulism?\nWhat temperature kills botulism spores?\nTo kill the spores of Cl.\nbotulinum a sterilisation process equivalent to 121°C for 3 min is required.\nThe botulinum toxin itself is inactivated (denatured) rapidly at temperatures greater than 80°C ..\nHow do I know if my home canned food has botulism?\nHome-canned and store-bought food might be contaminated with toxin or other harmful germs if:the container is leaking, bulging, or swollen;the container looks damaged, cracked, or abnormal;the container spurts liquid or foam when opened; or.the food is discolored, moldy, or smells bad.\nDoes all honey contain botulism?\nHoney is one of the most common sources of botulism. About 20 percent of botulism cases involve honey or corn syrup. One 2018 study looked at 240 multifloral honey samples from Poland. The researchers found that 2.1 percent of the samples contained the bacteria responsible for producing the botulinum neurotoxin.\nWhere is botulism found?\nCauses and types of botulism Clostridium botulinum bacteria are found in soil, dust and river or sea sediments. The bacteria themselves aren’t harmful, but they can produce highly poisonous toxins when deprived of oxygen, such as in closed cans or bottles, stagnant soil or mud, or occasionally, the human body.\nWho is most at risk for botulism?\nWho is at risk for botulism? Everyone is at risk for foodborne botulism, especially those who eat home-canned, low-acid foods. Drug users, especially those who use black-tar heroin, may be at risk of wound botulism. Infants younger than 12 months who are fed honey are at risk of infant botulism.\nCan you survive botulism?\nAlthough botulism can cause severe and prolonged symptoms, most people recover completely from the illness. Early treatment reduces the risk of permanent disability and death. However, even with treatment botulism can be fatal. Without treatment, more than 50% of people with botulism would die.\nCan botulism survive alcohol?\nThe alcohol in your drink won’t destroy the toxin (make it harmless). The only way to be sure you don’t get botulism from pruno is to not drink it.\nHow long does it take for botulism to grow in canned food?\nThe onset of botulism is usually 18 to 36 hours after eating the contaminated food, although it can be as soon as four hours and as long as eight days.\nDoes salt kill botulism?\nA concentration of about 10% salt will effectively prevent germination of Botulism spores in your canned food. … Botulinum in low-acid foods is through pressure canning. Pressure canning allows you to achieve temperatures high enough to kill the spores in a smaller amount of time.\nCan botulism spores be killed by boiling?\nThough spores of C. botulinum are heat-resistant, the toxin produced by bacteria growing out of the spores under anaerobic conditions is destroyed by boiling (for example, at internal temperature greater than 85 °C for 5 minutes or longer).\nDoes microwaving kill botulism?\nbotulinum, and anti-toxin is not useful for prevention. Heating to high temperatures will kill the spores. … The toxin is heat-labile though and can be destroyed at > 185°F after five minutes or longer, or at > 176°F for 10 minutes or longer.\nCan you see botulism?\nYou cannot see, smell, or taste botulinum toxin – but taking even a small taste of food containing this toxin can be deadly. Click on the following tips for details on how to protect yourself and the people you feed. When it doubt, throw it out!\nDoes botulism die when exposed to air?\nNaturally acquired botulism is contracted by ingesting food that has been contaminated with the spores; however, the spores can be aerosolized for use as a potential weapon. The toxin is absorbed readily by gastrointestinal or respiratory epithelium. … Simple exposure to open air can deactivate toxin within 12 hours.\nHow long before you know you have botulism?\nIn foodborne botulism, symptoms generally begin 18 to 36 hours after eating a contaminated food. If you or someone you know has symptoms of botulism, immediately see your doctor or go to the emergency room.\nHow can you tell if food has botulism?\nBotulism symptoms usually begin about 18 to 36 hours after eating contaminated food. Signs of botulism include weak muscles, drooping eyelids, and double vision. In rare cases, you may also experience nausea and vomiting.\nCan botulism grow in vinegar?\nCathy also pointed out that vinegar-pickled vegetables are also not likely to host the botulism bacterium. Because pickled vegetables are covered in an acidified brine, the process creates a high enough acidity to prevent the risk of botulism.\nDoes botulism die when cooked?\nDespite its extreme potency, botulinum toxin is easily destroyed. Heating to an internal temperature of 85°C for at least 5 minutes will decontaminate affected food or drink.\nDoes boiling tomatoes kill botulism?\nNew Mexico says, “To prevent the risk of botulism, chiles and other low-acid and tomato foods not canned according to the 1994 USDA recommendations in this guide should be boiled even if no signs of spoilage are detected. … Boiling destroys botulism toxin. If in doubt, always boil foods before tasting.”\nDoes frying bacon kill botulism?\nThe main ingredient in a cure, salt, functions primarily to kill bacteria and thus act as a preservative. … But because bacon is fried before eating, botulism isn’t an issue, so the use of curing salt is considered optional."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e57b5732-15e2-4e73-a9b5-591e2951c555>","<urn:uuid:fbccfe76-dac1-4b05-91c7-1547f2304064>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the historical origins of seminary basketball tournaments, and what key performance metrics are used to evaluate players during games?","answer":"The seminary basketball tournament tradition was initiated after Bishop Robert Barron mentioned the national tournament to Peter Schirripa in 2017 at St. Anselm College. St. John's Seminary first participated in 2018 at Mundelein Seminary, winning two games with 15 players, and has continued participating since, with their best achievement being third place among 12-16 teams. During games, players are evaluated on specific performance metrics including: their speed in getting back on defense, ability to deny the ball, positioning in help-side defense, blocking out effectiveness, ball security, floor running on offense, movement without the ball, screening ability, aggressiveness on free throw block outs, participation during timeouts, and maintaining mental engagement when on the bench.","context":["Ricky Reyes dribbles the ball up court as now-Father Peter Schirripa follows behind at the national basketball tournament for seminaries in 2022. / Credit: St. John’s Seminary\nCNA Staff, Nov 6, 2023 / 14:40 pm (CNA).\nImagine the scene: The alarm clock starts beeping and it’s 4 a.m. Basketball practice starts in an hour. It’s time for a group of bleary-eyed young men to grab their gear, meet their teammates, and begin a one-mile uphill jog in the middle of New England’s freezing weather to the basketball facility.\nOnce inside the gym, the work begins: stretching, sprints, layups, scrimmaging, shooting, defensive posture, all with one goal in mind — winning.\nThis type of intense training is all in a day’s work for one team of men in Boston.\nNo, it’s not the Division I team at Boston College, Boston University, or Northeastern University.\nRather, it’s how a team of seminarians at St. John’s Seminary in Boston trains. And their goal of winning is twofold: victory in the spiritual life and a championship trophy at the national tournament for seminaries, which is held once a year.\nBut what does playing basketball have to do with priestly formation? Well, according to the seminarians who play for the St. John’s Eagles, quite a lot.\nSt. John’s Seminary’s basketball team at practice. Credit: St. John’s Seminary/YouTube May 18, 2023\nA ‘microcosm of the spiritual life’\nWhen 27-year-old Deacon Marcelo Ferrari, the team’s co-captain, first entered seminary, he saw the game as more of an extracurricular activity, “a good opportunity to spend some time with close friends and maybe build some fraternity.”\n“But very quickly it became clear that the basketball team is just a microcosm of the spiritual life,” Ferrari, of Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico, said.\nPlaying the game together imitates the spiritual life in that “you experience a lot of humiliation, especially if you’re not as skilled like me,” said Ferrari, who has more experience in soccer than in basketball.\n“But you also just learn a real sense of what sacrifice means,” he said. “Even practice just being at 5 in the morning is enough to demand a lot of the human heart.”\nThe experience of being on the team aided in Ferrari’s priestly formation in “so many ways,” he said, adding that “it became a critical space for me to recognize especially more of those subtle movements of the heart.”\n“There’s nothing like team sports to bring out every part of you,” he said.\nAn uphill climb\nFerrari had never played organized basketball until he entered St. John’s Seminary. It wasn’t until another seminarian who established the team, now-recently ordained Father Peter Schirripa, asked him to join that he considered it.\n“He saw me playing soccer and was like, ‘Oh, this guy’s mildly athletic. Let’s see if we can get him a basketball and see what he can do,’” Ferrari said.\nThis type of recruiting was par for the course for Schirripa, 30, who grew up in Lexington, Massachusetts, and had the idea for the team when he first entered seminary more than six years ago.\nBut Schirripa, who had experience in basketball, track and field, and soccer, credits the founder of the media apostle Word on Fire, Bishop Robert Barron, with the conception of the idea.\nSchirripa was visiting his alma mater St. Anselm College during its 2017 graduation ceremony, the spring before his entrance to seminary, when he met Barron, who was giving the commencement address. Barron mentioned to him that there was a national basketball tournament for seminaries and encouraged Schirripa to put together a team from St. John’s.\nSo, Schirripa brought the idea to his superiors at the seminary and got a green light to start building a team for the national tournament.\nDeacon Marcelo Ferrari at one of St. John’s Seminary’s basketball practices. Credit: St. John’s Seminary/YouTube May 18, 2023\n“The leadership was like, ‘Sure, you can do it if you can pull it off.’ But I was a first pre-theologian. I’d been there for, like, three weeks,” Schirripa said.\n“And let’s just say there was not a robust athletic or even really communal culture at St. John’s at the time. And so trying to inspire guys to do this and play on the team, it was like I was just taking whatever warm body I could get,” he said.\nEventually, enough seminarians wanted in, and Schirripa’s idea came to fruition, which culminated in St. John’s taking a squad of 15 guys to the national tournament at Mundelein Seminary in Mundelein, Illinois, and winning two games in 2018.\n“We went out to it and we won two games, which is crazy because we were so bad,” he said.\nHe noted that the games were livestreamed and their brother seminarians were watching.\n“The whole common room was watching it and I think people couldn’t believe that we did it,” he said.\n“And the rest,” Schirripa said, “is history.”\nSt. John’s has been sending a team to the national tournament ever since. The best they’ve done is third place in a tournament that typically consists of between 12 and 16 teams.\nThe future of the church\nPart of St. John’s success can be attributed to their volunteer coach, Patrick Nee, 44, a practicing Catholic in the greater Boston area who was a Division I basketball player at Brown University in the 1990s.\nNee had coached on the high school level, on travel teams, and even on his young children’s teams, but what made this coaching experience different was the “shock” of being immersed in seminary culture.\n“It’s not an experience like I’d ever had before, just being in a gym with 15 seminarians, being on a bus or being on a plane with them and just realizing how good it was,” he said. “And these guys are really holy guys that are just terrific. Getting to know them all, it has just been really inspiring for me.”\nPatrick Nee coaches St. John’s Seminary’s basketball team. Credit: St. John’s Seminary/YouTube May 18, 2023\nNee, a high school state champion from St. Raphael Academy in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, said that he stopped practicing his Catholic faith during his college years and didn’t come back to it until his late 20s.\nHe said that when he returned to the Church it took him on “a journey.” And over the last five years, that journey has “intensified” even more, he said, adding that “this experience has played a role in that.”\nNee said that it’s overwhelming “in the best way” when he is at the tournaments and “every guy you meet is this on-fire guy who’s studying to be a priest.”\nOne of those men on fire for the faith is Brian Daley, a member of the St. John’s team, Ferrari said. He recalled an incident at practice one day when a newer seminarian began to indulge in “light mockery” of the other teams they would be playing in the tournament.\nFerrari said that Daley reminded his teammate: “No, these men that we’ll be competing against are all giving their lives for Christ and they’re great examples for us.”\nFerrari called it a moment of “deep fraternity” for the team, who were all inspired by the wisdom Daley shared.\nThe deacon also said that as a team that fire is seen at every practice through prayer.\nAt every practice, each player is handed a sheet of prayer intentions to offer up their labor on the court so that all of their work is “done with an eye that sacrifice is fruitful.”\nSeeing all of the hard work the teams put in for one weekend showed Nee that they care a lot about winning, “but they never lose track of the bigger picture.”\nSt. John’s Seminary basketball coach Patrick Nee guides his players during the 2022 tournament. Credit: St. John’s Seminary/YouTube May 18, 2023\nHe said that being a part of the team has strengthened his faith and added that the whole experience inspired him to tell Schirripa that “we need to share this with people.”\n“I wish other people could see this. I mean, if you know anyone who is negative about the future of the Church, it’s like, well, walk into this gym for five minutes and you’ll change your mind immediately,” he said.\nNee’s vision for sharing the experience with others became a reality five months ago when St. John’s Seminary released “Souls in the Game,” a documentary that “highlights priestly formation beyond the study of philosophy and theology.”\nThe 28-minute documentary follows the team’s journey from the early morning practices to the recruiting and training of the seminarians to the final tournament.\n“There is no pressure at all. Go out and play. We have brought life to St. John’s Seminary. God has used this team and let’s go out there and show everyone that we love each other, we love our vocations, and we’re going to represent St. John’s,” Schirripa says to his team during a pregame speech in the documentary.\nViewers might be surprised by how competitive the games are, especially in the scene where 6-foot-4 Schirripa is shown slamming it down during the tournament, which resulted in a technical foul for the team.\nDespite the penalty, the team was roaring with excitement at Schirripa’s slam dunk, a feat that not many players ever get to experience on a 10-foot hoop.\n“We were ready to storm the court,” Ferrari said in excitement in the documentary.\nThat documentary can be seen below.\nPhysical exercise such as can be had playing on a basketball team is something that every seminary should “absolutely” have, Schirripa said.\n“I think it’s absolutely essential because you need a physical outlet and you need to obviously have a healthy body, mind, and soul. But it also teaches you to work towards something that’s bigger than yourself, which ultimately is the apostolate,” he said.\n“And so it’s such a great venue for formation,” he said.","This post was submitted by Coach Tom Kelsey.

{"question":"How do the storage methods differ between Pashmina shawls and antique silk garments to maintain their quality over time? What are optimal conditions for each?","answer":"Pashmina shawls and antique silk garments require different storage approaches for preservation. Pashmina shawls should be folded and packed in tissue paper or plastic bags, then stored in a closet away from light, dust, and dampness. They must be kept in well-sealed, dry plastic storage boxes during summer, with mothproofing products or perfumed paper to prevent moth infestation. For silk garments, after cleaning, they should be sprinkled with warm water, folded neatly, and placed in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for an hour before storing. Both materials require cleaning before storage - Pashmina to prevent moth damage from food stains and oxidization, while silk needs proper cleaning to prevent wrinkle setting and deterioration.","context":["Caring for your Pashmina\nMost stores would recommend or even request professional dry cleaning when it comes to cleaning your Pashmina shawl, but actually that's not the best way. The way you look after your hair also applies to your Pashmina, because they are both natural fibres.\nSo as genuine Pashmina shawl lovers, we would like to share our easy to follow tips with you. You do not have to spend a lot of time and money on professional dry cleaning again!\nHow to wash\nHand wash in lukewarm water using your hair shampoo. Be sure to dissolve the shampoo thoroughly then put the Pashmina shawl into the water. Rinse with hair conditioner, this will make your Pashmina softer. Wash coloured garments separately.\n- Do not bleach.\n- Squeeze gently, do not twist or wring. Twisting the wet shawl would stretch the shape.\n- Dry flat after removing excess water, away from direct heat and sunlight.\n- Press with damp cloth, using a cool iron, iron from the inside of the garment.\nHow to store\nBefore storing your precious Pashmina shawl in a basement or attic, check carefully for leaks, dampness and sunlight.\nFold the Pashmina shawl, pack them neatly in tissue paper or a plastic bag, and store them in the closet away from light, dust and dampness.\nCleaning before storage is recommended, as fresh stains that may not yet be visible will oxidize and become fixed during storage, they may also be food for moths. Moths have a discerning palate, they feast only on natural fabrics. Mothballs (naphthalene) and cedar chips are standard protection from moth infestation of woolens.\nTo store a Pashmina shawl during summer, the most important thing is to keep moisture away, so please do not store cashmere in a damp place. A well-sealed plastic storage box (available in most stores) is good enough (a see-through one is better as you can notice if there is any moisture inside).\nMake sure the box is dry before you put the Pashmina shawl in.\nTo keep the moths away, the first important thing is to make sure that the shawl is clean before long-time storage.\nPay close attention to any food stains as moths are particularly attracted to our normal food proteins and cooking oils. Those mothproofing products are helpful, or simply spray some perfume on a piece of paper and put the paper next to your sweater inside the box.\nSome more tips\n- Do not wear the Pashmina shawl too frequently, allow it two or three days rest after one day's wearing.\n- Do not wear the Pashmina shawl next to rough clothing, metal necklaces, bracelets, belts and rough leather such as crocodile leather bags.\n- Pilling is caused by abrasion during regular use, it often develops on elbows, on the seat of skirts, and in areas rubbed by a bag or briefcase, even a seat belt. Soft, fuzzy surfaces are more susceptible than others. So for Pashmina and silk/pashmina, it is normal when pilling develops in some areas after times of wearing.\n- To avoid pilling, it is important not to rub the garment with rough clothing, metal accessories, bags and all kinds of belts. In case you can not avoid the belts such as seat belts, cover your garment with a silk or synthetic fibres scarf, make sure it is the smooth surface that is next to your garment.\n- To remove pills, just manually pick them off. Do not rub and brush the garment.","Washing and caring for antique clothes can be simple if the right steps are taken. This can come in handy in many industries from dry cleaning to wedding alterations to costume design. Here are some commonly found antique garment types and how to care for them.\nSeparate any dyed silk garment and soak them separately in cool salt water. Following a thorough rinse, soak the garment in cool water and soap for 15 minutes. Rinse several times with clean water. Do not put the garment in the dryer – air-dry only as the heat may set wrinkles.\nHere’s the special trick to removing wrinkles and storing sink garments – sprinkle the clean garment with warm water, fold it neatly, and put in a plastic bag. Place the bag in the fridge for an hour. Upon removal, turn the garment inside out and iron. Spritz with water while ironing. A clean spray bottle is typically safer to use than the iron’s steam when working with antique fabrics.\nLinen is often silky to the touch after years of washing. Old linen, especially handkerchief quality, can be mistaken for cotton. To help tell the difference between linen and cotton, lay a piece of fabric on the back of your hand – if it’s linen, it will feel cool to the touch. Cotton, placed in the same location feels warm and dry.\nWhen cleaning white linen, wash with cold water, soap and a few drops of household ammonia. Follow this wash with a good soaking in hot water, liquid soap, and a small amount of chlorine bleach to brighten.\nRust stains on your linen? These can be the result of iron in your water. To correct the issue, you simply need lemon juice and salt. Sprinkle the salt and lemon juice over the dampened rust stain. Suspend the fabric over a bowl and pour boiling water through the stain from about 12″ away. Repeat until the stain is removed.\nWhen cleaning colored linen, soak the fabric in warm water and a cup of salt to set the dye. Rinse out the salt solution, and wash out the garment in warm water and a small amount of liquid laundry soap. Rinse the garment several times, and then soak in a white vinegar bath.\nMost people have experienced the new life a good washing can give to a fine sweater. To wash an antique sweater, soak and wash it in cold-water soap solution. Rinse it several times to gently remove the soap. DO not rub – this will cause pilling.\nSoak the sweater in a vinegar bath. Squeeze – don’t wring – the water, or lay it out on a screen over a sink to let the water drain out. Another option is to wrap the sweater in a clean towel, place it on the floor, and stand on it. Your body weight will push out the water. Gently press the sweater with an iron on medium heat.\nTailored suits of the 30’s and 40’s are well liked for their distinct shape and cut. Tip: look under the collar to determine the original color of the suit – years of washing and sun will fade. The many layers of interfacing and structured pleats means the garment needs to be cleaned with extra care.\nRepair any loose seams before washing. Soak the garment in a bathtub of lukewarm water and soap. Press down on the suit to remove dirt. Repeat with clean water until the water runs clear. Use the same drying process as used on sweaters above. A suit is best steam-press professionally."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:21406f21-0b33-439c-a699-828d3f8edad9>","<urn:uuid:57e9d005-6684-4717-9256-108138bc389c>"],"error":null}

Workers who smoke are at a much greater risk of lung disease if they are exposed to substances in the workplace that can cause lung disease. Poor ventilation, closed-in working areas and heat increase the risk of disease. Outside air pollution also can increase the risk of lung disease in people who work in jobs that expose them to substances that can cause lung disease.\nWhat substances in the workplace can cause lung disease?\nMany substances found in the workplace can cause breathing problems or lung damage. Some of them include the following:\n- Dust from such things as wood, cotton, coal, asbestos, silica and talc. Dust from cereal grains, coffee, pesticides, drug or enzyme powders, metals and fiberglass can also hurt your lungs.\n- Fumes from metals that are heated and cooled quickly. This process results in fine, solid particles being carried in the air. Examples of jobs that involve exposure to fumes from metals and other substances that are heated and cooled quickly include welding, smelting, furnace work, pottery making, plastics manufacture and rubber operations.\n- Smoke from burning organic materials. Smoke can contain a variety of particles, gases and vapors, depending on what substance is being burned. Firefighters are at an increased risk.\n- Gases such as formaldehyde, ammonia, chlorine, sulfur dioxide, ozone and nitrogen oxides. These are associated with jobs where chemical reactions occur and in jobs with high heat operations, such as welding, brazing, smelting, oven drying and furnace work.\n- Vapors, which are a form of gas given off by all liquids. Vapors, such as those given off by solvents, usually irritate the nose and throat first, before they affect the lungs.\n- Mists or sprays from paints, lacquers (such as varnish), hair spray, pesticides, cleaning products, acids, oils and solvents (such as turpentine).\nWhat kinds of breathing problems can occur following exposure to such substances?\nSome substances can cause you to have upper respiratory irritation or irritation of your nose and/or throat with cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose and scratchy throat.\nViral infections and allergies produce similar symptoms. You should become suspicious of a work-related illness if your nose and throat are often irritated and breathing problems seem to occur when you are at work. Breathing in substances at work can also increase your risk of developing bronchitis, flu-like symptoms, asthma or emphysema.\nA person who has bronchitis has a persistent cough that produces mucus or sputum and lasts at least 3 months to a year. Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of bronchitis, but workplace toxins can also play a role.\nIf you notice that you often have what seems to be the flu, your illness may be caused by something you are exposed to at work. The following are some work-related lung diseases that can make you feel as though you have the flu:\n- Allergic alveolitis (also known as \"farmer's lung\") can occur after excessive exposure to moldy hay.\n- Metal fume fever occurs from inhalation of metal vapors, such as in welding and other metallic operations.\n- Polymer fume fever can occur after breathing the fumes of polymers, such as Teflon.\nA worker who has one of these conditions develops breathing problems, cough, fever, muscle aches and general malaise (a feeling of being tired and having no energy) 4 to 6 hours after exposure to the substance. If such symptoms occur again and again when you are at work, this is a clue that your illness may be related to your work.\nIf you develop asthma for the first time as an adult, the illness could be related to something you are exposed to at work. Asthma symptoms include wheezing, chest tightness, a persistent dry cough or trouble breathing.\nEmphysema usually occurs in older people who smoke. However, people who have worked with coal, asbestos or silica dust for 20 years or more can also develop emphysema. They may have a cough, fatigue, chest tightness and difficulty breathing.\nWhat should I do if I think something in the air at work is making me sick?\nVisit your doctor if you think the air at work is making you sick. Your doctor will probably ask you to provide some of the following information:\n- When your symptoms first appeared\n- How often you have symptoms\n- The time of day that the symptoms are worse\n- Whether you feel better on some days\n- How you think your symptoms relate to work\n- What types of materials you come in contact with at work\nYou may find it helpful to keep a written record of these things to share with your doctor. Be sure to make a note of your shift or work hours, the days of the week you work and the days of the week you are off work. Try to recall previous jobs, hobbies and smoking habits -- anything that might have affected your lungs. If your doctor has sent you an occupational health history form, fill it out as completely as possible.\nYour doctor may find it helpful to know all of the ingredients listed on the containers of materials you use in the workplace. Make a list of these ingredients and write down any precautions and first-aid measures that are printed on the label.\nAsk your employer for copies of the material safety data sheets (MSDSs) at your workplace. These are information sheets about the products that you use in the workplace. All employers are required by law to complete these forms, and you have a right to see them. Bring them with you to your doctor's appointment.\nHow can I keep from having my lungs damaged by something I'm exposed to at work?\nIf you smoke, stop. This is the most important thing you can do for your overall health, regardless of risks at your workplace. Smokers have a greater risk of developing some work-related lung diseases than nonsmokers.\nUse a respirator. A respirator is a device you wear over your mouth and nose that cleans the air before it enters your body. You must be properly fitted and trained to use a respirator. Over time you should be refitted and retrained in how to use it. The respirator must be carefully cleaned after each use and it should be checked to ensure that it works properly. Use a respirator as a temporary measure until you are no longer exposed to the damaging substance.\nIf you are exposed to damaging substances at work, talk to your supervisor about the need for adequate ventilation and new procedures to reduce or eliminate your exposure. A change in ingredients, work practices or machinery can reduce hazards in the air. Ventilation systems can remove pollutants and toxins from the air to reduce exposure and prevent buildup. Local exhaust ventilation can be used to remove polluted air at the point where it is generated by a hazardous process or machine. At some jobs, people can be separated from the hazardous materials.\nWritten by familydoctor.org editorial staff"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c15ad4bc-da4a-42e2-8ffa-9877fb4f44d7>","<urn:uuid:e2b1daf7-dea9-4f15-b153-2a00db2732a7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the recommended approach for achieving proper pitch when crafting a bamboo flute?","answer":"To achieve proper pitch, first ensure you can produce a consistent tone by blowing across the mouthpiece. Then compare the flute's sound against a pitch-pipe, tuning fork, piano, or guitar. If the note is flat, carefully trim small amounts from the open end of the flute until it produces the correct key note. The size and shape of the mouthpiece also affect pitch, so you may need to adjust the cavity's configuration.","context":["How to carve a homemade bamboo flute. Fabricating a bamboo tube with holes is an easy way to make a simple homemade wind instrument. (See the bamboo flute diagram and spacing chart in the image gallery.)\nSeveral years ago a friend gave me a bamboo flute . . . and I became so enamored of the little instrument's pleasing tone and appearance that I set out to learn how to make one myself.\nWell, it didn't take me long to discover that fabricating a tube with holes that would make noise when I blew into it was fairly easy . . . but crafting an accurately pitched instrument that played true notes was quite another matter. Luckily though, I soon met Craig Rusbult. He showed me the right way to go about the project, and I'd like to share his instructions with you on how to carve a homemade bamboo flute.\nHOMEMADE BAMBOO FLUTES: ON BAMBOO AND DIMENSIONS\nCraig explained that the pitch and key of a homemade wind instrument—as well as the accuracy of each of its notes—are determined by the relationships between several variables: the size, shape, and placement of the mouthpiece and finger holes . . . and the length, internal diameter, and thickness of the tube itself.\nThe first step along the path of successful flutemaking, then, is to choose good-quality bamboo of the desirable dimensions. The tube's inside diameter should be between 3/4 inches and 7/8 inches . . . and Craig adds that thinwalled (about 1/8 inch-thick) specimens produce the best sound. Also, you should try to obtain a section of stalk that's well seasoned (not green) and free of cracks.\nTo make a flute that plays in the key of A, you'll need a 14 inch length of \"pipe\" . . . for the key of F, an 18 inch section . . . and for the key of D, a 21 inch piece. Look for bamboo with joints that are just a bit more than half as far apart as the intended length of the instrument . . . so that when you cut the piece to size, it'll have a node at one end and another more or less in the middle. (For example, the ideal bamboo \"blank\" for a 21 inch key-of-D flute would have about 11 inches of open \"tube\" between each pair of joints.)\nAnd where can you find bamboo? Well, in some larger cities (including my home base, Seattle) sources for the material are listed in the Yellow Pages under—logically enough—\"Bamboo\". On the other hand, you may very well live in an area where the oversized grass grows wild or in cultivated backyard\nZpatches (it's distributed throughout most of southern half of the U.S., and in much of the north, too). If all else fails, try hunting up some stock at carpet stores . . . flooring is often rolled up on low-quality, but generally usable, bamboo rods.\nIf the specimen you find is a fairly lengthy piece, so much the better . . . you'll probably want to experiment a bit, anyhow. Indeed, a pole that's several feet long and tapers from a 1 inch inside diameter at its base to 1/2 inch at the other is likely to contain enough material for several good 3/4 inch flutes in its middle.\nWhen you take a good look at your bamboo, you'll probably notice that every joint is marked by two circular ridges (this is true of most species, anyway) . . . and that the one on the joint's wider end is always somewhat \"sharper\"—in other words, narrower—than the other. Each of these double—rimmed nodes marks the location of a hard inner membrane that divides the tube into joint-to-joint compartments.\nTo cut a usable piece of the material, choose a good two-section, three-joint length and then—with a coping blade or some other fine-toothed saw—cut through the cylinder's broad end just outside the first joint . . . leave the middle node intact . . . and slice off the narrow end just inside the third joint. (Wrap masking tape around each tip before sawing to help keep the fibers from splitting.)\nThe result will be a two-section tube that's open at the thinner end and closed at the other extremity by that joint's dividing membrane. The interior \"bulkhead\" at the middle node will also still be intact. You'll need to remove it by chopping it out—a few pieces at a time—with a hammer and a long, sharp tool . . . or burning away the material with a hot poker . . . or boring it out with a drill and a long bit.\nOnce you've completed the rough work, take a 20 inch piece of dowel and glue a two-inch strip of sandpaper around each end . . . coarse at one tip and fine-grit at the other. You can use this tool (and a good bit of patience) to give the inside of your flute a smooth finish.\nTHE FLUTE MOUTHPIECE\nNow, it's time to make your instrument's \"blow hole\". Measure about 3/8 inches to 1/2 inches in from the smooth ridge at the closed end of the flute, and make a mark at that point. (Some kinds of bamboo have ridge creases running lengthwise. If this is the case with your section, you may want to position the mouthpiece about a quarter-turn beyond one of the ridges . . . so the raised part will rest against your chin when you play.)\nOnce you've located the site for the mouth hole, bore a cavity—using a succession of increasingly larger drill bits (and, again, a \"shield\" of masking tape) to keep the material from splitting—that's a maximum of 5/16 inches to 3/8 inches in diameter. Some flutemakers leave the opening perfectly round, but Craig prefers to \"ovalize\" his mouthpiece slightly by elongating the hole with a sharp knife or—again—a piece of sandpaper glued to a thin dowel. In any case, you should definitely undercut—by about 15 degrees to 30 degrees—the edge of the opening that'll be farthest from you when you play the instrument (see Figure 1).\nON BAMBOO FLUTE PLAYING AND PITCH\nAt this point your flute should be capable of making . . . well, if not a true note, at least some sort of sound. Before you can adjust the instrument's pitch, though, you'll have to learn how to produce a simple consistent tone.\nBasically, you'll be trying to accomplish the same thing you did as a child when you'd \"hoot\" by blowing across the top of an open pop bottle. Hold the flute as depicted in Figure 2, and place your lower lip against the flute near the edge of the hole. Now, purse your lips just a bit and blow a stream of air across, and slightly into, the cavity.\nIf you don't get a note, rotate the flute so you'll be blowing at a slightly different angle, and try again: You may have to experiment awhile to get it right (a certain amount of perseverance and breath control are required), but if you've followed my instructions correctly, you should eventually be able to make a sound. If you simply can't coax even a little noise from the tube even after repeated attempts, ask an experienced flute player to show you the technique (if that person can't produce a note from your bamboo tube, you may have to rework the instrument).\nYou'll probably notice—as you practice—that the placement of your lips, and the angle and force of the blown air, have an effect on the audible result. For example, by putting your mouth further over the hole, you'll produce a flatter note. The differences may seem subtle at first, but if you keep at it, you'll eventually develop a feel for the right position for you. The note will then come easily and sound true each time you play it.\nOnce you've developed this ability, the tone you're making should be the flute's key note . . . that is, if you've made a 21 inch key-of-D instrument, the note should be D. Chances are, however, that when you compare the flute's sound against the same note played on a pitch-pipe, tuning fork, piano, or guitar, your instrument's pitch will be slightly off . . . and you'll need to make an adjustment. The mouthpiece's shape and size have some effect in this regard, so-first-make sure you're satisfied with the cavity's configuration and performance, or make any improvements that you feel might help (for instance, you may want to enlarge the hole, or increase the undercut).\nIf your flute's note is still significantly flat, carefully trim off a very small amount of the instrument's length from the open end . . . play the note to check the flute's pitch . . . and repeat the process as often as needed until the flute reproduces its key note with reasonable accuracy.\nBAMBOO FLUTE: FINGER HOLE SPACING\nNow, you're ready to locate and drill the holes that you'll finger to play the full range of the scale. As you work, keep in mind that the size and—particularly—the placement of each opening in relation to the length of the flute will determine the \"trueness\" of its note.\nI've provided a spacing chart (Figure 3) that shows you the approximate hole-placement measurements for flutes in the keys of A, F, and D. I stress the word \"approximate\", however, because variables like the tube's inside diameter, the size of the mouthpiece hole, and the thickness of the bamboo affect the spacing required to produce accurate notes on any given flute.\nThat's why, in fact, I recommend that you start small and drill each hole in gradually increasing increments up to a maximum diameter of 1/4 inches to 3/8 inches . . . and that you check the tone of the note produced at each step. Every time you enlarge the hole, the note will become sharper (higher) . . . and by starting small (flat) and working up, you can pretty much \"tune in\" each cavity.\nAlso, as you look at the placement chart, you might notice that there are three \"extra\" openings, designated 1a, 3a, and 5a. Most flutes have just six, but Craig has devised a nine-hole system (employing two thumb holes on the underside of the instrument and an additional finger hole). By making more notes available, these additional perforations will allow you to play in two additional keys (those above and below the instrument's base key).\nMy advice, though, is to make a six-hole model first, and learn to play it fairly well (I'll include fingering charts for six- and nine-hole flutes in Part II). Then add the optional holes to your flute when you've reached the point where you can make good use of the extra notes. (An alternative is to go ahead and make the nine-hole version . . . but tape over the three extra openings until you've mastered the basics.)\nIn any case, drill the hole for the lowest note (the one closest to the open end) first, and once you've tuned it to your liking, proceed to the next, and so on. Remember, though, that the perforations don't have to be in a straight line. As long as you adhere to the recommended distances in the placement chart, you can put each hole anywhere around the circumference of the instrument. Just choose a spot where your finger seems to fall naturally and comfortably when you hold the flute to play.\nEDITOR'S NOTE: In the next issue, Marc Bristol will deal with the three F's of the bamboo flute: fine tuning, fingering, and finishing."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:42cb8a19-b2bd-4385-a131-acc257fe3213>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you explain the key integration patterns for IBM i mobile apps and the associated security risks when connecting to network systems?","answer":"IBM i systems support several integration patterns for mobile apps, including Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) for executing business logic, system-level commands for accessing OS capabilities, user spaces for storing up to 16MB of user-defined information, data queues for handling synchronous and asynchronous communications, spool file access, IFS objects, Java integration, database access, and web services integration. However, connecting to any network creates potential security risks. These risks include exposure to viruses that can delete or damage data, computer worms that replicate at excessive speed, man-in-the-middle attacks on unsecured networks, phishing attempts, botnets that create 'zombie computers', rootkits enabling unauthorized access, and keyloggers that record keyboard strokes. To mitigate these risks, organizations must implement proper physical security, network security with firewalls, and executable security with anti-virus software.","context":["Need to interface a mobile app with your IBM i? A number of IBM i integration patterns can be leveraged to keep mobile apps in sync with enterprise systems.\nYour IBM i system holds a lot of very useful data that can be leveraged for mobile apps. However, you need the right tools and methods to extract the data in the most effective way. This is where an integration platform comes in.\nThe purpose of system integration is to ensure smooth-running business processes across multiple systems. To do this, an IT department needs to be armed with integration and business process management tools that can recognize all of the needed integration patterns for your environment.\nTherefore, IBM i users should look for mobile app development solutions that support nine familiar IBM i integration touchpoints.\n1. Mobile Access Through Remote Procedure Calls\nA very strong pattern for integration is one that will allow you to call System i programs for the purpose of passing parameters back and forth or simply executing a batch program. Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) can be used not only to access data, but to execute existing business logic running on IBM i. For example, a mobile order-entry app can run an inventory lookup program on IBM i or check for available stock.\nTypically, IBM i programs are written in RPG, although COBOL or other IBM i legacy languages may be involved. Utilizing existing application logic has a number of advantages: It preserves investment in prior software, ensures consistency in business processes, and allows changes in logic to be made in familiar languages.\n2. Mobile Access Through System-Level Commands\nWith so many capabilities written into the IBM i OS itself, it makes sense to consider the system command line as an integration pattern. One can access, for example, current security system values using -*SEC-. The possibilities with system commands are numerous and provide extensive power for mobile apps designed to access them. Obviously, Control Language (CL) command integration will be limited to capabilities at the CL level. Capability to retrieve CPF and CPD error messages and job log messages will also be regarded as an important requirement in some apps.\n3. Mobile Access to the User Space\nOne of the powerful integration patterns somewhat unique to IBM i is the user space. You can think of the user spaces as objects of up to 16 MB that can be used to save user-defined information. A user space object is permanent and can be stored in either the system domain or user domain. Mobile apps that work with the user space allow apps to create user spaces for lists of data; to access and store pointers; to deal with large amounts of data; to add, update, and delete information using Control Language (CL) commands; to exchange data between jobs, applications, and systems; etc. For example, a mobile app that accesses a user space containing contact data can provide a mobile device with access to enterprise directories of information.\nWorking with the user space is a useful integration pattern for mobile apps accessing the IBM i because it provides the app with a way to deal with a commonly used IBM i methodology. Rather than requiring extensive changes to existing jobs or applications, the mobile app can interface with the user space already employed in an existing IBM i scenario. This reduces the invasiveness and fragility of the integration. Not all IBM i procedures are based on the user space, however, so this will be the primary consideration as to when to use the user space.\n4. Mobile Access to the Data Queue\nData queues are one of the powerful and unique capabilities of the IBM i that help an otherwise batch-oriented environment to deal with both synchronous and asynchronous activities. The data queue works with both data and metadata or one could even say messaging. Their purpose is to facilitate both synchronous and especially asynchronous communications. One possible use case is a mobile time-and-attendance app: A payroll system may have a single job to run payroll that is triggered by multiple time-card entries that are stored in the data queue. Among the attributes of the data queue is the \"Async read,\" which allows data in the data queue to be protected while it is being read. It is a type of transactioning mechanism that has specific parameters related to wait time. The data is essentially removed while it is being read but only for the specified wait time.\nUse of the data queue by mobile apps is most powerful when existing processes are already using data queue as a method. This allows you to take advantage of previously considered business rules for access of data in the data queue and avoids “reinventing the wheel.”\n5. Mobile Access to Spool Files\nThe print spool is a frequently used IBM i operating system feature. Spool files can be considered proprietary to the IBM i environment, in particular because of their traditional connection to IBM printer formats. However, increasingly, IBM i shops have engaged in spool file conversion to get output data into popular formats such as PDF. The spool files can take on several formats: SCS, AFPDS, IPDS, AFPDSLINE, and PCL. For example, rather than a large printed report with rows and columns of data, records from the print spool file can be parsed and then may be displayed on the mobile device in a whole new interface such as a searchable stack of records that may be browsed on the mobile device by swiping left or right.\n6. Mobile Access to IFS Objects\nMobile apps could also access IFS objects. The Integrated File System (IFS) of the IBM i supports stream input/output and storage management within an integrated structure across the system. The IFS supports binary formats, which can be useful for mobile interfaces and rich media types. Mobile apps may be designed that access both transactional and master item data via IFS.\n7. Mobile Access Through Java on IBM i\nSome IBM i-based IT departments have introduced Java into their environments with varying degrees of success. Since many teams seem to be searching for ways to minimize further investment in Java, integration of mobile apps to pre-existing Java capabilities on IBM i may be particularly important. To best integrate with various Java technologies, the mobile app will need to access abstracted capabilities for dealing with Java objects, classes, EJBs, and even in some instances the Java Message Service (JMS). A consumer-facing mobile app that provides current balance information, for example, may be able to access backend data via a JMS.\n8. Mobile Access to Databases on IBM i\nDirect data and database access is an important option for mobile apps. In addition to the IFS access already mentioned, the DB2/400 or DB2 UDB databases, SQL tables, SQL interfaces to physical files, and Open Query File (OPNQRYF) functionality may need to be employed as a point of mobile access to IBM i data. With the Open Query File, one will want to be able to sort and select records. With SQL access to physical files (as opposed to native IFS access previously mentioned), the option for use of direct SQL statements and access to views, triggers, functions, and stored procedures presents itself. Databases are ideal for mobile apps that execute transactions and where rollback and two-phase commit may be needed.\n9. Mobile Web and Web Services\nMobile apps that access IBM i can utilize API-style interactions hosted on IBM i. Both HTTP and Web Services integration can become an important integration pattern for mobile access to IBM i. While most mobile integration tools will provide support for Web Services and HTTP, it is important to make certain that the system supports the native Apache requester on the IBM i as well as the Apache server, which may in some cases be on a Linux partition. In addition to HTTP get and post for RESTful Web Services, mobile apps accessing a SOA environment on the IBM i will need to be supported by use of SOAP/WSDL/UDDI Web services and WS-Security. The support of the mobile app development and integration system for Web Services becomes especially powerful in combination with the other integration patterns discussed here, essentially service-enabling the IBM i platform and mobile apps.\nA variety of other integration patterns and capabilities will present themselves in the IBM i, although many of these can be considered non-native. XML, PDF, email, and other format support will be important as any of these may be utilized for input, output, and transport.\nThe mobile development and integration platforms that you ultimately select should support loose coupling between your mobile devices, your mobile app servers, and the IBM i environment. Loose coupling is desirable because it means that there is less interdependency between any two elements—a change in one component is less likely to require a change in the other.\nSolutions and toolkits for mobile app and IBM i integration will ideally support as many of these IBM i patterns as possible, provide EAI and BPM orchestration architecture, and support mobile app deployment to numerous mobile device platforms, especially iOS, Android, and Windows 10 Mobile.\nVendors that provide a full stack of application, platform, and integration capabilities for mobile access to the IBM i should be conversant in the touchpoints discussed here. With the right application development and integration platform, all of the patterns discussed here and more are incorporated as a part of the solution set offered, making for a successfully integrated mobile app supporting users based on an IBM i system.\nAbout the Author: Glenn Johnson","A network system refers to the interconnection of two or more computers to share resources (such as printers and scanners) to easily exchange and transmit information through cables or wireless connection that follows certain rules or protocols.\nThere are three common types of network, the Local Area Network (LAN), Wireless Local Area Network WLAN), and Wide Area Network (WAN).\n- Local Area Network (LAN) generally covers a limited geographic area like an internet café, school laboratory, or office. Computers are connected to a server or workstations. The server is configured so it can do its function without direct human intervention. Its function includes software hosting, file storage and retrieval, complete access control for the network resources, and many more. On the other hand, workstations need human users to interact and utilize network services, unlike servers.\n- Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) is the same as LAN, but the connection on the network is wireless.\n- Wide Area Network (WAN) connects a larger geographic area such as a whole state, country, or even the world. This global network is made possible by connecting through the satellite. WAN is a complex network because it uses a variety of connection materials such as multiplexers, bridges, and routers to connect locally, then metropolitan networks for global connection like the internet.\nConnecting to any network will create an opening to potential risk and attacks on the security of computer systems. Thus, an effective and strict computer security system must be implemented.\nWhat are the main types of computer security?\nComputer security protects the information that is stored in a computer from anyone who wants to harm or steal it and prevents unauthorized access. Below are the main types of computer security:\n- Physical Security – setting a unique password to a computer. The password will be known to authorize the person only to assure the safety and confidentiality of the data being stored in that computer.\n- Network Security – the network has many entry points. Thus, network security requires defense methods such as firewalls. A firewall is a software device that monitors the traffic and prevents access to the network depending on security rules.\n- Executable security – installing an anti-virus. An anti-virus is a computer program that will try to identify, remove and prevent viruses from harming your computer system. A virus may delete, duplicate or even damage your whole computer system. So it is a must to have an installed and updated anti-virus.\nThe main goal of computer security is to ensure the confidentiality of the information to authorized persons, to maintain the integrity of the information (which means there are no deviations from the original information being stored), and to make information available to concerned persons only.\nWhat are the 3 basic internal security of computer system?\nAttacks on the computer system and networks are rampant these days; thus, a computer’s internal security system must be strictly implemented and observed. There is three basic internal security of a computer system: management security, operational security, and physical security.\n- Management security is referred to as administrative controls, which provide the guidance, rules, and procedures for implementing the overall security of the system.\n- Operational security is referred to as technical controls, which assure the effectiveness of your controls, such as access controls, authentication, and security topologies applied to networks and installed applications.\n- Physical security refers to the protection of personnel, data, hardware and etc., from physical attacks and threats that can harm, damage, disrupt the operation or even destroy and affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data or the system.\nWhat are computer security risks?\nNowadays, it is complicated and unpredictable to know how or when an attack on your computer system will occur. Harming your computer system through physical damage and non-physical (viruses) may happen at any time, so it’s always better to be careful and avoid it from happening as much as possible.\nComputer security risk is an act that could damage the hardware and software of a computer unit. Following are examples of computer security risks:\n- Humans – the biggest security risk. In an organization, if your employee is not well trained about safety and good practices, misuse of a computer system may happen. It is critical to make sure that they are knowledgeable in terms of security, especially if that employee holds or is assigned in a very important and confidential task.\n- Bad backups – if your backup is corrupted or lost, you will face big trouble, especially if you don’t have any alternative copies. Always make sure that you properly back up the data and keep it in a safe place.\n- Not maintaining hardware or software – will give a potential entry to an attacker. It is always recommended to have regular check-ups of your hardware and software systems.\n- Not planning for a natural disaster and more.\nConnecting to a network or to the internet and installing software, your computer system is already introduced to risk. Today, almost all people need the internet to communicate and need to install new software and applications, we can never assure 100% security, but building and creating strong computer security helps alleviate the risk.\nWhat is the importance of computer security?\nComputer security will keep all information protected. Tightening the security of your computer will prevent unnecessary and harmful incidents that may result in information leaks and loss, and even hardware damages. Being aware and knowing the do’s and don’ts in terms of security will help you to sidestep unwanted occurrences.\nStrengthening computer security, guaranteed safety processing, storage of sensitive information, and more. It also provides confidentiality, integrity, and availability for all components of the computer system.\nComputer security allows your computer system to avoid the following:\n- Viruses – are malicious programs that will be installed into your computer without your knowledge. This program can duplicate, hide and even delete your data. It can also replicate itself and infect other installed software in the system and files.\n- Computer worm – a software program that replicates itself in greater volume and excessive speed and infects from one computer to another computer without the users’ knowledge. This program will use and consume users’ computer hard disk space.\n- Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (MITM) – a cybercrime that occurs when a visitor user uses an unsecured public Wi-Fi network. Hackers interrupt the traffic between the user and the network, and during that time, they can steal data by using malware to install the software.\n- Phishing – a cybercrime that involves someone pretending to be a legitimate and trusted institution over the telephone, email, or even text messages to trick possible targets into disclosing personal and confidential information (such as email, passwords, bank details and etc.). This may result in financial loss and stealing and using your identity.\n- Botnet – a network of connected computers that are conceded by hackers without the users’ knowledge. The infected individual computers are now called a ‘zombie computer,’ which now is the bot. It will be used for doing malicious activities on bigger-scale attacks such as DDoS.\n- Rootkit – malicious software designed to enable unauthorized access to a computer system or restricted network while hiding its existence. It allows a hacker to modify system settings and configurations and execute commands remotely.\n- Keylogger – a software monitoring that can track and record all keyboard strokes and activities without the users’ knowledge\nAdditional precautions to secure harmful incidents:\n- Do not leave your computer unattended\n- Do not visit websites without SSL certificates\n- Do not click links that you are not familiar\n- Be mindful of the information you are entering\nHere are some important reasons why computer security is important:\n- Protects your personal information\n- Protects your companies property\n- Stops unauthorized access\n- Prevents data leak and theft\n- Prevents viruses and malware\nHow do we maintain computer security?\nMaintaining your computer security allows you to avoid hacking and stealing attempts on your information and even your computer hardware. Computer hardware can be secured and protected through lockers, doors, confidential information, and unauthorized access to your system requires complex security strategies and practices. Below are some strategies and practices to maintain your computer security:\n- Backup your data regularly and store it in a protected place\n- Use a unique and strong password and change it regularly\n- Use a two-factor authentication\n- Use a firewall. Always activate your firewall because it acts as a security guard between your local network and the internet.\n- Keep all your installed software up to date.\n- Install reliable and trustworthy anti-virus software and malware protection\n- Be cautious of suspicious emails. Do not easily disclose personal information when asked. Always verify the reliability of all emails you receive.\n- Do not click any link provided or open any attachments, especially if it’s not familiar to you.\n- Make sure that the Wi-Fi is secure. Browse the web safely. Do not visit sites that offer prizes or promos.\n- Avoid pirated materials and cracked software. Always use and install software from a trusted source.\n- Do not leave your computer unit unattended.\n- Avoid using USB and other external devices unless you own it\n- Educate yourself with basic aspects of computer security and the latest security, as well as the evolving threats and ways to attack.\n- Always perform a daily or regular full system scan.\n- And more..\nA network system is critical in terms of security mainly because security threats are constantly evolving, and so as the security programs to defend the system against any threats and attacks continuously.\nThere are numerous threats and attacks that only wait for the opportunity to enter your system. However, understanding them and knowing how to avoid these threats is a key to preventing or defending your network and system from potential malicious activities.\nStrengthening your computer security system is always the best solution to avoid any harmful effects on your software, hardware, and network.\nJust visit www.thepractical.co.th for more information or any queries and concerns."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bba54496-6ba1-4c54-be44-59e61108d177>","<urn:uuid:8cd50449-54a2-4538-995d-3016a79a4b22>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Cuáles son los rangos normales de temperatura corporal y what are the risks of mercury exposure from broken thermometers?","answer":"A normal oral temperature for a resting, healthy adult is about 98.6°F (37°C), while for someone over 70 it's 96.8°F (36°C). Temperature can vary 1-2 degrees throughout the day. Regarding mercury exposure from broken thermometers, it can be highly toxic even in small amounts. Mercury exposure can cause immediate health effects including abdominal cramps, eye irritation, loss of appetite, weight loss, skin rashes, and muscle tremors. It's particularly dangerous for unborn and young children as their nervous systems are still developing. If a thermometer breaks, the spill should be cleaned up immediately using rubber gloves, cardboard or an eyedropper, and proper ventilation - never use a vacuum cleaner or broom.","context":["- Ranges in Body Temperatures\n- Stages of Fever\n- How to Take Your Temperature – Fever in Adults\n- Mercury Thermometer\n- Digital Thermometers\n- How to Treat a Fever\n- When to Call Your Doctor\n- If you have a cough\n- If you have a very bad headache\n- If you have a sore throat\n- If you spent most of the day in the sun or in very hot conditions\n- Fever in Newborns\n- Fever in Young Children (Toddlers)\n- Comments (12)\nA fever is a body temperature above 100.4°F. A normal oral temperature for a resting, healthy adult is about 98.6°F (37°C) (for someone over 70 normal temp is 96.8°F (36°C)). Your temperature can go up or down 1 to 2 degrees throughout the day. Fever is a sign of inflammation or infection and is a common symptom of illness. Fever is not a disease.\nA fever is one way your body fights illness—your body temperature goes up to kill bacteria that cannot live at the higher temperatures. Although it may not be comfortable, a temperature of up to 102°F is generally good for you. Most healthy adults can tolerate a fever as high as 103°F to 104°F for short periods of time without having problems. Body temperatures usually return to normal with the illness goes away.\nRanges in Body Temperatures\nA temperature above 100.4°F (38°C) indicates a fever, called pyrexia in medical terms.\n- Temperatures between 99°F (37.2°C) and 100.4°F (38°C) are called low-grade fever.\n- Temperatures between 100.4°F (38°C) and 105.8°F (41°C) are called pyrexia.\n- Temperatures between 105.8°F (41°C) and 109.4°F (43°C) are called hyperpyrexia and are serious.\n- Temperatures above 109.4°F (43°C) are usually fatal, that is causing death.\nStages of Fever\nA fever can be divided into three stages.\n- Onset is when the temperature first begins to go up. The increase in temperature can be slow or sudden, the person can have chills and feel cold and breathing and heart rate increase.\n- During the course of the fever the temperature can go up and down in one of three patterns: continuous, intermittent or remittent. During this stage, the person has an increased heart and breathing rate and feels warm to the touch. The person may also look flushed, feel thirsty, lose their appetite, have a headache and feel weak and tired.\n- During the subsiding stage the temperature returns to normal. It can return gradually or suddenly. As the body temperature returns to normal, the person usually sweats and may become dehydrated due to loss of fluid from sweating.\nHow to Take Your Temperature – Fever in Adults\nAdults should take their temperature under the tongue. Taking a temperature under the armpit is not very accurate.\n- Wash your hands with soap and warm water.\n- Wash the thermometer in cold water.\n- Make sure the top of the mercury is down near the bulb.\n- To reset the thermometer, hold the thermometer firmly at the end opposite the mercury bulb and shake it with a downward flick of your wrist. This brings the mercury level down below the normal temperature level.\n- Put the bulb end of the thermometer under your tongue and close your mouth. Keep your mouth closed while you take your temp.\n- Wait 1 minute then take the thermometer out of your mouth. Hold the thermometer near light to read it; turn it slowly until you see the silver column of mercury. The number at the top of the mercury is your temperature. There is usually a mark on the thermometer showing a normal temperature at 98.6°F (37°C).\n- Rinse the thermometer in cold water and clean it with alcohol before putting it away. Be sure to put it out of the reach of children because the mercury can be harmful if the thermometer is broken. What to Do if a Mercury Thermometer Breaks\nDigital thermometers can also be used but they can be expensive to buy. They are easy to read, as they have a large digital display for numbers. Before using, make sure the thermometer is clean and turned on. Remove the thermometer once it beeps. Clean it before you put it away.\nHow to Treat a Fever\n- Increase the amount of liquids you’re drinking, especially water. Your body may try to cool itself by sweating and you should replace this loss of fluid.\n- Take your temperature every two hours. Each time you take your temperature, write down your temperature and the time you took it.\n- Take your temperature before the end of two hours if your other symptoms change. For example, if you start throwing up or your temperature is going up each time you take it.\n- For fevers that are uncomfortable, sponge the body with lukewarm, not cold. water. Take acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen to get your fever down. Do not give aspirin or products that contain aspirin to children or teens under the age of 20.\n- Watch for signs of dehydration. Dehydration can happen if the fever causes you to sweat or you have other symptoms like vomiting or diarrhea. Signs of dehydration include: thirst, dry skin, dry mouth, chills, feeling tired or weak, and dark-colored urine.\nWhen to Call Your Doctor\n- If your fever is over 104°F and does not go down after two hours of home treatment.\n- Persistent fever. Many viral illnesses, especially the flu, cause fevers of 102°F or higher for short periods of time (up to 12 to 24 hours).\n- If the fever stays high:\n- 102°F or higher for 2 full days\n- 101°F or higher for 3 full days\n- 100°F or higher for 4 full days\nA fever is a symptom of a health problem and would be present along with other symptoms that mean you should call your doctor.\nIf you have a cough\n- If you have a fever along with other signs of a bacterial infection.\n- If you have a fever along with the following symptoms:\n- Shortness of breath and cough even when resting or you have been coughing up brown phlegm—you may have pneumonia. Call your doctor right away. This may be serious especially if you are over 65 or are in poor health.\n- Have been coughing up gray-yellow phlegm and/or have been wheezing—you may have an infection in your airways (bronchitis).\n- Pain over eyes or cheekbone may indicate sinusitis or sinus infection.\n- Painful or burning urination could mean a urinary tract infection\n- Abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting could mean flu, gastroenteritis, appendicitis or food poisoning\nIf you have a very bad headache\n- Along with a very stiff neck or pain when you bend your head forward, nausea or vomiting, bright light bothers you, you’re drowsy or confused — you may have encephalitis or meningitis. Call your doctor right away.\n- And you think you may have the flu. Symptoms would be one or more of the following: headache, body aches, cough, runny nose, sore throat.\nIf you have a sore throat\nIf you spent most of the day in the sun or in very hot conditions\n- Fever over 103°F with dry skin, even under the armpits could mean possible heat stroke. Exposure to the heat may have caused your temperature to go up. Most of the time it will return to normal after you have rested for an hour or so in a cool room. Drink plenty of fluids and call your doctor at once if your body temperature keeps going up.\nFever in Newborns\nFever in newborns can be serious and should not be ignored.","What is Mercury?\nMercury is a naturally occurring element that can be found throughout the environment. Human activities – such as burning fossil fuels and hazardous waste, and the improper disposal of mercury containing products – have greatly increased the amount of mercury contamination in the environment.\nWhere is Mercury Found Around the House?\nMercury can be liquid or gaseous. In both forms, it’s just as dangerous.\nYou can find mercury in…\n- Fluorescent light bulbs\n- Glass thermometers\n- Some older light switches\n- Older household thermostats\n- Some metallic jewelry\n- Children’s shoes (with flickering lights)\n- Some toys with flashing lights\n- Clothing irons\n- Some clock pendulums\n- Older oil-based paints\n- Button batteries (watch-type batteries)\nFluorescent and High-Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps are excellent energy-efficient choices because they can use up to 50 percent less electricity. However, used fluorescent and HID lamps must be disposed of properly because they contain mercury.\nThe Dangers of Mercury\nMercury is a highly toxic metal that is harmful to both humans and wildlife. Exposure to even small amounts of mercury, over a long period of time, may cause negative health effects including damage to the brain, kidneys, and lungs.\nUnborn and young children are especially susceptible to mercury exposure because their nervous systems are still developing. Whether it is absorbed through the skin, inhaled, or ingested, exposure to mercury should be taken very seriously.\nBrief contact with high levels of mercury may cause immediate health effects:\n- Abdominal cramps\n- Eye irritation\n- Loss of appetite\n- Weight loss\n- Skin rashes\n- Muscle tremors\nProper Storage and Disposal\nProper storage and disposal of mercury-containing products will greatly reduce the risk of exposure in your home. Store products containing mercury in a safe place to prevent breakage.\nCarefully handle and dispose of those products by taking them to the Delta Household Hazardous Waste Collection Facility for free and proper disposal.\nIf There’s a Spill\nAll mercury spills, regardless of size, should be cleaned up immediately and carefully. If the amount spilled is more than two table-spoons, contact the National Response Center at 1.800.424.8802. If a spill is less than two tablespoons:\nDo …keep all pets and children away from the immediate area\nDo …wear rubber or latex gloves when cleaning up a spill\nDo …use cardboard, a squeegee, or an eyedropper to gather and draw up mercury\nDo …properly ventilate the spill area (turn off heaters, and turn up the AC)\nDo …put clean-up materials in a sealable containerDon’t …use a vacuum cleaner or a broom to clean up mercury\nDon’t …pour mercury down the drain\nDon’t …wash mercury-contaminated items in the washing machine\nDon’t …walk around – your shoes could be covered with mercury.

{"question":"What are similarities and differences between ravens and humpback whales in their altruistic behavior towards other species? Can you analyze their protective instincts in detail?","answer":"Both ravens and humpback whales demonstrate notable altruistic behavior towards other species. Humpback whales have been observed actively protecting other marine mammals from killer whales, as evidenced by an incident where four humpbacks defended a Steller sea lion from orcas by positioning their bodies between them, slashing at the orcas, and trumpeting loudly. Similarly, ravens show cooperative behavior with wolves - they assist wolves by alerting them to potential food sources and danger. However, the nature of these relationships differs: while humpbacks appear to act purely altruistically to save other species from predators (with researchers noting this happens 9 out of 10 times), ravens' relationship with wolves is more mutualistic, as they depend on wolves to kill prey and open carcasses they cannot tear open themselves. The ravens' behavior has evolved over millions of years as part of this mutualistic relationship, while the humpbacks' protective behavior was only recently documented and surprised many researchers.","context":["Was it the law of the jungle, the golden rule or just some newcomers defending their turf?\nSome whale watchers are still trying to make sense of an unusual encounter off the southern tip of Vancouver Island that might just rewrite our understanding of interspecies behaviour.\n“This was an example of humpback whales coming to the rescue of another marine mammal, in this case a Steller sea lion,” said Michael Harris, the head of the Washington-based Pacific Whale Watch Association.\n“We knew there would be some encounters, but we never expected to see something like this. It was an amazing, amazing encounter.”\nAccording to Harris, the incident began when a group of four Bigg’s Killer Whales started hunting a lone Steller sea lion in the waters off Sooke on Sept 11.\n“As the hunt was going on, two humpbacks decided to intervene and actually get between the sea lion and the killer whales,” said Harris.\n“Then, two more humpbacks joined the fray, literally putting their huge bodies between the orcas and the sea lion, flipping their flukes on the water, trumpeting very, very loud at these transient orcas and ultimately saving this sea lion and escorting it in the other direction of these killer whales.”\n‘The water boiled all around’\nNaturalist Alethea Leddy with the Port Angeles Whale Watch Company was one of the first on the scene and watched the whole encounter unfold.\n“The water boiled all around as the orcas tried to separate the sea lion from the humpbacks,” she recalled.\n“It was a wild scene with the humpbacks even circling the sea lion trying to keep him safe, while he frantically struggled to get his breath. The anxiety of the humpbacks was palpable, and they took turns diving and slashing at the orcas.\nVeteran Capt. Russ Nicks of B.C. Whale Tours of Victoria also saw the attack — and the defence.\n“What we witnessed was pure aggression,” Nicks remembereds. “We had four humpbacks trumpeting, rolling on their sides, flukes up in the air multiple times.”\n“The killer whales split many times into two groups, with one that appeared to try to draw the humpbacks away from the sea lion. The other group would go in for the attack, while the humpbacks were safely away — but then they’d get in the middle of it again, fighting the orcasoff. It was amazing to watch.”\nEventually, the humpbacks appeared to win the battle with both sides going their separate ways, including the sea lion who stuck with the humpbacks until it was safely out of sight from the hungry killer whales.\n“I think the Stellar sea lion was well aware that he had some help out there, and he was lucky he did, because he would have been lunch,” said Harris.\nHarris says this is the first time he’s heard of this sort of behaviour by whales in the Salish Sea, but it’s actually been reported elsewhere recently.\n“A publication came out last month from researchers who were saying they were witnessing humpback whales coming to the rescue of smaller marine mammals and saving them from transient orcas, but we had never seen anything like that in the inland sea.”\nAccording to researchers, most of the time when humpback whales do battle with killer whales, they appear to be acting in an apparently altruistic way to save other marine mammals from the transient predators.\n“Nine times out of 10, they are actually intervening to save another species,” said Harris, who admits when he first heard about the research, he was skeptical the researchers were over-interpreting the animals’ behaviour.\n“Someone asked me about it, and I said, ‘I’m not so sure about it. I think we would need to see something like that happen. That seems pretty anthropomorphic, like us human beings imparting our own value sets on these creatures out there.'”\n“But now we have seen it first-hand, and I am a believer,” he freely admitted.\nFull story: British Colombia","|The Mind of the Raven|\n|Investigations and Adventures with Wolf-Birds|\nby Bernd Heinrich\nPosted: June 16, 2000\nBackyard Biologist Tests Raven IQ\nSince prehistoric times, ravens have been revered and reviled. Poets wrote about them, native people worshipped them and European settlers attempted to eradicate them.\nThey were kept in the Tower of London because their vocalizations were thought to warn of approaching danger. Odin, the ruler of the Norse gods, kept two wolves at his side and a raven on each shoulder. The Vikings eagerly welcomed ravens as an omen of victory. The Inuit believe ravens help them hunt caribou, polar bears and seals by dipping their wings in the right direction.\nThen there's their downright peculiar behavior: reports of ravens hanging from their feet, sliding in snow, flying upside down, rolling in mid-flight, tugging at wolves' tails and defending their nests with rocks.\nIn \"Mind of the Raven: Investigations and Adventures with Wolf-Birds,\" biologist and raven fanatic Bernd Heinrich sets out to investigate the motives for these odd behaviors by attempting to separate what is pre-programmed, what is learned, and what is insightan indication of intelligence.\nHeinrich has studied ravens for 16 years, but his history with the birds dates further back. As a boy in post-World War II Germany he kept a pet crow, and as a graduate student at UCLA in the 1960s he housed two tame ravens in his Westwood apartment. He wanted to study them but was advised (jokingly) never to study an animal smarter than himself.\nInstead he studied protozoa, moving on to caterpillars and later bees. His book \"Bumblebee Economics\" is considered a scientific classic. Heinrich is a professor at the University of Vermont but does most of his raven-watching near his hand-built cabin in Maine. In 1994, he published \"Ravens in Winter,\" his first attempt to \"make sense\" of ravens.\nThe common raven, Corvus corax, is the world's largest crowfour times heavier than the American Crow. No other bird in the world has a wider distribution or shows more adaptability. They occupy an extraordinary geographical and ecological range, from the Arctic Circle to the mountains of Central America.\nWhile most of us couldn't tell one raven from anotherbig, black, noisy, looks like a crow, right?Heinrich believes no two are alike. Ravens, like humans, are not \"pre-wired\" (like, say, ants or bees). Their behavior is spontaneous and evolving as they solve life's problems. \"I have often been startled by their enigmatic and seemingly contradictory responses. But the poetry of biology resides hidden in opposing tensions, and the often arduous fun comes from trying to reveal it,\" Heinrich writes.\nAnd fun he does have. Heinrich, a seasoned marathon runner, climbed two large pine trees in a windstorm to retrieve four baby ravens, which he is raising in his backyard in Maine.\nHe derived an idea to test their intelligence from a copy of \"Ranger Rick\" magazine, a present to his then young son, Stuart. In the magazine, a short article described the clever things you can watch birds do, like pulling up food suspended by a string. Heinrich theorized that if a rare raven could figure out how to pull up fooda 10-consecutive-step processwithout a lengthy trial-and-error period, that it might indicate intelligence. \"That is, insight might precede or accompany learning to produce the same behavior.\"\nThis simple experiment allowed Heinrich to reduce the possibilities of random chance and of genetic programming that would have coded this very specific unnatural behavior. Since his ravens were raised in captivity, Heinrich was assured they had no prior experience and so could not have learned the behavior.\nIf they could solve the problem, it would prove insight. Well, the ravens aced the test. Not only did the first raven perform the entire sequence with nary a fumble, he dropped the meat when chased off by Heinrich instead of trying to fly away with it. \"The significance of the remarkable behavior of not flying off (with the meat) was that it was a new behavior that was acquired without any learning trials. They acted as though they had already done the trials. The simplest hypothesis is that they hadin their heads.\"\nHeinrich does not restrict his detective work to his backyard. He flew to Oberhausen, Germany, in response to a letter he received from a medical doctor who regularly allows his raven, Jakob, to roam 'free' in his apartment. \"(This) was an opportunity I could not pass up . . . I wondered how fast a raven would disassemble an apartment . . . three minutes, maybe five.\"\nIf it is true, as some speculate, that the capacity of an animal to cause damage is proportional to its intelligence, then ravens are geniuses. To his surprise, Jakob destroys only junk mail and has left the doctor's museum-like apartment intact.\nJakob eats what the family eats, watches television with them (Jakob finds a raccoon on the screen very upsetting), bathes regularly and demands caresses every night.\nHeinrich watched Jakob, asked questions and took notes. At one point, Jakob insisted, with a \"mighty heave\" into Heinrich's thigh, that he hand over his pen. Heinrich, ever agreeable to a raven's demands, complied.\nHeinrich speculates that Jakob does not destroy the apartment because he had remained in his cage for his first two months there. During that time, he had seen most of the apartment and his interest in its contents had faded. It was only new things, like the pen, that interested him. \"The corvid line of birds all share this capacity of curiosity. It is their trademark. One wonders if it is the key that has allowed them to flourish and diversify.\"\nWolves may have also had a hand in their survival. During a trip to Yellowstone National Park, Heinrich observes that ravens arrive at all wolf kills and immediately begin feeding. However, they avoid carcasses where wolves are absent.\nThough confusing behaviorwhy wouldn't ravens take advantage of an easy food source?it fits a pattern Heinrich had observed before; that ravens invariably choose to be with the wolves. \"Maybe (ravens) had evolved with wolves in a mutualism that is millions of years old, so that they have innate behaviors that link them to wolves, making them uncomfortable without their presence.\"\nRavens need wolves for several reasons: they rely on wolves to kill, to open carcasses (ravens are incapable of tearing open a carcass) and to possibly overcome their innate shyness of large food. Wolves also need ravens. Ravens have been reported to alert wolves to potential food sources and to danger.\nWolf watchers have historically taken ravens and wolves for granted, \"so much is taken for granted that further comment, or data, have seemed superfluous,\" Heinrich writes. Heinrich successfully convinced Yellowstone biologists to include studies of ravens with their studies of wolves. As the book went to press, initial surveys indicated ravens always showed up at wolf kills and fed with the wolves within minutes. In the twenty-five cases where provided meat was unattended by wolves no ravens fed within the hour of observation.\nObviously there is much left to learn about ravens. \"Mind of the Raven,\" beautifully designed, is a great start. Each chapter begins with a black-and-white photo, one of which includes a picture of Heinrich's son as a baby surrounded by Heinrich's last batch of raven babies. His sketchesmuch more sophisticated than sketches from \"Raven in Winter\"are included within each chapter. At times his writing rambles, but for the most part, his enthusiasm is so grand that even the disinterested can't help hoping Heinrich will continue unearthing clues to the mystery named Corvus corax."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:329c8bd8-ec1d-40ab-9322-cccc3b898e47>","<urn:uuid:0040b4db-1d6b-4df9-a2fa-c661f5649a1f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do both self-cleaning ovens and the Shokunin Kamado Grill approach the challenge of heat distribution for achieving their respective purposes? This question is essential for understanding the engineering principles behind both cooking technologies.","answer":"The two systems use different approaches to heat distribution. Self-cleaning ovens, particularly high-temperature models, evenly distribute heat throughout the chamber to ensure all food residue is removed from sidewalls and ceiling. Steam-based models generate most heat near the floor where water is poured. The Shokunin Kamado Grill, on the other hand, uses a strategic placement of charcoal in the four corners of the fire grate, allowing heat to envelope the pizza and reflect down from the inner curvature of the lid. It also employs a two-piece baking deck that creates an air gap for more gentle heat distribution, ensuring the pizza doesn't cook too quickly on the bottom.","context":["Solved! When to Use Your Oven’s Confusing “Self-Clean” Function\nWeigh the pros and cons of using the self-clean feature of your oven before putting it to the test.\nQ: The oven in my new house has a self-clean feature, but I’ve heard there are pros and cons to using it. Should I try it, and is it a viable replacement for manually cleaning my oven?\nA: On paper, it’s a home-keeper’s dream come true: an oven that actually cleans itself! In practice, this function—developed in the early 1960s for both gas and electric ovens—can be confusing, even controversial. In fact, self-cleaning ovens are only used by slightly under half of all households in America according to 2001 U.S. Census data. The term is actually something of a misnomer, too, because there will always be some manual cleaning involved. What’s more, the function is by no means intended to replace a hands-on cleaning routine.\nSome folks swear by the time-saving convenience, while others have sworn it off due to a few unfortunate drawbacks—and we’ve laid it all out here to help you decide whether or not this feature will work for you.\nIt does the heavy lifting. The self-clean function works by blasting either high heat or steam throughout the oven interior to release hardened food remains. This saves the time and effort of getting on your knees and scouring stubborn gunk with a scrubber and also does away with the need for pricey, chemical-laden commercial cleaners. Simply start a self-clean cycle and allow it to work; then, when the cycle is complete, use a water-dampened rag to manually remove loosened debris from the oven’s smooth, heat-resistant enamel coating.\n• In high-heat models, the self-clean cycle is usually initiated by closing the oven door and setting the oven to a “self-clean” mode. The oven door automatically locks and the temperature rises to between 900 to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit to incinerate any food remains, in a cycle lasting between two to six hours. Once the cycle is complete and the oven has cooled completely, the door automatically unlocks.\n• The self-clean cycle of a steam-based model is usually initiated by pouring roughly one cup of distilled water into a floor cavity, then closing the door and setting the appliance to “steam clean” mode. During the cycle, which lasts only half an hour to an hour, the oven door remains unlocked and the interior temperature rises to only around 250 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to generate steam that softens and loosens food remains.\nHigh heat beats steam on heavy-duty grime. High-temperature self-cleaning ovens evenly distribute heat throughout the chamber, so you’ll rarely find leftover food residue on the sidewalls or ceiling. Steam-based self-clean cycles, however, tend to generate the most steam near the oven floor (where the water is poured)—so while this effectively removes food debris on the oven floor and lower sidewalls, you may still need to manually scrub the ceiling and upper sidewalls.\nBeware of fumes and oven failures. Both high-heat and steam self-cleaning ovens can emit unpleasant burning odors and fumes, and even harmful by-products like carbon monoxide from the vent of the oven during the cleaning cycle. High-heat models tend to emit a higher volume of more noxious fumes due to the extreme temperature. These fumes emanate from both food particles and the enamel lining that coats the oven interior. Fumes circulating in the kitchen can irritate pets, children, and adults, especially those who suffer from respiratory conditions.\nExcessive heat buildup in the oven can also short a thermal fuse or burn out a heating element. While a one-time do-it-yourself replacement of either a blown fuse or a heating element should set you back no more than $30 in parts, repeat occurrences can become costly and time-consuming.\nReplacement parts won’t be the only expenses with the self-clean feature. Consider the amount of energy (and the money) it takes to run the oven at such high levels for an extended period of time. A single high-heat self-clean cycle can rack up 8 Kilowatt (kWh) hours of energy on average (roughly the equivalent of a month’s use of a traditional oven), while the average steam self-clean cycle consumes less than 3 kWh of energy.\nProper preparation is key. If you choose to try out the feature, you can take steps to mitigate the risks of using the self-clean setting and ensure that the clean cycle runs without hiccups. Follow these safety rules:\n• Install a carbon monoxide detector in your kitchen to monitor for harmful fumes.\n• Before running a self-clean cycle, remove all pots and pans and any metal oven grates or tin foil shards. In the high heat of the self-clean cycle, the debris on charred metal grates can catch fire, while tin foil can melt on top of the oven’s interior lining and warp it.\n• Prior to using the feature, remove any large fallen chunks of food from the oven floor with a pair of tongs to prevent them from smoking and emitting fumes. Similarly, wipe up any visible spills with a water-dampened rag.\n• If your oven allows you to adjust the time of the self-clean cycle, set it to the shortest possible duration to reduce the risk of overheating (which can lead to blown fuses) and also reduce energy consumption.\n• Prior to starting a self-clean cycle, ensure the oven vent, located above or below the oven door or behind the oven door handle, is uncovered. If you have a range (an oven connected to a stove), turn on the exhaust fan on the range hood to ensure that fumes get expelled to the outdoors. If you don’t have a range hood, ventilate the room by opening windows.\n• Aim to use the self-cleaning feature no more than five times per year, or only when the oven is heavily soiled. Schedule these days well before or after holidays or other occasions when you know you’ll need the oven so that any malfunction won’t interfere with your hosting duties.\nMaintain a manual cleaning routine. The self-clean feature wasn’t designed to replace the manual cleaning method. Following oven use, wipe down wet food or liquids from the inner door glass, sidewalls, floor, and ceiling with a water-dampened rag. On a monthly basis, clean the interior and grates of your self-cleaning oven as you would clean a traditional oven, preferably using the safe, natural agents of white vinegar, baking soda, and water. Never use abrasive cleaning utensils (e.g., steel wool) or chemical cleaners in self-cleaning ovens, which could easily damage the interior enamel coating.","Making Pizzas in the Shokunin Kamado Grill\nThe Shokunin Kamado Grill is incredibly versatile. Use it to smoke, roast, bake and grill with a flavorful charcoal and wood fire. One of our favorite things to cook in the Shokunin is pizza. Because of the amazing efficiency of the Shokunin’s insulated design, it is easy to maintain a 750°F baking temperature for hours at a time. At this temperature, you can make a perfect pizza in just three minutes.\nThis simple guide to baking pizzas in Kalamazoo’s kamado grill will walk you through the tools, steps and techniques needed for a successful artisan pizza night at home.\nThis two-piece baking deck creates an air gap for more gentle heat.\nTHE TOOLS YOU’LL NEED\nThe most important tool you’ll need is a hollow-core baking deck or pizza stone. The cordierite two-piece deck from PizzaCraft is ideal for balancing the heat and preventing the bottom of the pizza from cooking too quickly. Make sure your pizza stone is no more than 16 inches in diameter.\nIf your pizza stone is solid, without an air gap, you can use an aluminum pizza screen between the pizza and the stone to slow down the cooking.\nA perforated pizza peel, like the one included in Kalamazoo’s Pizza Master’s Essentials Kit (PMEK), is very helpful in transferring the assembled pizza into the grill. A wooden pizza peel, or even a thin cutting board can also be used. The PMEK also includes a pair of dough boxes that are helpful when resting the dough prior to shaping the crust.\nOnce the pizza has cooked, you can lift it out of the grill with a large grill turner or spatula, or you can use a pizza peel.\nPizza cooking with a pizza screen on top of the stone.\nA chimney starter gets the charcoal started quickly with no chemicals.\nSETTING UP THE GRILL\nConfigure your grill with the fire grate placed in the highest of the three positions. Because of the tapered interior shape of the Shokunin, you’ll want to slide each part of the two-piece adjustable fire grate to the outside (far left and far right) of the grill. Pile a little hardwood lump charcoal in each of the four corners of the grill.\nOpen all four vents (two supply vents in the base of the grill and two exhaust vents in the lid) to the wide-open positions.\nStarting the Fire\nFill the chimney starter with more lump charcoal. We typically use a paper grocery sack to start the chimney, but you can also use paraffin fire starters. To use paper, loosely wad it up and put it inside the bottom of the chimney starter. Place the chimney starter in the center of the fire grate, then use the plumber’s torch to light the paper on fire. Leave the grill lid open and the cooking grates flipped up out of the way while the charcoal starts, about 15 minutes.\nOnce the fire has travelled all the way up the chimney and the coals at the top are burning, it is time to distribute them in the grill. Use long, protective gloves to pour the burning coals out of the chimney starter and onto the unlit charcoal that was positioned earlier. You want to keep all of the charcoal positioned toward the corners of the fire grate so that the heat envelopes the pizza and reflects down from the inner curvature of the lid.\nOnce the charcoal is distributed, you can add wood chunks or small wood splits on top of the charcoal. The wood will boost the heat and add subtle wood flavor to the pizza. (Unlike a wood-fired pizza oven, where the fire is next to the pizza and the smoke travels out the chimney, the fire in the Shokunin is below the pizza so the flavor is noticeable.)\nNow you can lower the cooking grates into position and place the pizza stone in the center of the cooking grate.\nClose the lid and preheat the grill to 750°F, about an hour of preheating time.\nCOOKING THE PIZZA\nAssemble your pizza on the countertop, then transfer to the pizza stone using a pizza peel (see tips that follow). Close the lid and start a three-minute timer. The pizza will cook evenly from all sides and does not need to be rotated in the Shokunin. With a hollow-core pizza stone, the pizza will cook untouched for three minutes.\nWith a solid stone, check the pizza after one minute. If the crust has “set” and the pizza is easily moved, gently lift it off the stone and slide a pizza screen into position. Close the lid and continue cooking for the remaining two minutes.\nRemove the pizza when done and let rest for a minute before slicing.\nPIZZA MAKING TIPS\nBecause we are cooking pizzas quickly at a high temperature, use a pizza dough made in whole or in part with Tipo ‘00 flour. This is the flour used in traditional Neapolitan pizzas. Our Artisan Fire Pizza Dough recipe is perfect for cooking in the Shokunin.\nPizza dough needs to relax before stretching, and ideally needs to come up to room temperature. We recommend keeping dough balls in the dough box at room temperature for three to four hours before making pizza. A seven to ten ounce dough ball size is good for working with a 14-inch diameter pizza stone.\nWhen forming the pizza, be gentle with the dough. You want to avoid “bruising” it and creating areas that can’t form air pockets inside as the crust bakes. We form our pizzas by hand rather than using a rolling pin. The dough can be formed to a flat disc. There is no need to form it with a raised crust around the outside. The heat of the grill will do that for you.\nThe first two minutes of this pizza making video includes tips for stretching the dough and getting the assembled pizza onto the pizza peel.\nOur Favorite Pizza Recipes\nThese recipes are all written for the Artisan Fire Pizza Oven, but are easily cooked in the Shokunin following the directions above.

Brunei has implemented stringent policies including strict tobacco licensing, high importation taxes, smoke-free zones, and a total ban on vape products, making tobacco products virtually impossible to obtain. This has resulted in achieving a single-digit prevalence of tobacco use among their youth population by 2019. Scotland, on the other hand, has focused on gradual restrictions, being the first UK member to implement a public smoking ban in 2006, followed by standardized cigarette packaging, banning cigarette vending machines through the 2010 Tobacco Act, and prohibiting cigarette displays in public retail stores. Scotland aims to be smoke-free by 2034 and has announced plans to ban smoking on hospital grounds by 2015.","context":["THE Health Ministry has announced that its minister will table a Tobacco Control and Smoking Bill in the Dewan Rakyat in July.\nThe new legislation targets those born in and after 2005, who would be prohibited from buying, possessing or consuming tobacco products, including cigarettes and vape.\nThis move aims to ultimately ban access to tobacco and nicotine by Malaysian youth and future generations. This strategy is termed the Generational End Game (GEG).\nSome may argue that the bold move to eliminate legal products that have been in Malaysia for hundreds of years will not work. It took the human race decades to understand the devastating effects of tobacco use. This addictive substance is linked to various types of cancers, heart and lung diseases, and disorders connected to virtually every organ in our body.\nAs technology advances, nicotine addiction takes on a new form.\nThe electronic nicotine delivery system or vape makes it more convenient to replenish one’s nicotine withdrawal with fruity flavourings to mask the vicious dependence behind it.\nStudies have proved that nicotine is as addictive as cocaine and heroin, and may in fact be more addictive.\nI am certain that if we had known this fact decades ago, tobacco and nicotine would be made illegal for people, just like illicit drugs.\nThe GEG’s ultimate goal is to control tobacco use. It makes total sense that we have the will to make it happen.\nMalaysia will not be the first to propose a tobacco-free generation plan.\nSingapore has been planning since 2010 to totally ban access to tobacco products by all those born in 2000 and beyond. In a country where falling ill is a very costly affair, it’s no wonder that the move to create a healthier nation has strong public support.\nBrunei is perhaps one of the best examples of nations that strive hard to end the tobacco epidemic. Its stringent tobacco licensing policy, importation tax, smoke-free zones and a total ban on vape have made tobacco products virtually impossible to obtain.\nCongratulations to Brunei for achieving a single-digit prevalence figure of tobacco use in its youth population, as evident in a 2019 survey.\nNew Zealand also plans to ban youths from ever buying cigarettes in their lifetime. Through this policy, New Zealanders aged 14 and below in 2027 will not be allowed to buy cigarettes anywhere in the country.\nA bill will be introduced in Parliament next month, with the aim of making it law by the end of this year. New Zealand may soon become the first country in the world to achieve its own GEG.\nTasmania, an island-state in Australia, which is about one fifth the size of Malaysia, advocates a legislation barring the sale of tobacco to individuals born after 2000 to prevent youths from becoming nicotine addicts.\nTasmania also plans to raise the legal smoking age to 21.\nCan you see a pattern here? More countries around the world are having tobacco-free generation strategies and working passionately towards achieving the goal.\nThe benefits of removing all tobacco products, including the electronic nicotine delivery system or vape, from the environment will be greater than just for health reasons. A healthy generation will create a progressive, productive and prosperous nation.\nI watched a video recently in which children do not have a clue what a cassette tape is!\nWouldn’t it be nice if one day, the younger generation do not know what a cigarette, cigar or vape pod is?\nThat dream can come true if we all come together and make the right decision now for the sake of our children, and their children.\nThey should not be exposed to any nicotine product, and smokers and vapers should be assisted in ending nicotine addiction.\nOur younger generations (Z, Alpha and others) will face different kinds of life trials and tribulations in this seemingly tougher world.\nHaving effective nicotine addiction policies will help millions of young Malaysians get a great start in life.

We must end it now.\nDr Nizan Baharom. The writer is Public Health Medicine Specialist, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia (USIM)","The use of tobacco products continues to be a worldwide issue. In the U.K. the phase shift has begun with Scotland. Major steps have been taken here to limit the use, and dampen any future use of tobacco products.\nThe Steps Taken Thus Far\nScotland is blazing the trail towards a tobacco free society. In fact Scotland was the first member of the U.K. to implement a public smoking ban in 2006. Since that time the country has further restricted the tobacco industry and the way tobacco is marketed to the public.\nA recent restriction that has been seen is the standardization of cigarette packaging. As explained by Dr. Harpal Kumar, the U.K.’s Cancer Research chief executive, Scotland would replace, “…glitzy, brightly colored packs that appeal to children with standard packs displaying prominent health warnings…” These health warnings and simple packages discourage the purchase of cigarettes, however, it is unclear whether these rules will also apply to related products such as chewing tobacco and the electronic cigarette.\nIn addition to standardized packaging, more legislation has been passed to further inhibit tobacco distribution. The Tobacco and Primary Medical Services Act of 2010 banned the sale of cigarettes in vending machines throughout Scotland. This act however, received much resistance from the Imperial Tobacco manufacturer, which caused its implementation to be delayed. Never the less the act was passed and made effective immediately for large retailers, yet allowing smaller retailers to comply by 2015 without penalty.\nAlthough these past action have proven effective in reducing smoking, Scotland has taken this battle a step further. This year the country has put into effect a ban on any display of cigarettes in public retailing stores in hopes of further reducing the country’s smoking rate. The goal: a smoke free Scotland by 2034. Many retailers are up in arms stating that the display of cigarettes does not influence the purchasing decisions of individuals. Regardless of the outcries the Scottish government is determined to enact every policy possible to realize a smoke free society. In fact, the Scottish government has announced plans to ban smoking on hospital grounds by 2015.\nThe Reasoning Behind the Ban\nIn Scotland, over 13,000 deaths and 56,000 hospital admissions are seen each year due to smoking. Smoking is the most prevalent cause of preventable death in this country and in many other countries as well. These numbers have caught the eye of the Scottish government and have spurred them to action.\nThe governments main reasoning behind these bans is the hope of reducing the amount of youths that smoke. National educational marketing programs are being financed to enable youths to see the dangers of smoking. By influencing the younger generations, the Scottish government hopes to see an increase in the health of the overall population in the coming years.\nScotland, however, is not the only country to set their sights on these proactive goals. New Zealand hopes to be tobacco free by 2025 and Finland plans to follow suit by 2040.\nThese are progressive times, and all across the world actions are being taken to decrease smoking rates in hopes of creating better habits and healthier populations. Scotland is on track to meet their lofty goal, however, we will have to wait and see if they can accomplish what they have set out to do."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f454cb5f-ba29-43e3-af4a-2d08aa6087de>","<urn:uuid:d18260d1-166f-44b7-926c-6e87ea8956ce>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What percentage of bacteria cause diseases compared to cholera's annual infection rate?","answer":"Less than 1% of bacteria are harmful and can cause diseases. In contrast, cholera alone affects approximately 1-4 million people annually, with death rates ranging from 20,000 to 125,000 per year.","context":["Do most microbes cause disease?\nA few harmful microbes, for example less than 1% of bacteria, can invade our body (the host) and make us ill. Microbes cause infectious diseases such as flu and measles….Microbes and disease.\n|Infectious disease||Microbe that causes the disease||Type of microbe|\n|TB (Tuberculosis)||Mycobacterium tuberculosis||Bacterium|\nAre the majority of microbes harmful?\nThe vast majority of microorganisms are not harmful but rather beneficial. Microbiota refers to all of the microorganisms that live in a particular environment. A microbiome is the entire collection of genes found in all of the microbes associated with a particular host.\nDo some microbes cause disease?\nA variety of microorganisms can cause disease. Pathogenic organisms are of five main types: viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and worms. Some common pathogens in each group are listed in the column on the right.\nAre microbes good or bad for humans?\nMicroscopic creatures—including bacteria, fungi and viruses—can make you ill. But what you may not realize is that trillions of microbes are living in and on your body right now. Most don’t harm you at all. In fact, they help you digest food, protect against infection and even maintain your reproductive health.\nWhere do most microbes reside in the human body?\nMicrobes inhabit just about every part of the human body, living on the skin, in the gut, and up the nose. Sometimes they cause sickness, but most of the time, microorganisms live in harmony with their human hosts, providing vital functions essential for human survival.\nWhy do some microbes make us sick?\nBacteria are also used in making healthy foods like yogurt and cheese. But infectious bacteria can make you ill. They reproduce quickly in your body. Many give off chemicals called toxins, which can damage tissue and make you sick.\nAre there any diseases that are caused by microorganisms?\nThe microbes that are harmful and capable of producing microorganism diseases also termed as pathogens. But not all the microbes are harmful and they do not cause microbial infection. Rather some are useful as well and serve in our everyday life.\nHow are microbes harmful to the human body?\nA few harmful microbes, for example less than 1% of bacteria, can invade our body (the host) and make us ill. Microbes cause infectious diseases such as flu and measles. There is also strong evidence that microbes may contribute to many non–infectious chronic diseases such as some forms of cancer and coronary heart disease.\nHow is the human microbiome related to disease?\nThey used DNA sequencing technologies adapted from those first developed during the Human Genome Project to analyze these microbial communities. Microbiome-associated diseases are usually not infectious, but have a proportion that can be explained by the human microbiome.\nWhen is it unethical to use a disease causing microbe?\nFor example if a disease-causing microbe has humans as its sole host and has a significant possibility of causing death, it would be unethical to apply this microbe to test humans as dictated by postulate 3. Also, it is not always possible to obtain a disease-causing microbe in pure culture.\nAre the majority of bacteria known to cause disease?\nThe vast majority of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system, though many are beneficial, particularly in the gut flora. However, several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, and bubonic plague.\nWhat is microbe capable of causing disease?\nA microbe that is capable of causing disease is referred to as a pathogen, while the organism being infected is called a host. The ability to cause disease is referred to as pathogenicity, with pathogens varying in their ability.\nWhat are the harmful effects of microorganisms?\nHarmful microorganisms can spoil our food, leather, clothing etc. One another harmful effect of microorganisms is that they cause diseases in plants, animals and even human beings.\nDo most microorganisms cause diseases?\nIn the 1880s, Robert Koch discovered that microorganisms caused the diseases tuberculosis, cholera, diphtheria and anthrax . Microorganisms include all unicellular organisms and so are extremely diverse. Of the three domains of life identified by Carl Woese, all of the Archaea and Bacteria are microorganisms.","Cholera is an infection that is caused by a bacterium known as Vibrio cholerae, which attacks the small intestines. This disease is extremely contagious, especially in areas where there is poor sanitation or during disasters such as floods. It is capable of killing people who are infected within hours in severe cases if it is not treated promptly.\nAccording to research statistics, an approximate of a million to four million cases of cholera infections are reported yearly. The annual number of deaths due to cholera can range from twenty thousand to an eighth of a million.\nCholera affects adults and children, as well as men and women alike. Therefore, cholera is a disease that can affect anyone. However, there are people who are more prone to getting it than others. There are places where cholera is endemic. In other areas, it breaks out as an epidemic.\n\"Endemic\" means that a particular disease is native to the place. There have been several cholera outbreaks in the past that have caused deaths in thousands or even in millions. Cholera epidemics usually arise in areas with poor sanitation and scarce resources like water and toilets.\nThe areas that have been affected by wars, natural disasters, poverty, or any other factors that force people to overcrowd are the most prone to massive outbreaks of cholera. The reason is that such places will most likely have poor sanitation and means of waste disposal more so feces. The bacteria that cause cholera will thrive under such conditions.\nCholera is mainly transmitted through contaminated food and water. Flies are the main carriers of the bacteria to the food. When they land on the food, they contaminate it, and whoever eats the food, also gets infected. Eating an undercooked food will also make people get infected if the bacteria were present in the meal.\nContaminated water also helps in spreading the disease. Basically, human feces are the carriers of Vibrio cholerae. When clean water gets into contact with the bacteria, it becomes contaminated. Anyone who drinks such water or uses it to cook food gets infected.\nWho is more prone to the infection?\nCholera is a highly communicable disease. Aside from living in areas where there are epidemics or factors that favor its spread, the following people are more likely to be infected:\nKids like playing a lot. They can carry out their games near sewers, pits, around latrines, and at times, as they play with water, their games can be held in ponds. All these are the places that are prone to have the bacteria that cause cholera.\nTherefore, children get exposed to factors that aid in the spread of the disease more than adults. When they come into contact with the contaminated water, the likelihood that they will get cholera is very high. The reason is that some will suck their fingers afterward or eat food without washing their hands. Through unhygienic practices, they will introduce the bacteria into their bodies.\n2. Careless Doctors and Nurses\nCareless doctors and nurses who handle cholera patients are also likely to get the disease. The reason is that some of the healthcare professionals do not observe maximum caution when dealing with their patients, e.g., not wearing gloves. Eating food without washing their hands after handling the patients also heightens their risk of getting infected.\n3. Family Members and Friends of Victims\nWhen people get sick, the closest around them are the ones who take care of them. Such people may include friends or family, which makes them prone to getting infected, too.\nParts of the World that Are Most Affected by Cholera\nThe parts of the world that are most affected by cholera are:\n- South-East Asia\n- Some parts of Africa\n- Central America\n- Central Mexico\nThese areas are heavily populated and the levels of sanitation are extremely low. These areas are able to provide a suitable place for the bacteria to exist and multiply.\nHow does cholera cause death?\nWhen the bacteria get inside your body, they cause diarrhea that can be very violent in some cases. Severe diarrhea results to dehydration of the body. In severe cases, the blood pressure drops and infected people go into a state of shock. If they do not receive medical attention quickly, death occurs within hours.\nWhat are the symptoms of cholera?\nPeople with cholera show symptoms differently. Some may experience symptoms within a few hours after infection, while in others, symptoms may begin to show after several days. The symptoms of cholera may include:\n- very watery diarrhea (main symptom)\n- muscle cramps can also occur at times\n- diarrhea that usually leads to an excessive loss of water from the body (dehydration)\nDehydration can cause the following conditions:\n- development of wrinkles on the hands and feet\n- the skin becoming less elastic\n- sunken eyes\nPeople who experience severe dehydration will require an immediate correction of the fluid imbalance in their body. Therefore, they have to be hydrated in order to prevent any further damage or complications.\nTips on How to Minimize the Risks of Getting Cholera\nOne of the ways used to control cholera is the use of a vaccine. However, vaccination is not a guarantee, as the vaccine does not usually last for long. That is why it becomes necessary to avoid getting infected with cholera. There are a number of things that you can do to lower your chances of being infected by the disease. Listed below are tips on how to prevent a cholera infection:\n- Parents should always be aware of their kids’ activities. They should keep track of where they spend their time and make sure that it is not in areas where they are likely to pick up the bacteria. The levels of hygiene should also be very high. They should make sure that the kids wash their hands before they eat and after they use the toilet.\n- Implementing high standards of sanitation and hygiene also make you less likely to get infected.\n- Doctors, nurses, or any other medical practitioners who handle patients with cholera should also exercise caution by using protective gears such as gloves. They should also observe high levels of sanitation.\n- Any friends or relatives around a person with cholera should also be careful in how they carry out themselves, especially on hygiene issues.\nThe Bottom Line\nCholera is a water-borne disease. Since this bacteria will more likely be transmitted through water, it is very important to be careful when using water in areas that are prone to the disease. Drinking water should be well-boiled and food should also be cooked properly. These precautions will help ensure that the bacteria are killed by the heat.\nThe main issue is for hygiene to be exercised at the highest of levels. If it is possible, avoid areas that prone to the disease. If you cannot avoid these places, then following the above-given tips should allow you a better chance at avoiding the disease.\nAnyone can get cholera and children are the ones that are most likely to get infected. Thus, keep an eye on your kids and should they show any symptoms, visit a medical facility as quickly as possible as they can get worse quickly and even die.\n- Who Gets Cholera?\n- Cholera Risk Factors\n- Prevention of Cholera"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dcb9eb20-ff67-4c3e-8fab-47a93c41c489>","<urn:uuid:46c4c8dd-72b2-464a-8d37-ff6bdee772f1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do prevention strategies for graffiti and identity theft compare in terms of physical security measures - what role does securing physical spaces play in both types of crime?","answer":"Both crimes rely on physical security measures but in different ways. For graffiti prevention, physical security focuses on environmental design - using rough concrete surfaces, chain link fences, thorny plants, good lighting, and restricted access to walls. For identity theft prevention, physical security emphasizes securing documents and information storage - keeping sensitive documents in locked drawers, protecting computers behind locked doors, controlling access to spaces with personal information, and being mindful of who has access like household employees or work crews. In both cases, the physical measures aim to create barriers that make it harder for criminals to access their targets.","context":["Graffiti is Everybody’s Problem\nGraffiti costs American communities more than $8 billion per year. It hurts property values, drives away business, and sends the message that nobody cares about the community. Graffiti is everybody’s problem. Here’s what you can do to help.\nDownload the printable pamphlet\n- Report graffiti immediately. The sooner it is reported, the sooner it can be removed.\n- If you see graffiti in progress, report it—don’t try to intervene. Some places have graffiti hotlines or tiplines, which usually offer anonymity to people reporting crimes.\n- Encourage everyone in the community to report graffiti as soon as it happens.\n- Contact the property owner whose building has been vandalized by graffiti. Stress the importance of quick cleanup. Form a neighborhood group to help property owners clean up graffiti quickly.\n- Take a photo of the graffiti. It may provide information that will lead to identification of the vandal.\n- Removing graffiti promptly (within the first 24 hours if possible) is the best way to prevent it. Prompt, persistent removal usually results in a nearly zero rate of recurrence. Before any graffiti removal begins, however, find out whether the police want to photograph it as evidence.\n- Paint a mural over the graffiti if the site is suitable. Involve the community in painting a mural to celebrate the history of the community or its diversity. (Ask local paint companies to donate the supplies.) Vandals seldom put graffiti on murals.\n- When painting over graffiti, save some of the paint for touchups in the event of future vandalism.\n- Some municipal governments have guidelines for removing graffiti. Check with your local government.\n- Look in the Yellow Pages (under “Graffiti Removal”) or on the Web for companies that specialize in cleaning up graffiti.\n- Check your local laws. In some jurisdictions, property owners are given a certain time period in which they must remove graffiti, after which a violation can be issued.\n- Rapid removal is one of the best ways to prevent future graffiti. Removing graffiti tells the vandals that people care about the community and that their work has little chance of being seen.\n- Plain smooth surfaces invite graffiti. For walls, choose patterned and rough concrete surfaces or tiled or mosaic surfaces; for fences, use chain, lattice, or wooden picket fences.\n- Choose paints and coatings to deter graffiti. Dark colors make graffiti harder to see. Antigraffiti coatings are available as well. A sacrificial coating is one that can be easily removed if graffiti artists strike. A protective coating can be easily cleaned.\n- Plant trees, shrubs, or climbing vines to restrict access to tempting walls. Plants with thorns or strong scents are good deterrents.\n- Use good lighting to deter vandals from popular graffiti sites.\n- Encourage community groups to adopt a wall or area to keep it clean, well maintained, and graffiti free.\n- Encourage local merchants who sell paint and painting supplies to become responsible retailers. Responsible retailers observe existing laws against selling spray paint and broad-tipped markers to customers under the age of 18 and do not display these items where they might be vulnerable to shoplifting. They post warning signs about the penalties for graffiti vandalism.\n- Coordinate a graffiti awareness campaign in your community. Educate potential graffiti artists about the legal consequences of graffiti vandalism: the vandal’s driver’s license may be suspended, and fines—or even jail time—may be the result of future offenses. Victims of graffiti may sue the perpetrator’s parents, and the parents may be fined or ordered to provide restitution.\n- Encourage anyone you think might be tempted to do graffiti to check out art schools instead or to get involved by doing posters, murals, and other art projects at their schools.\n- Involve the media. Distribute information about the harm graffiti vandalism can do to a community. But caution them not to display the work. Graffiti vandals want their work to be seen and publicizing graffiti only encourages them.\n- Contact Keep America Beautiful (www.kab.org) to see what you can do to make your community beautiful and crime free.","Identity theft, which hits more than 12 million Americans per year — carries a per victim cost of nearly $5,000, according to some reports. So, the need to protect yourself is obvious.\nAnd protection doesn’t have to be costly in terms of money or time. Here are 10 quick, easy and free ways to reduce your risk:\n1. Mail outgoing bills from the post office or a secure USPS dropbox, not your unlocked home mailbox. The reason: Thieves cruise neighborhoods, looking for upright flags indicating outgoing mail, and steal check-containing envelopes addressed to mortgage, credit card and other vendors. Not only do invoices and checks reveal account information, but checks can be “washed” to steal money from your bank account. Also try to retrieve incoming mail soon after its delivery.\n2. Get off mailing lists for pre-approved credit card offers. These are a gold mine for mail-stealing identity thieves. Call 1-888-567-8688 from your home phone or visit optoutprescreen.com. This service, run by the three credit reporting bureaus, requires your Social Security number when you call by phone. Avoid that step by opting-out online. Stop other so-called junk mail at dmachoice.org.\n3. Build better passwords. Those with at least 12 keystrokes — versus the often advised eight characters — can take hackers using automated programs (or their own know-how) longer to crack. For easier recall when mixing upper- and lower-case letters, numerals and symbols, consider using your favorite song or poem as a guide. For instance, Avicii’s “Wake Me Up” refrain becomes “Wmuwiao@!” Change or add a different digit on each account for maximum protection.\n4. Consider free antivirus software. Many Internet and cellphone providers offer subscribers free antivirus and malware protection software. Sometimes they include pricier “security suite” products. Many leading vendors also provide free downloads, including AVG, Avast, BitDefender and MalwareBytes.\n5. Password-protect your smartphone (done by only one in three users) with a PIN that isn’t 1234, 0000, 2580, 1111 or 5555 — the most easily hacked. Set it on auto-lock and install a location-tracking app, which is already installed on iPhones but needs to be activated.\n6. Avoid making copies of medical, tax-related or other sensitive documents on digital copiers at libraries or businesses. They are often leased, and information stored on their hard drives can be retrieved by scammers who subsequently purchase them.\n7. Use a crosscut shredder before disposing documents that contain key personal identifiers — account numbers, passwords and PINs, SSNs and birth dates. Consider shredding items with your name, address and phone number. So-called Dumpster diving is messy and less-than-stealthy, but still accounts for about 4% of identity theft cases.\n8. Access your free credit report once a year from each of the three major credit bureaus. Regular reviews can lead to discovering fraudulent credit accounts opened in your name. You can also monitor your credit for free using the Credit Report Card, which updates your credit scores monthly.\n9. Never click on links in emails from strangers, or those purporting to be from a government agency. (Uncle Sam usually sends official correspondence by mail.) Don’t provide Social Security numbers or other sensitive info to unsolicited callers. When scanning the Web, access websites by typing the address yourself rather than relying on links found through search engines.\n10. Keep doors and drawers secure. Identity thieves can’t steal your information if they can’t get to it. Keep computers, paper files such as bank or credit card statements, passports, Social Security cards, earnings statements, birth certificates and any other documents with personal identifying information behind closed — and locked — doors or in locked drawers. Always be aware of who has access, such as household employees or work crews — and even family members."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a11034d7-35c3-4347-b1ec-8568e37254a7>","<urn:uuid:b620a9ac-c5cd-479e-905c-5f3444d74a6a>"],"error":null}

Features include email marketing, web tracking, lead scoring, and social media tools.\nFounded in 1996, the company was originally known as AdventNet. Zoho released the Zoho CRM application in 2005 and by mid-2008, had over 1 million users.\nSoftware As A Service (SaaS)\nThe majority of CRM systems are provided as Software As A Service (SaaS). In a SaaS model, users don’t purchase a version of the software outright. Instead, the client licenses the software on a subscription basis. The vendor hosts the software on a centrally located server. This model is also commonly referred to as a “cloud-based” service.\nRoughly 72.9% of spending on CRM software in 2018 was SaaS. Experts estimate that this number will grow in 2019 to approximately 75% of total spending.\nSuccessful CRM implementation is based on 3 primary components.\nTechnology is the core of your implementation. You should give careful consideration to all aspects of your integration:\n- Is the application provided on a SaaS model or is it locally hosted?\n- Are there any specific minimum equipment requirements necessary to run the application?\n- What kind of support does the software company provide?\n- What about backups, downtime, and security?\nThese are just a few of the questions that you should ask with any software implementation. (This post about ERP implementation may be helpful as well since ERP and CRM integrations have many shared components.)\nOf course, since people are going to be using your new CRM, it’s important to consider how it will impact your team. As a result, you need to consider factors such as the usability and training requirements of the new system.\nSoftware applications should make life easier for your staff, not harder.\nFor any software to work effectively, having established business processes is critical. Everyone has probably heard the phrase “garbage in, garbage out”. This is an appropriate description of how software applications work.\nIt doesn’t matter how good the CRM is. If you don’t have accurate data and your people don’t follow your processes, your results will be disappointing.\nTo successfully implement CRM software in your organization, you need to focus on all three components and their role in the system. It’s important to also remember that every organization is unique. You need an application that complements your business and manner of operations.\nFinding a “perfect fit” for your needs may be difficult. If so, having a generic framework for implementing CRM can be a good starting point. While not ideal, you can optimize it later to suit your specific business requirements.\nHow To Implement CRM\n5 Easy CRM Implementation Steps\nStep 1: Assign a Point Person\nEvery project needs strong leadership to succeed. Your CRM implementation is no different. Your Project Manager (PM) should have a solid understanding of your business’s needs and processes.\nYou may not have someone internally with the skill sets to manage a project of this nature. If this is the case, then don’t worry. That’s not a show-stopper. Consider hiring an outside consultant to oversee and guide the implementation for you.\nImplementing CRM software is a substantial amount of work. For this reason, you will most likely need to build a team to manage all the details. Your PM should be responsible for building and managing the team.\nYour team should work collaboratively and good communication is a must. There are countless details that you need to consider and address. Make sure that your team is organized and thorough. If they aren’t, it’s likely that you will miss something.\nTruth be told, on a project of this size, something will almost always get missed. You just want to make sure that any oversights are as inconsequential as possible.\nFile sharing tools and checklists are worth their weight in gold.#ProTip\nStep 2: Define Goals and Objective\nThe next step of the process is to analyze your current situation and define your goals. You need to decide what specific issues and processes you want your CRM to control, as well as your desired outcome.\nAre you looking to solve existing problems? Is your goal simply to just increase your visibility of business activities? Whatever your reasons, make sure that you clearly understand what it is that you’re trying to accomplish. More importantly, make sure that implementing CRM software will achieve those goals.\nYou also need to make sure that you’re prepared to implement a software application of this magnitude. To do this, you’ll need to:\n- Define your goals and objectives. Be sure that a CRM platform is going to be the solution that you need.\n- Assess whether the organization has the resources to implement CRM. These include human, financial, technological, and process-oriented resources.\n- Develop an implementation strategy.\n- Establish and communicate CRM implementation as an organization-wide goal.\nStep 3: Researching Vendors\nResearch the vendors that can provide you with CRM software. This involves the following:\n- Analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the vendor’s software\n- Researching on the vendor’s experience in CRM systems\n- Evaluating the level of support they provide to clients\n- Asking for references\nMake sure that you choose a CRM product that can complement the procedures currently in place and automate them.\nStep 4: Develop Your Implementation Plan\nOnce you make the decision to implement a new platform, communicate it as an organizational objective and develop an implementation plan. The plan is where the rubber meets the road, so make sure you devote whatever resources are necessary to be thorough. Poor planning will come back to haunt you.\n- Understand how all the users involved in the CRM process work. This means your sales, customer service, finance, marketing, and IT teams. It also involves your suppliers and partners. This will help you develop a CRM interface that can be readily adapted to your workflows.\n- Provide training to your staff. No system will work well if your people don’t know how to use it. Don’t skimp here.\n- Identify and make contingency plans for roadblocks and obstacles.\nFrom a technological point of view, you must understand what goes into your customer relationship management procedures. You need to choose a system that complements your existing processes and procedures and can enhance them accordingly. This also involves engaging consumers, troubleshooting, and gathering data for each business contact.\nData Management and Integration\nOptimize your CRM to gather the data both in terms of quantity and quality. This will help you assess the needs of your customers and improve accordingly.\nIt’s also important to integrate CRM processes across all channels of communication. For instance, your website is a valuable component in this regard. Aim for automation to enhance the productivity of your CRM system. This can also involve possible redesigns in your current processes to increase compatibility.\nStep 5: Monitor and Review Results\nThe final step of implementing CRM involves measuring your success and recording the benefits. You can do this by answering the following questions:\n- Were you able to realize all the objectives defined in your CRM strategy?\n- Has your customer relationship management improved post-CRM implementation?\n- How has CRM impacted your marketing performance?\n- How has CRM contributed to the financial position of your company?\n- What external factors have played a role in the success/failure of your CRM system?\n- What were the biggest obstacles to implementing CRM?\nAfter measuring the performance of your CRM implementation, you can re-assess the areas that require improvement. Identify gaps that need to be addressed with your review process. Monitor your results so you can continually refine your processes to get the most out of your investment.\nCustomer Relationship Management software is a valuable addition to just about any small business. However, the integration of these systems can be extremely challenging. As a result, utilizing proven CRM implementation steps can help ensure a successful integration that can do wonders for your business."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:129106a8-285f-4052-8f69-5944d90e9e84>","<urn:uuid:b05740a4-f6c0-45ef-b063-e8008d2356dd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did yoga practice impact healthcare utilization according to Massachusetts General Hospital research?","answer":"According to a study at Massachusetts General Hospital, patients who studied yoga for a year showed a 43% reduction in their healthcare use.","context":["As a caregiver, it is important to be aware that fiber intake is the key to successful aging according to a recent study from Australia. Seniors with the highest intake of fiber had an almost 80% greater chance of living a long and healthy life.\nEven the scientists were surprised by the results. Fiber had a greater impact than any other dietary factor they studied, including sugar consumption. Adults who ate more complex carbohydrates significantly lowered their risk for hypertension, diabetes, dementia, depression, and disabilities.\nIf you want to live a longer and enjoy a more active life without eating like a rabbit, study these practical tips. You’ll learn new facts about fiber and how to include more roughage in your diet.\nFacts about Fiber\n1) Understand your needs. The average North American eats about 15 grams of fiber a day, which is far below the recommended levels. Individual requirements decrease slightly with age, and vary from a minimum of 21 to 25 grams for women and 30 to 38 grams for men.\n2) Cover both bases. Fiber comes in two forms, soluble and insoluble, depending on whether it dissolves in water. Soluble fiber lowers cholesterol and protects your heart. Insoluble fiber enhances your digestion and helps you stay regular. Eating a variety of foods provides enough of both.\n3) Know the benefits. Foods rich in fiber make you feel full with fewer calories so you can manage your weight. They also help you stabilize your blood sugar and reduce your risk for certain cancers, heart disease, and diabetes.\n4) Take it gradually. Give your digestive system time to adapt to more fiber. Add about 2 to 3 grams a week to avoid bloating and diarrhea.\n5) Drink more water. Drinking plenty of water will maximize the digestive benefits of fiber, and minimize constipation and gas. Stay hydrated around the clock.\nEating More Fiber\n1) Breakfast hearty. It’s easier to take in more fiber when you start early. Prepare a bean burrito or whip up a smoothie with kale and fresh fruit.\n2) Adjust the menu. Bulk up the dishes you love with a few simple tweaks. Stir shredded cabbage or carrots into chili and meatloaf. Top off your pizza with mushrooms and onions. Sprinkle a cup of beans into your salad.\n3) Switch to whole grains. Trade in ultra-processed white bread and rice for their healthier versions. Order brown rice when you’re eating out. Make sandwiches with whole wheat wraps.\n4) Cook fast. Some cooking methods, like boiling, rob vegetables of fiber and important nutrients. Steaming or microwaving will let you enjoy all their goodness.\n5) Bake at home. You don’t even have to give up cookies and cake to make room for fiber. Rely on your own oven instead of supermarket brands so you can use ingredients like oats and whole wheat flour.\n6) Keep the peels. Stop wasting apple and potato skins. Many vegetables and fruits have edible peels and seeds packed with fiber.\n7) Snack smart. Use snacks as well as meals to help you reach your fiber goals. Dip raw vegetables into hummus. Create a trail mix with dried fruit, nuts, and seeds.\n8) Read labels. Manufacturers know that consumers are looking to eat more fiber. Check the label to see how many grams a product really contains. When an item says it’s an excellent source of fiber, it must contain at least 5 grams per serving.\nThe verdict is clear. Fiber can help manage weight now, and help protect from heart conditions and other diseases with the aging process. To help reach the golden years with fewer health issues and higher functioning, eat more complex carbohydrates like vegetables, nuts, breads, and fruits.\nHappiness is elusive without a sense of self-worth. If you’re not happy with yourself, how can you be happy about life in general? Self-worth is about believing that you have value as a person. It’s not how you compare to others. It’s your belief in your intrinsic value as a human being. We’re all important. Some of us just require a little more convincing than others.\nMaximize your feelings of self-worth with these 11 ways:\n1) Forgive yourself. You have plenty of guilt and resentment toward yourself that you’ve been carrying around for years. You chose the wrong major in college or broke up with your significant other via text. Give yourself a break and vow to do better in the future.\n2) Volunteer. Spending your time in a valuable and selfless way is a quick means to raise your opinion about yourself. Just two hours a week has been shown to make a difference.\n3) Avoid gossiping. Gossip probably has gotten you in trouble in the past, and you know you shouldn’t do it. Try pointing out positive traits and actions in others, instead. You’ll both feel better!\n4) Face a few of your smaller fears. We feel bad that we’re afraid of things that we know we shouldn’t fear. Face a few small fears and overcome them. You’ll be impressed with yourself.\n5) Set personal boundaries and enforce them. There’s no reason to allow others to use or manipulate you. Decide what you consider to be reasonable behavior and enforce it. Word will spread, and your life will be smoother.\n6) Set goals you can achieve. It’s important to have big goals, but small goals are important, too. Big goals lead to big accomplishments, but smaller goals can provide a great lift to your self-worth. Make it easy to succeed on a regular basis. Completing your daily to-do list is an example of completing a smaller goal.\n7) Define your values and live by them. It’s important to determine what you’re willing to do and what you’re not willing to do, as well as what’s important and unimportant to you. If you’re able to live by these values, you won’t have a reason to think badly of yourself.\nMost people don’t take the time to define their values. They rely on a vague sense of right and wrong from childhood. Give it some thought and put your ideas down on paper. When you’re stuck with a tough decision, pull out the list.\n8) Be willing to make changes in your life. The same life will provide the same results. Some changes will be necessary if your goal is to enhance your self-worth.\n9) Voice your opinion. Do you keep your opinion to yourself because you think no one cares? Maybe you put everyone else’s happiness above your own. Neither is good for your self-image. Your opinion matters. Share it.\n10) Minimize time spent with others who don’t appreciate you. Do you have a friend or family member that drags down your self-worth? Think about letting them go or spending less time with them.\n11) Make decisions. Indecisiveness creates stress and frustration. It’s also a way of avoiding responsibility. Take a reasonable amount of time and then pull the trigger. You’ll feel more in control of your life.\nWhen you think negatively about yourself, you lower your expectations. You even begin to look for reasons to support those thoughts. This is the ultimate in self-defeating behaviors. Your feelings of self-worth influence your ability to be happy and successful. Be proud of who you are as a person. Life will be easier and more enjoyable.\nWhen caring for others, it can be easy to forget about our own needs. It may take more than an apple a day to keep the doctor away, but a healthy diet and other simple lifestyle changes can keep you from becoming ill. Learn how to develop habits that will keep you fit and strong.\nMany experts blame the Standard American Diet (SAD) for high rates of obesity, diabetes, depression, and other serious conditions. Good nutrition can strengthen your immune system and lower your risk for many illnesses.\n1. Eat more produce. Fruits and vegetables are nutrient dense and light in calories. They’ll boost your immune system and help you stay hydrated. Plus, all that fiber can lower your risk of diabetes.\n2. Focus on whole foods. Processed foods are usually loaded with excessive fat, sugar, and salt. Try eating foods in their natural state.\n3. Limit alcohol. Too many cocktails can damage your liver and other organs. Most experts recommend up to one drink a day for women and two for men.\n4. Manage your weight. Carrying around too many pounds increases your risk of heart conditions, arthritis, and certain cancers. Stay slim by watching calories and leading an active life.\nOther Lifestyle Changes\nHere are a few more changes to go along with your balanced diet. They’ll have a major impact on your body and mind.\n5. Move around. Physical activity strengthens your heart and muscles. Aim to exercise at least 3 days a week. Take the stairs instead of the elevator.\n6. Sit less. Research suggests that the longer you sit, the poorer your health may be even if you exercise. If you have a desk job, try taking walking breaks every half hour. Cut back on your TV time.\n7. Do yoga. While any form of exercise and relaxation can be beneficial, yoga seems especially powerful. A study at Massachusetts General Hospital recorded a whopping 43% reduction in healthcare use among patients who studied yoga for a year.\n8. Deal with stress. If yoga is not your cup of tea, there are other ways to keep tension from piling up. Book a massage or listen to gentle music.\n9. Be happy. The more you’re satisfied with your life, the less you’ll need your doctor. On a scale of 1 to 6, a patient could expect an 11% decrease in doctor visits for each level of higher life satisfaction, according to one University of Michigan study.\n10. Adopt a pet. Holding your cat is good for mental and physical well being. The CDC says pets help people lower their blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. They also provide an antidote to loneliness.\n11. Connect with others. Speaking of loneliness, support from humans helps too. Close social ties can help you catch fewer colds, and may even extend your life.\n12. Sleep well. Adequate rest and sleep is vital to healing. Turn off the computer and TV in the evening and go to bed on time.\n13. Quit smoking. Giving up tobacco may be the most important thing you can do for your health. It takes an average of 5 to 10 attempts to quit for good, so hang in there.\nWorking through grief and loss, it is importance to maintain our physical health but mental and emotional health are just as critical. Exercise prevention whenever possible. Mental and emotional health issues can be very debilitating and challenging to treat.\nPlace a premium on your mental and emotional well being:\n1. Spend time with others socially. Your mental and emotional health won’t be optimal if you split all of your time between work and home. Spend some time in the company of others. Wednesday afternoon staff meetings don’t count! Humans are social beings and social interaction is a component of good mental health.\n2. Train your brain. Keep your brain active and healthy. Buy a book of crossword puzzles or brainteasers. Play chess or learn a musical instrument. One of the best ways to preserve your brain health is to challenge it each day.\n3. Take time for yourself. Between work, family, and maintaining a home, it can be challenging to find personal time. Nevertheless, spend a little time each day doing something that you enjoy. Even if it’s just sitting alone on your deck with a cup of coffee in the morning. Social activity is important. A little solitude is important, too.\n4. Spend time with positive people. Your thoughts, attitudes, and expectations mirror those of the people around you. By spending time with positive people, you’ll be more positive, too. Whom do you spend time with now\n5. Find a job that you enjoy. Besides sleep, you spend more time working than you do on any other single activity. If your job makes you miserable, your emotional health is sure to suffer. Money isn’t everything. Consider finding a career that you enjoy. You’ll be happier and more positive about the future.\n6. Share your time and yourself with your community. This is also a great social activity. You feel better about yourself and increase your sense of self-worth when you help others. There are plenty of opportunities to volunteer. Investigate a few and make a decision.\n7. Spend more time doing things you love to do. What makes you happy? Spend more time doing it. Do you love golf? Build a weekly round of golf into your schedule. How can you not be happier if you spend more time doing things that make you happy?\n8. Get sufficient sleep. Sleep is necessary for good health, both physical and mental. Those that lose the ability to sleep due to accident or illness die within several weeks. Your ability to manage stress, make smart decisions, and regulate your emotions are dependent on getting enough sleep.\n9. Have a compelling future. For your emotional health to be at its best, you need something to look forward to. It might be a date on Saturday night, a vacation, or retiring. It doesn’t matter what it is, but you need something in the future that makes you smile when you think of it.\nGive you mental health as much attention as you do your physical health. Strive to live a well-rounded life filled with enjoyable activities and people. Get enough sleep and find constructive ways to deal with stress. With good mental health, you’ll be able to handle any challenge that life throws at you.\nRemember to get professional help if you’re unable to maintain good mental health. You wouldn’t attempt to treat a physical disease by yourself. Put as much importance on your mental health. Avail yourself of expert assistance if necessary."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8a7a0eec-f9f6-487b-bcc9-467a76d655ca>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Religious Studies and Business Ethics courses compare in their approach to teaching ethics and morality from an educational perspective? What is common in their teaching methods? ¿Cuáles son las similitudes en sus métodos de enseñanza?","answer":"Both Religious Studies and Business Ethics courses share several teaching approaches. They both use case discussions to explore complex moral and ethical situations without easy answers. Religious Studies examines ethical theories and moral principles through topics like conscience and religious beliefs, while Business Ethics focuses on ethical decision-making in business contexts involving multiple stakeholders. Both subjects emphasize critical thinking and encourage students to defend their positions on difficult ethical issues. Additionally, both courses use practical examples - Religious Studies uses examples like the Problem of Evil explored during Auschwitz trips, while Business Ethics uses real business cases and literature to examine ethical challenges.","context":["Religion Studies is a subject that is central to world history, society and human life. It is very relevant for the world in which we live, since it informs our values, which are reflected in what we say and how we behave. A study of religion provokes challenging questions about the ultimate meaning and purpose of life, beliefs about God, the self and the nature of reality, issues of right and wrong and what it means to be human. A level Religious Studies lets you study the various philosophies and beliefs that underlie popular religions. It helps you understand the perspectives and motivations of believers and non-believers alike.\nAnyone who is interested in questions about the meaning of life, the historical basis for religion and the ideological foundations of human history and contemporary events will want to study Religious Studies, which investigates such issues in an intellectually serious way. Students of Religious Studies will grapple with ideas, which are often difficult but always interesting.\nReligious Studies is a well-regarded A level subject. The rigorous intellectual discipline that students develop, will assist them in almost any further study or career, since it is a subject which requires students to ask the big questions about human behaviour and motivation. Popular career options are law, journalism, counselling, community development work and charity fundraising.\nThe Religious Studies Department is committed to providing a supportive and purposeful learning environment. We aim to develop inquiring minds that are open to new ideas as well as being able to critically engage with them. As our students explore religion, ethics and philosophy it helps them develop a better understanding of the world around them and what motivates humans to constantly examine life and question the nature of their own existence.\nStudents who choose to study A level Religious Studies will follow the OCR A Level Religious Studies specification. This requires candidates to study three modules: Philosophy of Religion, Religion and Ethics, and Developments in Christian Thought.\nTopics taught include:\nPhilosophy of Religion:\n- Ancient philosophical influences\n- The nature of the soul, mind and body\n- Arguments about the existence or non-existence of God\n- The nature and impact of religious experience\n- The challenge for religious belief of the problem of evil\n- Ideas about the nature of God\n- Issues in religious language.\nReligion and Ethics:\n- Normative ethical theories\n- The application of ethical theory to euthanasia and business ethics\n- Ethical language and thought\n- Debates surrounding the significant idea of conscience\n- Sexual ethics and the influence on ethical thought of developments in religious beliefs.\nDevelopments in Christian Thought:\n- Augustine’s teaching on human nature\n- Death and the afterlife\n- Knowledge of God’s existence\n- The person of Jesus\n- Christian moral principles\n- Christian moral action\n- Religious pluralism, theology and society\n- Feminism, society and theology\n- The challenge of secularism\n- Liberation Theology and Marx\nThere are ten lessons per week and the course is typically taught by two teachers. Students are provided with a core textbook plus additional department handouts and digital resources. Students are regularly assessed through the submission of essays and seminar presentations.\nThe course is examined by three 2 hour exams at the end of the Upper Sixth.\nTrips, activities and clubs\nIn addition to our teaching there are a range of opportunities to support the development of Religious Studies knowledge including:\n- Philosophy Society\n- Lunchtime drop-in exam surgeries.\n- Cross-curricular trip to Auschwitz, with the History department.

Darden was one of the first business schools to incorporate such a requirement into the curriculum. The purpose of the course is to enable students to reason about the role of ethics in business administration in a complex, dynamic, global environment, often in the context of critical social and environmental challenges, and corporate social responsibility. Case discussions without easy answers focus on decision-making in situations involving multiple stakeholders, whether shareholders, employees, members of the local community, customers or governments. Students are encouraged to think deeply about the nature of business, the responsibilities of management, and how business and ethics can be put together. Students are pushed consider how they make decisions and develop their capacity to defend these decisions to other stakeholders. This is important as a way not only to foster integrity and responsible decision making, but also to push them to take leadership roles in dealing with complex and difficult choices they will face in their careers.\nThe Darden School of Business MBA program teaches that the role of business is to create value for all stakeholders. Integrated throughout our case-method curriculum is the theme that while business has one true bottom line, profitability, it must be achieved in an ethical, and socially- and environmentally-responsible manner.\nDarden is a general management program without formal majors. However, in choosing their second-year electives, students may opt for pursuing a concentrations, one of which is Innovation for Sustainability.\nDarden offers 20 elective courses that solely or partially focus on sustainability and ethical leadership/decision-making, and the role of business in society. Coursework includes tools essential for developing a successful sustainability strategy, such as stakeholder engagement and systems thinking. Specific courses are below. The majority of these courses also count toward the Innovation for Sustainability concentration [video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clG32ObivqA&feature=youtu.be], which aims to:\n1.Equip students with the ability to create and execute collaborative sustainability strategies to: increase firm revenues through innovative products and services; lower costs and raise profitability through efficiencies and design; create and enhance brands; better manage supply chains; and mitigate business risk.\n2.Instill knowledge about the global and systemic impacts on natural systems and human well-being from accelerating trends such as urbanization, industrialization, climate change and population growth, as well as emerging scientific knowledge.\n3.Inform students of regional and global institutions and policy instruments that influence business operations and strategy.\n1. Business Ethics through Literature\n2. Business-Government Relations\n3. Climate Change: Science, Markets & Policy (taught at UVA Law School adjacent to our Grounds; Darden students may register)\n4.

Sustainability, Innovation and Design in Scandinavia\n2. Israel: Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Israel\n3. Lessons from South Africa on the Need for Cooperation between the Public and Private Sectors to Grow an Economy\nCourses that are also recommended to enhance students’ ability to lead an organization effectively with an enterprise-wide perspective, capitalizing on sustainability risks and opportunities are:\n1. Innovation and Design Experience\n2. Leading Strategic Change\n3. Managing Innovation and Product Development\nDarden’s first year required coursework includes case discussions on sustainability and ethical leadership challenges. For example, in Strategy, students grapple with a case centered on BP’s evaluation of its long-term renewable energy portfolio. They must use strategy analysis tools to analyze what is best for the company in light of not only its core strengths and future projections, but also public perception after the oil spill.\nOther academic areas such as Accounting, Finance and Leading Organizations, similarly integrate cases addressing environmental and social issues.\nResearch Enhancing Curriculum\nDarden’s curriculum development is strengthened by five major research entities housed at Darden that conduct sustainability and ethics research geared toward both academic and business audiences.\n1. The Alliance for Research on Corporate Sustainability (ARCS)\n2. The Batten Institute for Entrepreneurship and Innovation\n3. The Business Roundtable Institute for Corporate Ethics\n4. The Institute for Business in Society (IBiS)\n5. The Olsson Center for Applied Ethics\nGiven that Darden is a case-method school, the case collection for Darden Business Publishing includes numerous cases written on the topic of sustainability. Examples include:\n1. Eastman Tritan: Case on launching a new BPA-free plastic and the associated supply challenges and opportunities. (Case was First Place winner of The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) Case and Materials Competition.)\n2.

First Coffee is a core tradition in Darden’s tight-knit community, making this a highly visible behavior change effort. Students have dedicated countless hours to leading the charge, designing and piloting new processes. They wrote a grant and secured $10K in funds through U.Va.’s Greening Initiatives Funding Tomorrow (GIFT) grant program in order to support the purchase of reusable mugs for a large pilot of 300. They have effectively engaged through discussions and mini-pilots all stakeholders along the way, from Hospitality to Housekeeping, from students to faculty, to ensure a superior and efficient experience.\nStudent leaders have also done what is challenging in student life: to carefully and effectively build upon the efforts of their student leader predecessors who co-wrote a case Embedding Sustainability: Refreshing First Coffee at Darden, and subsequently organized a case competition in which all five first-year sections competed for the ever-popular Darden cup points. Taking the best ideas from each of the case presentations, the current student leaders have carefully investigated options and brought them to life.\nTheir efforts are instrumental in Darden’s effort to be zero waste to landfill by 2020. To date we have reduced our waste by 59%. Changing our signature community event, First Coffee, will help us take another large step to zero.|\n|2: ||2.Additional Progress Toward Zero Waste\nRelative to our 2007 baseline, by end of 2013 Darden reduced solid waste generation by 59%, due to composting and recycling. We estimate that organics comprise approximately 50% of our waste stream, due to operating a very busy restaurant. Thus, composting has been the primary lever in effecting this change.\nDarden also maintains a robust recycling program, which accepts e-waste, glass, metal, plastics #1-7 (including plastic bags, straws and utensils), paper and cardboard. Waste not separated into recycling bins goes first to a material recovery facility, where additional recyclables are removed, before the remainder is sent to the landfill. Our ultimate goal is to be “zero to landfill”.|\n|3: ||3.Progress toward Carbon Neutral\nRelative to our 2007 baseline, by end of 2013 Darden reduced our carbon emissions by 19%, even as our academic programs have expanded. This progress has been enabled by recommissioning our building systems, and has also resulted in significant avoided energy costs. To support our efforts, Darden is also a partner in the Better Business Challenge, a competition among 75 local businesses over 12 months to earn the greatest number of energy efficiency and waste reduction “points”. We have learned a great deal by helping design the Challenge, and sharing information with other businesses committed to achieving sustainability goals.|"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b849b107-c59c-42d8-bd21-0e68c551bac8>","<urn:uuid:4f42f042-7963-4b01-9600-d404c0efe674>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the sustainable construction practices being implemented for CO2 reduction in modern buildings, and how are construction waste materials being effectively recycled on construction sites?","answer":"Sustainable construction practices include using wood as a primary building material since it has a low CO2 imprint, is locally produced, and creates a carbon sink. Buildings also utilize climate-improved concrete where alternatives aren't feasible, and reuse materials like bricks (up to 70% reused in some cases, saving approximately 80 tonnes of CO2). For construction waste recycling, about 65% of construction leftovers are inert waste (stones, demolition waste, bricks, glass) which, once sorted, can be used as embankment or backfill. Non-hazardous materials like wood, cardboard, plastic, and metal are also separated and recycled, contributing to waste reduction and environmental protection.","context":["High ambitions are great, but even better if they lead to something good. Part of our high-ambitions-package for the first construction phase along S:t Göransgatan was the decision to be one of the pilots in Sweden Green Building Council’s new certification NollCO2 (ZeroCO2) – a guide to a more climate smart way of building. This gave us access to knowledge and a network that turned out extremely valuable. But more importantly, this is a project based on Electrolux Group core values. Sustainability is at the core of our business, including a commitment to the United Nations Global Compact – Business ambition for 1.5°C – for net zero emissions throughout our value chain by 2050, in line with the 1.5°C climate target. Work in progress.\nSo, where have this lead us and what have we learnt along the way? Below we share some of the insights we have gained so far. The numbers below are not final, the project is ongoing, but should be seen as an indication of where we believe we will land.\nWe realized early on that it takes a long time to neutralize CO2 if you tear down and build new. This means that we tear down as little as possible. But, since we are constructing new buildings around an existing building, it meant that we got a lot of bricks over that will be reused in the new building’s façade. (Phase 1 of the process is done, and we reused as much as 70% of the bricks we took down – roughly 200 tonnes corresponding to a saving of approx. 80 tonnes CO2 equivalents vs new brick – Thanks Rival for a well-executed demolition!) We will also reuse floor tiles (installation floors) from the existing building. Armatures, bathroom fixtures, doors and glass-walls are other materials that we will reuse locally.\nBuilding in wood\nThe steel and cement industry (cement, the main raw material in concrete, is used for the foundation, floor joists and walls) are responsible for a large share of Sweden’s territorial CO2 emissions. We do use some steel and concrete – climate improved concrete – where we lack feasible alternatives (such as in the foundation work and the cellar) but our primary material is wood, namely fir trees from the woods of middle Sweden. Why? We believe that you live well in wood houses, wood has a low CO2 imprint, it is locally produced, and it is a renewable material that regenerates in a few generations. This also means that we create a carbon sink that can store CO2 in many generations to come.\nWhat about solar panels?\nThe NollCO2 framework does not consider the CO2 used to manufacture the solar cell panels, from raw material to finished product, in the building imprint. Instead, we can utilize the energy created by the solar panels. The framework assumes that each kWh produced by the solar cells reduces the consumption of coal power. Coal emits 820 g CO2 / kWh, while the solar panels imprint is estimated to 40 g/kWh (IPCC 2014). This means that the calculated CO2 saving amounts to 780 g / kWh per produced solar electricity. This calculation, needless to say, is a simplification given that the solar panels’ electricity production and the building’s electricity consumption don’t go hand in hand, but in frameworks you need simplifications in order to make calculations possible at all. In our project, we are satisfied to know that our solar cell panels on the roof improves the energy mix from a European perspective, and that is enough for us!\nAnyway, we were curious to find out more about the solar cell panels, which alongside wind power is one of the most common and most popular renewable energy sources. We had to work hard to obtain EPDs for the solar panels and realized that they varied very much primarily dependent on in which country they were manufactured(=the energy mix in the country). One thing that we found particularly interesting was that silicone, the semiconductor in the solar cells, represented up to 95% of the solar cells’ total CO2 imprint.\nKnowledge and conscious decisions\nBuilding carbon-low is an art that requires a lot of work. The market is not there yet. But the knowledge base is building up and the realization is here. It is possible – and wholly necessary – to make a difference with the help of knowledge and conscious decisions. As we write, the construction project that we have started along S:t Göransgatan (both the new office and apartments) has a total pre-calculated CO2 imprint of 175 kg CO2 per square meter. This translates into a total 2,500 tonnes CO2 for roughly 14,000 square meters, of which slightly more than 1,000 ton CO2 relates to brf Gourmet. For comparison, the baseline that the NollCO2 framework has calculated for us is 290 kg CO2/sqm. To meet the certification, we need to make sure that the house we build has an imprint that is at least 30% lower than that, or 200 kg CO2/sqm. This baseline takes into account the building’s specific design, if it has a basement, etcetera. If we had built “conventionally,” the imprint could have been substantially higher, more than 4,000 tonnes CO2. Even if it this is a theoretical mathematical exercise, it means that we avoided up to 1,500 tonnes of additional emissions – only by making CO2 an important part of our project. We have avoided – and now we must concentrate – 0,003% of the total CO2 that Sweden emits over a year (and yes, spent about 0,005%).\nTo conclude, and as a reference, it may be interesting here to mention that one cubic meter of wood holds 772 kg CO2 (according to our wood supplier Setra). This means that the first phase of the residential project, brf Gourmet, once completed, will have a carbon sink that holds somewhat more than 2,000 kg CO2 for many generations to come – CO2 that the Swedish forest has absorbed from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. This can be compared with the roughly 1,000 ton CO2 used to make and build brf Gourmet.\nIsn’t that fantastic!\nIf you have questions, let us know at email@example.com.\nUlrika Kågström, AB Electrolux, overall responsible for the Greenhouse Sthlm property development.\nRasmus Olsen Falk, Hedström & Taube, Consultant, in charge of environmental certification and carbon dioxide calculations in the project.\nNote: This text was edited August 30, 2023 (correction of numbers)\nIf you are interested in learning more – this is for you!\nIn a construction project, it is not enough to analyze how much energy the new buildings will consume once ready, it is also very important to understand how much CO2 that is consumed during construction of the building – how much of the total CO2 budget will our building use up? We must also evaluate different scenarios – CO2 emissions now or CO2 emissions in 10 to 20 years? To arrive at a decision, information is needed. An established system used to describe a product’s total CO2 emission from a life-cycle perspective are so called EPDs (Environmental Product Declaration).\nWhen we started our project, few companies actually calculated EPDs. More are doing so today, but we are still at the very beginning of a necessary development and adjustment. The three main reasons companies don’t produce this information is 1) that it is expensive, 2) the company has deemed that it not important or 3) customers don’t ask for it. There is quite a lot of work involved to prepare an EPD, not the least because it requires a good grasp of where all material and components come from. For small companies, it can be very difficult to collect this information, if it is at all doable.\nFor products where the main part of the carbon imprint comes when operating them (perhaps someone here thinks household appliances?) EPDs are not always wholly relevant since the product’s total imprint depends on where in the world it is used (and also when during the day or night it is used – read more about this in the blog post Theme: Energy). But, since appliances usually account for the largest part of the total CO2 imprint of an apartment’s fixed furnishings, it is of course interesting to understand how much CO2 that was used to manufacture the machine – from raw material to finished product. Next time you buy an appliance, ask for information about the product’s estimated imprint from scratch to finished product and compare different brands. If the salesperson can’t answer – contact the sustainability officer at the sales company – they know. Manufacturers who take these questions seriously have estimated their imprint.\nCO2 in a bigger context\nThe concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere affects the average temperature on earth. Greenhouse gases is a collective name for a number of so called climate gases, including carbon dioxide and methane for example. These gases contribute – to a greater or lesser extent – to the warming of the earth. The greater impact, the higher GWP (Global Warming Potential) has the gas. By multiplying the weight of the emission with the gas’ specific GWP value, the total emissions of these climate gases can be expressed in one unit – so called CO2 equivalents.\nThe concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has historically fluctuated, but when mankind started to burn fossil fuels on earth the concentration increased markedly to an average of about 420 ppm today (the figure varies over the year and also geographically), compared with around 280 ppm before the industrial revolution. Reports, based on the probability that the average temperature on earth does not rise more than 1,5 degrees (67% probability), shows that the “CO2 budget” we have left to spend is around 400 gigaton CO2 (year 2020). Given global emissions right now, that means this budget will be spent by around year 2030.\nWhen we talk about CO2 emissions in a country, we usually refer to either territorial emissions, which includes all emissions from a country (but not land and transports to and from the country) or consumption-based emissions – the emissions the inhabitants in a country causes irrespective of where the goods or services has been produced. As a reference, if the total remaining CO2 budget is expressed per capita, it lands at around 50 tonnes per person based on all inhabitants in the world. Looking at the consumption-based emissions we have in Sweden (around 8 ton per capita) we only have six years of the budget left.\nSweden’s total territorial emissions are about 50 million tonnes per year.","Krause provides construction waste management and construction waste recycling systems to solve a wide range of solid waste and other recycling problems.

{"question":"How do I transition my kitten to adult cat food when they turn 12 months old?","answer":"To transition your kitten to adult cat food at 12 months of age (or up to 18 months for larger male cats), you should make the change gradually over 4-7 days to minimize digestive issues and prevent negative food preferences. This gradual introduction is important to avoid upset tummies.","context":["Bringing a kitten home to the family is not only an exciting time but can also be a stressful one. What food do you buy? How often do you feed them and does this change over time? When are they no longer kittens? Here are some handy facts and tips to help relieve the stress and to instead focus on providing love and attention to your precious feline.\n1. Kittens need lots of little meals each day.\nTo cope with their small stomachs, and the fact kittens do not tend to overeat (unlike puppies), it is usual to allow kittens free access to food during the phase of rapid growth, or up to 5 meal occasions per day. As they grow and mealtime routines embedded, this reduces to 3-4 meals to the age of 6 months, then can reduce again to twice daily if desired to adulthood. Multiple meal occasions fit well with their natural preference to graze and snack feed throughout a 24-hour period to eat several small meals rather than a small number of large meals.\n2. When is a kitten an adult?\nDon’t let your kitten fool you into thinking they’re all grown up when they have reached sexual maturity (6 months), have all their adult teeth (8 months) or when they may be mistaken for an adult (9 months). While size and sex of a cat can influence the length of the kitten stage, kittens are generally not considered adults until 12 months of age when their energy requirements reduce to adult levels and reach or are close to reaching their full adult body weight.\n3. Why do I need to feed kitten food?\nKittens have a higher nutrient requirement compared to adult cats. They require over twice the amount of protein and five times the amount of calcium and phosphorus as their adult counterparts. Kittens grow fast, so their demand for protein is higher to ensure they can synthesise tissue for their growing bodies. If they don’t receive an adequate amount of calcium and phosphorus, it can cause skeletal issues, tooth loss and lameness in growing kittens. So it is important to feed a kitten food that has been designed specifically for kittens (or all life stages) up to their 1st birthday. Complete and Balanced kitten food is specifically designed to ensure these additional requirements are included in the diet.\n4. What happens if my kitten eats adult food?\nWhile feeding a kitten adult food as a once-off will not likely cause illness or issues, continual feeding adult products during their growth stage can cause slow development and development issues, and illnesses caused by malnutrition. So even though you may not think your kitten is growing any further from the outside, there are changes still occurring inside body that are not apparent.\n5. When do I transition my kitten onto adult cat food?\nWhen your kitten reaches 12 months of age (note this could be up to 18 months for larger male cats), you may like to transition them to an adult diet. Just like when changing from one brand or format to another, it is important to introduce the new food gradually to minimise any upset tummies, digestion or negative food preferences. Most reputable brands recommend taking 4-7 days to gradually introduce the new diet.\n6. What kitten food is recommended by vets?\nAs a minimum, always look for a specifically designed kitten food that is Complete and Balanced that has been substantiated as per the Australian Standard (AS5812). Products that contain quality protein sources that are highly digestible are recommended to ensure they are receiving adequate amino acids at the optimal levels, however significantly high protein foods (56% dry matter) must be supplemented with arginine to ensure the normal urea cycle function is not compromised.\nFurthermore, highly acidic foods must be avoided as kitten urine pH is already lower than an adult cat and therefore will be at risk of metabolic acidosis (a painful kidney issue).\n7. Should I make the switch to a raw diet for my kitten?\nKittens when fed a variety of formats, textures and flavour variants will be more prone to seek variety in their food as they grow older. Regardless of your food preference for your feline, always ensure the choice is Complete and Balanced so the kitten can get all the nutrition they need for optimal growth."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0156353a-b6e6-4beb-9d67-f37b20b3c65d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do eco-friendly fabrics benefit sustainable fashion, and what workplace health risks can arise from exposure to textile materials?","answer":"Eco-friendly fabrics benefit sustainable fashion by using biodegradable materials, requiring less water and energy in production, and often being made from natural, recyclable materials. Examples include linen, which grows without chemicals and is naturally moth-resistant, and bamboo, which requires minimal water to grow. Regarding workplace health risks, prolonged exposure to textile materials like dusts and powders can lead to serious health conditions. According to COSHH regulations, these materials can cause occupational asthma, dermatitis, and even cancer through various routes of entry including skin contact, inhalation, or ingestion.

It also has a large tap root that penetrates deep into the soil, preventing soil erosion and aerating the ground for future crops.\nHemp is also a great source of carbon sequestration and traps about 162 kg of carbon per tonne of hemp harvested. It is a much higher yield than cotton.\nIndustrial hemp has been used for various purposes, including food, medicine, and textiles. It is also the oldest cultivated plant in the world. Its fibers have been used to weave flax since the Neolithic period.\nThe plant is fast-growing, uses little water, and is pest resistant. It can be harmful if not grown in a controlled environment. Buying fabrics made from bamboo is a great way to help the environment.\nBamboo lyocell or bamboo viscose can be used to create bamboo cloth. The latter is made using an automated procedure. Chemical processes are used to develop the latter.\nBamboo lyocell is made in a closed-loop process, which means that the chemicals used are recycled and not disposed of into the environment. Compared to the rayon production process, this method is also environmentally friendly.\nBamboo viscose is a newer version of rayon. In this process, bamboo is mechanically crushed and processed into fibers. These fibers are then exposed to sulfuric acid, which softens the strands.\nThe bamboo fiber is then processed into yarn. The yarn is spun into fabric, then woven into valuable products.\nA great way to lessen your carbon footprint is to fill your wardrobe with eco-friendly fabrics. All-natural, non-toxic ingredients and dyes are used to create these textiles. Additionally, they generate less water and energy. Your apparel will last longer as a result.\nSome of the most popular fabrics in the fashion industry include cotton, nylon, and rayon. The latter two can contain poisonous compounds that are bad for your health.\nMany eco-conscious brands now use recycled fabrics, natural fabrics, and other eco-friendly materials. They are also more durable than conventional cotton and often require less water and energy to produce.\nAnother great way to support the environment is to use fabrics that are 100% biodegradable. They are also hypoallergenic and durable.\nOther fabrics that are considered eco-friendly include hemp, linen, and silk. Silk is a strong, durable, absorbent, and excellent material. It is also very soft against the skin. It can last up to 10 years if it is correctly cared for.\nCradle to Cradle(r) certification\nMBDC certification allows companies to assess their products’ environmental and social responsibility. It determines various factors, such as how a product uses energy, water, and materials. It is also essential to identify strategies for social responsibility.\nProducts are evaluated for material health, circularity, and potential renewable energy impacts. MBDC certification has several different levels. The lowest level, or Silver, awards a product with third-party verification that it meets the Cradle to Cradle Certified Product Standard. The highest level, Bronze, grants a product with a second-party assurance that it meets the Cradle To Cradle Certified Product Standard. Products are then subject to regular standards review and assessment.\nCompanies that produce cradle-to-cradle products can increase their profits. Cradle-to-Cradle Certified Products are advantageous for both the environment and business. Outcomes are assessed for their material health, renewable energy impacts, social fairness, and ethical treatment of workers.\nAn eco-friendly wardrobe is essential to anyone concerned with the environment. Fortunately, there are many options for sustainable fabrics. These fabrics can be made from organic or recycled materials and are often produced by sustainable brands. They also require less energy and water to grow.\nOne of the most commonly known eco-friendly fabrics is cotton. Cotton is grown using less water and requires less energy than other textiles. Cotton is also known for its durability. However, when cotton is overfarmed, the pollution from the farming process affects the environment.\nAnother type of eco-friendly fabric is organic cotton. Organic cotton is produced without pesticides and requires less water than conventional cotton. Similarly, hemp is a harmful carbon fiber, which requires less water to grow.\nAnother popular eco-friendly fabric is linen. Linen is made from flax, a plant that does not require much water to grow. It is also breathable and cool to wear.","COSHH – A Guide to Employers’ and Employees’ Responsibilities\nEmployee Responsibilities under COSHH\nEmployee responsibilities within the COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health) Regulations of 2002 include:\n- Making use of control measures and facilities provided by the employer\n- Ensuring equipment is returned and stored properly\n- Reporting defects/insufficiencies in control measures\n- Wearing and storing personal protective equipment (PPE)\n- Removing PPE that could cause contamination before eating or drinking\n- Making proper use of washing, showering and bathing facilities when required\n- Maintaining a high level of personal hygiene\n- Complying with any information, instruction or training that is provided\nEmployer Responsibilities Under COSHH\nUnder COSHH regulations, employers’ responsibilities include:\n- Implementing control measures to protect workers from hazardous substances.\n- Preventing or adequately controlling exposure to hazardous substances.\n- Providing employees with suitable and sufficient information, instruction and training, and appropriate protective equipment where necessary.\n- Ensuring that control measures are maintained, kept in full working order, and in a clean condition where appropriate.\n- Drawing up plans and procedures to deal with accidents and emergencies involving hazardous substances.\n- Ensuring that any employees exposed to hazardous substances whilst at work are under suitable health surveillance.\n- Ensuring that substances do not exceed the Workplace Exposure Limit (WEL).\n- Carrying out a COSHH risk assessment.\nNaturally, workplaces with higher risks, such as catering or a hair salon, will require more action than, say, an office. But as an employer, you should be assessing what risks may be posed by hazardous substances, no matter where you work.\nThat way, you can identify if there are risks and if so take action to reduce them to a minimum.\nCOSHH Risk Assessment\nA COSHH risk assessment is essentially the same as a standard risk assessment in terms of the process, but your assessment of the workplace will focus solely on hazardous substances.\nIf you’re unfamiliar with risk assessments, here’s a breakdown of the main 5 steps:\n- Identify the hazards.\n- Decide who might be harmed and how.\n- Evaluate the risks and decide on precautions.\n- Record your findings and implement them.\n- Review your assessment and update if necessary.\nRisk assessments will also involve frequently monitoring the workplace’s processes and the level of exposure to substances.\nWorkplaces are active and constantly changing, so a one-off check won’t be sufficient in minimising the risks posed by hazardous substances. You have to remain constantly vigilant and alert to the dangers.\nRecap: What is COSHH?\nCOSHH stands for the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations (2002). It exists to ensure that both employers and employees do all they can in a workplace to minimise people’s exposure to hazardous substances and work in ways that are safe.\nThis means that all hazardous substances need to be identified and precautions need to be taken to ensure that workers know how to use and handle them safely.\nThe importance of controlling hazardous substances cannot be overstated. In 2012/13, around 35,000 workers reported that they had breathing or lung problems caused by work, and the most common type of reported skin disease was contact dermatitis.\nAnd it’s estimated that around 13,000 deaths occur each year due to occupational lung disease and cancer – fatal conditions that will have developed over a prolonged period of exposure to dusts and chemicals at work.\nAs an employee or employer, you can prevent statistics like this from increasing. If you fulfil your workplace duties, you can prevent dangerous levels of exposure and meet COSHH requirements.\nRecap: What is a Hazardous Substance?\nSimply put, a hazardous substance is any mixture or substance that is toxic, irritant, or corrosive – whether it’s a liquid, gas, vapour, fume, or dust.\nThey cause harm to the body via routes of entry:\n- By coming into contact with skin or eyes.\n- By being inhaled.\n- By being ingested through the mouth.\n- By entering the body through cuts or punctures in the skin.\nAlthough there are certain industries that will be at greater risk, hazardous substances could exist in any workplace. They are often used directly in work activities, produced by work activities, or already present in your workplace’s premises.\nExamples of hazardous substances include:\n- Chemicals, e.g. cleaning chemicals or bleach.\n- Fumes, e.g. from paint or vehicles that exhaust.\n- Gases, e.g. ammonia from refrigerators.\n- Dusts and powder, e.g. from flour.\nIt’s worth noting that even seemingly innocent substances can be harmful, and that includes natural materials like wood dust or flour.\nWhile many hazardous substances can cause immediate harm, such as a corrosive liquid being spilled onto someone’s skin, the main danger posed by hazardous substances is prolonged exposure. For example, if someone is in the presence of or uses a dangerous chemical for a long time, they could develop breathing difficulties or skin conditions.\nExamples of ill-health caused by hazardous substances includes:\n- Occupational asthma.\n- Occupational dermatitis.\n- Occupational cancers.\n- Skin irritation.\n- Infection from bacteria.\n- Injury or death as a result of exposure to toxic fumes.\nWhat to Read Next:\nSubscribe for the latest Hub updates!

{"question":"What are the key changes to organ donation law in England, and what medical evaluations must potential living donors undergo?","answer":"In England, since May 20th 2020, an opt-out system was implemented where all adults are considered organ donors unless they explicitly state otherwise. This law excludes people under 18, those lacking mental capacity to understand the arrangements, visitors to England, and those living in England for less than 12 months. As for living donor evaluations, candidates must undergo extensive testing including blood type and tissue compatibility assessment, comprehensive physical examination (including blood tests, chest x-rays, and electrocardiograms), and specific kidney health evaluations such as urine tests and anatomical evaluation through CT scans. The transplant team needs to ensure the donor has compatible blood type and tissues with the recipient, is healthy enough for surgery, and has a healthy kidney to donate while maintaining one for themselves.","context":["Register your organ donation decision\nRecord your choice on the NHS Organ Donor Register\nMake sure you understand the new law around organ donation and discuss your views with your family. It could save a life.\nOn 20th May 2020, the law around organ donation in England was changed to help save and improve more lives.\nThe new, opt out system works on the understanding that all adults agree to become organ donors when they die, unless they have made it known that they do not wish to donate.\nAn opt out system now applies to everyone in England, except for people in an excluded group.\nIn a recent NHS Blood and Transplant survey, 83 per cent of people said they believe it is important to discuss organ donation. However, only 39 per cent say they have gone on to share their donation decision with their partner or family.\n• Those under the age of 18\n• People who lack the mental capacity to understand the new arrangements and take the necessary action\n• Visitors to England, and those not living here voluntarily\n• People who have lived in England for fewer than 12 months before their death\nThe Phillips family, from Retford, know all too well how important having that conversation is. Rick Phillips, then aged 38, was playing football in 2000 when he suffered a sudden brain aneurysm. Sadly, Rick would not survive, but even as his family were processing the devastating news, they knew what Rick would have wanted. So they requested to donate his organs.\nRick’s wife, Liz, says, “Rick’s death came totally out of the blue. Luckily, we had had a conversation and I knew I had to ask about organ donation when they said he wasn’t going to survive.\n(Picture: Rick with his daughter Jade)\n“I miss him like it was yesterday. But the pride we have in him has never faded and there are people living their lives because of him. We know he will never be forgotten.”\nRick was able to donate his kidneys, heart and liver.\nBut five years after Rick’s death, his daughter, Jade, now 27, was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis, as well as ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, and has been told she may eventually need a liver transplant.\nLiz says, “It came as a total shock to discover that Jade was ill and may one day need a transplant too. Although we had spoken about donation as a family, we never imagined that one of our children could end up needing a transplant from someone else. I firmly believe that if you would be willing to accept a transplant, then you should equally be prepared to give (an organ).\"\nMore donors and families willing to support donation are needed to help ensure waiting patients receive the transplants they so desperately need.\nYou can still choose whether or not you want to be an organ donor when you die by registering your decision on the NHS Organ Donor Register and telling your family.

We also have a text relay number and a text chat number for those that are hard of hearing*.\nWe know that nine out of ten families will agree to donation when the person’s decision to be an organ donor is known, but that only 47 per cent of families agree to donation if they are unaware of their loved one’s organ donation decision.\nTo find out more and record your decision please visit www.organdonation.nhs.uk.\n* Our text chat number is 07860 034343 and our text relay number is 18001 0300 1232323.","Now…About Your Health\nOnce you’ve agreed to be considered a donor, you’ll go through an in-depth assessment of your health. What the transplant team wants to evaluate is whether:\n- Your blood type and tissues are compatible with the recipient,\n- You are healthy enough to withstand major surgery and recover completely,\n- You have a healthy kidney—preferably the left one—to donate, and you have a healthy kidney to keep—one that can compensate for the loss of a kidney, and\n- Your are psychologically ready to donate and are donating for the right reasons.\nWith these three primary goals in mind, here is how donor candidates are medically evaluated.\n1. Blood and Tissue Compatibility\nBlood Type. The first step is to determine your blood type. There are four blood types, designated by the presence or absence of two antigens—the A antigen and the B antigen. Blood type A means you have the A antigen. Type B means you have the B antigen. Type AB means you have both antigens. Type O means you don’t have either antigen.\nAs a general rule, you must have a blood type compatible with the recipient or you will not be able to donate. Note that the Rh factor (positive or negative) does not matter for matching purposes. Here is who can donate to whom:\n- Type A can donate to types A and AB.\n- Type B can donate to types B and AB.\n- Type AB can donate to type AB.\n- Type O can donate to types A, B, AB, and O.\nThe blood type is determined by drawing your blood and testing it.\nIf you and your potential recipient have blood types that are not compatible, there are four things you can consider:\n- Paired exchange or chain donation. As explained on a prior LDO web page, paired exchange involves finding another donor-recipient pair who have incompatible blood types but where your blood type is compatible with the other recipient, and the other donor’s blood type is compatible with your intended recipient’s blood type. In that situation, you donate to the other recipient, and the other donor donates to your recipient. In a growing number of situations, more than two donor/recipient pairs are linked in an extended “chain” of donation.\n- Plasmapheresis. Plasmapheresis has the transplant recipient undergo a special medical process that removes the blood’s incompatible antigens. With removal of the recipient’s antigens, the donor is now able to donate. Note that plasmapheresis may be considered an experimental procedure and medical insurance may not cover the expense. Be sure to check the insurance plan before proceeding.\n- A different living donor. If you don’t match your intended recipient, maybe there is another friend, relative, or non-directed living donor who can be considered.\n- Deceased donation. Finally, the recipient could wait for a compatible deceased donor.\nTissue Type. A second test looks at the compatibility of your tissues by comparing your human leukocyte antigens (HLA) with the intended recipient. There are many different kinds of HLAs, but usually there are three categories evaluated for kidney donation. You inherit one set of these three antigens from each parent giving each person a total of six of these donation-related HLAs.\nYour antigens are determined by drawing blood and testing it. A similar test is run for the recipient, and the antigens are compared. You might hear of a “six-out-of-six” or “full” match (all donor and recipient antigens match) or a “half match” (three of the six antigens are the same) or a “zero match” (none of the antigens matches). The closer the match the better because the recipient is less likely to reject the donated organ over the long run.\nThere was a time when this type of tissue compatibility was very important. However, the development of more effective anti-rejection drugs has reduced the importance of the HLA match. In fact, some transplant teams ignore tissue typing. Therefore, even if your degree of matching with the donor is relatively low, you may still be considered for donation. However, given a choice among potential donors, the one with the highest level of tissue compatibility typically is preferred.\nCrossmatching. The third blood test, called crossmatching, is a further test of antigen compatibility. In this test, white blood cells from you are mixed with blood from the intended recipient. If the white blood cells are attacked, then the crossmatch is “positive,” which is a negative as far as your ability to donate to that person. It means the intended recipient is “sensitized” to you—he or she has antibodies to some of your antigens—so the intended recipient’s immune system would turn on the donated organ and destroy it. If the crossmatch is “negative,” you are compatible with the intended recipient.\nFor a “positive” crossmatch, plasmapheresis can be tried as a technique to allow the donation to proceed.\nAt this point, if there is more than one potential donor, the group is winnowed down to one or two. The reason for reducing the number of potential donors is because the remaining tests are more involved, time consuming, and expensive.\n2. Your General Health\nLiving donation may be the only medical procedure allowed where the patient (the donor) purposely leaves the hospital in worse physical health than when he or she walked in. Consequently, the transplant team needs to make sure you are in excellent health — better than the average person — so you can continue to enjoy good health after the donation.\nYou will go through an extensive physical examination, one that has more tests and evaluations than you have probably ever experienced before. Standard procedures for a medical evaluation do not exist but guidelines have been provided by several medical professional organizations. The transplant center will provide you with a schedule for the exams and testing, which often stretches over multiple days.\n- Physical exam including blood testing (cholesterol, blood count, creatinine, urea, etc.), blood pressure, height, weight, BMI calculation, personal medical history, family medical history, prescription drug use, substance abuse, smoking history, alcohol intake, history of mental illness and treatment, kidney history (stones, injury, etc.), gout history, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, and testing for viral and bacterial infection (HIV, hepatitis, syphilis, herpes, tuberculosis, etc.).\n- Fasting blood glucose test and, depending on diabetes risk factors, a glucose tolerance test.\n- Echocardiogram and stress test if over age 50 or presence of other risk factors.\n- Pulmonary function test and a chest CT scan for smokers.\n- Female donor candidates undergo a gynecological exam, mammography (if over age 40), PAP, and pregnancy test.\n- Male donor candidates may undergo a PSA test if over age 50.\n- Potential donors over age 50 may undergo a colonoscopy.\nCertain medical conditions will exclude you from being a donor. These conditions, called “contraindications,” vary from one transplant center to another because of the lack of common medical guidelines for evaluating living donors. However, to get an idea of the kinds of conditions that would typically exclude a donor, here is a list that was proposed by the UNOS Living Donor Committee:\nAbsolute Exclusion Criteria. The following conditions would exclude a living donor candidate without any further evaluation:\n- Under age 18.\n- Hypertension blood pressure greater than 130/90 plus one of the following conditions: in someone younger than 50 years old, with evidence of end organ damage, non-Caucasian, or on three or more anti-hypertensive medications\n- Abnormal glucose tolerance test\n- History of thrombosis or embolism\n- Psychiatric contraindications [UNOS did not specify which conditions]\n- Obesity: Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 35\n- Coronary artery disease\n- Symptomatic valvular disease [damage of heart valves]\n- Chronic lung disease with impairment of oxygenation or ventilation\n- Recent malignancy or cancers with long times to recurrence (e.g., breast cancer)\n- Urologic abnormalities of donor kidney\n- Creatinine clearance under 80 ml/min/1.73m2, or projected glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with removal of one kidney at 80 years old of under 40 ml/min/1.73m2\n- Peripheral vascular disease [diseases of blood vessels outside the heart and brain, usually a narrowing of vessels that carry blood to the legs, arms, stomach or kidneys.]\n- Proteinuria [blood in urine] greater than 300 mg in 24 hours\n- HIV, hepatitis C, or hepatitis B virus infection\nRelative Exclusion Criteria. The following conditions may exclude a potential donor, subject to further evaluation:\n- Age between 18 and 21, and older age [UNOS did not specify] relative to the medical condition\n- Obesity (BMI between 30 and 35)\n- Kidney stones\n- Distant history of cancer\n- Past history of psychiatric disorder\n- Renovascular disease [blood flow in and out of the kidneys]\n- Thin basement membrane disease [an inherited disease that affects the glomeruli – the small blood vessels in the kidneys that filter wastes from the blood]\n- Prior valve surgery\n- Moderate cardiac valvular disease with otherwise normal echocardiographic findings [heart issues]\n- Mild sleep apnea without pulmonary hypertension\nKeep in mind that policies and procedures vary from transplant team to transplant team. You should confirm the actual contraindications with your transplant team.\nIf you are overweight but otherwise a good potential donor, you may be given time to lose weight. Several donors who have visited LDO said they were able to lose weight and donate successfully. If you are a smoker, it is suggested you stop smoking at least four weeks prior to donation to reduce the risk of complications when recovering in the hospital (a smoke-free environment) from the surgery. Permanently quitting is recommended because of the negative impact smoking and its associated diseases can have on the health of your remaining kidney.\n3. Health of Your Kidneys\nIn addition to a general assessment of your health, the donor evaluation focuses on the health and structure of your kidneys with these tests:\n- Urine tests. Your urine will be examined for the presence of blood and protein, and to ensure your urinary tract is not infected. You will be asked to undergo 24-hour urine tests, called creatinine clearance tests. Creatinine is a protein excreted in the urine and is a measure of kidney function. These tests are run to make sure your kidneys are working properly and to measure your glomerular filtration rate (GFR). (Your GFR will also be estimated using the level of creatinine in your blood from the blood drawn during your physical exam.) Your GFR is the most important measure of your kidney function, and having a high level is important because you will be giving up half your kidney capacity when you donate. Transplant specialists say having a GFR of 90 or more is an acceptable level for kidney donation, while having a GFR less than 60 means you should not donate. For a GFR between 60 and 89, the transplant experts suggest looking at demographic and health considerations to determine whether you should donate.\n- Screening for polycystic kidney disease (PKD). If indicated by your family history, you will have an ultrasound of your kidneys if over 30 years old, and genetic testing if under 30 years old.\n- Anatomical evaluation. You’ll undergo a procedure to identify the structure of the kidney, veins, arteries, the ureter, and other anatomy. A common approach is a Computed Tomography (CT) Angiogram test, commonly called a CT scan, which is a sophisticated form of X-ray. For this procedure, a dye is injected into a vein, you lay flat on a table, and the table moves through a special machine shaped like a giant doughnut. The machine projects a thin x-ray beam through your body and measures the output. The dye gives more contrast to the blood vessels making them easier to identify. A computer takes the information from the x-ray scan and generates a three-dimensional image of your kidneys and surrounding anatomy.\nThe information from the anatomical evaluation is critical to the surgeon for determining which, if any, of your kidneys is best for donation. Generally, the left is preferred because of its longer renal vein. But there may be structural complications in the left kidney such as multiple arteries that result in consideration of the right kidney.\nFor tests that use x-rays, female donor candidates should inform the medical technician if you are pregnant or might be pregnant. Also, the tests use a dye that some people may have an allergic reaction to. Let the technician know if you have had allergic reactions in the past, especially to iodine.\nNote: You will want to keep copies of all your pre-donation test results. This information will form a useful basis of comparison for test results after donation.\n4. Psychosocial Assessment\nDuring the medical evaluation you will meet with a social worker, psychologist, or psychiatrist for a psychosocial assessment, the goal of which is to evaluate your state of mind. This evaluation looks at the mental, emotional, social, and spiritual aspects of being healthy.\nUsually this assessment is done in a meeting during which the assessor asks you several questions about your level of understanding of the living donation process and risks, whether are you freely choosing to be a donor, and whether you are emotionally and psychologically ready for donation and recovery. There are no standard procedures for this kind of assessment. However, the UNOS Living Donor Committee put together recommendations. The recommendations were not approved, but they indicate the subjects that might be covered in your psychosocial evaluation:\n- History and current state. Obtain standard background information such as the prospective donor’s education level, living situation, cultural background, religious beliefs and practices, significant relationships, family psychosocial history, employment, lifestyle, community activities, legal offense history, and citizenship.\n- Capacity. Ensure that the prospective donor’s cognitive status and capacity to comprehend information are not compromised and do not interfere with judgment; determine risk for exploitation.\n- Psychological status. Establish the presence or absence of current and prior psychiatric disorders, including but not limited to mood, anxiety, substance abuse, and personality disorders. Review current or prior therapeutic interventions (counseling, medications); physical, psychological or sexual abuse; current stressors (e.g., relationships, home, work); recent losses; and chronic pain management. Assess repertoire of coping skills to manage previous life or health-related stressors.\n- Relationship with the transplant candidate. Review the nature and degree of closeness (if any) to the recipient (i.e., how the relationship developed), and whether the transplant would impose expectations or perceived obligations on the part of either the donor or the recipient.\n- Motivation. Explore the rationale and reasoning for volunteering to donate, i.e., the “voluntariness”, including whether donation would be consistent with past behaviors, apparent values, beliefs, moral obligations or lifestyle. Determine whether the donation would be free of coercion, inducements, ambivalence, impulsivity, or ulterior motives (e.g., to atone or gain approval, to stabilize self-image, or to remedy a psychological malady).\n- Donor knowledge, understanding, and preparation. Explore the prospective donor’s awareness of the following:\n> Any potential short- and long-term risks for surgical complications and health outcomes, both for the donor and the transplant candidate;\n> Recovery and recuperation time;\n> Availability of alternative treatments for the transplant candidate; and\n> Financial ramifications (including possible insurance risk).\nMake sure that the donor understands the data on long-term donor health and psychosocial outcomes continue to be sparse. Assess the prospective donor’s understanding, acceptance, and respect for the specific donor protocol, e.g., willingness to accept potential lack of communication from the recipient and the donor’s willingness to undergo future donor follow up.\n- Social support. Evalute support networks available to the prospective donor on an ongoing basis as well as during the donor’s recovery from surgery. Consider significant others, family members, social contacts, and employers.\n- Financial suitability. Determine whether the prospective donor is financially stable and free of financial hardship; has resources available to cover financial obligations for expected and unexpected donation-related expenses; is able to take time away from work or established role, including unplanned extended recovery time; and has disability and health insurance.\nKeep in mind that policies and procedures vary from transplant team to transplant team. You should confirm the actual psychosocial evaluation process with your transplant team.\nA Review and Decision\nOnce your physical and psychosocial evaluations are complete, the results are reviewed by the transplant team and a transplant review committee at the transplant center. The purpose of the review is to decide whether it is safe for you to donate and whether your being a living donor is the best course of treatment for the recipient. The committee will also determine if you are donating for the right reasons and are able to consent to the donation.\nIf you are not approved, you will be told why and then you can work with the transplant coordinator on how to communicate the news to the recipient. More importantly, if you are not approved for a health reason, you should be referred to a health professional to address the issue. There have been situations where the health evaluation revealed the potential donor had a serious health issue he or she was previously unaware of. While the potential donor wasn’t able to save the life of their intended recipient, their interest in living donation did save another life — their own.\nIf you are approved, you will move to the next phase of the living donation process — the actual donation itself. Remember that even if you are approved for donation, you can change your mind at any time."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3c333353-9e6f-4077-81dc-118b837e8c65>","<urn:uuid:d7888172-dd10-4b19-bc9c-dfd652b78224>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is sarcopenia and what are its broader health implications for aging adults?","answer":"Sarcopenia is the significant loss of muscle mass and function that occurs with aging. It is associated with multiple chronic conditions including diabetes, high cholesterol, and obesity. The condition has broad health implications as muscle mass is closely connected to metabolism, and its loss increases the risk of developing metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, sarcopenia affects mobility - maintaining muscle mass through physical activity can significantly influence a person's ability to walk after age 70. With the U.S. elderly population expected to increase significantly, addressing sarcopenia has become important for healthcare cost control.","context":["Sarcopenia – the significant loss of muscle mass and function that can occur as we age – is associated with many chronic conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol and obesity.\nIn findings published online ahead of publication in the September 2014 issue of the FASEB Journal, researchers at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University identify a muscle-building mechanism that could be important in addressing sarcopenia.\nWhen people strength train the body responds by making muscle. The researchers recruited 16 healthy but sedentary men to perform a single bout of resistance exercise to trigger muscle growth and examined tissue samples taken before and six hours after the exercise. Half of the men were in their twenties and the other half in their seventies.\n\"In order for the body to make proteins that build muscle, certain genes need to be turned on,\" said lead author Donato A. Rivas, Ph.D., a scientist in the Nutrition, Exercise Physiology and Sarcopenia Laboratory at the USDA HNRCA at Tufts University. \"We noticed the older people had a lot fewer genes turned on compared to the younger people, showing us their muscles weren't responding as well to the exercise.\"\nRivas and colleagues observed that the level of microRNAs, small RNA molecules that have a prominent role in regulating genes, was lower in the muscle tissue of the older men, compared to younger men. \"One of the steps in building muscle seems to be missing in the older men, preventing them from responding to the exercise as strongly as the younger men did,\" Rivas said. \"It is possible that the suppression of these microRNAs is setting off a chain of events that is causing older people to be less efficient in developing muscle.\"\nWith the population of older adults in the United States projected to increase significantly in the coming decades, more effective sarcopenia treatment and prevention could help control healthcare costs. \"Age-related muscle loss has been associated with a myriad of other health problems,\" said senior author Roger A. Fielding, Ph.D., director of the Nutrition, Exercise Physiology and Sarcopenia Laboratory at the USDA HNRCA at Tufts University.\n\"Muscle mass is closely tied to our metabolism and losing it increases the risk of developing metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We also know that a program of moderate physical activity, including resistance exercises, can strongly influence a person's chances of maintaining their ability to walk after age 70.\"\nIn addition to resistance exercises, scientists are exploring different approaches to preserving and building muscle mass in older adults. \"A few studies suggest gene therapy, nutrient supplementation or hormone replacement therapy can assist with building muscle,\" said Fielding, who is also a professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University and the Tufts University School of Medicine. \"Our identification of a possible microRNA target could help advance the study of these largely untested, but promising approaches to promoting muscle growth in older people.\"\nThe authors note the small size of the study necessitates future research in clinical models and in men and women, particularly those who have sarcopenia.\nThe researchers were supported by funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture under agreement no. 58-1950-0014, the Boston Claude D.

{"question":"How does the Quality Seal for Research Platforms (QS4RP) certification process work?","answer":"The QS4RP certification is a three-step process. First, Service Providers complete a pre-assessment where EuroRec assessors examine system documentation and operational policies. Second, a two-day site visit is conducted to assess the service provider's software solutions and interview key staff members. Finally, the assessment team provides a formal report to i~HD, which determines if the Quality Seal is awarded. The Quality Seal must be renewed every two years or upon significant product upgrades, whichever comes first.","context":["The European Institute for Innovation through Health Data ( i~HD) has developed a Quality Seal for Research Platforms (QS4RP) in order to provide assurance to the market, especially to healthcare organisations, research centres and research sponsors, that ICT products and services, used to conduct research analyses using electronic health record (EHR) information, do so in secure ways that protect data privacy.\nProducts are now emerging that offer significant opportunities to accelerate the conduct of clinical research by enabling remote or on-site querying of EHRs – normally a de-identified extract of the operational EHR – in order to optimise clinical research protocols before they are finalised, and to assist healthcare organisations to efficiently identify suitable trial recruitment candidates. In parallel, the European General Data Protection Regulation places stricter obligations on organisations that hold personal data, such as healthcare organisations, to protect the privacy of their data subjects and to use personal (i.e. identifiable) information under strict controls. These new-generation research platforms use architectures that limit researcher access only to de-identified (and usually only aggregated) information and do not enable researchers to access personal health information at patient level. The purpose of the QS4CR Seal is to verify that such ICT products do indeed restrict access in this way and that the information governance policies and information security measures adopted by the product vendor provide sufficient assurance of privacy protection.\ni~HD has chosen to commission the EuroRec Institute to develop the content of this Seal and to conduct the formal assessments of products and services. EuroRec is Europe´s leading body for quality labelling electronic health record systems, and brings nearly a decade of experience in developing quality seals and conformance-testing of EHR systems. The seal criteria draw on the software requirements specifications and standard operating rules developed during the EHR4CR project, and also on the EMIF project´s code of practice, instruments developed by the ETRIKs project, the IMI Secondary Use code and ISO/IEC 27000 series of standards on information security management systems.\nOn the basis of a test report issued by EuroRec, i~HD will issue a Quality Seal of Conformity to successful service providers.\ni~HD intends that the possession of this Quality Seal will give added confidence to healthcare organisations and to research sponsors about joining such research platforms and networks.\nThe QS4RP Seal has been developed as a three-step process for the independent assessment and verification of how clinical research platforms and services handle data in accordance with information governance and security requirements, and public and professional expectations.\nThe processes add additional assurance over existing international (ISO) standards for information security practice, and good practice guidelines. QS4RP is more precisely attuned to the area of health and genomics research using electronic health records and other sources of health and life science data.\nThe QS4RP identifies the following core stakeholder groups in the “ecosystem” of reusing EHRs for research:\nThe focus of the Quality Seal is on the Service Provider and is designed to assure the two other stakeholders of Service Provider capability in discharging their responsibilities.\nThere are four core sets of capability criteria that will be assessed:\nThe first part of this process is for Service Providers to complete a pre-assessment, where the EuroRec assessors examine specific system documentation and operational policies, and answer a series of questions. Their responses will (i) be used to help determine their suitability for the Quality Seal and (ii) help the assessment team to confirm the most relevant scenario based tests when they embark upon the second part of the process, which will involve a site visit to assess the service provider tooling and setup.\nThis second part will last two days and will involve a series of tests and assessments on the service provider software solutions, as well as interviews with key members of their staff.\nIt is important to note that any ambiguities or uncertainties about the process service providers may have must be resolved during the pre-assessment step. Once the assessment team embark upon the onsite assessments, these will be binding and are not open to negotiation, discussion or amendment. The capability criteria are fixed and cannot be altered.\nOnce the on-site assessments have been completed, the assessment team will provide a formal report to i~HD, which will then determine if the Quality Seal is awarded or not. The service provider will receive a comprehensive assessment report, to assist with any improvements that may be required. Renewal of the Quality Seal will occur every two years, or on the release of a significant upgrade to the product, whichever is the sooner."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6046e16d-9744-4d16-8fcd-da8c239f3d95>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the main medical conditions that respiratory therapists typically treat in patients?","answer":"Respiratory therapists typically treat patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's disease, and sleep apnea.","context":["Choosing a healthcare career requires tapping into your interests because there are so many options available. Knowing you want to help people makes you uniquely qualified to work in several different healthcare fields. One option is to become a respiratory therapist. These nurses deal primarily with breathing problems.\nThere are similarities and differences between the two healthcare professions. Nurses and respiratory therapists work closely with patients and require much of the same educational background. In this article, we’ll explore the following information to help you make the best choice:\n- What is a respiratory therapist?\n- What is a nurse?\n- What are the differences between respiratory therapists and RN?\n- What is the career outlook for respiratory therapists and RNs?\nWhat is a respiratory therapist?\nYour patients can experience breathing problems or medical issues with their lungs. When that happens, their medical team often includes a respiratory therapist to help them improve their condition.\nRespiratory therapists may treat patients with:\n- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n- Cystic fibrosis\n- Muscular dystrophy\n- Parkinson’s disease\n- Sleep apnea\nThey can work in settings that include:\n- Emergency rooms\n- Intensive care units\n- Nursing homes\n- Outpatient clinics\n- Sleep centers specializing in sleep apnea\nWhat is a nurse?\nNurses serve as caregivers for their patients. As a nursing professional, you help manage your patients’ physical needs, prevent illness, and treat health conditions. You’ll need excellent observational skills to monitor your patients’ health and the ability to think quickly on your feet.\nYour job duties depend on the kind of nurse you become. For instance, Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) can check patient vitals and perform bedside care. Registered nurses (RNs) can administer medications and fill supervisory roles.\nNurses can work in a variety of settings, including:\n- Nursing homes\n- Physicians’ offices\n- Trauma centers\nWhat are the differences between respiratory therapists and RNs?\nWhile they both work in direct patient care and in many of the same healthcare facilities, there are several differences between respiratory therapists and RNs. Examining their roles and responsibilities, salaries, licensure, and certifications is the best way to learn how these two healthcare careers align and vary.\n|Administer medications||Administer inhalants for the treatment of asthma and other breathing conditions|\n|Check and record patient vitals||Conduct and analyze diagnostic & function tests to determine lung capacity/capability|\n|Conduct physical exams||Examine patients with pulmonary diseases, disorders, and complications|\n|Coordinate care with other members of the healthcare team||Work with doctors and nurses to create treatment plans for patients|\n|Provide counseling and healthcare education to patients and their families||Train patients and their family members on how to use prescribed equipment and medications|\nRoles and responsibilities\nThere are key differences between the roles and responsibilities of nurses and respiratory therapists. Nurses have a broad scope of practice compared to respiratory therapists. They focus on the overall health and well-being of their patients, which includes caring for the whole person. Respiratory therapists focus only on the proper functioning of the heart and lungs.\nRNs and respiratory therapists make very different salaries. RNs earn an average of $82,750 annually, while respiratory therapists earn $61,830. RNs with Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) or Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degrees can earn even higher salaries with some healthcare employers.\nSalaries and wages vary for nurses and respiratory therapists are based on their education, experience, and location.\nDiscover your true salary range\nReceive a free salary estimate in minutes. Then get matched with nursing jobs to pay it.\nNurses must complete an appropriate level of education for their chosen licensure. To become an LPN, you only need an Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN), which takes 12-18 months. RNs can earn an ADN, but many choose to pursue their BSN as more employers are requiring it.\nTo become a respiratory therapist, you must complete an associate degree in respiratory therapy from a program approved by the American Medical Association (AMA). The Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care is one of the accrediting agencies accepted by the AMA.\nThe kind of license you need for nursing depends on the kind of nurse you become. LPNs and RNs must take the NCLEX exam to become licensed to practice. However, the exam varies depending on your career path. Each state has licensing requirements, so it’s best to check with the board of nursing for your intended state of practice.\nRespiratory therapists must be licensed in all states except Alaska, where national certification is recommended instead. The National Board for Respiratory Care is the main certifying body. It offers two levels of licenses:\nCertification for nursing professionals depends on their career path. For instance, RNs can become certified anywhere from emergency care to women’s health. Some nursing positions require certification, such as Family Nurse Practitioners (FNPs) and Legal Nurse Consultants (LNCs).\nAll states require licensed respiratory therapists to earn CRT certification. Individual healthcare employers may prefer or mandate RRT certification.\nWhat is the career outlook for respiratory therapists and RNs?\nLike all nursing professionals, RNs are in high demand. Projected growth is 9% between 2020 and 2030, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The largest increases in demand for RNs may occur in long-term care facilities.\nRespiratory therapists also have a rosy career outlook because of the rising numbers of middle-aged and senior residents in the U.S. As the population ages, the need for treatment of respiratory conditions like COPD and pneumonia will grow. The BLS predicts a 23% growth rate for respiratory therapists between now and 2030.\nIf career advancement is important to you, then nursing may be your best bet. Nursing has more opportunities for future growth than respiratory therapy.\nLearning everything there is to know about nurses and respiratory therapists may lead to more questions. You can always seek advice from those who currently hold positions in healthcare facilities across the U.S. before deciding which career path is right for you.\nTired of applying for nursing jobs?\nWith Incredible Health, hospitals apply to YOU.\n- Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care. coarc.com.

{"question":"What are the key metrics for measuring email marketing success, and how do they relate to overall marketing ROI?","answer":"Email marketing success is measured through several key metrics including bounce rate (percentage of visitors who leave without action), click rate (number of link clicks), open rate (percentage of subscribers opening emails), and conversion rate (percentage who make purchases). These metrics directly impact marketing ROI, as businesses can make $38 for every dollar spent on email marketing. The ROI calculation follows the formula: [((number of leads x lead-to-customer rate x average sales price) - cost) ÷ cost] x 100. To determine if marketing ROI is good, businesses should monitor factors like content creation time, production costs, promotion costs, and track URLs for analytics.","context":["The prime objective of any marketing campaign is to make it successful. To make a campaign successful it is always the output from KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) throughout the campaign. From the output of the KPIs, it is determined either the campaign was successful or not. From a business perspective, it is about the marketing ROI which tells how good or bad the campaign went. Return on Investment or ROI is the caliber to measure the scale of success of a campaign. In simple words, the difference between the amount of investment and the return on the investment is called the return on investment in marketing.\nDisastrous ROI can lead to stop or cut down the project costs like we never saw the third sequel to the Jim Carrey classic, Bruce Almighty! On the other side, you will be waiting for the next sequel of Mission Impossible, right? Yes, it is the ROI that leads the project to proceed further. Let’s have a look at the financial details of the Mission Impossible series;\nThe release date: 1996\nBox office: Total (6 films): $3.570 billion\nProduced by: Tom Cruise\nBudget: Total (6 films): $828 million\nROI: 2.672 billion\nWhat’s good marketing ROI?\nIf you are making more than a dollar for every dollar you spend on a marketing campaign it means the marketing ROI is good and vice versa.\nThe marketing strategy, distribution channels, and the industry impact on the “good ROI” in marketing. This logic is true because all marketing tactics are different so does marketing ROI benchmarks.\nIf you are dealing with an online ad strategy like PPC, and all the data is tracked through the servers of Google, it is much easy to see how your ads return in comparison to others.\nAnother way, if your marketing strategy involves content marketing, blog posts, podcasts, or videos, it might be hard to find out if it was your content that pays you back in the shape of leads and/or customers.\nContent Marketing Institute, one of the leading online platforms teaching about content marketing, states that it is almost hard to determine marketing ROI.\nLet’s consult businesses to get to know marketing ROI from their perspective. They have set a very simple formula and that is if you earned more than what you earned in past from the same strategy with the almost same spending including current sales numbers. From these simple lines, it is easy to create ROI benchmarks and goals that are realistic for your company.\nMarketing ROI formula\n[((number of leads x lead-to-customer rate x average sales price) – cost or ad spend) ÷ cost or ad spend] x 100.\nIdentify the following things to use marketing ROI formula;\n- Number of leads: how many visitors converted to lead\n- Lead – to – Customer rate: how many leads converted to customers.\n- Average sales price: The average sales price of your product.\n- Cost/ad spend: how much did you spend on creating and promoting the marketing campaign? This cost includes ad spend, hourly wages of people who put time into the project, or cost-related to producing content.\nMarketing ROI examples\nFrom the facts of the 2018 State of Inbound Report, 82% of marketers observed a positive ROI in their inbound marketing strategy.\nThe cost to produce blog post is quite less than the cost to produce video content but it still cost you time and money. The related costs to calculate are time-related costs, production costs, and promotional costs into your total spending.\nLet’s translate time into a dollar amount and for the purpose, track the number of hours that an employee spent on the project and then multiply that number by their hourly wage.\nFor example, if you pay $10 an hour and it takes 3hours to write a promotional post, your total cost will be $30 in labor.\nThe promotional cost will be separate and will be added after the spent.\nIf your blog post linked to a landing page then you must need a tracking URL instead of a basic page URL. Having a tracking URL will help you find how many visitors are coming to the landing page directly from your blog post.\nNext, if the blog post visitor is converted to the lead, and the customer then you will be able to see how many leads and customers your blog post bring to the business. Finally, you will be able to find how successful your marketing strategy remains.\nA law firm focuses on divorce settlement cases and wants to gain more clients. They write 7 blog posts on divorce settlement rights. Each post is assigned a tracking URL that links to a landing page where prospects can request a Free Legal Consultation.\nThe firm spent $900 on the blog post draft and $100 to promote it. All 7 blog posts create 10 leads – four of which become clients. The firm made an average of $1500 per client.\nHere’s how their ROI would be calculated:\nThis marketing segment is thought to be dead but it is not true. Even I myself clicked the link given in the email from Neil Patel. In fact, a business can make $38 dollars for every dollar they spend on an email. There are many good examples of the real-world where people getting marketing ROI through email marketing.\nabout 83% of marketers are convinced with their personal experience that video marketing is so helpful in their marketing strategy. Research your product from the customer point of view and spend a handsome time handful of money to produce video content.\nPay Per Click is a great way to market your product by reaching your prospects. Google says its advertisers to get a strong marketing ROI, but small businesses still waste 25% of their budget on not so well managed PPC campaigns.\nThere are a number of tools that can help you monitor and manage live PPC campaigns, utilize them.\nBest practices of measuring marketing ROI\nDetermining marketing ROI is tricky. If you are running PPC or paid social media ads then it is quite easy to find out the Marketing ROI over the platforms. But when it is about things like content marketing it is kind of tricky to trace the benefits to the business.\nIt is advised to monitor the following factors to determine if marketing ROI is good or not.\n- The time you spent to create the promotional content of any type.\n- The production cost will include the total cost of supplies, services, and software needed to create the campaign.\n- The total cost of the promotion spent\n- Use a tracking URL to get the page analytics\n- If you gain any social media engagement, unexpected traffic boosts, or other benefits from your campaign then this still helping your level of brand awareness.","Email Marketing Analytics: To measure the success of business growth performance, the companies must use the key performance indicators (KPIs).

{"question":"How are both the Namur citadel and the Broch of Mousa used for tourism today? Please list the main tourist activities at each site.","answer":"Both historic structures offer tourist activities but in different ways. The Namur citadel offers various modern attractions including a hotel-restaurant (Castle of Namur), the Terra Nova Visitor Centre with underground tours, Queen Fabiola Park with children's facilities, a perfumery, local crafts shops, a funicular, a tourist train, and tuk-tuk tours. The Broch of Mousa, managed by Historic Scotland, offers a more archaeological experience where visitors can access the structure via boat from Sandwick, ascend the internal staircase to an open walkway at the top, and observe the original features like the hearth, floor tank, and stone cells. It's also a popular spot for birders to observe breeding European storm-petrels, particularly during summer nights.","context":["Did you know that the Namur citadel is one of the largest citadels in Europe?\nA site modified over time and history\nThe citadel, a former fortified castle that has undergone several transformations over the course of its hundreds of years of existence, consists of several parts. Some newer than others. Due to its strategic location at the confluence of the Sambre and the Meuse rivers, it has attracted many enthusiasts over the years.\nThe first part was built in the Middle Ages and gradually evolved into a true fortified castle. A surrounding wall enclosed a small town that included the residence of the Counts of Namur, a collegiate church, auditoriums (reception rooms), a bakery and stables. Today, you can still see parts of the wall, the castle and the three towers that were built beyond the protective moat.The desire to improve artillery and fortification techniques gave rise to a bastioned front above the castle, known as the “Median”. The architecture of this part of the building is still visible. The third and new defensive part, the “Terra Nova”, was built later. Some parts of it can still be seen today.\nImpressive underground tunnels\nA fortified castle, underground passages and a whole host of other attractions\nThe citadel site is not only made up of the fortress overlooking the city. In the enclosure you will also find another castle, the castle of Namur. This hotel-restaurant (open to the public) was built between the two world wars and is surrounded by a garden.Also discover the esplanade, which was once a stadium and an open-air theatre. Then take the opportunity to walk through the attractive Queen Fabiola Park, which is located at the top of the site. Here you will find numerous facilities to entertain your children and several places to eat. A trip to the citadel is not complete without a visit to the Terra Nova Visitor Centre. This is the starting point for the underground tour. In this former barracks, you will be led on a pictorial journey through the history of the city of Namur.\nAt “Made in Namur”, discover the flavours of Namur and the many products from local producers that you can taste on the spot or take away.Also make a beeline for the Guy Delforge perfumery! This building, steeped in history, may today be a perfumer’s workshop, but once it was dedicated to the manufacture of gunpowder and projectiles. You can take a guided tour that will reveal each stage of the perfumer’s creation. Rich in, and proud of, its local producers and craftsmen, the city of Namur is also pleased to present Véronique Henri’s creations in the Vieille Forge (Old Forge). Discover her ceramics, paintings, and jewellery full of charm and authenticity. Don’t like to walk too much? Then you will be delighted to have access to the citadel via the funicular! To please the kids, there is also a small tourist train that allows them to discover the ramparts and enjoy the panoramic view of the Namur valley. Would you like to visit the site in a unique way? Then take a tuk-tuk from the Citadel! The driver will also take you to the strawberry museum in Wépion via the “La merveilleuse” road and along the Meuse.","Broch of Mousa\n|Broch of Mousa|\nMousa Broch exterior\nBroch of Mousa (or Mousa Broch) is the finest preserved example of an Iron Age broch or round tower in Shetland, Scotland. It is the tallest still standing in the world and amongst the best-preserved prehistoric buildings in Europe. It is thought to have been constructed circa 100 BC, one of 570 brochs built throughout Scotland. The site is managed by Historic Scotland.\nThe broch is located on the western shore of the island of Mousa (grid reference HU457237). It is accessible by boat from Sandwick, Shetland, 14 miles south of Lerwick. It stands on the flat rock surface of a low promontory near the shore overlooking Mousa Sound.\nMousa Broch has one of the smallest overall diameters of any broch, as well as one of the thickest wall bases and smallest interiors; this massive construction (as well as its remote location) is likely to be the main explanation for its excellent state of preservation. It stands 13.3 metres high and is accessible via a single entrance at ground level. Once inside, a visitor may ascend an internal staircase to an open walkway at the top. It is the only broch which is complete right to the top, including the original intramural stair. It is built of dry stone with no mortar. The entrance is on the west side but has been enlarged and altered from its original appearance. The entrance passage is 5 metres long and still has its original bar-hole.\nInside a hearth and floor tank can be seen in the central space. There is a low stone bench around the base of the inside wall, which must have been an early alteration to the interior. The broch went through at least two phases of occupation. In its original condition it may have contained a wooden roundhouse resting on the scarcement ledges and presumably on a ring of posts set into the primary floor. At a later date this must have been demolished to make way for a small wheelhouse (with three projecting stone piers) in the interior. Scarcement ledges at heights of 2.1 and 3.7 metres would have supported these timber buildings. The other main feature of the ground floor is the three large cells within the walls. They are entered via thresholds which are 0.7 metres above the floor level. Above the lintel of each cell door are further openings which seem designed to let light and air into the chamber behind. The cells all have recesses, or large cupboards, set into the thickness of the wall.\nAbove the solid base of the broch are five galleries preserved complete, part of a sixth is complete and roofed and the bottom part of a seventh rests on the sixth. The galleries are formed by the space between the two concentric walls of the upper part of the broch, and are partly lit by three voids. It is possible to walk along most of the galleries, although ready access is blocked by the staircase. The stair, which begins at the second level, is reached by a doorway in the inner wall face, which has an adjacent cell. There is also an upper cell above the entrance passage.\nMousa Broch continued to be used over the centuries and is mentioned in two Norse Sagas. This may have been the time when the entrance passage was extended upwards. Egil's Saga tells of a couple eloping from Norway to Iceland who were shipwrecked and used the broch as a temporary refuge. The Orkneyinga Saga gives an account of a siege of the broch by Earl Harald Maddadsson in 1153 following the abduction of his mother who was held inside the broch.\nThe site was visited by the antiquarian George Low during his tour of 1774 and he provided the first drawings of the broch. It was visited by Sir Walter Scott in 1814, who described it as \"a Pictish fortress, the most entire probably in the world.\" The antiquarian Samuel Hibbert visited it in 1822 and provided a detailed account of the site. The first accurate survey was conducted by Sir Henry Dryden in 1852.\nMousa was cleared of debris in 1861 and great quantities of animal bones, especially of otters (which probably inhabited the deserted ruin) were found. Also found were pieces of a clay pot, stone pot lids, a slaty stone about 12 inches long \"like a three-cornered file\" and a \"carved model of a Norway boat in fir\" about 3 inches long. The interior was cleared again by the Office of Works in 1919, but no finds are mentioned. In the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh are some pottery sherds, including a large black-burnished rim sherd, probably found during the 19th century clearance.\nIn January 2005 it was announced that archaeologists used 3D laser scanning to catalogue the structure in detail for possible repairs. With the scans it is now possible to see how the structure was constructed in detail.\nMousa Broch is well known among birders for its breeding European storm-petrels, which are best seen after dark on partly or on completely overcast summer nights. The island holds around 6,800 breeding pairs in total, representing about 8% of the British population and about 2.6% of the world population. Some of these birds nest in burrows within the broch itself.\n- Mousa Broch at Historic Scotland. Retrieved 15 September 2014\n- \"Site Record for Mousa, Broch Of Mousa\". RCAHMS.

{"question":"What conservation goals are shared by the Huzzah Creek watershed in Missouri and Kansas' eastern watersheds?","answer":"Both regions focus on streambank stabilization and erosion control. In the Huzzah Creek watershed, efforts aim to prevent valuable land from washing into streams and reduce impacts on aquatic habitat for fish and wildlife. Similarly, in eastern Kansas, conservation efforts target streams lacking adequate tree cover, with trees helping stabilize river banks, keep debris off fields, and improve water quality by reducing sediment entry into streams, which is particularly important as Kansas federal reservoirs serve as water sources for over two-thirds of the state's population.","context":["Ozark Land Trust (www.ozarklandtrust.org), a Missouri nonprofit organization, has received a generous $100,000 grant from the Robert J. Trulaske, Jr. Family Foundation for streambank restoration along Huzzah Creek, a major tributary of the Meramec River.\nThe Huzzah Creek watershed, with its crystal clear spring-fed streams, rich plant and animal life is one of the most biologically intact and functioning landscapes within the Meramec River Basin. It also serves as the home to farmers who graze cattle and grow hay, and to those who enjoy the kayak and floating recreation for which the Ozarks are so well known.\n“We are grateful to the Trulaske Foundation for trusting and enabling Ozark Land Trust to protect and improve the health of the Huzzah and Meramec watersheds,” said Larry Levin, Executive Director of OLT. “This support builds upon our partnership with landowners, agencies and other nonprofits to protect the immense beauty and value of the land and waters, and at the same time meet the needs and goals of farmers and ranchers, whose homes and livelihoods depend on the creek’s health and stability.”\nStreambank erosion is of vital concern for landowners in the watershed. Valuable land is washed into streams, filling in pools and reducing aquatic habitat for fish and wildlife. The Foundation’s grant, along with support from other funders, will enable OLT and its partners to stabilize and restore almost a mile along Huzzah Creek, as well as implement numerous other conservation practices.\n“Our Foundation is grateful for the leadership of the Ozark Land Trust and the support of all partners involved in this effort to reverse the effects of erosion and protect habitat along the Huzzah,” said Jeanne Trulaske Dalba, President of the Robert J. Trulaske, Jr. Family Foundation.\nOLT has worked in tandem with the Missouri Department of Conservation, The Nature Conservancy-Missouri Chapter, and a landowners’ committee that includes a variety of residents within the watershed. The groups have built strong relationships over the last 15 years, and a cooperative structure that has been effective in other Missouri watersheds as well.\nIn addition to administering the Foundation’s grant, OLT also holds five conservation easements on more than 500 acres in the Huzzah Creek watershed. Conservation easements keep land in pri- vate hands but prevent intense development, while allowing many productive uses, such as farming, ranching and forestry, to continue. A land trust such as OLT serves as steward of the easements, permanently safeguarding the lands’ important conservation values.\nOzark Land Trust is a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization that works with landowners and partners to protect resources across the Ozark bioregion. A nationally accredited land trust, OLT current protects more than 30,000 acres of forests, farmlands and other natural landscapes for both public and private use.

A five-year partnership agreement between NRCS and the Kansas Forest Service provides free technical assistance, in addition to $8.1 million in financial assistance to landowners who implement conservation practices, such as planting trees to control erosion and improve water quality.\nWith additional financial assistance from Watershed Restoration and Protection Strategy groups, a landowner would only need to cover 10 percent of the total conservation project cost.\n“This project provides a great opportunity where conservation stewardship can add value to the property at a reasonable cost,” said Eric Banks, NRCS Kansas state conservationist.\nAssistance is available for landowners in targeted watersheds. Many Kansas streams in the eastern one-third of Kansas lack adequate tree cover to stabilize streambanks.\nAccording to the Kansas Water Office, federal reservoirs in Kansas serve as the source of municipal and industrial water for more than two-thirds of the state’s population. Runoff and erosion contribute to sedimentation of these reservoirs. Trees help stabilize river banks, keep debris off of fields, and ultimately improve water quality by reducing sediment entry into streams. This program also funds the improvement of the quality and productivity of woodlands and forests, which are vital to overall watershed health.\nThis type of partnership agreement is a new feature included in the 2014 Farm Bill. Called the Regional Conservation Partnership Program, it encourages partners to join in efforts with producers to increase the restoration and sustainable use of soil, water, wildlife, and related natural resources on regional or watershed scales. The program lets partners (such as the Kansas Forest Service) stretch their resources and share expertise to help producers install and maintain conservation activities in selected project areas.\nApplications will be taken until funding is exhausted, and the project will be funded on a first come, first served basis as long as the resource concern meets the NRCS and Kansas Forest Service conservation criteria.\nFor more information on eligibility requirements and how to apply, call or visit your local NRCS office located in USDA Service Centers. Locations and contact information are available online at www.ks.nrcs.usda.gov by clicking on “Find a Service Center” under “Kansas Links.” Eligible areas and more information can be found on the Kansas Forest Service website: www.kansasforests.org/streamside_forestry/rcpp.html, or by calling or emailing Bob Atchison, rural forestry coordinator with the Kansas Forest Service, 785-532-3310 or [email protected].\nAbout the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service\n“Black Sunday” on April 14, 1935, is known as the worst dust storm in American history. After moving across Kansas, the dust cloud reached Washington, D.C. on the next day, with the sky so dark, lights had to be turned on at noon. Congress took action. President Roosevelt signed the bill creating the Soil Conservation Services on April 27, 1935. Now called the Natural Resources Conservation Service, we have a deeply held vision of a nation where use of resources is guided by a widely shared and heartfelt stewardship ethic. Our approach starts with talking one-on-one with landowners to understand their goals and then applying science-based conservation practices to create a plan to fix problems such as soil health, grazing capacity, water and wind erosion, wildlife preservation or wetland management. To help people help the land to sustain their livelihood now and for the future.\nAbout the Kansas Forest Service\nThe Kansas Forest Service is the nation’s fifth oldest state forestry agency. The agency serves rural landowners, communities, rural fire districts, forest and arboriculture industries, and citizens of the state through its Conservation Tree and Shrub Planting, Fire Management, Community Forestry, Rural Forestry, Marketing and Utilization, and Forest Health programs. The Kansas Forest Service state office is located in Manhattan, Kansas, just off the campus of Kansas State University. The agency is administratively attached to the Department of Horticulture, Forestry and Recreation Resources, College of Agriculture, Kansas State University. The agency receives its direction from a mission statement that reads: “Care of Natural Resources and Service to People through Forestry.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d9721dab-6aa4-449d-80d3-08414827f2ee>","<urn:uuid:1fb1ca21-44e4-4628-ae81-7b279316a36e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between industrial safety vacuum cleaners designed for asbestos dust versus air purifiers with HEPA filters? Both claim to handle dangerous particles, but I need specifics about their technical capabilities.","answer":"Safety vacuum cleaners for asbestos dust and air purifiers with HEPA filters have distinct capabilities. Industrial safety vacuum cleaners like the S 560-Asbestos model are specifically designed for hazardous industrial environments and can handle carcinogenic dusts, pathogens, and materials with Work Exposure Limits. They include features like 3m suction hoses and can operate in both wet and dry conditions. In contrast, air purifiers with true HEPA filters are designed to remove at least 99.97% of particles measuring 0.3 microns in laboratory conditions, focusing primarily on common household particles like dust, pollen, and smoke.

Usually, filters are made from paper, fiber (typically fiberglass), or mesh, and require regular replacement to preserve efficiency.\nWhat are air purifiers expected to filter out and do they really do it?\nA lot of filters on the market are developed to capture particles like dust and pollen, however don’t catch gases like VOCs (unstable organic compounds) or radon. That would require an adsorbent, like activated carbon. The Environmental Security Firm (EPA) cautions that the functionality of air purifiers is limited in terms of filtering out gases, and that you should often change filters for ideal functionality, typically about every 3 or so months.\nMany air purifiers are good at filtering toxin particles out of the air (dust, smoke, pollen, and so on), but they are not necessarily great at getting rid of gaseous contaminants like VOCs or radon from the air that might build up from adhesives, paints, or cleaning products. Allergens that are embedded into furnishings or floor covering are likewise not captured by them.\nAdditionally, the efficiency of air cleansers in real-world scenarios most likely will not simulate those of regulated conditions in a laboratory (what those “99% efficiency” claims are describing!). The place, setup, circulation rate, and how long it is operating for will all vary, as will the conditions in the space. In addition, there are other things taking place in your house that might effect the efficacy like ventilation (open or closed windows), and new particles are constantly emerging, so the air may not as filtered as the claims may have you think.\nIf you are concerned about mold, we ‘d recommend purchasing a dehumidifier or humidifier to assist maintain the appropriate moisture levels in your home and ward off mold development issues. Air cleansers do not avoid mold growth, so it is essential to get rid of the source of wetness that is permitting it to grow.\nCan air cleansers filter the outside air that enters your home?\nSometimes, non-organic air pollutants like the VOCs we pointed out previously can originate from outdoors your house. “There are all sorts of circumstances in structure fires where large doses of smoke inhalation might lead to cyanide toxicity. However that would largely need to be someone who was standing directly in or near the fire: Those individuals are given emergency clinic immediately,” Dr. Roten describes. “Normally, outside contamination or smoke or short-term bad air isn’t a continuous issue for bystanders.” However the best sort of cleanser can address any ecological air qualities in your location. Utilizing close-by wildfires as an example, Dr. Roten includes that a HEPA filter-equipped cleanser is your best bet: “Anything that has a true HEPA filter in it is probably adequate enough to filter out the majority of all the big particles that would be concerning,” he says. “The majority of the smoky smell will likewise be attended to as well.”\nWhat should I look for in an air purifier?\nCADR (clean-air delivery rate) rating. This measures the cleaning speed of the cleanser for eliminating smoke, dust, and and pollen. Search for a CADR of at least 300, above 350 is actually terrific.\nFor proper effectiveness, you require a design created to work in the space size. Choose a model that is designed for an area larger than the one you are equipping it for if you wish to run it at a lower, quieter setting.\nAHAM (Association of House Appliance Manufacturers) Verified mark AHAM’s standards are style to ensure the security, efficiency and efficiency of lots of home care home appliances, consisting of air cleansers. The requirements are developed to provide a typical understanding in between manufacturers and consumers to assist make the purchasing process simpler. While voluntary, many trusted air cleansers have actually undergone this accreditation program, which often provides a CADR ranking and size guidelines.\nTrue HEPA. Real HEPA filters work at removing ultra fine particles (think: dust, dander, pollen, mold and other typical allergens in the house). The market requirement for such is that the unit needs to have the ability to remove a minimum of 99.97% of particulates determining 0.3 micron size in a laboratory setting. Remember, it is important to keep in mind that in reality settings, the actual efficacy of these gadgets would be far less as new pollutants are constantly emerging. Note that there is no market requirement for the terms “HEPA-like” or “HEPA-type,” and are mostly utilized as marketing tactics to get consumers to acquire the product."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a32a165d-47e7-437a-bdc9-09f49284f2a2>","<urn:uuid:91e474da-9c24-415f-b074-3a64613204be>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Are both Abigail Toland and Amanda Sanfilippo involved in commissioning new artistic works?","answer":"Yes, both are involved in commissioning new artistic works. Amanda Sanfilippo, as curator of Fringe Projects, commissions temporary public artworks in Miami. Meanwhile, Abigail Toland, as producer at Second Movement, has commissioned works like Zátopek!, a new opera about Czech Olympian Emil Zátopek, and supports new opera through the rough for opera platform which has supported work by more than 50 composers.","context":["Fringe Projects Brings Public Art\nto Downtown Miami and Beyond\nPhotographs by Gesi Schilling | Courtesy of Fringe Projects\nThis Thursday, from 6 to 8 pm, Fringe Projects will premiere Site of Sound, an interactive underwater performance by artist Cara Despain in partnership with EXILE Books. This new soundscape created by Cara Despain will be experienced in the pool at The Standard Spa. The work creates a soundtrack for the city using found sounds in the storm drains of Miami, serving as a commentary on an issue that the city has struggled with for years: surrounded by water, the heralded growth of Miami is at odds with sea level rise. In a constant battle with storm surges and temporary flooding, invasive water could become a permanent part of Miami’s not-too-distant future.\nSite of Sound is the most recent project funded by Fringe Projects. Started in 2012 in tandem with DWNTWN Art Days, Fringe Projects is a commissioning organization that funds temporary public artworks in the city of Miami. Using an open call format, artists submit their ideas under a request for proposal and selected projects are shown for a period of time – from a single event to months in duration. The objective is to engage Miami residents and challenge artists to use the city of Miami as a starting point for their work.\nThe recent growth of the organization is in no small part due to the appointment of Amanda Sanfilippo as curator in 2013. Sanfilippo sees Fringe Projects as a way to use the whole city as an artistic platform, “Commissioning is so key to contemporary art, so Fringe is really about exploring that, alongside asking the question, ‘What does it mean to produce large-scale experimental work that is open-ended?’ Public works can have such an impact on a city.”\nHer vision reflects her training as a curator. Her own relationship with large scale public art developed in the graduate program at the Sotheby’s Institute of Art, London. It was there that she became interested in the idea of how to ask an artist to use a city as a platform. That led to positions at Creative Time, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, NY and the BCA Center in Burlington, VT. In addition to serving as curator for Fringe Projects, she is currently the development director at Locust Projects, non-profit exhibition space in the Design District that works with local and international artists.\nTo date Fringe Projects has worked with roster of artists, commissioning works with Miami artists Nicholas Lobo, Emmett Moore, Domingo Castillo and Jillian Mayer. The increasing scale of the pieces has garnered the organization attention: In 2015, Fringe Projects was awarded both a Knight Arts Challenge Grant and a Wavemaker Grant. “The grants will help us expand both the scope and duration of our projects in the future,” says Sanfilippo.\nShe references public art organizations such as Creative Time, New York and Artangel, London, as inspiration, noting that Fringe Projects takes measures to support artist’s ideas and encourage experimentation, alongside field-work and research.\nAs for what Fringe could be in the future? Sanfilippo says, “Miami could be a major biennale city and we’re two steps away.”","Second Movement’s Artistic Directors are Nicholas Chalmers, Simon Lima Holdsworth and Oliver Mears.

{"question":"How did ancient Chinese aristocrats view the afterlife during the Qin/Han dynasties, and how does this compare to other cultures' festivals honoring the dead?","answer":"In ancient China during the Qin and Han dynasties, aristocrats viewed the afterlife as very similar to earthly life. They were buried with practical items like bronze bowls, wine vessels, and food containers, believing these would be useful in the afterlife. The First Emperor's tomb contained terracotta soldiers, pet animals, dancers, and even sacrificed concubines to comfort him after death. This tradition continues today with people being buried with paper money and model cars. In comparison, other cultures around the world have different ways of honoring their dead. For instance, during Mexico's Día de los Muertos, people place food, drink, and items the deceased enjoyed at grave sites, while in China's Hungry Ghost Festival, paper offerings like fake money and cut-out cars are burned to provide for ancestors in their afterlife. In Japan's Obon festival, spirits are believed to return to visit relatives, and in Korea's Chuseok, families honor ancestors by sharing harvest foods and visiting graves.","context":["French schoolchildren used to be taught that they were descended from the Gauls, a tribe that emerged around the fifth century BC. It is a common conceit of nineteenth-century nationalism that citizens of modern nation-states can trace their national origins back to a remote past. Not so long ago, a Japanese professor maintained that “Japanese values” were already in evidence more than ten thousand years ago among the Jomon period hunter-gatherers.\nMuch of this is nonsense. But the Chinese at least have a better claim than most people of being heirs to a unified culture that began roughly in the third century BC. This idea forms the basis of the fascinating exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Qin and Han dynasty artifacts. Almost all the objects lay buried for many centuries in tombs. That is why we can see perfectly preserved lacquer ware from a burial site in Sichuan, richly colored textiles from the far west of China, the body of Dou Wan, wife of Prince Jing, encased in a suit made of jade, and much more. And all these are more than two thousand years old.\nIn 221 BC, the Qin conquered six other kingdoms in what is now geographically a part of China. Under the first emperor, Qin Shihuangdi—reviled in Chinese history as a tyrant, but much admired by the no less brutal Mao Zedong—the Chinese language was unified in a common writing system. A common currency was introduced, as well as a system of weights and measures. Central power was exercised through an elaborate bureaucracy. The First Emperor also mobilized hundreds of thousands of slave workers and convicts to build roads, waterways, and, most famously, parts of what came to be known as the Great Wall.\nThe Han dynasty that toppled the Qin in 206 BC was in many ways more humane. Whereas the First Emperor allegedly buried Confucian scholars alive after burning their books, because, rather like Chairman Mao, he wished to start his reign on a clean slate and couldn’t tolerate dissent, Confucianism became the state ideology under the Han emperors. Rare stone tablets from the Eastern Han dynasty (AD 25-220), engraved with texts from Confucian classics, that once stood in front of a lecture hall, were excavated in the 1980s, and are now on show at the Met.\nZhixin Jason Sun, who curated the exhibition, writes in the catalogue that the dominance of Confucian thought “undoubtedly struck a heavy blow against intellectual development, and, consequently, had a lasting negative effect over the next two millennia.” This is one of the clichés of leftist Chinese propaganda. Confucianism, revised endlessly by scholarship over the last two thousand years, is too diverse a philosophy to lend itself to such a sweeping statement. The least one can say is that from the beginning Confucian ideas constituted a secular attempt to devise a moral political order. That it was often used—and still is—as a doctrine of bureaucratic oppression should not obscure its remarkably enlightened origins. Contrary to what the current Communist Party, or indeed the likes of Lee Kuan Yew, the late Singaporean prime minister, have made of it, an important strand of Confucianism, developed by the fourth-century philosopher Mencius, holds that people have the right to rebel against an unjust ruler.\nEven though certain aspects of Chinese civilization, such as the uniform written language, do indeed go all the way back to the First Emperor of Qin, it is highly unlikely that most people living under his rule, or indeed in later dynasties, thought of themselves as “Chinese” in the same way citizens of the PRC or Taiwan, or in the global Chinese diaspora, do now. Still, the exhibition reminded me of an experience I had a few decades ago, when I visited the Chinese galleries at the British Museum in London after seeing a show of Russian Orthodox art. It felt like coming back to a familiar world of plain humanity, after being immersed in sacred images meant to awe the viewer in a display of religious power. And there is something rather Chinese about that.\nWhat is striking even of the artifacts produced under the despotic Qin emperor is how down to earth many of them are. The soldiers in his terracotta army, protecting the emperor in his tomb, are not stylized figures, or symbols of otherworldly power, but individual human beings sculpted with a remarkable sense of realism. “Down to earth” is of course a relative concept, since the bulk of the objects on display were dug up from the tombs of aristocrats, whose lives would have had very little in common with the peasants who provided them with their food, dug the canals, served in the imperial armies, and built the first bits of the Great Wall.\nIt would also be a mistake to forget how different people in the distant (or even the not so distant) past were to most of us in the way they saw the world. Like the ancient Egyptians, the Chinese who could afford to think about such things at all were obsessed with notions of immortality and the afterlife. That is why we can still enjoy the glories of the terracotta soldiers in the Qin Emperor’s vast tomb that was a microcosm of life on earth. There were sculptures of pet animals too, and dancers and acrobats to entertain him, and model palaces, parks, and pavilions. Rivers of mercury wended their way through mountain ranges of bronze. And the bones of his concubines, sacrificed to comfort their ruler in the afterlife, were found inside the tomb as well.\nFrom the First Emperor’s tomb to funerals in our own time, the traditional Chinese view of the afterlife is hardly any different from life on earth. People are still buried with paper money and model cars, as well as food. The superbly crafted Han dynasty bronze bowls, wine vessels, and lamps, and the exquisite red and black lacquer food containers, would have been of practical use to the deceased if they had indeed lived on as people believed they would. In life after death, the Chinese grandees were still expected to take delight in the beauties of nature, splendid animals, good food and fine wines, as well as graceful dancers and bed companions. Having been beautifully preserved underground for thousands of years, these objects delight us still.\nOne of the attractive qualities of Qin and Han culture, shared by the arts of many later eras, is their cosmopolitanism. Chinese artisans and their patrons loved to adopt and adapt designs and shapes imported from Iran, India, Central Asia, and perhaps even ancient Greece. Golden ornaments with horse motifs that predate the Qin dynasty show the influence of Scythian designs. Gold beads excavated from Han tombs are worked with fine filigree that suggests Persian or Bactrian origins. Even during periods of oppressive central control, China was never really closed to outside influences.\nThis high level of sophistication creates the illusion that if we were to meet a cultivated Chinese of the second century BC at a dinner party today, we would have much to talk about. It is easy to forget that the past remains another country. But perhaps it isn’t a complete illusion. Despite periods of horrendous violence, savage wars, and cruel oppression, something of the humanist spirit of ancient China has survived. In another thousand years, if mankind is still around, Chairman Mao’s attempt to stamp it out will look like a tiny blip in Chinese history. There is consolation in that.\n“Age of Empires: Art of the Qin and Han Dynasties” is on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art through July 16.","Festivals of the Dead Around the World\nIn the United States, Halloween is mostly about candy, but elsewhere in the world celebrations honoring the departed have a spiritual meaning\nIn the United States, Halloween is big business: The National Retail Federation estimates that Americans spent over 6 billion dollars on candy, costumes and ghoulish decor during the 2013 holiday. But what has become a commercial feast for candy producers and pumpkin farmers actually has its roots in an ancient Celtic festival, Samhain, which marked the beginning of winter. The Celts believed that the night before Samhain, spirits from the other world came and destroyed vegetation with their breath, leaving the land barren for winter. People would leave food and wine on their doorsteps to appease the spirits, and wear masks when they left the house to blend in with them. Eventually, the pagan tradition was co-opted by the Christian church in the eighth century, and Samhain became All Saint's Day—or All Hallows. The night before became Hallows Eve (later Halloween for short).\nHalloween retained its spiritual and macabre nature through many centuries, thanks to traditions like souling, where the poor would beg for pastries on November 2 (All Souls Day) in exchange for prayers for deceased relatives. In the 19th century, Irish and Scottish immigrants in America began to revive these traditions—with more of an emphasis on trick-or-treating than religious introspection—and by 2013, more than 150 million consumers participated in the modern American iteration of Halloween.\nAround the world, many cultures have festivals intended to honor the dead. Like Samhain, some of them are linked to the change of seasons and the harvest, while others mirror the influence of Christianity, spread by missionaries throughout the world. If you're interested in checking out holidays for the dead—without fun-sized candy bars and jack-o'-lanterns—consider taking a trip to one of these seven festivals. But note that while many feature jubilant celebrations replete with dancing and music, they're meant first and foremost as a way to honor dead relatives and ancestors, and should be approached with respect.\nA traditional Buddhist festival, Obon commemorates lost ancestors, whose spirits are believed to come back during Obon to visit relatives. Sometimes called the Japanese Day of the Dead, Obon was traditionally celebrated during the seventh lunar month, around the 15th day. Today that roughly translates to August 15, and most festivals throughout Japan are held from August 13 to 16 (though in some areas of Tokoya, Obon is celebrated around July 15).\nSince Obon commemorates the spirits of ancestors, many people return to their hometowns, and spend the holiday surrounded by family and friends. In Kyoto residents publicly mark the end of Obon by lighting giant bonfires in the hills surrounding the city; the fires are thought to guide spirits back to the world of the dead.\nIf you want to experience Obon, consider making a trip to Kyoto to see the fires and witness the bon-odori, a traditional dance meant to welcome spirits of the dead into the world of the living (catch a glimpse of these dances at public parks or temples). People also honor the deceased through toro nagashi, or floating lanterns, which are sent down rivers to the ocean.\nDía de los Muertos\nLike Halloween, El Día de los Muertos is the product of ancient ritual mixed with Christian doctrine. Celebrated throughout Latin America—and by Mexican-Americans in the United States—it's most heavily associated with Mexico, where it began. Día de los Muertos actually takes place over two days, All Saints Day on November 1 and All Souls Day on November 2. The celebration emphasizes celebrating the lives of the deceased, complete with food, parades, dances and parties. Revelers believe that on Día de los Muertos, the spirits of the dead return to take part in the celebrations alongside the living.\nTo celebrate, people also decorate and clean the graves of deceased family members, removing weeds and debris and placing things that the deceased enjoyed while alive—food, drink and other offerings—at the grave site. A photo of the deceased is also added to the grave, creating a kind of altar. Pan de muerto, a sweet \"bread of the dead,\" is another important part of the holiday—families bake loaves, meant to look like a pile of bones, to place on graves as well. The holiday is marked with bright, vivid colors, as well as images of skeletons and skulls, a remnant of an Aztec tradition where skulls were used during rituals to symbolize death and rebirth.\nOne of the best places to experience the vibrant holiday is Mixquic, a community southwest of Mexico City's center. The area—which retains strong ties to its indigenous history—is famous for its Día de los Muertos celebrations, with vendors setting up stalls in the streets days before November 1. During the holiday, Mixquic's cemetery comes alive with vibrant colors as residents create beautiful altars, using flowers and other decorations, around the graves.\nChuseok, often compared to American Thanksgiving, is Korea's largest national holiday, and is celebrated throughout both North and South Korea. Marked with dancing, games and food, Chuseok is also a time for Koreans to honor their ancestors. The holiday is celebrated on the 15th day of the eighth lunar calendar month (which translates to sometime in September or October). Traditionally, the celebration coincides with the fall harvest—and during the three-day festival, the living give thanks to the dead for their part in providing bountiful crops.\nFamilies celebrate Chuseok by sharing the harvest with others, so the holiday is food-centric, with food prepared from the harvest and traditional Korean rice cakes enjoyed in the morning. Throughout the day, Koreans visit and clean the graves of their ancestors. At night, under the full moon, they participate in folk games and traditional dances.\nIf you want to get a true sense of this ancient holiday, consider heading to any of South Korea's well-preserved ancient villages, such as the Namsangol Hanok Village or the Korean Folk Village, which host special celebrations for the holiday.\nHungry Ghost Festival\nFor Buddhists and Taoists, an entire month is spent each year honoring their ancestors. The month—known as Hungry Ghost Month—culminates in the Hungry Ghost Festival, when the gates to the netherworld are said to be most open to the world of the living. Often, people avoid going out at night for fear that ghosts who have passed through the gates will haunt them.\nLike Halloween, however, the Hungry Ghost Festival balances fear with frivolity. Celebrations begin with a parade, which culminates with lanterns being placed on floats and released onto bodies of water. Families believe that the further the lantern travels before catching fire, the luckier the family will be in the coming year.\nDuring the Hungry Ghost Festival, families place food on altars to appease hungry spirits. They also place paper offerings—fake money, cut-out cars, paper watches—into metal bins; the paper in the bins is then set on fire, and the offerings are meant to provide for the ancestors in their afterlife.\nHeld on the 15th day of the seventh lunar month (July or August by Gregorian standards), Hungry Ghost Day is celebrated throughout China, but for the biggest celebrations, stick to the cities.\nGai Jatra, or festival of the cows, is one of the most popular holidays in Nepal and is held each year in August or September. Families who lost a relative in the last year lead a cow (or a child dressed as a cow, if a cow can't be procured) down the village street in a procession. The cow is one of the most revered animals in Hinduism, and participants believe that the animal will help lead the deceased family member into the afterlife.\nThe festival is believed to have begun in the 17th century, when Nepal's King Pratap Malla invited people to dress in costume and perform plays and stunts in front of the palace, in the hopes of making his wife happy again after the couple lost their young son. The queen did indeed smile at the sight of the celebration, and the parade has continued ever since. Today, participants still dress in costume to celebrate the procession. Nepal's cities celebrate Gai Jatra with verve, so consider a trip to Kathmandu if you want to witness the festivities.\nSometime between mid-September and mid-October each year, Cambodian life slows down in observance of Pchum Ben, one of the most important holidays in the Khmer religious calendar. The holiday lasts for fifteen days, during which time Cambodians gather at pagodas (wearing white, the Cambodian color of mourning) to remember ancestors. During the 15 days of Pchum Ben, the line between the living and dead is thought to be at its thinnest—Cambodians believe that during Pchum Ben, spirits come back in search of living relatives, hoping to atone for sins from their past life.\nLike in China, the spirits who wander through the world of the living are thought of as \"hungry ghosts,\" and as such, are offered food and drink to help placate their otherworldly suffering. Cambodians carry food to pagodas, which Buddhist monks then offer to the souls of the deceased.\nBecause Pchum Ben is such an important holiday—one that nearly every Cambodian participates in—visitors can see rituals and festivities in any Cambodian city. But since Pchum Ben is first and foremost a religious holiday, it's important to observe certain requirements, such as wearing white and avoiding tank tops, shorts or clothing that might be deemed disrespectful."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b1f8be5f-7cf9-4d3d-89f6-f1e67dcd021e>","<urn:uuid:0dafb259-7347-4279-bdd6-eb1dde409f4b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Gold recovery methods physical vs chemical - what difference? Also want know how handle e-waste properly?","answer":"For gold recovery methods: Physical methods involve gravity concentration but can be difficult when gold particles are locked in host rocks. Chemical methods include leaching and using microorganisms that can reduce gold ions to metallic forms. As for proper e-waste handling, you should: 1) Always use authorized recyclers and collection centers, 2) Disconnect batteries and protect glass surfaces before disposal, 3) Never dismantle electronics yourself, 4) Avoid giving e-waste to informal dealers or rag pickers, and 5) Never dispose of electronics in regular garbage bins. The proper way is to contact authorized collection centers or use their toll-free numbers to arrange pickup.","context":["Precious Metals Guide - Meierotto Jewelers,Traditional metals used in jewelry are the noble metals: silver, gold and the ...

{"question":"How do performance metrics differ between traditional leadership development programs and contingent workforce management? Could you explain the key contrasts in measuring success?","answer":"In leadership development, performance metrics are primarily gathered through employee performance appraisals, customer surveys, and direct observation of workplace operations, focusing on identifying areas that need improvement through training. These measurements help determine where the organization needs to develop its leaders' skills. For contingent workforce management, performance metrics are more project-focused, with clear KPIs aligned to specific project goals. The contingent workforce metrics focus on measurable benchmarks for performance evaluation and streamlined identification of areas for improvement, particularly in the context of specific assignments or projects. While leadership metrics aim for long-term skill development and organizational improvement, contingent workforce metrics emphasize immediate project delivery and specific task completion.","context":["Leadership Training and Development Needs Assessment\nProviding the opportunity for leaders in your organization to hone their skills through\nleadership training and development opportunities can bring improvement and change in the ways business is conducted.\nYet, not every leader needs the same training. How can you determine which of your leaders\nshould be given the opportunity to attend which specific training and development opportunity?\nThe answer is the implementation of a training needs assessment (TNA)\nOften, the employee performance appraisal can reveal clues to training needs. Metrics and measurements can also provide insight into what training can best development a leader's skills.\nDevelopment of a training needs assessment process is the best means of collecting these\nclues and creating a training plan for the individual from the data. There's little guesswork involved when the facts are collected and presented through a TNA.\nIn the TNA, it is important to collect the\nstrengths and weaknesses of each individual leader.\nThis doesn't mean that areas in which that person is strong can not benefit from\nadditional training, but it is obvious that the weakest skills should be developed first.\nBy reviewing employee performance appraisals, you should be able to identify and include in\nthe TNA those areas that could best benefit from additional training.\nSurveys of customers and employees reporting to each leader can also provide a great deal of insight into training needs. Again,\nyou'll want to select the areas that need the most improvement as priority areas for training and development.\nSpending a little time walking around your office or shop can give you a great deal of\ninformation about training needs. What is happening that is costing time and money? What can be changed to improve the process?\nObtaining the training and development record of each leader will also help you\ndetermine what leadership training and development to approve and in what order.\nImplementation of a TNA process should include a form or questionnaire into which the leadership employee can input data\ninitially, identifying areas in which they feel the need to receive training and development.\nAfter obtaining the completed TNA form, review the information and compare it to what you\nhave learned from performance appraisals, surveys, metric measurements and observation.\nUpon completion of your input, you should have a list of training that includes not only\nwhat the leader wants but also what the leader needs. Set priorities in areas that show the most need for training and follow through with making this training available to that leader.\nYou may well find\nthat most of the leaders both want and need certain training. In this case, consider making these training and development opportunities available to all your leadership team.\nYou'll probably identify some training that only one, two or a few of your leaders want\nand need. This might be training that can most effectively be provided by allowing these employees to attend outside the organization.\nThe most important part of leadership training and development is to\nknow what skills your leaders have and what skills they need to develop.\nBy using measurements to determine where your organization needs to\nimprove and training needs assessment processes to determine which areas training can most effectively result in positive change, you'll be able to make effective decisions and use your training and development\nbudget to get the most improvement for your training dollar.","What is Contingent Workforce?\nContingent workforce management involves the recruitment and oversight of the company’s part-time employees. This category encompasses various types of workers, such as independent contractors, gig workers, and those engaged under a Statement of Work. It also includes individuals hired through agency contracts or sourced and managed by external recruiters, commonly known as temporary staff.\nIndependent contractors are self-employed individuals providing services on a contract basis, with specific terms regarding both price and duration. This group includes freelancers completing designated tasks, like creating content for the company’s social media, or qualified consultants contributing their expertise to specific projects, such as auditors.\nThere are also gig workers*. They, on the other hand, collaborate with the company through platforms like Fiverr or Uber, working as freelancers with distinct origin and legal status.\n// *This term originates from the concept of the “Gig Economy”, a labor market system where individuals engage in freelance, temporary, on-call, or contract work instead of traditional permanent employment. Typically, this is facilitated through digital platforms that connect clients with eligible workers.\nStatement of Work (SoW)\nWorkers operating under a Statement of Work deliver services or perform defined scopes of work for a predetermined price and timeframe.\nAgency Contract Labor\nAgency contract labor involves individuals hired and paid by a temporary agency, often forming part or the majority of a team. They function similarly to full-time employees in terms of working hours but are formally employed by the agency.\nTemporary staff, typically managed and paid by external recruiters on an hourly basis, make up another segment of the contingent workforce. The distinction among these groups lies in their employment conditions, contractual relationships, and the nature of the work they perform.\nGiven the diversity of the contingent workforce, it is crucial to employ different management strategies tailored to each subgroup’s unique needs, contractual aspects, and associated risks and liabilities. Understanding these differences allows organizations to implement effective management strategies while ensuring compliance with both domestic and international laws and addressing the varied skills and requirements of temporary workers.\nPros & Cons of a Contingent Workforce\nFlexible work with contingent workers offers numerous benefits, but companies must carefully manage the associated challenges to ensure a cohesive and productive work environment. Let’s attempt to recognize certain benefits and drawbacks associated with this management approach.\nPros of a Contingent Workforce\n- Cost Efficiency: Employing contingent workers allows the company to reduce costs associated with health insurance, office space, and other employee benefits.\n- Flexibility in Workforce Management: Applications and systems for contingent workforce management effectively support employers by enabling strategic allocation of resources to specific projects. Contingent Workforce organization isn’t a logistical challenge when you have user-friendly interfaces and integrations.\n- Access to Specialized Skills: Utilizing contingent workers, such as independent contractors or on-demand workers, enriches the pool of available talents with individuals possessing specialized skills not necessarily found among permanent employees.\n- Scalability: Companies can easily adjust the number of workers to their current needs, helping them budget effectively and maintain competitiveness in a dynamic business environment.\n- Risk mitigation: Leveraging contingent workers allows companies to reduce employment-related risks since they are not obligated to maintain permanent positions and can quickly adapt to market changes.\n- Effective Talent Acquisition: Working with contingent workers provides access to a sizable, consistent pool of qualified candidates.\n- Strategic Workforce Planning: Companies can effectively pursue their strategic goals through the flexibility offered by hiring contingent workers.\nCons of a Contingent Workforce\nReduced Employee Loyalty: Contingent workers may not exhibit the same loyalty as permanent employees, potentially impacting the company culture and long-term organizational goals.\n💡 To address this issue, companies can use applications that facilitate the integration of external teams with permanent employees, using techniques like gamification.\nLimited Control over Work: Managing contingent workers can be challenging, as they often work more independently, and the delivered outcomes may lack a common pattern.\n💡 In this case, it’s valuable to rely on technologies and provide external workers with consistent materials, instructions, and guidelines.\nCompliance with Labor Laws: Companies must navigate complex labor laws when hiring contingent workers to avoid legal issues.\n💡 This challenge can be addressed by collaborating with temporary staffing agencies.\nDependency on External Agencies: Relying on temporary staffing agencies for contingent workers may generate additional costs and dependencies, affecting effective management.\n💡 This issue can be eliminated by partnering with a provider that has a broad workforce and can offer support at a consistent, competitive price.\nInconsistent Availability: Contingent workers, especially those in the “Gig Economy”, may be unavailable when needed, potentially leading to project delays.\n💡 This problem can be mitigated by collaborating with reliable workforce providers.\nPotential for High Turnover: The transient nature of contract work may contribute to higher employee turnover, requiring additional time and resources for continuous talent acquisition.\n💡 This issue can be addressed by partnering with a provider that offers attractive employment conditions.\nIntegration Challenges: Integrating non-permanent employees into the company’s payroll system and organizational culture can be challenging, affecting overall organizational coherence.\n💡 This issue can be resolved by collaborating with an agency that handles payroll matters or by using software that facilitates efficient time tracking for temporary workers. To incorporate temporary workers into the organizational culture, it’s beneficial to use a knowledge base for sharing information about the company or a company app that engages workers in the company’s life.\nWhich Industries Are Actively Hiring Contingent Workers?\nThe demand for contingent workers is driven by economic conditions, technological advancements, and industry trends. Industries (in alphabetical order for clarity) that frequently rely on the support of contingent workers include:\n- Construction and Engineering: Project-based work in construction and engineering often involves hiring contingent workers with specialized skills for specific tasks. Contingent workers like seasonal workers or construction workers are also frequently involved in performing the most physically demanding tasks.\n- Education: Educational institutions may hire contingent workers, such as substitute teachers or part-time instructors, to address short-term staffing needs.\n- Event Management: Contingent workers are often hired for planning events, coordination, and support services during conferences, trade shows, and other events.\n- Financial Services: Certain positions in the financial industry, such as consultants or analysts for specific projects, may be filled by contingent workers.\n- Healthcare: Contingent healthcare workers, including nurses and medical technicians, are frequently employed to fill staffing gaps or during peak demand periods.\n- Manufacturing: Manufacturing companies (Automotive, Food, Textile, Chemical, and others) hire contingent workers for assembly line work or specialized tasks. The demand for this workforce increases during periods of heightened production or when executing extensive projects.\n- Marketing and Creative Services: Companies regularly hire freelancers for marketing campaigns, graphic design, content creation, and social media management.\n- Retail and E-commerce: Seasonal fluctuations and the need for additional staff during peak times lead to the hiring of contingent workers in retail and e-commerce. Their responsibilities may include ensuring the smooth operation of warehouses, sorting facilities, and sometimes handling customer service calls.\n- Technology and IT: Many Tech companies hire freelancers or contract workers for specific projects or to address skill gaps. This encompasses software development, cybersecurity, data analysis, and more.\n- Telecommunications: The telecommunications industry frequently hires contingent workers for network installations, upgrades, and other project-based tasks, such as handling support or sales hotlines.\nEfficient Strategies for Contingent Workforce Management\nCompanies vary in their approaches to managing contingent workers, and the chosen strategy depends on various factors, including the company’s development stage, nature of business, business objectives, industry, legal constraints, and the need for specialization among part-time employees.\nHere are three strategies for effective management:\nTechnology Integration Strategy\nConsider implementing a comprehensive set of tools or a system for managing employee demand, projects, communication, knowledge transfer, and collaboration between temporary and full-time employees. This approach offers quick responses to company needs, efficient real-time communication, seamless collaboration, simple onboarding, and a centralized platform with a user-friendly interface for task and document management.\n🏆 Your benefits:\n- quick response to company needs,\n- efficient real-time communication,\n- seamless collaboration,\n- simple onboarding,\n- centralized task and document management.\nClear Performance Metrics Strategy\nEstablish key performance indicators (KPIs) for temporary workers aligned with the goals of ongoing projects.

{"question":"What is difference between national defense and air pollution as types of externality that affect many people? National defense protect citizens but pollution harm them, yes?","answer":"National defense and air pollution represent opposite ends of the externality spectrum. National defense is a pure public good with positive externalities - one person's protection doesn't diminish others' protection, and all citizens benefit equally regardless of their individual contribution through taxes. In contrast, air pollution is a negative externality that causes harmful effects for everyone in the affected area, including respiratory diseases, health problems for humans and other species, interference with photosynthesis, and reduced visibility. While national defense is intentionally provided as a public benefit that requires government coordination and tax funding, air pollution is an unintentional harmful side effect of various activities like industrial operations, vehicle emissions, and fossil fuel combustion that requires government intervention to control and mitigate its negative impacts on public health and the environment.","context":["Some goods and services are provided by the government (e.g., mail delivery and schools) while others are provided by private business firms (e.g., grocery stores and dry cleaning). Economically, what goods and services would be best provided by the public sector and which are best provided by the private sector?\nEconomists distinguish broadly among three types of goods along the private to public continuum. Purely private goods are purchased and used by individuals and families. Another way of explaining a private good is to say that my use (or consumption, in economist language) excludes your ability to consume the same good. Food is the best understood example. Food is eaten by one person. A family may purchase and cook for the family and their friends. People may share food with friends or with needy families through food banks, but only one person can eat a particular serving of food. Because private goods are purchased and consumed, traditional supply and demand analysis describes the market for private goods very well. The intersection of private demand curves and production supply curves correctly predicts the appropriate market price and quantity.\nPublic goods are at the opposite end of the continuum. Classic examples include national defense and the internet. The characteristic that distinguishes a pure public good from a pure private good is that one person’s use does not diminish the ability of someone else to use the same good at the same time. You and I are equally protected by U.S. national defense. My consumption does not exclude your consumption. For that reason, traditional supply and demand analysis does not correctly identify how much defense to “produce” and how much each person should pay for his or her defense. In fact, since no business could charge each person for their defense, there is no market mechanism to identify how much each individual is willing to pay. Economists generally agree that pure public goods are properly provided by government and paid for by taxes. There are complicated ways to discern how much each person is willing to pay, but it is much simpler and more acceptable politically to use the tax system.\nMany goods, including the examples of mail delivery and schools, involve both public and private benefits. There is an expressed private demand for mail delivery and schools. Individuals are willing to pay private delivery services, such as Federal Express and UPS, to deliver mail and packages outside the postal service and families send their children to private schools at high costs, while still paying taxes for public schools. Even sending mail through the postal service is not free and students at primary and secondary schools pay more for many extras that enhance their education.\nBefore government provision of mail service and schooling, private mail service and private schools were the only options. The reason that mail service and schools are also provided by the government is that having universal mail delivery and universal schooling have large public benefits in addition to their private benefits. Let’s look at schooling, in particular. If only the wealthy are educated, most of the population is confined to low-wage, low-skill jobs. The economy suffers and the country does not prosper. Moreover, if only the wealthy are educated, they will control the political agenda. Universal primary and secondary education, combined with subsidized higher education ensures the possibility of equal opportunity for all to move into high-skill, high-wage jobs and to effectively participate in politics. A larger population of high-wage earners contributes to economic growth.\nEconomists refer to goods like schooling, mail service, vaccinations against communicable diseases, roads, and bridges, just to name a few, as having positive externalities. They would be provided privately for those who could pay, but having them available benefits many more people than those willing to pay privately. If large numbers of people are vaccinated, we can prevent pandemics, such as the 1918 flu epidemic. Everyone benefits from having roads and bridges. There is also an important coordination benefit from public support for the production of goods with positive externalities. The public mail service maintains a database of all addresses and zip codes that private mail services also use. The Centers for Disease Control coordinates information on diseases and adjusts vaccinations to account for changes in diseases. The National Weather Service coordinates information on weather that everyone can use to plan for everything we do in our lives, from weekend picnics to airline travel to agricultural planning to disaster preparation.\nJust as in the case of pure public goods, the private market does not have a mechanism for determining each person’s benefit from having such goods available. And, as in the case of public goods, there are complicated ways to figure out what each person or family is willing to pay. However, it is simpler and more acceptable politically to fund such goods (or the subsidies in addition to private payments) through the tax system.","Will you prefer to live in a house near a beautiful lake facing it and with greenery around or a canal of sewer water? This is how externalities affect any entity and hence the decisions.\nWhat are externalities?\nExternalities are unintentional side effects of an activity affecting people other than those directly involved in the activity.\nThere can be two ways in which the activity or goods or services may affect positively and negatively; and hence they are called positive externalities and negative externalities.\n- A negative externality is the one whose effect could be harmful,\n- Positive externality on the other hand, is an unpaid benefit gained from the activity.\nExternalities and Environment\nIn environmental terms, the externalities are mostly natural resources or those which influence public health and environmental conditions. For example, negative externality can be an industry causing pollution that reduces property value, causes health problems in surrounding area, or has an ill impact on the habitat and quality of living environment of other species and biodiversity. A positive externality includes such actions that reduce transmission of diseases or contribute to improve the quality of environment. For example, beekeepers raise and keep bees in order to harvest money and sell it to public. In this process of creating honey, bees fly around and pollinate plants which enables them to grow. Presence of bees to pollinate plants is a positive externality that arises from the presence of honey farmers.\nNegative Externalities are the root cause of environmental problems, major cause of the same being human intervention. Small interferences from every individual collectively impose affects, potentially on each other, where overall consequence is a situation of substantial unwanted environmental changes – high ambient air pollution level, increase in average temperature, deforestation, habitat and biodiversity loss, ground water depletion and so on. Influence of third parties resist to let us achieve optimal and necessary well-being conditions.\n- Environmental Planner | Roles, Responsibilities & Future Prospects\n- What is Environmental Planning?\n- Environmental Laws & Protection Acts in India\n- What is Environmental Protection?\n- Importance of ecology\nRole of Externalities in Environment Planning\nProtection and improvement of environment is a solution to this collective problem and is a means of achieving greater human welfare. Here the externalities play an important role in decision making and policy making in environmental planning and in the preparation of environment management plan to achieve well being goals, for humans as well as other species and environmental components to achieve sustainable development.\nUnderstanding Negative Externality\nFor an easy understanding of how these third parties play an important role in environmental planning process, decisions and policy making, let us take a common example of environment degradation – air pollution.\nThe alteration of air quality is measured in terms of air quality index (AQI) which gives the numeric values of chemical, biological, or physical pollutants. Undesirable presence of these impurities or abnormal rise in the proportion of the same in atmosphere cause harmful effects. Increase in any of these pollutant measure leads us to know the actual cause of this pollution. For example, increase in Particulate Matter (than the permissible value) will lead to respiratory and other chronic health diseases in humans, health problems in other species, will interfere in process of photosynthesis by blocking the sunlight, will increase visibility impairment in the atmosphere and a number of other long and short term environmental problems. All these are caused by the sources, which are nothing but externalities, like combustion engines, industries, heavy vehicles, burning of fossil fuels, burning of dried up crop waste, dust storms and many other sources.\nThese externalities causing lethal outcomes for environment assist the planners to work on how the conditions can be improved, with what measures can the ill effects be reduced, and in turn result in taking fruitful decisions regarding the same. Like, for increase in the amount of particulate matter, measures to reduce the combustion of fossil fuels, and opting for clean and green energy sources like renewable energy, electric motors etc. will be the first step proposals in environment planning. Increase in taxation by the industries or vehicle owners contributing to pollution is also a probable proposal in order to reduce the pollution.\nSimilarly, for trends with decrease in forests and urban greens, a lot of environmental problems will arise. For this externality of continuous cutting of trees and deforestation from humans, measures like forest protection acts and afforestation, increasing the urban greens in open and public areas are proposed by the planners and authority in order to control the unwanted environmental change and degradation. Planting more trees, given number for that particular area, while cutting one in place of it, comes under planning and development norms i.e. if you cut one tree, you have to compensate for it by planting given number of more tree.\nUnderstanding Positive Externality\nOne more example is use of toilets. Presence and use of toilets, is a positive externality for the environment. It helps to provide a proper disposal system of waste. Human excretion often carries harmful organisms that can contaminate water sources, soil, and increase spread of numerous diseases. Not only for humans, it is toxic for wildlife as well. Use of toilets helps reduce transmission of diseases in both humans and other animals. They also help in improving public health by controlling odours, growth of waste borne parasites, and human waste poisoning surrounding areas. Eco-toilets if being used, also help saving water used to flush, resulting in conservation of water. These toilets also help us use the waste to use in bio-gas plants or to turn the waste into manure which increase soil fertility and can be used in agriculture or for urban greens and in gardens.\nAs this positive externality is beneficial in terms of both environment and public health, in planning, measures to increase toilets in required and necessary areas are proposed. Construction of public toilets in villages and public areas under Swatchta Abhiyan is an initiative taken by the planners and authority.\nSimilarly, use of public transport is also a good example of positive externality where this activity causes reduction in the amount of fuel consumption and in turn reduces harmful vehicular emissions. Transit Oriented Development is a solution outcome given by planners which focuses increased use of public transport, bike sharing systems, as well as using active methods of transportation such as walking, cycling, skating etc. for shorter distances to be travelled. Active methods of transportation are those which use human power and these methods are proved to be good for human health too. As this system encourages the use of public transport, it also increases social interaction which is good for social environment.\n- Guidelines for Sustainable Urban Regional Planning\n- Various Types of Pollution\n- How to prevent and reduce Air Pollution?\n- Importance of Urban Planning\nConsideration of externalities is an important part in environment planning. Their influence amends the planning process as well as decisions. Externalities causing negative effects are worked upon to be reduced or get rid of whereas positive externalities are cherished, celebrated, and are worked upon to get increased. Many times, these externalities also work as example for other similar conditions and help in easy decision taking for some other area or situation. It is also taken into account that even if the effect of any externality is not seen currently, they may lead to direct or indirect effects in future. In this way, analysing externalities, their causes, and their effects, leads planning process to workable, valuable, and useful proposals and solutions which guide to achieve well being and sustainable development goals.\nAuthor Bio: Anusha Batra, Environment Planning and Management, School of Planning and Architecture, Vijayawada.

{"question":"How does multicomponent seismic imaging enhance subsurface visualization, and what specific data quality challenges like side-lobe effects need to be addressed in spectral decomposition?","answer":"Multicomponent seismic technology enhances subsurface visualization by using multiple wave modes (P, SH, SV, C, fast-S, slow-S) for imaging. The 9-component (9-C) seismic data allows all seismic wave modes to be used in subsurface imaging, while 3-C and 4-C data are more commonly acquired but provide fewer wave modes. This technology has demonstrated capability to image depths up to 60,000 ft with P-P mode and 42,000 ft with P-SV mode in the Gulf of Mexico. However, when processing seismic data using spectral decomposition, there are significant challenges with side-lobe effects where additional events appear adjacent to the main lobe that don't correspond to actual geology. This can create interpretation ambiguity, especially when using traditional methods like continuous wavelet transform (CWT) that rely on mathematical wavelets rather than actual seismic wavelets.","context":["Geophysics research at the Bureau concentrates on developing multicomponent seismic technology that can be used to better characterize geologic systems. Research effort focuses on design of vector seismic sources, optimization of data-acquisition and data-processing procedures, and unified interpretation of P- and S-wave images. Researchers use 9-component (9-C) seismic data whenever possible as these data allow all seismic wave modes (P, SH, SV, C, fast-S, slow-S) to be used in subsurface imaging. Research involving 3-C and 4-C seismic data is also a key focus area, even though SH and SV modes are not available with these data, as 3-C and 4-C data are acquired by companies more often than are 9-C data.\nImaging Deep Gas Targets with Multicomponent Seismic Data\nOperators across the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) are targeting deeper and deeper drilling objectives. For deep targets to be evaluated, seismic data are required that have longer and longer source-receiver offsets. Most shallow-water operators in the GOM consider 30,000 ft (9 km) to be the greatest target depth to be drilled for the next several years. For geology at depths of 9 km to be imaged, seismic reflection data must be acquired with offsets of 9 km or more.\nThis long-offset requirement is difficult to achieve using towed-cable seismic technology in areas that are congested by production facilities, which is the situation for many shallow-water blocks across the northern GOM shelf. Ocean-bottom-cable (OBC) and ocean-bottom-sensor (OBS) technologies are logical options for long-offset data acquisition in congested production areas because ocean-floor sensors, once deployed, are immobile and can be positioned close to platforms, well heads, and other obstructions that interfere with towed-cable operations. An additional appeal of OBC seismic technology is that four-component (4-C) data can be acquired, allowing targeted reservoir intervals to be imaged with P-SV wavefields, as well as P-P wavefields. Once 4-C seafloor receivers are deployed, source boats can maneuver along a receiver line to generate P-P and P-SV data from long-offset distances.\nThis research is designed to investigate the value of long-offset multicomponent seismic data for studying deep-gas geology across the northern shelf of the GOM. The term long offset means that 4-C OBC data are processed using uniformly sampled source-receiver offsets ranging from 0 to 10 km. The study area is a large, 3,200-mi2 (8,200-km2) section of the Louisiana shelf noted for prolific gas production. Data consist of parallel north-south and parallel east-west 2-D4C profiles spaced at intervals of 2 mi. P-P and P-SV images produced from these long-offset reflection data are interpreted to determine the relative depth-imaging capabilities of each seismic mode. Analysis of these long-offset data shows that the P-P mode contains reflection signals from depths of 60,000 ft (18 km), which is deeper than any reported seismic reflection effort in the GOM basin. Equally important, the critical P-SV mode has a reflection signal from depths of 42,000 ft (13 km).\nAssessing Deep-Water Gulf of Mexico Gas-Hydrate Systems with Multicomponent and Multi-frequency Seismic Data\nThe Exploration Geophysics Laboratory (EGL) is a subcontractor to Louisiana State University in this study. Research is funded by the U.S. Department of Interior, Minerals Management Service. The study will investigate several seafloor fluid-gas expulsion sites in the deep-water area of Green Canyon in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Sites will be selected that are traversed by one or more of WesternGeco's deep-water, multiclient, 4-C OBC seismic lines. Multifrequency imaging of gas-hydrate systems associated with these expulsion chimneys will be done by acquiring 2- to 16-kHz chirp-sonar data using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and 500- to 2,000-Hz data with the Naval Research Laboratory Deep-Towed Acoustic/Geophysics System (DTAGS). These AUV and DTAGS images will then be compared with 4-C OBC images along each profile that is analyzed.\nProcessing and Interpreting Multicomponent Seismic Data: Gulf of Mexico Seafloor Observatory\nThe Exploration Geophysics Laboratory (EGL) is a subcontractor to the Mississippi Mineral Resources Institute (MMRI) in this study. MMRI has received funding from a variety of sources (DOE, MMS, NOOA) to construct a seafloor observatory across a gas-hydrate system in Mississippi Canyon Block 118. EGL's responsibilities are to process and interpret seismic data acquired by the horizontal and vertical arrays of 1-C and 4-C seismic sensors that will be deployed across the observatory. Downgoing P waves from three types of sources will be used to illuminate gas-hydrate strata: conventional surface-positioned air-gun arrays, noise from passing ships, and wind-driven ocean-surface waves. Data will be acquired in a continuous round-the-clock mode when wind-driven surface waves are the imaging source. Data acquisition will be repeated at appropriate calendar-time intervals to investigate dynamic processes that occur in gas-hydrate systems.\nCO, DO: Horizontal array (400 m long)\nDC: Data Cable\nDRS: Data recovery ship\nDSS: Data storage system\nSSD: Station service device\nVA1: Water-column vertical array (200 m)\nVA2: Subsea vertical array (150 m)\nW: Weight (disposable)\nThe principal components of the seafloor observatory that will operate in Mississippi Canyon Block 118.\nDistinguishing Fizz-Gas and Commercial-Gas Reservoirs\nThis investigation applies 4-component ocean-bottom-cable (4-C OBC) seismic data across gas-producing trends of the Gulf of Mexico to the problem of distinguishing between commercial-gas reservoirs and low-saturation, noncommercial, fizz-gas reservoirs. Attributes of the P-SV mode are combined with calibration log data to classify high-amplitude P-P reflection anomalies into \"high-saturation\" and \"reduced-saturation\" categories. Two reservoir examples are provided as Figures 1 and 2. One example is a commercial-gas reservoir; the other is a fizz-gas reservoir. The gas saturation will not be defined for either example so the difficulty of distinguishing between the two types of targets can be appreciated.\nResearch data utilized in the study are provided by Devon Energy, Seitel Data, and WesternGeco. Funding is provided by EGL sponsors.\nElastic-Wavefield Seismic Stratigraphy: A New Seismic Imaging Technology\nClick here for Technical Progress Report (May 2004) posted on DOE Website\nThe Exploration Geophysics Laboratory (EGL) is partnering with Fasken Oil and Ranch Ltd. and Vecta Technology to develop a new seismic interpretation technology, Elastic Wavefield Seismic Stratigraphy. This technology is based on the physics that each mode of an elastic wavefield can, and often does, image a suite of stratal surfaces differently than do the other elastic modes. Shear (S) modes can image seismic sequences and facies not observed in the compressional (P) mode, which is the only elastic-wave mode used in conventional seismic stratigraphy. In a homogeneous Earth, a full-elastic (9-component) seismic wavefield yields three S-wave modes: SH-SH (horizontal shear), SV-SV (vertical shear), and P-SV (converted shear). In an anisotropic Earth, each of these S modes splits into S1 (fast-S) and S2 (slow-S) modes controlled by the principal axes of anisotropy. Thus, there is a rich source of stratigraphic information in a full-elastic wavefield that is not being utilized in conventional P-wave seismic stratigraphy studies. The objectives of this research are to create compelling examples that prove that different stratal surfaces are imaged by different elastic-wave modes, to develop systematic relationships between petrophysical properties and combinations of elastic-mode sequences and facies, and to demonstrate how this new seismic imaging technology should be applied to improve geologic understanding of oil and gas systems.\nExploring for Subtle Mission Canyon Stratigraphic Traps with Elastic-Wavefield Seismic Technology\n(A study funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and Vecta Exploration)\nThis study is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and Vecta Exploration. In its subcontract to Vecta Exploration, Inc., the Exploration Geophysics Laboratory (EGL), is developing a new seismic technology to explore for subtle Mission Canyon oolitic limestone reservoirs in the Williston Basin. This technology will be based on the acquisition and application of full-elastic (9-component) seismic data. Mission Canyon reservoirs are elusive targets when exploration is based on conventional compressional (P) wave seismic data. The attraction of 9-component (9-C) seismic data is that three shear (S) wave modes can also be used for target imaging: SH-SH (horizontal shear), SV-SV (vertical shear), and P-SV (converted shear) modes. Work at EGL has shown that each mode of an elastic wavefield can, and often does, image stratal surfaces across a target interval differently than do other elastic modes. Thus, any of the S modes can depict seismic sequences and seismic facies that are not observed using P waves. This rich, expanded source of stratigraphic and lithofacies information in full-elastic seismic wavefields needs to be utilized in Mission Canyon exploration. The objectives of this study are to acquire, process, and interpret 9C3D seismic data across Mission Canyon plays, develop relationships between drilling objectives and elastic-wavefield attributes, drill confirmation wells, and then share research findings so that full-elastic seismic technology can be applied to improve oil exploration across other areas.\nNarrow Azimuth Migration\nSergey B. Fomel, principal investigator\nWe are developing the theory, numerical algorithm, and prototype implementation of narrow-azimuth migration, a powerful and efficient method for 3-D seismic imaging of marine streamer data.\nNarrow-azimuth migration takes advantage of the narrow-azimuth character of data acquired by marine streamers to increase the efficiency of seismic imaging by wavefield extrapolation methods. A new theory is being developed to account for inadequate approximation in common-azimuth migration and corrected for small rotation in the offset azimuth of the propagating wavefield. We anticipate that this theory will lead to a noticeable improvement in current seismic imaging technology. An additional increase in efficiency comes from implementing the narrow-azimuth algorithm on parallel computer clusters.\nDifferential Azimuth Moveout\nSergey B. Fomel, principal investigator\nWe are developing the theory, numerical algorithm, and prototype implementation of differential azimuth moveout, a new powerful method for regularizing 3-D seismic reflection data.\nIn theory, differential azimuth moveout is represented by a partial differential equation, whose role with respect to integral (Kirchhoff) azimuth moveout is similar to the role of the wave equation with respect to Kirchhoff migration. In practice, we anticipate differential azimuth moveout to behave as a compact, local, accurate, and efficiently computed regularization operator. The operator is applied iteratively to produce regular output from irregular input.\nPetrophysical Analysis of Multicomponent Seismic Data\nSergey B. Fomel, principal investigator\nWe are developing new technology for improved multicomponent seismic data analysis. The technology is based on creating angle gathers for both P-wave and S-wave amplitude-versus-angle (AVA) analysis using new powerful wave-equation imaging approaches. Unlike traditional amplitude-versus-offset (AVO) gathers, AVA gathers operate directly in the true reflection angle coordinates, providing a direct assessment for inverting P-wave and S-wave reflectivity for seismic lithology, porosity, and pore fluid content. A joint inversion of multicomponent data in the true angle coordinates opens new possibilities for direct detection of natural gas resources by discriminating between oil, water, and gas content in complex reservoirs during both exploration and production. This technology facilitates exploration in complex geologic areas, improves oil-and-gas reservoir characterization, increases the accuracy of petrophysical attributes estimation, and decreases the much higher costs of exploratory drilling and failed secondary recovery injection projects.\nUtilizing 3-D wave-equation migration for seismic imaging is a new approach that has shown great promise in imaging complex deep-water Gulf of Mexico structures. Previously only so-called Kirchhoff methods could be used to generate common-reflection point (CRP) gathers in offset domain and iteratively improve the velocity model used for imaging. Recent research has established a new approach to generating angle-domain common image gathers (ACIG) directly from 3-D wave-equation methods. ACIG's can be used to update the initial velocity model, and they form the basis for a novel method of 3-D amplitude analysis. This technology can be used for gas exploration in deep complex structures over 10,000 ft, where conventional, single-traveltime-arrival, Kirchhoff imaging fails to provide an accurate structural image and wave-equation imaging provides much higher structural resolution and amplitude fidelity. The geophysicist can then obtain higher resolution petrophysical information, linking the accurate seismic amplitude to reservoir properties such as porosity, sand/shale content, water/oil saturation, Vp/Vs ratio, etc.\nSeismic Imaging by Riemannian Wavefield Extrapolation\nSergey B. Fomel, principal investigator\nWe are developing the theory, numerical algorithm, and prototype implementation of seismic imaging by Riemannian wavefield extrapolation (RWE). RWE was proposed by Sava and Fomel (2004) for imaging steeply dipping and overturning reflections in geologically complex exploration areas, such as deep subsalt structures in the Gulf of Mexico.\nRWE belongs to the class of wave-equation extrapolation methods that are known to handle accurately large-velocity contrasts, multipathing, and band-limited wave propagation effects. Instead of conventional downward extrapolation, RWE employs a coordinate transformation to extrapolate waves numerically in a direction close to the preferential direction of natural wave propagation. As a result, one can accurately image large propagation angles, including overturning salt-flank reflections, using inexpensive extrapolation operators.\nDevine Test Site\nA Public-Domain Geophysical Field Laboratory Operated by the Exploration Geophysics Laboratory (EGL)\nThe 100-acre Devine Test Site (DTS) is located less than 50 miles southwest of San Antonio, Texas, in Medina County, Texas (Maps 1 and 2, below). The site is managed by the Exploration Geophysics Laboratory (EGL), an Industrial Associate Program at the Bureau of Economic Geology. It is a state-of-the-art public-domain geophysical research facility for academia and industry donated to UT in 1998 by British Petroleum (BP). The test site is used for surface-based seismic and potential-field experiments performed in conjunction with downhole and crosswell experiments.\nThe size and shape of the 100-acre field laboratory and the adjacent area for which surface-access rights can be negotiated with property owners is shown on Map 3. BP drilled three test wells (2, 4, 9) during its 12 years of ownership, which are cased to 3,000 ft. Wells 2 and 4 are completed with fiberglass casing to allow for testing of borehole electromagnetic (EM) sources and receivers. These wells are popular with logging companies as resistivity tools can be tested without the complications of steel casing attenuating EM wave propagation. Four shallow (100-200 ft) steel-cased holes are available for borehole-based seismic energy sources and other instrumentation. The wells are in excellent condition. Permanent concrete and gravel pads provide consistent vibrator coupling in a wide range of weather conditions.\nSignificant upgrades to the site have been made as a result of generous donations by the SEG Foundation. The site now has electricity, flood lights for nighttime use, a water well and water lines, new and refurbished chain fences, new entry gate, tractor mower, and storage sheds.\nThe stratigraphic section (shown below) breached by the site's 3,000-ft wells is well suited as a field laboratory for geophysical experiments. A key attribute of the site, which appeals greatly to developers of downhole geophysical instruments, is its stable geologic condition. The nearest oil and gas production is several miles away, which ensures that no fluid-exchange processes are occurring in rock facies immediately around the wellbores. Petrophysical properties of the formations, therefore, are well calibrated by numerous historical well logs preserved in the public database. Equipment manufacturers and researchers can also quickly determine if a new tool, a new measurement procedure, or a new petrophysical analysis procedure is providing correct data.","It is no secret that geologists do not fully trust all the events shown in pretty seismic pictures.\nEven deeper concerns may arise when the images are composed from algorithmic manipulation and transformation of seismic signals, such as seismic attributes – especially spectral decomposition.\nLast month in this column I reviewed how spectral decomposition is used in seismic interpretation, and pointed out that even though this technique has become a popular interpretation tool in the industry, it does have some issues – including a significant problem called the side-lobe effect.\nIn spectral decomposition, when there is one event (the main lobe) that corresponds to a particular geological feature – like the top or bottom of a formation – there often are several relatively smaller adjacent events, called side-lobes. These are closely related to the main lobe, but have nothing to do with sub-surface geology.\nFor example, many of the strong events shown in warm colors in figure 1 are self-related and do not correspond to actual geology. The risk of interpreting spectral decomposition results with strong side-lobe effects without good well control is obvious and sometimes very large.\nThe side-lobe effect in spectral decomposition results from the use of a mathematical function with closed form expressions – such as a mathematical wavelet, a sine/cosine and a Gaussian function, for example – as the basic elements in the algorithm used to compute results. These basic elements are squeezed and stretched analytically and then convolved with the seismic trace to calculate spectral decomposition at different frequencies.\nUnfortunately, these mathematical expression-based elements rarely resemble the actual seismic data. The Morlet wavelet – the basic element used in continuous wavelet transform (CWT) spectral decomposition – probably is the closest among many other functions to resemble a real seismic wavelet, but is still far from matching real data.\nHere, we have proposed a new spectral decomposition method that is similar to CWT; however, instead of using a wavelet derived from a mathematical expression, an actual wavelet extracted from the seismic data is used (an example is shown on the top right of figure 1).\nSince the real wavelet does not have a simple mathematical expression, we may not be able to transform back from the spectral decomposition. This, however, is regarded as a limited deficiency, since inversion to the original data may not be required in many or most cases.\nThe direct benefit, comparing to CWT and other methods, is that there are fewer side-lobe effects and therefore less ambiguity. The proposed method uses an algorithm similar to CWT, wherein the seismic data is convolved with groups of dilated, squeezed and stretched seismic wavelets.\nIf the closed form expression of a wavelet is known, squeezing and stretching can be easily done – but doing this with a discrete seismic wavelet is challenging and special care is required.\nFigure 2 shows the spectral decomposition results calculated by CWT and the new method at the same frequency (72Hz) on a cross line in Blackfoot (Canada) P-wave seismic data. From shallow to deep, there are roughly three groups of events (corresponding to warm colours) where the reservoir is located in the middle group.\nComparing the results in figure 2, it is clear that the new method displays a clear advantage over the CWT method. Fewer side-lobe effects are observed, especially in the first and the third event groups, where some individual events hardly can be distinguished in the results from CWT.\nIn the map view, the results (right) from the new method show the north-south incised valley more clearly. There are the upper channel and the lower channel located in the valley, and they are partially sand-filled and partially shale-filled. Due to this, the sand and shale deposits within the channels in this data set cannot be fully distinguished solely by spectral decomposition results.\nSome wells penetrate the channels; some do not, and are the regional wells as reference.\nThe CWT method shows high amplitudes within the channel, which could be misleading.\nSpectral decomposition is a powerful interpretation tool, and each method has its advantages and disadvantages. The new method introduced here tries to reduce the side-lobe effects that come with the other methods.\nThe severity of these effects varies across geologic regimes, data sets and frequencies.\nThe new method provides a very attractive option when spectral decomposition side-lobe effects appear to be masking key geologic features.\nI would like to thank John Sherman for his help in this article. I also would like to thank Geomodeling Technology Corp. for its support.\n(Editor’s note: Rongfeng Zhang is a senior geoscientist with Geomodeling Technology Corp.)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:46205e76-7946-4048-b84b-18eb91776161>","<urn:uuid:1a35a070-ea38-4dcf-9141-384fc38ed496>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does vitamin K contribute to maintaining healthy blood circulation, and what specific roles do K1 and K2 play?","answer":"Vitamin K maintains healthy blood circulation through different forms with distinct roles: Vitamin K1 works in the liver to activate blood clotting factors. Vitamin K2 works throughout the body to activate vitamin K-dependent Gla-proteins, which prevent calcification of blood vessels and organs, including the heart and kidneys. K-dependent proteins maintain the balance between coagulation and anticoagulation in the circulatory system. Additionally, one specific protein called matrix Gla-protein (MGP), when activated by vitamin K, acts as the strongest known inhibitor of tissue calcification, preventing calcium deposits in blood vessels and maintaining their elasticity for proper blood pressure regulation.","context":["You can ensure life-giving blood is circulating properly throughout your entire body!\nWhen it comes to the cardiovascular system, most people think in terms of the heart, veins and arteries that carry blood throughout the body. And that’s typical. For decades now, modern medicine has focused on the largest components in the cardiovascular system which includes the heart and the large coronary arteries that feed the heart.\nBut have you ever stopped to ask, “If the cardiovascular system feeds the heart, what exactly feeds the cardiovascular system?” The quick answer is, the cardiovascular system itself. You see, it’s the cardiovascular system that carries oxygen from the lungs and nutrients from the stomach throughout the entire body so they can be used by vital organs, like the heart, but also by the cardiovascular system itself.\nAnd that all makes sense. But what many people don’t know is that it accomplishes this by utilizing an incredibly small circulation network called the microcirculatory system.\nYour microcirculatory system\nIf you’ve never heard of your microcirculatory system, you are not alone. As already mentioned, it’s the heart and large coronary arteries, or the “macrocirculatory” system that gets all the attention. When something goes wrong there, a heart attack or stroke is the likely result.\nFor example, we’ve all heard of blockages in the coronary artery, and we all know those are bad. If a doctor tells you that, in the very next sentence he is probably going to send you to a heart surgeon to schedule by-pass surgery.\nBut what caused the blockage and why is it in that particular place? Was it cholesterol? Arterial calcification? If that was the case, shouldn’t the blockage extend the length of the entire artery? Why do these blockages tend to form in just one place in an artery? For years, the explanation given by heart specialists is that these blockages are skip lesions, meaning they skip around and form randomly.1\nMaybe … but the newest breakthrough theory in cardiovascular health appears to make a lot more sense. This theory, which is becoming more and more accepted by alternative health experts, is that arterial blockages form where the minute microcirculation blood vessels that feed the main arteries with oxygen and nutrients, shut down. When these extremely small blood vessels, called vasa vasorum, (from Latin—vessels of the vessels) become clogged and can no longer feed an artery, atherosclerotic lesions or atherosclerotic plaques can form.2\nIt’s these atherosclerotic plaques that eventually choke off healthy arteries, preventing blood flow to and from the heart and to and from vital organs. And they might very well have never formed if the vasa vasorum, the tiny blood vessels that feed the arteries and remove waste, had continued to function properly.\nSo you see, all this focus on keeping the large veins and arteries healthy misses the point. It’s the microcirculatory system, the one that contains upwards of 60,000 miles of capillaries, arterioles, venules, and vasa vasorum that needs to be nourished and protected.\nThreats to your microcirculatory system\nBefore we explain how to nourish and protect your microcirculatory system, let’s first look at what threats these small blood vessels face and how they can be damaged.\nWe know that these small blood vessels, just like the large ones, are really just hollow tubes protected by an endothelial lining called an endothelium. The endothelium is made up of a smooth, thin layer of cells that regulates expansion and contraction of vesicles to allow oxygen and vital nutrients to flow in and out of the bloodstream.\nEndothelial dysfunction is one of the biggest threats to the microcirculatory system.3 Under normal circumstances, the body utilizes the amino acid l-arginine to produce nitric oxide that helps to relax the endothelium and allow sufficient amounts of blood to flow. If the nitric oxide production is interrupted, the endothelium can collapse onto itselfand restrict blood flow.\nStudies show that a build up in the blood of harmful heavy metals like chromium, iron, lead and mercury interfere with l-arginine’s production of nitric oxide, resulting in poor microcirculation.4 It is for this reason that people with high levels of toxins often suffer from circulatory related symptoms like cold hands and feet, angina, diminished vision capabilities, and high blood pressure.5\nOxidative damage caused by free radicals is another threat to the endothelium.6 Free radicals are reactive molecules that are unstable because they are missing an electron. In an effort to replace their lost electron, they frantically bump into and damage the molecules that make up the cells in your body. In the process, they cause oxidation of body tissues.\nWhen a free radical comes in contact with the inner lining of a small capillary, microscopic injuries result. This process is called lipid peroxidation and is recognized as one of the underlying causes of atherosclerosis. Eventually the build-up of fat, cholesterol, toxic metals and other substances at the site of injury narrows the capillary restricting blood flow. The key is to neutralize free radicals before they damage your arteries … and that’s done with antioxidants. Heavy metals are catalysts for free radical oxidation, which is another good reason to remove them before they can set off the chain of events that can harm the endothelium.\nOther threats to small capillaries and vasa vasorum include elevated blood viscosity, improper blood coagulation, and blood vessel calcification. If the blood is too thick, it won’t flow fast enough to deliver oxygen to—and remove carbon dioxide from—vital organs. When there is a problem with blood coagulation, a thrombus or blood clot can develop. In a small blood vessel, a thrombus can completely cut off blood flow, which can result in the death of surrounding tissue supplied by the vessel. And finally, when the body does not properly process calcium and send it to bones where it is needed, it can accumulate in blood vessels resulting in arteriosclerosis, also called calcification or hardening of the arteries.\nNutritional solutions for your microcirculatory system\nEliminating or reducing your risk to these microcirculation threats is the first step toward protecting your overall cardiovascular system, and ultimately your health. Following are a number of nutritional solutions that work both independently and together to keep your microcirculatory system healthy:\nEDTA-based oral chelation\nChelation comes from the Greek word “claw,” meaning “to grab,” which is exactly what EDTA does. When a molecule of EDTA travels through the bloodstream and gets near a toxic metal such as lead or mercury, it grabs the destructive particle and binds tightly with it, pulling it out of the membrane or body tissue it was embedded in.\nEDTA supports normal endothelial function by removing heavy metals that impair nitric oxide function.7 It also prevents the production of free radicals that cause cellular damage in the endothelium and other organs throughout the body.\nHere’s how it works: When metals, minerals and other toxins are in the body, they act as the catalyst for oxidation reactions, including lipid peroxidation. This triggers the production of free radicals. But when EDTA is in the blood, it removes the metals and minerals before they get a chance to catalyze, or start the oxidation reactions.\nThe result? The production of free radicals is dramatically reduced and their destructive influence is prevented. Plus, by removing the lead stores that have built up in the endothelial lining, the production of nitric oxide is restored which allows the blood vessel to expand and contract normally.\nAnd while oral EDTA works hard in the bloodstream to remove heavy metals and prevent oxidation, it also does double duty by chelating toxins in the digestive tract before they are absorbed, preventing them from ever entering your bloodstream.\nEDTA chelation therapy is not new. It’s been around for a long time. In fact, EDTA is the standard FDA approved treatment for lead, mercury, aluminum and cadmium poisoning. The American Heart Association also recognizes chelation therapy as a treatment for heavy metal poisoning. But today, we are finally starting to understand that EDTA oral chelation, by removing toxic heavy metals from the microcirculatory system, is working to keep health problems from forming in the larger macrocirculatory system.8\nOne important note about EDTA oral chelation … while EDTA will chelate toxic heavy metals preferentially, it can also chelate essential minerals as well. Therefore it is important to supplement with minerals while taking an EDTA oral chelation product. Reputable health supplement companies offer companion products that contain vitamins, minerals and other nutrients that enhance EDTA’s effectiveness and prevent mineral deficiency.\nLess reputable companies sometimes combine EDTA with vitamins and minerals in the same capsule. Be wary of these because as soon as you digest the capsule, the EDTA will chelate the minerals included in the capsule, thus defeating the purpose of removing heavy metals from the body.\nVitamin K1 and vitamin K2 provide healthy coagulation and prevent calcification\nVitamin K comes in several different forms. Vitamin K1 is the form used in the liver to activate clotting factors, while vitamin K2 is the form used in the rest of the body to activate other vitamin K-dependent Gla-proteins, which prevent calcification of blood vessels and organs, including the heart and kidneys.9\nBlood must flow freely through our cardiovascular system, unless injury causes a breach in a blood vessel, in which case, blood must clot rapidly to prevent excessive, potentially fatal blood loss. If clots form too readily, however, blood vessels can become blocked, cutting off the delivery of oxygen and nutrients, which rapidly results in tissue and organ death.\nVitamin K-dependent Gla-proteins are responsible for maintaining the delicate balance needed between coagulation and anticoagulation throughout the circulatory system.\nVitamin K also plays an important role in preventing arteriosclerosis or hardening of the blood vessels due to calcium deposits. The elasticity that characterizes healthy blood vessels, be they arteries or the smallest vasa vasorum, is what enables it to accommodate increases in blood flow. Add enough calcium and that pliability is lost; the artery can’t expand and contract, so blood pressure rises.10\nOne of the vitamin K-dependent proteins, matrix Gla-protein (MGP) is the strongest inhibitor of tissue calcification presently known. MGP is produced by small muscle cells in our blood vesselswhere—once activated by vitamin K—it prevents calcium deposits.11\nNattokinase—the natural blood thinner\nNatural nutritional support for normal, healthy blood flow throughout the body, including the microcirculation system, can be found in the enzyme Nattokinase. Nattokinase is a potent fibrinolytic (anti-clotting) enzyme extracted and highly purified from a traditional Japanese food called Natto. Research has shown that Nattokinase supports normal blood pressure and can prevent and dissolve thrombus or blood clots.\nNattokinase is considered extremely useful for those wanting a safe, nondrug, aspirin alternative for healthy blood flow. In fact, Nattokinase is especially useful for keeping the body’s microcirculatory system free of harmful blood clots. Researchers have found that Nattokinase is four times more potent than plasmin, works more effectively than warfarin drugs, and doesn’t produce any side effects.12\nMaybe you have heard of deep vein thrombosis which is a blood clot inside veins found deep in extremities or body cavities. A venous thrombus is a clump of blood cells, platelets, and fibrin (clot) which attaches to the inside walls of veins. If the clot stays localized, it can cause swelling and vein irritation. If part of it breaks off, it can cause blockage downstream, or become an embolus and result in a pulmonary embolus. In some instances, deep vein thrombosis may also contribute to other serious medical problems such as heart attack and stroke.\nNattokinase can prevent deep vein thrombosis and keep your microcirculatory system clear and clean by not allowing the venous thrombus to develop.13\nNattokinase is safe for most people when used according to the recommended dosage. However, some people should avoid Nattokinase. This includes people with bleeding disorders, such as hemophilia, or the group of diseases called hemorrhagic diathesis. Also, people with ulcers, hemorrhoids, or recent major trauma, or those who’ve had neurosurgery or a recent stroke should not take Nattokinase. If you take heparin, Coumadin ® or aspirin, use only under the close supervision of a medical doctor.\nTo sum it up … Nattokinase enhances our body’s natural ability to fight blood clots, even in the smallest microcirculatory blood vessel, and has an advantage over blood thinners because it has a prolonged effect without side effects. The perfect combination for microcirculatory health. So let’s recap … it’s the microcirculatory system that feeds and nourishes the macrocirculatory system, keeping it healthy and keeping your entire body disease free.\nThere are nutritional supplements that can keep your microcirculatory system functioning properly. These supplements include EDTA oral chelation to remove harmful heavy metals and toxins; vitamins and minerals to combat nutritional deficiency and replenish essential minerals; vitamins K1 and K2 to ensure healthy coagulation and combat calcification; and Nattokinase to prevent dangerous blood clots.\nAnd remember, the oral chelation supplement should be taken separately from the companion supplement containing the vitamins, minerals and other microcirculation enhancers. That way, you are maximizing the health benefits of the supplements, and maximizing your circulation system too.\n- Klein RG, Campbell RJ, Hunder GG, Carney JA. Skip lesions in temporal arteritis.

In areas such as the bloodstream, a pressure difference would rupture blood cells. Dialysis is not a function of pressure; therefore a pressure difference is not needed.\nBy far the most important application of dialysis is the therapeutic treatment of patients with renal failure. The technique is called hemodialysis and attempts to mimic the action of the nephron of the kidney in the separation of low molecular weight solutes, such as urea and creatinine, from the blood of patients with chronic uremia.\nShare of the market\nElectrodialysis is a membrane process in which ions are transported through ion permeable membranes from one solution to another under the influence of an electrical potential gradient.

Very often toxic or valuable components such as heavy metal ions are removed to avoid pollution of the environment and save disposal chemical costs by recycling valuable materials.\nElectrodialysis processes are different from distillation techniques and other membrane based processes (such as reverse osmosis (RO)) in that dissolved species are moved away from the feed stream rather than the reverse. u In almost all practical electrodialysis processes, multiple electrodialysis cells are arranged into a configuration called an electrodialysis stack, with alternating anion and cation exchange membranes forming the multiple electrodialysis cells. = dilute ED cell inlet concentration, mol/L, C For example, peritoneal dialysis may be recommended for: Haemodialysis may be recommended for people who are unable to carry out peritoneal dialysis themselves, such as those who are visually impaired, have dementia, or are in a poor state of health.

A typical large-scale electrodialysis water desalination plant is shown in the photograph of Fig. Another large-scale application of electro-dialysis is the preconcentration of seawater for the production of table salt. However, desalting of sparingly conductive aqueous organic and organic solutions is also possible. The overall result of the electrodialysis process is an ion concentration increase in the concentrate stream with a depletion of ions in the dilute solution feed stream.

{"question":"What were the exact artillery numbers deployed by the Alliance forces during the 1708 Siege of Lille?","answer":"The Alliance forces deployed a total of 120 guns, 40 howitzers, and 40 mortars during the siege of Lille. These were arranged in multiple batteries, including three batteries of 24-pounders (one with 43 guns, one with 12 guns, and one with 11 guns), plus additional forward batteries of 8, 10, 14, and 17 guns, and a battery of 7 mortars and 5 howitzers.","context":["Siege of Lille\n13 August - 9 December 1708\nThe siege gets underway\nThe allied force was now split into a siege army commanded by Eugen and a covering force near Helchin (a few km south of Pottes) commanded by Marlborough. Eugen's army consisted of 53 battalions and 90 squadrons, Marlborough's army of 69 battalions and 140 squadrons. On 13 August Lille was closed in and Eugen started to dig two 15 km long circumvallating walls around the city on the 14th1). Within these two walls that were finished on the 21st the besiegers were posted facing in and outwards.\nAs point of attack the besiegers chose the sector between the St. Magdalen and St. Andrew gates which were both covered by large protruding fortifications. Ditches were then opened in the night of 22-23 August. On the left the first paralel was made about 400 meters from the covered road, but on the right it was more distant because it was hindered by a French outpost at the farm La Vacquerie. In the evening of the 24th a French outpost at the Magdalen chapel was stormed with a loss of about 30 men and that same night La Vacquerie was evacuated.\nIn the evening of 26 August the French performed their first sortie. It had a lot of success because it temporarily regained the chapel and destroyed about 120 meters of ditches. That same night most of the batteries were completed. There were three batteries of 24 pounders: one of 43 guns; one of 12 guns and one of 11 guns. As regards indirect fire there were two batteries one of 24 pieces and one of 12 pieces, each battery half mortars half howitzers. On 27 August these siege guns started battering away at the walls of Lille2), but even though they were quite effective this was way too early. Later on the price for this had to be paid when the besiegers had to renew their bombardment but faced an ammunition shortage3).\nOn the 27th and the following night the second paralel was dug. New batteries were then constructed in a more forward position (Of restpectively 8, 10, 14 and 17 guns and one of 7 mortars and 5 howitzers). In the first days of September the trenches then reached almost up to the glacis. Between 4 and 7 September the besiegers started to dig into the protruding corners of the Glacis and meanwhile the last forward batteries were put in place, meaning that the whole alliance artillery of 120 guns, 40 howitzers and 40 mortars could fire.\nAlliance losses up till 1 September were about 400 men and on 3 September the besiegers were not yet ready to storm the covered road. Meanwhile the French army had shown up in an attempt to lift the siege. This was a threat that had to dealt with first, and so 26 battalions and 76 squadrons left the camp in the evening of the 4th to strengthen the covering force.\nThe French try to lift the siege: 27 August -14 September\nIf the French wanted to prevent Lille from falling they had to take action. On 14 August Louis ordered the army to march and lift the siege of Lille. On 27 August both Berwick and Burgundy/Vendome marched, leaving De La Motte with some inferior troops in Brugge. On the night of the 27th Burgundy was somewhat east of Gavere, and Berwick was west of Mons with 35 battalions and 98 squadrons4, marching from there to Herne on the 28th. Marlborough was west of Ronse at Amougies5. On 29 August the French armies met at Geraardsbergen/Grammont, at which Berwick gave up his command. The now united French army then marched on Tournai, crossed the Schelde on 2 September and reached Orchies on the 3rd. On 4 September it reached Mons en Pévêle were it picked up its heavy equipment.\nThat same 4 September they could see Marlborough's covering force before them. It extended from Fretin to Noyelles. If ever there was a moment to prevent the allies from taking Lille it was that afternoon. Though not all French troops had arrived, they outnumbered Marlborough two to one. However, both Berwick and Vendome thought the time of day to late to attack, and so nothing was done on the 4th, except that they occupied Pont a Marq. Eugen arrived that night with 26 battalions and 72 squadrons and Fagel arrived at dawn with 7 battalions, abandoning his task of covering the communications with Brussel.\nOn the 5th the forces ranged against each other were 102 battalions and 232 squadrons of the alliance against 125 battalions and 243 squdrons for the two crowns, of which the alliance battalions were larger. Vendome wanted to attack immediately, but Berwick did not like the rough terrain across which the army would have to advance. The alliance army was furthermore in a position where one flank was covered by the Marcq and the other by marshes of a brook that was tributary to the Deule. Burgundy therefore decided to improve the approaches first, which of course cost so much time that no attack could be made on the 5th.\nThe alliance army of course reacted by digging in. On the 6th the armies were again ranged against each other, but again the French did not come forward. This prompted Eugen to return to the siege with all the battalions and half the cavalry he had brought. Still not able to decide Burgundy, Vendome and Berwick all wrote letters to Versailles in the evening of the 6th. Louis XIV answered that they had to attack and sent Chamillart to the camp.\nFirst assault on the counterscarp\nOf course all attempts to lift the siege could be ended by taking the city and this probably induced some misplaced optimism in Eugen's mind. The optimism of the besiegers was however indeed misplaced because the trenches were still too far away from the covered road, and this meant that the attackers had to cross a large distance over open terrain. A general assault of the counterscarp with 14,000 men was planned for 4 o'clock in the afternoon of 7 September. At 3 o'clock the artillery indeed opened fire against the city, but the assault had to be postponed till about half pas seven in the evening because men and materials were not ready in time.\nThe assault immediately suffered big losses when it had to cross the open terrain. When it next entered the covered road chaos reigned because a lot of the engineers were killed and a lot of laborers panicked under the heavy defensive fire6). To top off their misery three mines were exploded with great effect and the darkness contributed to further chaos7). The end result was that the attackers only held the protruding corners of the Horn works and that of the left tenaille. Alliance losses were estimated at about 400 killed and 2,250 injured.\nVendome bombards the covering force\nOn 8 September Marlborough was in a solidly fortified position ranging from Noyelles to Fretin. Louis XIV still wanted his generals to fight and the next day Chamillart arrived in camp. In a council of war all of course concluded that by now an attack against the covering force was hopeless. Nevertheless something had to be done to satisfy the king and so the army moved forward a bit to a position on the line Ennevelin, Avelin, Seclin, with headquarters in Pont a Marcq.\nNext a battery of 20 heavy guns was arranged against the village of Ennetières which slightly protruded from the alliance lines. On the 11th this battery pounded away at the village from about half past three till the evening. This prompted Marlborough to call in Eugen and Johan Willem Friso who arrived with 19 battalions and a cavalry detachment. The generals now expected an attack at dawn on the 12th, but that day the only French action was to double their battery and to continue to fire at the village, which did not cause much damage.\nOn the 13th the French started to fortify the village of Seclin, which was in front of their positions, but they had retired their artillery. That day Marlborough sent 13 infantry regiments of Eugen's troops back to the siege and the other infantry was ordered back the next day. The French then concluded that nothing useful could be done and after receiving permission from the king they retreated on the 15th8.\nThe alliance digs into the counterscarp\nFrom 8 till 12 September the besiegers laboured on their postions and improved them. Meanwhile the besieged executed sorties in the evening of the 9th and the morning of the 12th. Both were driven back and did not have much result. On the other hand the numbers of the besiegers were dwindling.\n|1) Ouwerkerk to Heinsius 16 August 1708|\n|2) Marlborough to Heinsius 27 August 1708|\n|3) See Het Staatse Leger VIII/II page 339 for the first actions of the siege and the criticism about firing too early.|\n|4) Berwick page 121|\n|5) Marlborough to Heinsius 27 August 1708|\n|6) Goslinga to Heinsius 8 September: 'De quatre mille on ne put jamais rassembler 1600 pour faire les logement.'|\n|7) Van Collern to Heinsius 8 September: 'Doordien deselve so laet in 't doncker eer men gereet heeft konnen sijn is begonnen, dat eenighe desordres en confusie is voorgevallen.'|\n|8) Berwick page 127.

{"question":"How do archaeological findings compare the historical presence of lions and the symbols of triple triangles across ancient civilizations?","answer":"Archaeological evidence shows different patterns for lions and triple triangle symbols across ancient civilizations. Lions were historically present throughout Syria, Israel, Asia Minor, and the Balkan peninsula, with fossil remains found in Northwestern Europe and Britain, though they are no longer found in Israel today. The triple triangle symbol appears in multiple ancient writing systems - in Egyptian hieroglyphs (as three rounded hills), proto-cuneiform (representing 'land' or 'country'), Luwian hieroglyphs (meaning 'fortress'), and the Indus script (with 33-44 documented occurrences across sites like Mohenjo daro, Harappa, and Lothal). While lions had a widespread physical presence that has since contracted primarily to Africa and parts of Asia, the triple triangle symbol shows remarkable persistence across diverse ancient writing systems, though with varying meanings and arrangements.","context":["Besides basic symbols, the Indus script contains a number that are composed of two (or more) parts, each of which may or may not occur as an independent sign. I have discussed several apparent numerals, including THREE POSTS (III 2), a group of three tall verticals. In another post, I discussed the TRI-FORK (III 13). At times, the latter combines with another basic sign to form a ligature. In the case of today’s first symbol, these two are combined: THREE POSTS WITH ATTACHED TRI-FORK. This sign appears elsewhere only in the list of symbols prepared by Wells (W221). He notes only one occurrence from Mohenjo daro (M-409). To this we might add another of slightly different form, deriving from the same place (M-898). This is one I discussed previously, enumerating it VI 33 (see the earlier post for an image). Only the first, cited by Wells, is a seven-stroke item, one which I enumerate VII 9.\n|Seal M-409 with inscription: CIRCLED TRI-FORK / POT // |\nTHREE POSTS WITH ATTACHED TRI-FORK.\nIn both variants, the TRI-FORK attaches to the left side of the third “post.” In the first example (VII 9, as found on M-409, depicted here), the prongs all rise from the diagonal stem of the TRI-FORK. In the second example (VI 33, as found on M-898), the prongs attach at opposite angles to this stem, i.e., as a “V” shape bisected by the stem. If this distinction is significant enough to be reflected in the name as well as the numerical designation, we can amend VII 9 to THREE POSTS WITH ATTACHED E TRI-FORK.\nThere may be a third instance of this same ligature in a third variant form. It appears as a singleton cited only by Wells (W182), which I included in the list of five-stroke signs as DOUBLES QUOTES ON SLASH BELTED AITCH (V 14). Its single occurrence is on a seal from Mohenjo daro that is crowded toward the right edge. The inscription transliterates: BUD / CEE BOAT / SINGLE QUOTE // SLASH IN FISH / CUPPED POST / 3 POSTS / DOUBLE QUOTES ON SLASH BELTED AITCH / 2 POSTS. However, the “posts” on either side of the peculiar “aitch” are indistinguishable from the two vertical strokes of this “aitch.” So the same inscription might be transliterated with equal validity another way: BUD / CEE BOAT / SINGLE QUOTE // SLASH IN FISH / CUPPED POST / 4 POSTS / 3 POSTS WITH ATTACHED TRI-FORK. Here, the “TRI-FORK” actually has only two prongs attached to the stem, so it is a BI-FORK in my terms.\nIn any case, there are few comparable signs elsewhere. In Luwian hieroglyphs there is one that is fairly similar. It contains three vertical strokes like the Indus sign. To the one on the right is attached a diagonal stroke, forming the phonetic element tara. The diagonal is unadorned, though, and slants in the opposite direction of the stem of the Indus TRI-FORK.\nIn proto-cuneiform, we might compare a composite (or ligature) transliterated |3(N57).AMAR|. In this, there are three horizontal strokes on the left, which represent a true numeral. On the right is an outlined wedge shape which came to mean “calf.” Thus, together the two elements mean “three calves.” Other similar examples could be cited, but in each case the numeral is equal in scale or smaller than the other element. I am aware of no examples where a numeral has a small attachment, as appears to be the case with Indus sign VII 9.\nThe next Indus sign in my list is VII 10 (the tenth of the seven-stroke signs), which I term ARROW SKEWERING DIAMOND. As with the previous symbol, it occurs elsewhere only in Wells (W246). It resembles our conventional “arrow” sign pointing upward, with a diamond shape overlapping the shaft midway between the base and the point. It appears once, as Wells notes, on a pot shard from Naru-Waro-dharo (Nwd-1). On that shard it is to the left of two somewhat shorter strokes which might be classified as either \"quotes\" or \"posts.\" Cut off by the break is a hint of another (unfortunately unidentifiable) sign.\n|Inscription on pot shard Nwd-1 (reading from right): |\nTWO QUOTES (?) / ARROW SKEWERING DIAMOND.\nLuwian hieroglyphs again provide a vague parallel in the syllabic sign za. This is also basically an upward pointing arrow. However, this is no diamond. Beneath the arrow are two slanting lines stacked one over the over. The shaft of the arrow touches the upper of these. In contrast, proto-cuneiform and proto-Elamite include diamond shapes “skewered” in a similar manner to the Indus sign, but by simple posts rather than “arrows.” The proto-cuneiform SZIR~a came to mean “bulb” among other things. When the diamond contains two short strokes, this is NU11, which came to mean “light; fire, lamp.” The proto-Elamite sign contains various numbers of internal strokes (M254). Its significance is unknown.\nThe following two Indus signs may be variants of a single symbol. I term the first STACKED STOOLS WITH MID QUOTE (VII 11) and the second STACKED STOOLS WITH MID POST (VII 12). With equal justice, they might both be given the same name and enumeration, distinguished by adding “A” to the first and “B” to the second. Fairservis does not list either, Koskenniemi and Parpola show only one variant (KP228), and Wells distinguishes them. The first, with the central “quote,” is W457, which he notes twice (M-376 and M-391). The second, with the central “post,” is W454, which he also sees twice (H-37 and K-17). And of course the simple STOOL is III 21 in my list.\n|Detail from seal M-26 showing inscription: CROSSROADS EX / PINCH //|\nSTACKED STOOLS WITH MID POST / POT / MAN (horn of \"unicorn\"\nis abraded and partly broken off).\nIn proto-cuneiform there are two long, low “X” shapes stacked one over the other in a manner reminiscent of these Indus signs. In addition, there is a central vertical mark, though it extends beyond the middle of each “X.” This the “quote” and “post” do not do in the Indus signs. The proto-cuneiform sign is TE, which came to have a great variety of meanings: “cheek, skin; thorn, sting; tattoo, symbol; to prick, pierce; dye red; to approach, reach, meet; attack; be frightened.” Since the form of the symbol itself is fairly abstract, it is difficult to see which of these might be the original meaning – if any.\n|Seal M-936 with inscription: CORN HOLDER / TRIPLE TRIANGLES /|\nCRAB / POT HATTED BEARER.\nI note one more Indus sign here, TRIPLE TRIANGLES (VII 13), about which I have a little more to say. It is also known as KP215(a), W414, and Fs G-21. Fairservis states that the symbol represents three conical structures and means “dairy, storage, liquid measure, buttermilk; dairy or other storage; top of conical dairy.” Wells observes a total of 33 occurrences in four variants. The “a” form shows three triangles side by side, touching (see M-936 above). The “b” form adds a vertical stroke to the top of each of these triangles. In the “c” form the triangles are smaller and their base line is tilted at an angle (see M-809 below in which the triangles are both \"stemmed\" as in the \"b\" variant and tilted as in the \"c\" variant). The triangles of the “d” form are small again, with the sign rotated 90 degrees (proposed by Wells but not yet observed by me). Thus, the three triangles form a column rather than a row. Among the 33 occurrences of these combined variants, according to Wells, 26 are from Mohenjo daro (abcd), five from Harappa (abc), one is from Lothal (bc), and one is from Kalibangan (c). In addition, I find seven more from Harappa, an additional instance from Lothal, plus one from Allahdino (a), one from Kot Diji (poorly executed “a”), and perhaps one from Sibri-damb, yielding a larger total number of occurrences of 44.\n|Detail of seal M-809 showing inscription: BACKED CEES / STRIPED MALLET /|\nDOUBLE QUOTES // STRIPED TRIANGLE / TRIPLE TRIANGLES / SPEAR\n(final sign partially reconstructed).\nIn Egyptian, there is a hieroglyph representing three rounded hills, the two outer ones cut off midway (N25). This sandy hill country becomes an ideograph or determinative in h3st “foreign land,” in names of particular foreign lands, and for the desert. Proto-cuneiform provides a similar sign with KUR~c, made up of two triangles side by side with the third above them (and the whole thing rotated 90 degrees). It came to mean “land or country; netherworld; the east.” In Old Chinese there is a roughly similar character, though simplified into a “U” with an internal chevron, a vertical stroke rising from the latter. This is shan1, “mountain,” the 46th radical (Wieger 1967:208). It is tempting to note the graphic parallels between the Indus TRIPLE TRIANGLES, the three triangles in the proto-cuneiform “land,” the three humps of the Egyptian hill country, and the three vertical elements in the Old Chinese “mountain,” and conclude that there must be some universal principle involved. This might mislead us into thinking we can guess the meaning of the Indus sign, assigning it the definition “mountain” or “land.”\nBut I say mislead us for good reason. There is another Egyptian glyph representing three vessels side by side, identified as water-pots in a rack (W17). This is the ideograph for that very thing: racks for water-pots. Although the Indus symbol is considerably simpler, it may represent something actually triangular or cone-shaped rather than mountains, hills, or foreign countries.\nIn Luwian, too, a hieroglyph exists of three triangles, though these are typically striped. The glyph is transcribed CASTRUM, meaning “fortress.” Cretan hieroglyphs also include joined triangles, though only two, and these each have a round dot at the apex. This sign may represent the syllable ta. Neither of these examples supports the hypothesis that the Indus symbol must represent hills or some such. A final parallel, less convincing, is proto-Elamite M125. In this sign the three triangles are not joined side by side but stacked one over the over (and the stack is rotated 90 degrees, as is typical). The meaning remains unclear.\nThis leads to the interesting question of whether the arrangement of the three triangles is significant in the Indus symbol. If we accept tilting and rotating as carrying no change of meaning – and probably due to the need to fit a broad sign into a narrow space – then perhaps we should consider the SPACESHIP as another variant. This sign is made up of three triangles as well, although two are side by side and a third is beneath them (an 8-stroke sign not yet discussed). The whole set is then rotated 90 degrees from the orientation of the TRIPLE TRIANGLES described here. In other words, this is a very different arrangement of the same three elements. Being visually distinct, it probably designates something different. Or does it?\nAs a final note on enigmatic symbols, we should note that a row of joined triangles appears in the rock art of North America also. It appears in Texas (Newcomb and Kirkland 1996: 51, Pl. 15, no. 1; p. 192, Pl. 142, no. 20-N). It also occurs in Nevada, though infrequently (Heizer and Baumhoff 1984: 180, fig. 117a). The cited instances include three triangles, but other numbers of them also occur together in both areas of the Southwest.It is interesting to note that neither simple nor repeated triangles appear among the core designs found on Adinkra cloth (Willis 1998: 200-201). There are triangular elements in some of the designs, but these are always combined with some other element(s). The most prominent example is sepo, featuring a triangle atop a circle (1998:190). Variants rotate the design so that the triangle is on one side, the circular element on the other, or interpose a dividing stroke between the two shapes. In the latter case, the triangle is typically transformed into a diamond. Regardless of variant, this symbol represents an executioner’s dagger used for piercing. It symbolizes law and justice, as well as punishment. However, this is very different from a row of triangles, especially three of them. Generally speaking, Adinkra symbols show bilateral symmetry -- with two sides matching or top and bottom matching -- or else four-fold symmetry.","Bible History Online\nInternational Standard Bible Encyclopedia\nli'-un: (1) Occurring most often in the Old Testament is 'aryeh, plural 'ardyoth.

Natural History:\nThe lion is not found in Israel at the present day, though in ancient times it is known to have inhabited not only Syria and Israel but also Asia Minor and the Balkan peninsula, and its fossil remains show that it was contemporary with prehistoric man in Northwestern Europe and Great Britain. Its present range extends throughout Africa, and it is also found in Mesopotamia, Southern Persia, and the border of India. There is some reason to think that it may be found in Arabia, but its occurrence there remains to be proved. The Asiatic male lion does not usually have as large a mane as the African, but both belong to one species, Fells leo.\nLions are mentioned in the Bible for their strength (Jdg 14:18), boldness (2 Sam 17:10), ferocity (Ps 7:2), and stealth (Ps 10:9; Lam 3:10). Therefore in prophetical references to the millennium, the lion, with the bear, wolf, and leopard, is mentioned as living in peace with the ox, calf, kid, lamb and the child (Ps 91:13; Isa 11:6-8; 65:25). The roaring of the lion is often mentioned (Job 4:10; Ps 104:21; Isa 31:4 (the Revised Version (British and American) \"growling\"); Jer 51:38; Ezek 22:25; Hos 11:10). Judah is a \"lion's whelp\" (Gen 49:9), likewise Dan (Dt 33:22). It is said of certain of David's warriors (1 Ch 12:8) that their \"faces were like the faces of lions.\" David's enemy (Ps 17:12) \"is like a lion that is greedy of his prey.\" \"The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion\" (Prov 19:12). God in His wrath is \"unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah\" (Hos 5:14). \"The devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour\" (1 Pet 5:8). \"Lion\" occurs in the figurative language of Ezekiel, Daniel, and Revelation. The figures of lions were used in the decorations of Solomon's temple and throne (1 Ki 7:29,36; 10:19 f).\nNearly all references to the lion are figurative. The only notices of the lion in narrative are of the lion slain by Samson (Jdg 14:5); by David (1 Sam 17:34 f); by Benaiah (2 Sam 23:20; 1 Ch 11:22); the prophet slain by a lion (1 Ki 13:24; also 1 Ki 20:36); the lions sent by the Lord among the settlers in Samaria (2 Ki 17:25); Daniel in the lions' den (Dan 6:16). In all these cases the word used is 'aryeh or 'ari.\nThe Arabic language boasts hundreds of names for the lion. Many of these are, however, merely adjectives used substantively. The commonest Arabic names are sab`, 'asad, laith, and labwat, the last two of which are identified above with the Hebrew layish and labhi'. As in Arabic, so in Hebrew, the richness of the language in this particular gives opportunity for variety of expression, as in Job 4:10,11:\n\"The roaring of the lion ('aryeh), and the voice of the fierce lion (shachal),\nAnd the teeth of the young lions (kephirim), are broken.\nThe old lion (layish) perisheth for lack of prey,\nAnd the whelps of the lioness (bene labhi') are scattered abroad.\"\nIn Jdg 14:5-18, no less than three different terms, kephir 'arayoth, aryeh, and 'ari, are used of Samson's lion.\nAlfred Ely Day\nOrr, James, M.A., D.D.

{"question":"In a two-buyer auction model, how does the relationship between signal components affect equilibrium outcomes?","answer":"In a two-buyer auction model where buyer 1 has two signal components (s11, s12) and buyer 2 has one signal (s2), the equilibrium outcome will be identical for any pairs of signals (s11, s12) that sum to the same constant. This is due to independence, as buyer 1's objective function remains the same for any such pairs.","context":["By Dewatripont M., Hansen L.P., Turnovsky S.J.

Suppose that there are two buyers and one good. Assume that buyer 2’s signal s2 is, as usual, one-dimensional but that buyer 1’s signal s1 has two components: s1 =(s11 , s12 ). Let v 1 (s11 , s12 , s2 ) = s11 + s12 + αs2 Auctions and Efﬁciency 19 and v 2 (s11 , s12 , s2 ) = s2 + βs11 + γ s12 . Because of independence, buyer 1’s objective function is the same for any pairs (s11 , s12 ) that add up to the same constant, and thus, he will behave the same way for any such pairs. In particular, if (s11 , s12 ) and (s11 , s12 ) are pairs such that s11 + s12 = s11 + s12 , then, in any auction, the equilibrium outcome must be identical for the two pairs.\nSpeciﬁcally, suppose that in our two-good model, each buyer wants at most one good (this is not essential). Assume that the true value of good A to buyer i, yi A , is the sum of a component z A common to all buyers and a component of z i A that is idiosyncratic to him. That is, yi A = z A + z i A . Similarly, assume that buyer i’s true valuation of good B, yi B , satisﬁes yi B = z B + z i B . Suppose, however, that buyer i does not directly observe his true valuations, but only noisy signals of them.\nAuction Theory 31 easier. Furthermore, the RET was also useful in the actual analysis of the more complex games that Bulow and Klemperer (1999) used to approximate this game. In addition, anyone armed with a knowledge of the RET can simplify the analysis of the basic two-player war of attrition. 3.
