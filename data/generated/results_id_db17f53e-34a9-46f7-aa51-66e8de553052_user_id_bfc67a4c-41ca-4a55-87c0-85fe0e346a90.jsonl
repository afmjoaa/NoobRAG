{"question":"what differs between event boundaries and life transitions in memory formation?","answer":"Event boundaries and life transitions serve different functions in memory formation. Event boundaries are created when something unexpected happens that doesn't match our predictions, helping to segment continuous experiences into discrete memories. Life transitions, on the other hand, are longer periods marked by external circumstantial changes (like starting a new job) that help organize related memories in terms of both time and space. While event boundaries create individual snapshots of memory, transitions provide a broader context that helps structure our autobiographical memories and serve as temporal landmarks.","context":["How do we experience time and form memories?\nAn interview with Dr Lucia Melloni, Group Leader at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, conducted by April Cashin-Garbutt\nHave you ever been to a country where you can’t speak the language? When you hear people talking in a language you don’t understand, the sound often appears as a continuous stream – and that’s precisely because they are.\nTo perceive discrete segments, such as syllables, words and sentences, we must parse continuous sensory input into meaningful units. But how does the brain do this? Recent SWC seminar speaker, Dr Lucia Melloni, explains her research understanding how events structure cognition and memory allowing us to go from continuous streams to segmented units.\nIn what way does our experience differ from perception in terms of continuity?\nA surprising fact is that while our experience is continuous, we perceive it as a series of snapshots or events with a temporal order. One example is speech: when having a conversation, if we know the language, we typically experience it as if there are pauses, or breaks between words and sentences. Yet if one looks into the physical sound waves those pauses do not really exist, and if there are some, oftentimes they don’t demark words or sentences but occur in the middle of the words, which means that they can’t be used as clues to separate words.\nHow do these snapshots shape our memories and how much is known about the mechanisms by which continuous input is segmented?\nThe same holds true for our memories, while we experience life in a continuous manner, our memories are composed of snapshots of experience. If somebody asked you – what did you do last Tuesday? – you are very likely to remember, no matter how many other things happened in the days in between. You might remember whether or not you went to the office, or even what you were wearing that day. Not only does your brain remember all these snapshots of experience, but it also remembers the order in which things occur and we are even able to put ourselves into the starting moment of a memory from a particular point in a day and reexperience the moment.\nThe fact that we are able to do this means we must have ‘made a mark’ at the start of each experience thereby creating snapshots. This is a topic that has fascinated people for decades. Professor Jeff Zacks put forward an idea that we have models in our heads and we create event boundaries every time we cannot predict what is going to happen next.\nIn a similar way in my research, we study for instance how people learn words. We learn how one syllable leads to another and creates a chain, then when the association goes down, we create a boundary, and form a word. We are also studying how those perceptual boundaries affect our memories, and in particular the order in which we remember snapshots of experience within and across event boundaries. While there are lots of hypotheses and people working on these issues, there’s still a lot to learn! For example, how do brain areas get together and which events make up perception?\nHow did you unravel the mechanisms supporting segmentation and the encoding of sequences?\nThe first question I had was, what is an event for the mind? One problem in research is that when we ask people to pay attention, that could alter their experience. For example, if you ask someone to listen to the violins when they attend a concert, they can extract it versus if had they not been asked and they were just in the background.\nHow can we capture these chunks without having to ask people? To answer this question, I made use of language. There have been many years of beautiful research by linguists and psycholinguists demonstrating the building blocks of language. As we know what the building blocks should be – i.e., phonemes, syllables, phrases, sentences – we can capitalize on that and start looking for them in the brain.\nImportantly, while most assume that those building blocks of language exist in the mind, how those are put together in the brain is still an open question. We are working on this using invasive and non-invasive techniques in human subjects. Our hope is that by starting from this ‘known’ chunks of the mind, once we answer this question, we can extrapolate to other areas.\nWhat were your key findings?\nOne of the key findings was that we can determine how much people comprehend language just by looking at their brain activity. In particular, we can track in real time the different building blocks of language as they unravel, for instance the syllables, the phrases and the sentence. We can do that by simply asking subjects to listen to linguistic materials, while collecting the electrical responses of their brain through either non-invasive techniques such as Electroencephalography and also through invasive techniques such as electrocorticography in epilepsy patients. As they listen and comprehend language brain waves track those different units.\nWe can also use that now to track how people learn those linguistic units. This becomes relevant for evaluating those who aren’t able to tell us themselves, such as babies and animals and adults who do not have overt responses. We developed tools to be able to look at these event segments without explicitly asking subjects to report their understanding. While in its infancy, the tools that we have developed are helping us to understand whether unresponsive patients are able to comprehend language, and even use that information prognostically to predict their recovery.\nWere you surprised to find a hierarchical representation of sequences?\nIn a sense yes, and in a sense not. In language, we know that we have phonemes, syllables, words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs – since we already have this knowledge, we think it is simple. But imagine learning a new language such as Chinese – it is actually very difficult. We also have the same hierarchies of segmentation and narrative in movies. Building hierarchies and capitalising on sequences is something we do all the time. When we listen to music, move around in a city and so forth – it’s ubiquitous. By using the technique we developed we can now ‘see’ those units in real time and even track their acquisition, yet we don’t quite understand how they are built in the brain. We are at the early beginnings.\nHow was order better preserved and remembered within an event than across an event?\nAs per Jeff Zacks' work, the hypothesis is that our continuous experiences is parsed into events for the mind, which has several consequences for structuring our memories. Events are created based on models or schemas of what typical situations are e.g., the sequences of actions involved in having dinner at a restaurant. Those schemas, or world situational knowledge, are combined with ongoing experiences to make predictions about what comes next. When something unexpected happens, then an event boundary is created, and memories are separated.\nImagine if we had to remember every single sound, it would be very daunting. However, because we parse and chop it into meaningful units, then we compress it in some sense. One way to overcome our limits of working memory is chunking. If you are struggling to remember a phone number for example, breaking it into smaller chunks allows you to remember it more easily. Yet, an interesting consequence of that chunking mechanism is that remembering the temporal order is easier for things that happen within an event than for things occurring across an event. We could establish that behaviourally and then attempted to explain that through computational modelling.\nWhat are the implications of your research?\nThe broader goal of my research is to understand how other people experience the world, especially subjects who cannot overtly tell me how they feel such as babies or animals. I have a dream of understanding how animals also feel, not just us as humans. How does it feel to be a bat, a dolphin, or a mouse? How do they experience, segment and remember? It would be amazing but also very important to know that for animal research and making ethical decisions. My hope is that the kind of techniques we are developing will help us capture that, ideally in ways that do not require subject’s explicit responses so we can use those tools to interrogate people who are unresponsive, such as patients in vegetative states.\nWhat is the next piece of the puzzle your research is going to focus on?\nI’m just getting started! I would love to crack the question of how does our experience change based on the way we chunk information. I would also like to understand how we translate the very high-definition, rich, perceptual experiences into our memories. We know that we don’t remember everything and so there is a part that is lost, but we do not quite understand how that part is lost. How does this data compression happen – which information is dismissed, or transformed and which stays in the translation between perception and memory?\nAbout Dr Lucia Melloni\nDr Lucia Melloni received her PhD in Psychology from the Catholic University in Santiago, Chile and the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research, Frankfurt, Germany. She is currently a group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in Frankfurt am Main, Germany and a research professor in the neurology department at New York University Langone Health. Her lab is broadly interested in understanding the neural underpinnings of how we see (perception), how and why we experience what we see (consciousness), and how those experiences get imprinted in our brain (learning and memory) - as well as the interplay between these processes. She uses multiple methods to address these questions, ranging from electrophysiological and neuroimaging methods to behavioral techniques and online surveys.","When you take a look back at the year just gone, do you see any times of real change? A turning point, perhaps – or maybe a transition? No, I’m not repeating myself: although many of us, including those who research our autobiographical memories, use them interchangeably, these two kinds of important life events are distinct, and as new research in Applied Cognitive Psychology shows, both have their own role in helping us organise our past.\nConsider first a time in your life where your circumstances visibly changed: arriving at college, or when your first paychecks began tumbling in. Working with participants between 30 and 64, researchers Karalyn Enz and Jennifer Talarico demonstrate that these are the sorts of things people come up with when asked to describe a transition they have experienced in their life. They involve a change in external circumstances, something you and others can easily point to at the time.\nIn contrast, people asked to recall turning points give examples like meeting their partner or deciding to apply to grad school. Because it can be an internal decision or change of emotion or attitude, the turning point may not be immediately obvious to others, or even to ourselves at the time. These examples point up another difference: the 36 participants were twice as likely to see turning points as being a single event rather than a period, and twice as likely to see transitions as an extended period rather than an event. True, sometimes a turning-point type event would be suggested as a transition and vice versa, but the two appeared reasonably distinct. But for this to be really meaningful, we’d want to see them function differently. And they do.\nFirstly, consider how past autobiographical memory work shows that if you want to find a narrative thread to tie your past into a coherent whole, you shouldn’t focus on the crashing highs and lows – Disneyworld! The time I was mugged! – but on the critical decisions or forks in the road, however muted. Sounds pretty similar to turning points, doesn’t it? In the current study, participants were asked to rate how central the remembered events were to the person’s life to date. Turning points received significantly higher ratings than transitions, which seem to be less important on their own terms.\nLuckily, transitions appear to have another, practical, function: providing a context for organising other events. After generating a specific memory (e.g. a transition or turning point), Enz and Talarico asked participants to use this as a trigger for further memories, which were then rated for similarity to the trigger. When the trigger was a transition, the memories immediately produced were more similar and more likely to share a location with the transition. In other words, transitions provide a backdrop against which related memories may be organised; prior work (including my own) has suggested that by carving out distinct periods of a life, transitions may also supply temporal landmarks – who forgets the date they finished high school? – that help us organise in terms of time as well as space.\nTwo ways in which our life changes: a fresh environment or lifestyle, and the little moments with a deep impact. Researchers can do better work by distinguishing the two. What does this research mean for the rest of us? If you want to catalogue your life, you could do worse than cast your mind to the big transitions. But if you want to make sense of it, reflect on the turning points where you chose your own adventure.\nEnz, K., & Talarico, J. (2015).

{"question":"How do forensic guidelines mandate multiple data sources, and what accountability measures exist for working with marginalized groups?","answer":"Forensic guidelines require gathering data from multiple sources, including interviews with third parties like friends, relatives, therapists and neighbors, as well as reviewing records and case-specific information to confirm or disconfirm hypotheses. This helps avoid relying solely on potentially biased self-reporting. For accountability when working with marginalized groups, organizations must create structures for consultation and partnerships with women's rights organizations, respect their leadership, and ensure interventions truly support rather than undermine the needs of historically oppressed groups. This requires continual self-examination and openness to criticism.","context":["This author has served as a clinical and forensic neuropsychologist expert witness for over twenty years. It is a matter of utmost importance that an even playing field be created in adversarial proceedings. What is conducive to this is use of forensic guidelines as standards by all experts involved in a case. The \"common ground\" for experts is undoubtedly guidelines and standards cited in the research literature and by specialty standards.\nIn the Jodi Arias trial, there were apparent omissions of important standards that could indeed influence outcome of assessment. For example, a defense witness, when asked, had testified that she had interviewed Jodi Arias for over thirty hours. This same witness, when asked if she had talked to anyone else other than Jodi Arias, had indicated that she had not. This leaves one only with \"self-report\" which is decidedly biased, in particular given the significant problems in credibility with Jodi Arias. The specialty guidelines for forensic psychology discuss the importance of multiple sources of information. Although the expert testified that they had relied on many e-mail communications, etc., there did not appear to be any interviews of third parties, such as friends, relatives, therapists, neighbors, and individuals who may have had some knowledge of the relationship between the victim and Jodi Arias or knowledge of Jodi Arias's behavior and personality. Moreover, there were serious issues with respect to Jodi Arias's veracity, which would mandate gathering data from individuals other than she alone. The case cried out for information from collateral parties, yet this was apparently never done. Heilbrun (2001) notes that the need for accuracy and scrutiny in forensic mental health assessment standards have been cited as providing the necessity for obtaining case-specific information in the form of records and interviews of third parties. Specialty guidelines in Forensic Psychology also mandate collateral data from multiple sources.\nThe process of attempting to confirm or disconfirm hypotheses by using other case-specific data obtained in the course of the evaluation is imperative. Moreover, it is difficult to understand how it was concluded that Jodi Arias was a victim of abuse from the victim when there did not appear to be any police reports or documented instances of domestic violence. Moreover, there did not appear to be any consideration of her abusive behavior (e.g., alleged to have slashed tires on the victim's car as well as peeking in the window of the victim's house). One defense expert even stipulated that the victim was indeed fearful of Jodi Arias. Mechanic (2002) found fear to be the most frequently reported emotional response in stalking.\nAnother expert in the case had noted that Jodi Arias had, in fact, not been forthright in terms of one of the psychological test administrations. There did not appear to be any test of malingering or effort. Moreover, the testimony from one particular expert related to the fact that Jodi Arias suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is important to recognize that PTSD criteria did not appear to be established by any corroborating evidence. Moreover, it was represented that Jodi Arias had taken a video of the victim prior to the alleged murder. It is difficult to understand how she lacked \"memory\" of the event when she showed the thought process to be able to film the victim shortly before the alleged homicide. Moreover, the prosecutor represented that Jodi Arias had purchased cans of gas at a remote distance from the crime scene so as not to use credit cards near the scene of the allegations. This would appear to be facts which support premeditation rather than \"not remembering\" or reacting to a threat. The latter is difficult to understand when the evidence indicated, for example, that there was a rainbow-shaped pattern of blood on the wall in the area where the allegations had occurred, which the prosecutor indicated showed that the victim was trying to get away at the time he was being allegedly stabbed multiple times by Jodi Arias. All of these facts appear to support predatory and purposeful behavior.\nIt is important to integrate the physical findings and characteristics of the crime scene and integrate this with the psychological profile of the defendant. This writer presented a seminar at the University of California at Irvine on Psychological Profiling and Crime Scene Analysis. This writer also, in an evaluation of a capital case with a prosecutor, had worked assiduously with correctional officers in the facility to go over different pieces of physical evidence. These are particularly crucial in cases such as this because a subjective interview with the defendant can be verified or not verified against physical characteristics of crime scenes. This also assists the jury and the trier of fact in understanding and integrating of findings from analysis of the crime scene with subjective interviews and objective psychological test findings. None of the experts appeared to have evaluated or considered crime scene evidence with their findings.\nMechanic (2002) writing on intimate partner violence and stalking behavior speaks of stalking from attachment perspectives, noted intense scrutiny of a victim and monitoring and harassing behavior engaged in by batterers, which can be conceptualized as seeking to reestablish connection with partners to reestablish a secure base in the face of perceived or actual threats of separation. This is related to histories of early attachment disruptions in childhood. A defense witness did stipulate to Jodi Arias peeking in the window of the victim's house and watching him kissing another female. She stated that this was not stalking. This is difficult to understand especially given the research of Mechanic (2002) on the etiology and dynamics of stalking. Stalking is to annoy and harass. In domestic violence there is the heightened risk of violence in the face of actual or perceived threats of separation. This non-endorsement of stalking behavior by the expert is also inconsistent with this author's analysis of many cases of stalking.\nIt is incumbent upon forensic evaluators to avoid dual roles which could create the appearance of bias. Forensic evaluators are to be objective experts. This is addressed in the professional guidelines. However, in the case of Jodi Arias, one expert apparently gave her a book and then reportedly apologized for looking at her diary. Another expert had also given her a book. It is difficult to even understand how this could occur when contraband is not allowed in correctional facilities. In any event, it impairs objectivity in expert evaluators.\nThe Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence (RMSE) was formulated to provide the tools for judges to manage cases involving complex scientific and technical evidence. The manual contains updated chapters on neuroscience, mental health, and forensic science. It was published by the Federal Judicial Center and National Research Council of the National Academies in 2011. The reference manual addresses the fact of when deception is suspected, efforts to confirm it should begin during the clinical examination. Testimony in the case established that Jodi Arias was not telling the truth and was deceptive in various areas. This lack of veracity was noted by the jury. There did not appear to be any study or assessment of malingering by the experts to scrutinize her statements during the evaluation, nor did there appear to be any assessment of functional impairment subsequent to diagnosis of such areas as PTSD.\nThe RMSE addresses collateral informants, noting that in addition to reviewing records, interviewing third party informants can provide important perspectives on the person being evaluated. Family members and friends, including coworkers, can relate behavior and patterns indicative of symptoms of a mental disorder or functional impairment. Current or former therapists can share useful impressions in terms of diagnosis and psychopathology. Collateral parties can round out a picture of the person and help to confirm or disconfirm the evaluator's impressions. This did not appear to have been done, with one evaluator answering \"no\" when asked if she had spoken to any other parties other than Jodi Arias. An evaluation of only the defendant is weighted towards self-report of the defendant, in this case Jodi Arias. This leaves an evaluation devoid of information from third parties who can provide various perspectives on a defendant.\nIt appears that the experts focused on \"PTSD\" and \"lack of memory\" issues. It is difficult to understand, given the extreme and egregious nature of the allegations, why neuropsychological and clinical assessments were not done. Neuropsychological deficits are often seen in extreme violence. Clinical assessment can reveal presence of psychopathic traits.\nThere has been a tremendous expansion of the field of forensic psychological practice, as noted by the American Psychological Association, over the past fifty years. Thus, guidelines are important standards for contributing to the reliability and validity of data from forensic examinations. It is incumbent on all experts and practitioners to adhere to appropriate professional standards in forensic practice. As is frequently said, output is a function of input. Good input translates to a good outcome. Bad input leads to a bad outcome. These are standards to be striven for by all practitioners in the pursuit of good science and practice. There appears to have been significant omissions of these guidelines and standards in the Jodi Arias trial. However, the jury carried out its duty and carried it out well. The jury focused on the facts, evidence supporting the facts, and rendered a verdict of guilty of first-degree murder. They are to be commended for their hard work and rendering of justice. The victim's family deserves no less.\nDr. Perrotti received his PhD in Clinical Psychology from Alliant University in San Diego, CA. He is a licensed psychologist in California and Pennsylvania.

{"question":"How do positioning systems differ between ROVs and AUVs? I need to understand their positioning limitations since GPS doesn't work underwater.","answer":"ROVs and AUVs use different positioning methods due to GPS limitations underwater. For ROVs, there are three main positioning systems: Pipeline Tunnel Positioning using optical encoders to track penetration distance along pipes, Ultra Short Baseline Acoustic Positioning (USBL) which uses surface vessel DGPS and acoustic signals to determine ROV position in open water, and Doppler aided Inertial Positioning for restricted access areas using accelerometers and Doppler sonar. AUVs, being untethered vehicles that operate autonomously, face additional positioning challenges since they cannot rely on surface communication and must navigate independently without GPS or radio waves underwater.","context":["What are your means of positioning the ROV?\nMore than once we have been asked why we don’t put a GPS on our ROV’s in order to position them. Were it only that simple! Unfortunately, RF energy at the frequency used in GPS positioning systems only travels a couple of inches through water. Instead, we have to rely on a number of other alternatives available to us. We will briefly discuss them here.\nPipeline Tunnel Positioning: Penetration Distance\nThis is the simplest means of positioning available to us and provides an accurate means of determining position when performing pipeline and tunnel penetrations where we are only moving significantly in one direction, down the pipe or tunnel. This system works by running the ROV’s umbilical cable through a series of spring loaded idler wheels attached to an optical encoder. The encoder is attached to a computer which keeps track of the number of “counts” coming from the encoder. The count is then scaled for feet or meters as required. We write our control software in-house so we are able to configure the system to meet job-by-job requirements. One feature that we often customize for our clients is the ability to show not only the ROV’s position in a pipeline as a penetration distance but also as a station position. By using a station position the inspection engineer reviewing the recorded video and sonar data is more easily able to correlate the position to their construction drawings. We find that this can save a lot of time and confusion. If you think this service would aid your project, please don’t hesitate to ask us about implementing the option.\nOpen Water Positioning: Ultra Short Baseline Acoustic Positioning (USBL)\nUSBL is a means of providing a position of the ROV using acoustic positioning. It works by using a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) derived position and an accurate heading, pitch, roll and heave sensor to position a transceiver carried on a vessel on the surface. The transceiver is equipped with a phased transducer array capable of resolving both range and bearing to a transponder or responder carried on the ROV. Since the position and attitude of the transceiver on the vessel is known, the absolute position of the ROV is able to be derived by combining that position with the relative range, depth and bearing from the USBL system. This makes for the most simple and efficient means of providing a position in open water conditions. Download the USBL Fact Sheet here.\nWhat’s the difference between a Transponder and a Responder?\nThe difference between a transponder and a responder is generally more about the way the USBL device is used on a mobile underwater object (ROV for instance) than the hardware itself. A USBL transponder is a device that receives an acoustic signal from the surface transceiver, waits a predetermined time (milliseconds) and then sends out a reply pulse. The surface transceiver receives this pulse and calculates the range to the transponder by halving the time and using the speed of sound through water (approx 1500m/s). This system has the advantage that it is simple to deploy as it doesn’t require any independent wiring and can often run on internal batteries. The downside is that as the sound path has to travel both from the surface transceiver down to the transponder and then back from the transponder to the transceiver, inaccuracies are introduced to the calculation due to variations in speed of sound in water, thermoclines etc.\nThe Responder is a similar device except that instead of taking the trigger signal as an acoustic signal from the surface transceiver, it receives the trigger as an electronic pulse sent down the ROV’s umbilical. This pulse then causes the responder to send out an acoustic pulse to surface where it is received by the transceiver. Though this method requires that the ROV be configured by a competent electronic technician to allow the signal to travel from copper on the surface to fiber optics in the umbilical and then back to copper in the ROV, the advantage is that the responder system doesn’t have to travel twice through the water column but rather just once. This results in us providing a significantly tighter position to the client.\nWhen working in deep water we generally place a transponder on our aluminum deployment garage and a responder on the ROV itself. This way, we are able to keep a general track of the deployment cage while achieving a tight position on the ROV itself. An example of this method was demonstrated in this recent NOAA/NURC project.\nRestricted Access Positioning: Doppler aided Inertial Positioning.\nOriginally designed for navigating nuclear powered submarines and space craft, the IMU is essentially an array of very sensitive accelerometers (based around a fiber optic gyroscope) sensing movement in all 6 degrees of freedom. The device measures the rate of change of velocity in the fwd/rev, up,down, port,stbd planes as well as the corresponding rotational axis of the sensor. These accelerations are then integrated two times (the first integration giving velocity and the second integration giving displacement). This process is done many times a second to give the device the ability to not only dead-reckoning its position in space relative to a known start point but also to know its attitude to a very precise degree with respect to North and vertical.\nWhen fitted to a specially designed skid on the Falcon DR and mated with Doppler sonar (to null out any drift errors when the unit is stationary) and a profiling scanning sonar, the system allows us to geo-reference any solid underwater object. This means we are able to model the interior of a tunnel or pipeline or perform very high resolution hydrographic surveys in locations otherwise inaccessible to conventional navigation devices (USBL)\nIt is a very impressive technology. While CDL initially intended it for use in performing tunnel investigations we (SeaView Systems and SeaVison Marine Services) have been pioneering its application for performing other restricted access surveys.\nPlease don’t hesitate to contact us for further information about this technology, how we deploy it, the available deliverables and how they may be used to support your application.","This section provides Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Information of a general nature to the interested public.\nThe Development of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV):\nA Brief Summary Download (4.2mb)\nThere are different types of underwater vehicles. One method of categorizing these vehicles is to identify them as members one of two classes of vehicles; manned and unmanned systems. We are all familiar with the manned systems. They can be described simply as falling into two sub-classes; military submarines and non-military submersibles such as those operated to support underwater investigations and assessment. The navies of the world utilize a number of different classes of submarines to conduct their missions.\nOn the other hand, Alvin (USA), Epaulard (France), Mir (Russia) and Shinkai 6500 (Japan) are all familiar names of small submarines that allow a few individuals to descend into the ocean to gather data and information from observations of the water column and ocean bottom.\nUnmanned submersibles also fall in to a number of different sub-classes. The simplest and most easily described are those submersibles that are towed behind a ship. They act as platforms for various sensor suites attached to the vehicle frame. A second type of submersible system is called a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). An ROV is a tethered vehicle. The tether supplies power and communication to the ROV and is controlled directly by a remote operator. A third type of unmanned submersible is an Unmanned Untethered Vehicle(UUV). This untethered vehicle contains its own onboard power, but is controlled by a remote operator via some type of a communications link. An AUV is an undersea system containing its own power and controlling itself while accomplishing a pre-defined task. A further distinction between the AUV and UUV is that the AUV requires no communication during its mission whereas the UUV requires some level of communication for it to complete its assigned mission.\nVideo provided by Sonardyne International\nNARRATOR: Henry Stommel, an eminent oceanographer from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, envisioned the day that there would be “a thousand swimming robots” in the sea. His vision has been partially realized with the technology in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), computer-controlled systems operating under the water.\nWhen you compare vehicles, some of them look like torpedoes, some of them look like stingrays, some of them look like things with flippers on them. So the breadth of that is pretty exciting, and what they can do.\nThey are designed with the intelligence to perform their tasks, identify problems, and adapt to different situations. AUVs can help protect our environment, as well as mitigate threats to our national security. And now, they are even being used to search for sunken history.\nSo, when you take AUV technology, you can see how the ships maneuvered, where the canon balls landed, where all the ship debris scattered as they blew up. That gives you greater insight as to the decisions that were made on those significant days.\nAutonomous Underwater Vehicles can be equipped with sophisticated sensing devices. These sensors can measure different ocean characteristics; others can provide images of objects under the water or even buried below the ocean bottom. Since visibility under the sea is usually poor, sound - or SONAR - is used to create these acoustic pictures.\nSide-Scan Sonar can produce very realistic imagery of objects and the seafloor. As the ping, or sound wave, travels underwater, it will reflect off objects such as sunken ships. The sonar distinguishes between these objects and creates dark or light regions that make up the astonishingly clear images we are able see today.\nSince the 1990’s, the Office of Naval Research has been investing in AUVs and their advanced sensors to help search for mines. Now, marine archeologists are able to use this amazing technology and put it to use exploring sunken history.\nOver 2,000 shipwrecks can be found in the waters off Rhode Island, which has more shipwrecks than any other state per square mile. These shipwrecks include British frigates intentionally burned and sunk during the Revolutionary War in 1778 to avoid capture by a French fleet.\nFour of these shipwreck sites, including the HMS Cerberus and HMS Lark, were explored using AUV technology. Several new discoveries are being made with these advanced remote sensing technologies, as they help marine archeologists answer important questions about our history.\nA benefit of AUV exploration, and one that is of critical importance in exploring sunken ships, is the non-invasive nature of the technology. AUV missions will not disturb these delicate sites in any physical way.\nNot only can AUVs help marine archeologists, but they are also being used in coastal surveys, fisheries research, and ocean exploration. Through these demonstrations, we can really grow the pull for this technology and basically increase access to the sea. Everything good will follow from that.\nPerhaps a thousand swimming robots in the sea is closer than we think.\nDesign of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Download\nThere are concerns about the impact that global warming will have on our environment, and which will inevitably result in expanding deserts and rising water levels. While a lot of underwater vehicles are utilized, AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) were considered and chosen, as the most suitable tool for conduction survey concerning these global environmental problems. AUVs can comprehensive survey because the vehicle does not have to be connected to the support vessel by tether cable. When such underwater vehicles are made, it is necessary to consider about the following things. 1) Seawater and Water Pressure Environment, 2) Sink, 3) There are no Gas or Battery Charge Stations, 4) Global Positioning System cannot use, 5) Radio waves cannot use. In the paper, outline of above and how deal about it are explained.\nThe Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) and the Office of Naval Research (ONR) sponsored the development of these documents. They are intended for students who are considering participation in the annual AUVSI/ONR Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) competition. The documents provide an overview of engineering and organizational considerations for designing, building, and operating a vehicle for this event. Development of an underwater system requires knowledge of multiple engineering disciplines, as well as good organizational and execution skills. These documents provide a brief overview of these topics to acquaint readers with the subjects, knowledge, and skills important to competitive teams. The documents also include practical tips and advice based on experience developing and operating AUVs. The authors include past AUV competition participants who have shared their experience."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:72b694af-4ca0-4464-814f-21887d7ea36a>","<urn:uuid:57b9f6fd-1e38-4f2a-978b-1a82133b781d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Were clippers used for Tea Route faster than modern catamarans?","answer":"Modern catamarans are faster than the historical clippers. While 19th century clippers were considered fast vessels of their time and competed annually in tea races from China to London, modern vessels like the maxi-catamaran Gitana 13 aimed to complete the Tea Route in about 40 days. In contrast, historical clippers took significantly longer, as evidenced by the current record holder Philippe Monnet's time from 1990 being beatable by the modern 33-meter catamaran.","context":["Maxi-catamaran crosses the start line of the Tea Route to start their seventh final record campaign\nWhilst the Summer Olympics are in full swing in China, Lionel Lemonchois and his nine crew have bid farewell to Asia. The maxi-catamaran crossed the start line of the Tea Route – Hong Kong to London – today (14 August) at 0755’32” UT. On this course spanning over 14,000 miles the sailors of Gitana Team are targeting a time of around forty days to make Europe and the city of London.\nAhead of the 33 metre catamaran lies a seventh and final reference time to beat in order to conclude a record campaign.\nFollowing on from the Route de l’Or, for which they’ve held the new record of 43 days 3 minutes 18 seconds since last February, the sailors from Gitana Team are tackling another legendary course: the Tea Route. This prestigious commercial route has seen some of the largest clippers of the XIXth century start with a close-hauled navigation across the China Sea, then the Java Sea, prior to entering the Indian Ocean.\nThe crew will leave this turbulent ocean immediately after leaving the Cape of Good Hope (SE tip of Africa). From there they will begin the long climb up the Atlantic Ocean. During their target forty days at sea, the crew will have adopted a route fairly unfamiliar to contemporary sailors. To date, no maxi from the G Class has ventured into these regions; the current record being held by French sailor Philippe Monnet since 1990.\nAccording to the weather forecasts, over the first days of the course Gitana 13 is set to face a medium SW’ly wind which will veer round to the W. Some close-hauled sailing is on the menu for the start of the course, which will take the men of Gitana Team fairly near the Vietnamese coast prior to closing on the shores of Malaysia and Indonesia.\n“The first part of the course as far as the Indian Ocean won’t necessarily be very quick. Until we get to the south of Vietnam, the anemometer will rarely exceed 10-15 knots, but as the wind gradually backs we’ll be able to pick up the pace as we approach the Java Sea. There aren’t likely to be any big surprises as far as the weather is concerned over the initial miles but the crew will have to be on their guard. We noticed during our previous records that our passage across the China Sea is likely to involve a number of encounters (fishing boats and drifting nets dotted about everywhere). In addition, throughout our descent of the Indian Ocean, we’re going to pass strings of islands? land will never be that far away” explained Lionel Lemonchois this morning.\nBrief history of the Tea Route\nUntil 1849, the East India Company had the monopoly on the maritime transport of tea. Following this time however, the abrogation of the Navigation laws came about, which protected the trade and opened it up to the American clippers, normally dedicated to cotton. These faster vessels were to impose double tariffs and in order to remain in the race British shippers had to launch themselves into the construction of new yachts: the clippers. Around the middle of the XIXth century, the annual race of the “Tea-Clippers” from China was a real obsession for sailors. The first vessel to reach London with its precious cargo pocketed colossal sums and not inconsiderable prestige. Setting out from London in the winter, the clippers began their outbound voyages carrying various loads towards whatever destination they fancied in the Orient or even Australia. Next, at the height of the summer, the vessels sailed for China where they headed towards the main tea ports, prepared to embark the very first new tea.\nFor more information on the team, visit www.gitana-team.com .","The British cargo ship Norham Castle, built in Glasgow, was launched in 1869 as a tea clipper for the trade with China. Clipper ships, sleek and three-masted, were designed for speed. Their production took off in the 1840s because of a growing demand for faster delivery of tea from China.\nThe Norham Castle transported tea and eventually mixed cargoes to places including Australia and New Zealand. In 1883 she was sailing near the Sunda Strait, which is located between the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra. It just so happens that most of Indonesia’s more than 130 active volcanoes lie between Java and Sumatra, the most famous being the stratovolcano (the steepest and most deadly kind) known to Westerners as Krakatoa.\nBy the summer of 1883 seismic activity around Krakatoa had been intensifying for months, producing earthquakes, steam venting, and ash eruptions. The three peaks of Krakatoa served as an exit for a huge magma chamber beneath. There is some speculation that an earlier eruption had clogged the neck of one of the peaks, creating an incredible amount of pressure building up below the blockage. The volcano was overdue for a climax.\nAround 1:00 p.m. on August 26, a volcanic eruption sent a cloud of gas and debris about 15 miles into the air. The eruption was continuous, with numerous explosions. Capt. W.J. Watson of the Irish merchant ship Charles Bal reported that the noise was like the continuous discharge of heavy artillery. The noise intensified and was accompanied by a hail of ash and pumice. Ash eventually blanketed everything within thousands of square miles, plunging the area into darkness that would last two and a half days.\nCapt. Watson said that the intense blackness made it impossible to see to any distance. There was also a small tsunami on the shores of Java and Sumatra.\nEarly in the morning on August 27, a series of explosions began triggering more tsunamis. The third of these explosions was the most horrific, so violent that it was heard about 1,900 miles away in Western Australia – and about 3,000 miles away on the Indian Ocean island of Rodrigues. People there thought the blasts were cannon fire from a nearby ship.\nThe noise from this explosion is arguably the loudest sound ever recorded. The barometer at a gasworks in Batavia (now Jakarta), 100 miles from Krakatoa, registered a spike in pressure of over 2.5 inches of mercury, which converts to over 172 decibels, at 100 miles from the source. (For context, if you were operating a jackhammer you would be subject to 100 decibels.)\nAt above 194 decibels, sound waves stop traveling through the air and begin pushing the air along with them – and the resulting “wind,” or shock wave, can blow anything in its path to pieces. Closer to Krakatoa the sound was well over this limit.\nThe shock waves created by the Krakatoa eruption shattered windows and shook homes within a 100-mile radius of the volcano. The shock waves were so powerful that they were recorded by barometric stations around the globe.\nThe tsunamis created by the eruption proved most deadly. More than 36,000 people were swept out to sea in the series of tsunamis caused by the volcano’s collapse, which created a wall of water over 100 feet high that wiped out scores of coastal villages on Java and Sumatra. The tsunami carried the Dutch ship Berouw a mile inland, killing all 28 crew.\nThe eruptions also created pyroclastic flows – avalanches of lava, ash, and pumice. These flows scorched everything in their path, whether passing ships or coastal villages. Michael Bubb writes:\nOf the 36,000 deaths, around 4,500 were attributed to the pyroclastic flows which would have arrived just after the tsunamis. Most likely the 4,500 who met their fate with the flows had reached higher ground or shelter to avoid the rushing water, only to be engulfed in fire and ash.\nUnimaginable horror was unfolding on the Sunda islands.\nThis catastrophe marked a series of “firsts,” says geologist David Bressan. It was the first global catastrophe and the first news story to go around the world, thanks to modern communications.\nAs the Sunda Strait was and still is an important passage from the Indian Ocean to the Chinese Sea, news about the eruption and destruction of harbors and lighthouses in the area were of special interest to merchants, politicians, and the public in general…\nKrakatoa was also the first scientifically well recorded and studied eruption of a volcano, from the very beginning to its disastrous ending.\nThe study of what was left of the former island of Krakatoa also spawned a new scientific discipline: disturbance ecology. Observations made at Krakatoa were valuable for understanding the colonization of devastated or newly formed terrain.\nAnd what of the clipper Norham Castle? On Sunday, August 26, the vessel was at the eastern entrance of the Sunda Strait, along with another ship, the Sir Robert Sale. On Monday morning both vessels entered the Strait but because of blackened skies neither made much progress.\nCapt. O. Sampson of the Norham Castle reported that Krakatoa “appeared to be alight with flickering flames rising behind a dense black cloud; at the same time balls of fire rested on the mastheads and extremities of the yardarms.”\nIn the wake of the devastating eruption, Capt. Sampson wrote in his official log:\nI am writing this blind in pitch blackness. We are under a continual rain of pumice and dust. So violent are the explosions that the eardrums of over half my crew have been shattered. My last thoughts are with my dear wife. I am convinced the Day of Judgement has come.\nBy the morning of Tuesday, August 28, Krakatoa had gone silent. The volcanic island had almost entirely sunk, except for the southern third. The blackness of the sky was slowly beginning to lift. The Sir Robert Sale and the Norham Castle finally made it through the Strait."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b01b5671-6a09-45c9-be70-5006a25f395d>","<urn:uuid:5bacd2b1-152d-4491-b4e6-e11eb8632132>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the real deal with pretzel history and proper prep methods? How'd this twisted snack come to be and what's the right way to make it?","answer":"Pretzels originated around 610 A.D. in northern Italy, created by a monk who shaped dough into loops representing arms folded in prayer, calling them 'pretiola' (meaning 'little reward' in Latin). The name evolved into 'brezel' in Germany by the 9th century. As for preparation, the most authentic method uses a lye bath (1 oz food-grade lye in 1 quart water for a 30-second dip). Alternative methods include sodium carbonate baths or boiling methods, but they must achieve the characteristic crunchy exterior and soft interior that Germans consider essential. The basic ingredients have remained unchanged for 14 centuries: wheat flour, yeast, water, salt, and malt or molasses.","context":["- Cold lye bath method: 1 oz. food-grade lye, dissolved in 1 quart of water. 30 second dip, sprinkle with salt, then bake. Please follow the link, and follow their safety instructions. This is the most desirable, authentic method.\n- Cold sodium carbonate bath method: 100 g sodium carbonate dissolved in 2 cups of water. Immerse raw, shaped pretzels in the bath for three to four minutes, rinse off the excess dipping solution in a large bowl of plain water, sprinkle with salt, and bake.\n- Sodium carbonate boil method: Boil 6 cups of water. Add 2 to 6 tablespoons sodium carbonate . Boil pretzels for 1 minute, sprinkle with salt, then bake.\n- Baking soda boil method: Boil 6 cups of water. Add 2 to 6 tablespoons baking soda. Boil pretzels for 1 minute, sprinkle with salt, then bake.\n- Water boil method: Boil pretzels in water for 1 minute, sprinkle with salt, then bake.\n- Egg wash method: Beat an egg with 1 Tbsp water. Brush over the top of the pretzels, sprinkle with salt, and bake. But this is really just a bread twist with egg wash, not a pretzel.\nAnd here they are! I drafted my husband to help keep track of which pretzel was done by which method. He wrote what they are on the parchment in red Sharpie. Here's the layout:\n|5 2 4a|\n3a 4b 3b\nI made a batch of sodium carbonate, and a batch of pretzel dough, and here we go! I'm skipping #1 because I don't have any lye. I might come back to it one day. I'm also skipping #6, because I know it will make a pretzel-shaped roll, having no true pretzel flavor. Here are my tests. I made one pretzel by each of these six methods:\n2. Cold sodium carbonate bath\n3. a. Sodium carbonate, 2 Tbsp in 6 c water, boiling\n3. b. Sodium carbonate, 6 Tbsp in 6 c water, boiling\n4. a. Baking soda (Sodium bicarbonate), 2 Tbsp in 6 c water, boiling\n4. b. Baking soda (Sodium bicarbonate), 6 Tbsp in 6 c water, boiling\n5. Plain boiling water\nResults:5. Clearly the plain water pretzel did not get anywhere near the color that the others have. It also tasted more plain. However, my son thought it was the second best.\n2. The cold carbonate dipped pretzel looks puffy, maybe because it was not restricted from its rise by being partially cooked by the boiling water. This tied for first in our family taste test.\n3.b. The 6 Tbsp sodium carbonate pretzel looks the best (lower right), and tied the cold version for best taste.\n4.b. The 6 Tbsp baking soda pretzel had a bit of a chemical taste to it in some bites, not very appealing.\n3.a. & 4.a. Both of the 2 Tbsp boils did not add much pretzel taste.\nBut wait, there's more!\nUnexpected secondary results:I thought I was done at this point, and turned back to the remaining six ropes of dough laying on the table waiting to be made into pretzels also. I twisted two and gave them the cold sodium carbonate soak, and slipped two into the 6 Tbsp sodium carbonate bath.\nThe boiling pretzels looked terrible! They had been proofing for maybe 20 min before I twisted and boiled them, which looks like allowed the boiling water to burst some bubbles and soak into the pretzels. Yuck! I baked them anyway, but probably won't eat them.\nI took the remaining two dough ropes, folded them up, and re-rolled them. On a whim, I tried for the Bavarian-style shape, where the twisted arms are very thin, and the big loop is fat. I boiled one and soaked one. I reduced the oven to 425° because the first tray browned too fast, leaving some boggy places in the pretzels. Here's the result:\n|Beautiful cold-bath pretzels on the left, gnarled boiled ones on the right.|\nThe Winner:I was able to bake them longer, and I let them get darker. The beauty in the photo above was clearly better than any from the whole first tray. Cold bath wins. The boiled pretzels, even the ones that didn't get mangled, all had a heaviness from the water. That wasn't the case for the cold soaked pretzel. Not only is that a pretty pretzel, it also has some of that true pretzel flavor, which must be approaching that of its lye-dipped cousins. It also crunched when we pulled it apart. :) I think this one isn't puffy like on the first tray because I inadvertently let the rope rise about 20 min before twisting it.\nThen there's that curious fat Bavarian-ish pretzel using the cold-bath, in the lower left corner of the tray. I didn't get the shape quite right, it's too closed up, but it was tasty, and has lots of promise! The fat back edge was really nice, and the little arm nubs were crunchy. I'm definitely trying that shape again!\nUpdate: My latest pretzel recipe and techniques are here: http://doughcrafter.blogspot.com/2014/02/brezeln-pretzels.html","ULM, GERMANY — This is a story with a twist.\nNearly a billion pretzels a year are gobbled up in Germany where the gnarled, salt-sprinkled edible is considered a ``best friend`` by beer-drinkers and non-beer-drinkers alike. The Bread Museum in this Danube- flanked peewee city keeps a special corner of its magnificent exhibition on the staff of life just for the lowly pretzel.\nCalled in German die Brezel, the pretzel--especially the so-called\n``soft`` kind, crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside--is to be found in Germany in at least 24 configurations, most of them resembling the figure 8 or the letter B.\nWhile retaining its crusty integrity, the pretzel also comes in such diversified shapes as horns, rods, nuggets, tear drops and animal forms. Here in Ulm, for instance, where the sparrow is the city`s official symbol, you can buy pretzels molded in the image of that hardy bird. Sliced down the middle and spread with thick butter, the pretzel becomes a poor man`s, and even a rich man`s, super delicacy, especially at breakfast time. Who can resist them? Asserts a spokeswoman in the curator`s office of the Bread Museum: ``Let me say that there are some places, but not here in Germany, that serve them up as chocolate-covered items--an abomination and an insult--or dipped in garlic or covered with soft cheeses. But that`s unacceptable to us Germans, as indeed are those hard, glazed pretzels made by machines on a mass scale and sold in cellophane packages or boxes. No, there is only one true pretzel, and it`s the soft one made by hand with a lifespan of just a few hours.``\nThe museum maintains that you judge the quality of the pretzel by the characteristic bumps or nubs where the two ends of the coil of dough finally connect. There`s still a big difference of opinion among Germans as to whether these nifty nodules should be eaten first or saved for the end. There`s also a difference of opinion as to whether the doughy comestible was invented in Germany, but everybody agrees that Germany is, unofficially, the ``official home`` of the pretzel.\nAccording to historians, however, the pretzel probably was invented in northern Italy around 610 A.D., then made its way across the Alps into Germany, where it found a permanent home. Oddly enough, the Italians have never taken to the pretzel, whereas the French have their own version of what goes best at breakfast, the buttery croissant.\nDeveloped by a now-forgotten monk, the pretzel was intended as a reward for children who learned their prayers well. After baking his quota of bread each day, he took the leftover ends of the dough, made them into long ropes and wound them into loops in such a way as to represent arms symbolically folded in prayer.\nThe monk called the intriguing baked twists of dough ``pretiola,`` which means ``little reward`` in Latin, and when it migrated into the teutonic country, ``pretiola`` evolved around the 9th Century into the German\n``brezel.`` It had found a friendly milieu in a land that takes the pretzel seriously.\nAs might have been expected, there are some other theories about the origin of the pretzel. One has it that a certain German king ordered loaves of bread to be made as odd-shaped rolls with large holes in them so pilgrims could conveniently string them on staffs. There`s also a legend to the effect that Aeneas, the Trojan hero, hosted Dido, the Carthaginian Queen, at a dinner table where the bread had holes similar to those of today`s pretzel.\nThe pretzel has even played a role in history. Documented facts show that when the Turks were besieging Vienna in 1683, they were unable to breach the city walls; so the invaders decided to dig a tunnel during the night when everybody was asleep. But the Turks did not reckon with a pretzel-baker who was preparing his wares for the next morning.\nHearing the Turks` shovels, the pretzel-baker alerted the general in charge of defense, who forthwith rallied this troops and annihilated the enemy. For this, the pretzel-bakers of Vienna were awarded a special coat-of- arms--two sword-bearing lions holding up a pretzel with a cross.\nHistory and legend aside, the lowly pretzel--regardless of its disheartening calorie-count--has been admired for at least 14 centuries and is still made with the same ingredients used at the start. That goes for the soft, lightly browned, perishable kind and the small, crisp types--wheat flour, yeast, water, salt and malt or molasses.\nThe life expectancy of the soft-variety pretzel, which has instantaneous eye-appeal to a pretzel enthusiast, is but a few hours before it begins to lose its springy consistency. It can only be made by hand, whereas the hard, dehydrated pretzel, less alluring, lasts indefinitely and is produced by machines that turn out 30,000 of them an hour.\nThe pretzel-making machine was invented just before World War II by a Pennsylvania manufacturer with the help of a hobo baker, and the pretzel thus became mass-produced to the extent that today this crispy species racks up sales of more than $100 million annually in the United States alone.\nBut in Germay, it`s a different story. ``Soft`` is the message among the pretzel-fanciers if you want to be considered among the upper crust."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f6f814c0-22cf-401e-8d0e-211d4a335cc9>","<urn:uuid:207e843f-3857-45f9-a584-7e1f1d539919>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What methods are used for maintaining sterility in surgical environments, and how do video production crews adapt to these requirements when filming procedures?","answer":"In surgical environments, surface disinfection is crucial and requires cleaning contaminated surfaces with EPA-registered hospital-level tuberculocidal disinfectants. These must be used according to label directions, with proper cleaning of bioburden first through a 'spray-wipe-spray' or 'wipe-discard-wipe' procedure. For video production in operating rooms, crews must work around these sterility requirements while setting up equipment. They use remote control pan-tilt cameras, wireless mics, and video conferencing systems that can be operated from separate control rooms, minimizing direct presence in the sterile field.

Apparently Warner Brothers stored clothespins in a bin marked C-47 - or a fancier name was needed to make it sound like something other than a clothespin. Whatever the reason, you can do a lot more than just clip gels and diffusion to a light. You can fasten a piece of cardboard or paper to any number of materials, to create a makeshift teleprompter, flag or bounce card. You can keep cables, headphone wires or other parapharnelia neat. And should you pack too few socks in your carry-on bag, you can do laundry in your hotel sink and hope it dries by morning.\nThe Ponytail Holder\nI sometimes get strange looks when I buy a pack of these at the drug store, but there is nothing cheaper for holding a coil of audio or video cable wrapped tight. Actually you should see the strange look I once got when buying some nylon stockings - I was trying to soften the image of a wrinkly interview subject! You can also use them to secure cables to a tripod leg, utility cart or to keep cables together. The slightly less cheap multi-colored Velcro® strips available at your local home center are good also.\nThese doohickies, though seldom used unless you are in an office with a drop ceiling, are a great way to secure a light without a stand.\nA solid utility cart\nFor years we used a pair of stainless steel and aluminium carts. These were well balanced and held our 70+ pound OR tripod. This tripod was a beast, originally designed to support a 16mm camera back in the 70's - we used it up until 2003 with our D700, now it is in the basement with the large Anvil cases and the lost ark of the covenant.\nNow we use a pair of Rock-n-Roller carts. These things are lightweight and so far indestructible. We got one in 2000 and it still has its original parts, and you can move a VW Bug with it.\nGadgets in the OR\nIn the OR, when shooting surgery, we use a combination of our own gadgets, plus we get to see the latest gizmos used by surgeons. There are some amazing devices, all of which should make you quite optimistic about surgery.\nWhen opening up an abdomen for surgery, you need to keep the small intestine, omentum or colon out of harm's way. There are some pretty cool choices. The Army-Navy retractor is very useful, compact and has two sized blades for retracting smaller structures. Malleable retractors are basically flat pieces of metal with rounded edges, and are bendable (malleable in medical-ese) so they can be shaped around a particular structure. Self-retaining devices, such as the Wheatlander have the handle like a pair of scissors but the business end looks like two serving forks with the tines bent outward. You squeeze the handle and the tines extend and lock into place, keeping a smaller incision wide open - hands-free (very useful in hernia and axillary surgery). The Thompson retractor, and others like it, use a large ring with ridges, mounted to a vertical support, over the incision. Then several retractor blades are attached to the ring with spring-loaded clips, widening the operative field, also hands-free. From a video point of view, the fewer hands the better!\nMost people know the term \"cautery\" or \"cauterize.\" Cauterization is using heat to seal tissue, as is often done in the eyes or nose. However the electrosurgery device, usually called the Bovie, uses electrical current to cut or coagulate tissue, such as blood vessels or other connective tissues. You can basically cut anything with it. There is a grounding pad placed on the patient's thigh, which takes the excess current and gets rid of it. Another form of energy is ultrasonic energy. A cutting blade vibrates at an extraordinary frequency, cutting or coagulating tissue in the process. Kreskin would be impressed.\nMany people who have had surgery are familiar with Skin Staplers, an alternative to skin stitches. In ancient Egypt doctors would use the pincers on an insect to close wounds - for real! However another type of stapler is the surgical stapler. This is hard to explain, but it is a device which uses several rows of staples and a blade to both divide and join structures, depending upon how it is used. These are used to cut bowel and to join segments of bowel together, and for other uses, such as in obesity surgery.\nNo, this is not the device that turned Bruce Banner into the Hulk. In some types of surgery, notably breast cancer surgery, a radiation-detecting probe is used to find the extent of the spread of cancer. Let me explain. Prior to surgery, the patient is injected with technetium sulfur colloid, a specially designed radioisotope designed to adhere to cancer cells in the lymphatic system. A pre-operative scan shows lymph nodes which have captured the material. Then during surgery, the surgeon moves the probe over the patient's axilla (armpit) and monitors the radiation level detected. A higher number indicates a large take-up of the cancer-adhering material, and that lymph node is removed. They keep at this until the radiation level decreases. The last lymph node detected that is removed indicates the extent of cancer spread, and prevents the need, in some patients, for a complete lymph node dissection at the time of breast cancer lumpectomy. A similar technique uses a blue dye in the same manner. This is about as close to Dr Crusher's medical tricorder as you can get.\nSome years ago I helped produce a monthly course on this procedure. We had two OR's wired up with remote control pan-tilt cameras, wireless mics and a video conferencing touch screen control panel, connected by fiber to a conference room in another building. I would sit in the control room, operating the cameras and switching sources (and sometimes recording the non-synchronized switched feed to DVCPRO), while my colleague in the OR would manually move the camera booms, wire up the surgeon for sound, and communicate with me via wireless land-line telephone headsets. We did this two days a month for 6 months in a row at a hospital in Tampa. Fun stuff. Lots of troubleshooting.\nLet's say a patient has metastatic cancer. This means cancer originated in another organ, but cancer that spreads tends to go to specific organs, such as the liver. If a patient has tumors inside the liver, detectable using ultrasound, you have limited choices - remove a portion of the liver, or destroy the tumor from the inside. There exists a metal probe, inserted into the tumor guided by ultrasound. Once in place, 5 thin metal tines are extended out to the edges of the tumor. Then an RF signal at a certain frequency is fed into these tines, to destroy the tissue surrounding the tumor, thus cutting it off from its blood supply, and saving the patient from a major operation.\nPatients having surgery in the brain or sinuses often have a mass or other offending material that needs to be removed. In the case of a mass inside the brain, you can't go removing large pieces of brain. In the case of the sinus, surgeons use a video endoscope either up the nose or through the room of the mouth along with suction and cutting devices to remove mass quantities of goobers. In either case, how do surgeons know where they are going?\nA system of radio frequency receivers is placed near the patient's head, while a transmitter is attached to the tip of the endoscope. By triangulating the position in X-Y-Z space, and synchronizing this 3D position with a 3D reconstruction of the brain or sinus created by a CAT Scan machine, the surgeon gets a real-time 3D roadmap of the surgical field. Motion capture systems work on a similar concept.\nThinking on One's Feet\nTroubleshooting your own video system is pretty straightforward. Troubleshooting someone else's system can be a problem. In an OR, the cables are often hidden in conduits, the ceiling or are simply not labeled.\nThinking on your feet can also relate to finding yourself in unexpected circumstances, such as, oh I don't know, being approached by security guards while shooting the exterior of a hospital - hypothetically, or so I have heard :)\nMany of the thinking on your feet experiences seem brilliant at the time, but they are not memorable. You do what you gotta do to get the job done.\nTruth be told, I used to carry a Swiss Army knife and a roll of duct tape in my leather jacket at all times. Even on airplanes pre-2001. Now most of my multi-tools are property of TSA, but a roll of gaffer's tape still has 1001 uses, but that is a whole blog post of its own.\nAs always, thanks for reading.","Environmental Surface Asepsis: Principles, Applications, and Issues\nJohn A. Molinari, PhD\nChemical disinfectants serve a very useful purpose in infection control, because many operatory surfaces become routinely coated with saliva, blood, exudate, and other debris, and these surfaces require cleaning with appropriate disinfection when it is not feasible to use disposable covers. Over the years, a number of formulations and technologies have become available, and the area of environmental asepsis continues to be emphasized in Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and American Dental Association (ADA) infection control recommendations.1-7\nDental health care workers (DHCW) are faced with many product choices, and unfortunately they sometimes come upon information that can be confusing, thereby making purchasing decisions difficult. Despite extensive literature on this subject, many of the common questions asked by clinicians and their clinical personnel center around what type and/or brand of disinfectant or disposable cover to purchase. In an effort to address representative concerns, the following discussion will use a question-and-answer format to review, among other issues, basic principles of environmental asepsis, classification and regulation of commercially available products, and product use and misuse.\nQuestion No. 1\nWhere do environmental surfaces and disinfection fit into the classification scheme for contaminated items?\nA standard system of classification for chemical sterilants and disinfectants was originally proposed by Spaulding in 1972,8 with a subsequent updated modification in 1991.9 Patient care items and equipment are classified into one of three categories: critical, semicritical, and noncritical, as presented in Table 1.7 Environmental surfaces are included in the noncritical item category and are further subdivided as either housekeeping or clinical-contact surfaces (Table 2) according to the most recent modification of the Spaulding system for classification of disinfectants.10 Each category requires different levels of infection control based on: (1) potential for patient contact; (2) frequency of hand contact; and (3) potential contamination of the surface with body substances or pathogens.\nIn addition, classes for chemical germicide use are related to their sterilization or disinfection capabilities.7 Classes here include the efficacy against vegetative bacteria, tubercle bacilli, fungal spores, lipid and nonlipid containing viruses, and bacterial endospores.\nQuestion No. 2\nWhy does the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) require the destruction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (ie, a tuberculocidal claim) as the benchmark for intermediate-level disinfectants?\nM tuberculosis is a highly resistant, vegetative, acid-fast bacillus that is used as the resistance standard for disinfectants because of its innate resistance to chemical germicides. It is therefore used as a “marker” bacterium, and not because of any risk of contracting tuberculosis from a contaminated counter top or light handle. Killing M tuberculosis also destroys other pathogens of occupational significance, including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex viruses, influenza viruses, and Staphylococcus aureus.\nQuestion No. 3\nAre there criteria for choosing and appropriately using a surface disinfectant product?\nThe basic premise to remember is the following phrase: “It’s not necessarily what product you use but how you are using it.” This statement should be combined with the fundamental infection control axiom: clean first. The efficacy of products under consideration should also be compared with published criteria for an ideal agent (Table 3).11 It does not take very long to realize that none of the available products meet all of the criteria. While there is no single best disinfectant, a number of sprays, foams, and wipes have received EPA registration as hospital-level, tuberculocidal disinfectants. The choice often comes down to whether individuals in a practice are going to use a product according to prescribed label directions. Basic concepts like cleaning requirements must be followed to maximize disinfectant efficacy.\nQuestion No. 4\nWhat are some of the most common misuses of products used for environmental surface asepsis?\nThere could probably be a lengthy debate on this topic no matter what group of people were asked in a forum. There is not enough space here to discuss all of the possibilities, so the author will present only a few of the most frequent disinfectant misuses he has come across.\n- Forgetting that effective surface disinfection requires initial cleaning of contaminated surfaces to remove the bioburden. The first step in a “spray-wipe-spray” procedure for liquids and a “wipe-discard-wipe” procedure when using disposable wipes is crucial. Cleaning is the removal of visible soil and organic debris, which results in a reduction of the number of microorganisms and removal of organic matter. Cleaning removes the overwhelming majority of biological debris that contains potential pathogens.\n- Excessive aerosolization of sprays causing respiratory, ocular, allergic, and/or dermal irritation problems.\n- Overextending the application area for disposable disinfectant wipes. Most manufacturers of this type of product state on the labels to use multiple wipes to keep treated surfaces wet for the required period. Unfortunately, some personnel may use one or two wipes over a large surface area not realizing that the antimicrobial agent in the wipe is no longer active or in sufficient concentration. This can result in merely spreading biodebris to other surfaces.\nAdherence to a few basic principles and guidelines can assist in the selection and safe use of chemical disinfectants. These include: (1) the product must display an EPA number on its label; (2) the product must be used in strict compliance with printed instructions on the label; and (3) for surface disinfectants to be used on contaminated clinical contact surfaces, the product should state on the label that it is tuberculocidal. These guidelines remain applicable even though these were formulated before the availability of many of the current products.\n1.

{"question":"What is the relationship between potential workplace hazards identification and their control measures in both occupational safety guidelines and pregnancy-specific workplace protection protocols?","answer":"In general workplace safety, hazards are identified through Job Hazard Analysis by examining the relationship between workers, tasks, tools, and work environment, with control measures including proper PPE and written instructions for complex jobs. For pregnancy-specific protection, the approach is more comprehensive, considering exposure routes like inhalation, skin absorption, and ingestion, with additional control measures such as proper ventilation, specific PPE that may need adjustment during pregnancy, and careful attention to chemical exposure limits. Both systems emphasize the importance of proper safety procedures, but pregnancy-specific protocols require additional consideration since workplace safety measures were primarily designed for non-pregnant adults.","context":["By Ginger Nichols, Licensed Certified Genetic Counselor at MotherToBaby Connecticut\nThe New Year often brings thoughts of finding a new job. Even those happy in their current occupations often use the New Year to jump start career advancements. If you are thinking about a pregnancy, or you are already pregnant or breastfeeding, chances are you have also started to think more about potential exposures that might be of concern.\nAs a prenatal genetic counselor, I have noticed a common trend among working women. Many women do not worry very much about potential work hazards when first starting their careers. However, once they start to plan a pregnancy or find out that they are pregnant, many women call to ask about job safety. With a new life is on their minds, many women start to view their environment more critically.\nFor those of you planning a pregnancy, now is a great time to ask your questions about workplace safety with your healthcare providers or to contact a MotherToBaby specialist. Researching possible occupational exposures prior to pregnancy can allow time to decide if extra safety measures should be considered. Don’t forget to think about occupational exposures that your partner might be facing.\nOccupational hazards can include:\n- anesthetic gases,\n- ionizing radiation,\n- loud noise,\n- extreme heat or extreme cold,\n- strenuous physical exertion,\n- repetitive movements,\n- whole body vibration,\n- infectious agents (viruses, diseases),\n- emotional stress and\n- changing shift rotations.\nIn general, exposures can happen through: inhaling substances (e.g., breathing a gas, powder, dust or vapor into your lungs), absorption through skin, or ingestion (i.e., eating or drinking).\nSometimes, workers carry hazardous substances (dust, powder, chemicals, metal flakes) home on their shoes or clothing. This is one of the reasons that it is also important talk to your partner or other adults living in your home about their workplace.\nWhile the list of potential hazards looks long, we should remember that just because we work around a potential hazard, it does not mean that we are actually exposed to the hazard. More importantly, employment has generally been considered beneficial for maternal health and birth outcomes. This is due to the financial and social benefits of working, and some call it the “healthy worker effect”. Most of the health problems that have been associated with workplace exposures do not affect our ability to get pregnant or to carry a healthy pregnancy to term.\nThe United States Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires employers (your bosses) to make the workplace safe for their workers. But, workplace safety measures were mainly created with adults (men and non-pregnant women) in mind; not a developing baby. In addition, workplace hazards that might affect a pregnancy are difficult to research. Therefore, your healthcare providers might not always know how a true exposure could affect a pregnancy. However, by following proper safety procedures, workplace exposures will likely be kept below levels that would affect your health or a pregnancy.\nWhat should I be ready to discuss if I am worried about possible exposures at my workplace?\n- Employer/Job title\n- How long you’ve been working there\n- Description of job tasks, during and prior to pregnancy\n- Exposures that you are worried about\n- Personal protective equipment used (such as gloves, gowns, masks, or eyewear)\n- Ventilation at the work site (e.g., are there Hoods? Air Handlers? Fans? Windows that can open?)\n- Eating or drinking at the work site (e.g., do you store your food in an area that is designated only for that purpose?)\n- Any health symptoms in you or coworkers\n- Any reports available, such as blood lead levels, air quality reports, or water report.\n- Sometimes an industrial hygienist will come to a work site to visually look at the work place or to take test samples (air, water, surfaces) for contamination.\n- For those who work around chemicals, they may ask about Safety Data Sheets (more on these below).\n- Other jobs/hobbies during pregnancy\nWhat are Safety Data Sheets?\nThe best way to find out what chemicals are in the product(s) you use at work, or products that are used around you, is to get a copy of the Safety Data Sheets (SDS) (previously called Material Safety Data Sheets, or MSDS). SDS are prepared by chemical manufacturers and outline information on the product. Your workplace is required to have the SDS readily available to workers for all hazardous chemicals used at a worksite. Most SDS / MSDS can also be downloaded from the internet.\nAlong with listing hazardous ingredients, the SDS will talk about how to handle and store the product. The sheet should also talk about any specific recommendations for PPE and how to clean a spill or how to apply immediate first aid in case of accidental exposure.\nSometimes, a hazardous ingredient may be listed as “trade secret” or “proprietary formulation”. One can try to learn more about the chemicals in the proprietary formulation by contacting the manufacturer at the address or telephone number listed on the SDS. If a product contains no hazardous ingredients, it will be listed as such.\nAlong with a list of ingredients considered hazardous, the SDS may also discuss allowable levels of exposure. You may have heard of these limits by the terms: the Threshold Limit Value (TLV) or Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL). TLVs and PELs are limits for the maximum exposure allowed in the workplace. Industrial hygienists can perform workplace assessments to determine if there are exposures that are above allowable levels. These limits are designed to minimize health effects in nonpregnant workers. So it cannot be assumed that exposure levels below the TLV or PEL will be safe for a pregnant woman and/or her fetus.\nWhat kind of safety protection can be used?\nAll work places should provide the proper personal protective equipment (PPE) for handling and working around hazardous situations. Some examples of PPE include gloves, shoes, aprons, gowns, ear protection, masks, and/or ventilation such as hoods and air filters.\n- Use the PPE that is recommended for your job.\n- Use PPE at all times, not just when pregnant.\n- Keep your training on how to properly use the PPE up to date.\n- Make sure hoods, respirators, and other equipment are working properly.\n- If you wear PPE (such as a respirator), be sure it fits correctly. And keep in mind: as a woman’s body changes during pregnancy, PPE may need to be re-fitted.\n- If you wear a respirator, remember that respirators are not a substitute for appropriate permanent exhaust ventilation (such as fume hoods, exhaust ducts and/or exhaust fans). Respirators are designed to be used only for a short period of time.\n- If the right PPE is not currently at your worksite, ask your employer about getting it.\nConsider talking with an occupational health specialist or industrial hygienist who may be able to provide information that is specific to your workplace.\nHow can I learn more about ways to reduce my exposure to potential hazards in my workplace?\nMotherToBaby has a fact sheet that discusses general tips on working safely called Reproductive Hazards of the Workplace. There are some other fact sheets on specific occupational exposures, such as infectious diseases, lead, paint, and pesticides. There are also specific workplace sheets that look at working in a veterinary setting, in a nail salon, and for those who work with x-ray machines. Our entire library of fact sheets can be accessed by visiting https://mtborgdev.wpengine.com/fact-sheets-parent/.\nYou can also contact an industrial hygienist or occupational medicine specialist. Try looking for them at a local medical university or through the American Industrial Hygiene Association: https://www.aiha.org/about-ih/Pages/Find-an-Industrial-Hygienist.aspx. Industrial hygienists should be able to provide an independent assessment on ways to improve the safety of your job, if needed, and may be able to give advice on how to work with employers in implementing these changes. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has a free service called Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE), which can provide you or your employer advice about health hazards that might be in your workplace and can offer tips on how to make your workplace safer. To learn more, visit the NIOSH website at: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hhe/.\nHappy New Year, New Job, and New Baby.\nGinger Nichols is a licensed certified genetic counselor based in Farmington, Connecticut.

Presented by Bill Jividan, CSP.\"— Presentation transcript:\nWhat is a JHA and How Do I Use It? Presented by Bill Jividan, CSP\nPurpose To inform safety proponents about a very useful tool that can be used to indentify hazards and to have a plan on how to control or eliminate hazards.\nWhat is a hazard? A hazard is the potential for harm. In practical terms, a hazard often is associated with a condition or activity that, if left uncontrolled, can result in an injury or illness.\nJHA Definition OSHA defines a Job Hazard Analysis as: a technique that focuses on job tasks as a way to identify hazards before they occur. It focuses on the relationship between the worker, the task, the tools, and the work environment. A JHA is on component of the larger commitment of a safety and health management system.\nWhats the difference between JHA and JSAs? A Job Hazard Analysis should be the preliminary step to evaluating hazards associated with any job category or function. The JHA assigns risk while the JSA identifies specific hazards and provides tools to remediate the hazards.\nContinued Performing a JHA prior to a JSA is critical because it allows a company to prioritize the implementation of its workplace safety efforts.\nWhy is a JHA important? One of the best ways to determine and establish proper work procedures is to conduct a JHA. A JHA is one component of the larger commitment of a safety and health management system\nWhat value does a JHA have? JHAs help identify, eliminate and prevent hazards in the workplace. This will likely result in fewer worker injuries and illnesses, safer, more effective work methods and reduced workers compensation costs and increased worker productivity.\nWhat jobs do I use JHA on? Jobs with the highest injury or illness rates. Jobs with the potential to cause severe or disabling injuries or illness, even if there is no history of previous accidents. Jobs in which one simple human error could lead to a severe accident or injury. Jobs that are new to your operation or have undergone changes in processes and procedures. Jobs complex enough to require written instructions.\nOK, Where do I begin? Involve your employees Review your accident history Conduct a preliminary job review List, rank, and set priorities for hazardous jobs. Outline the steps or tasks.\nHow do I identify workplace hazards? What can go wrong? What are the consequences? How could it happen? What are other contributing factors? How likely is it that the hazard will occur?\nGrinding Iron Castings: Job Steps Step 1. Reach into metal box to right of machine, grasp casting, and carry to wheel. Step 2. Push casting against wheel to grind off burr. Step 3. Place finished casting in box to left of machine.\nExample Job Hazard Analysis Form Job Location: Metal ShopAnalyst: Joe Safety Date: Task Description: Worker reaches into metal box to the right of the machine, grasps a 15 pound casting and carries it to grinding wheel. Worker grinds 20 to 30 castings per hour. Hazard Description: Picking up a casting, the employee could drop it onto his foot. The casting's weight and height could seriously injure the worker's foot or toes. Hazard Controls: 1. Remove castings from the box and place them on a table next to the grinder. 2. Wear steel-toe shoes with arch protection. 3. Change protective gloves that allow a better grip. 4. Use a device to pick up castings.\nJob Location: Metal Shop Analyst: Joe Safety Date: Task Description: Worker reaches into metal box to the right of the machine, grasps a 15 pound casting and carries it to grinding wheel. Worker grinds 20 to 30 castings per hour. Hazard Description: Castings have sharp burrs and edges that can cause severe lacerations. Hazard Controls: 1. Use a device such as a clamp to pick up castings. 2. Wear cut-resistant gloves that allow a good grip and fit tightly to minimize the chance that they will get caught in grinding wheel.\nJob Location: Metal ShopAnalyst: Joe SafetyDate: Task Description: Worker reaches into metal box to the right of the machine, grasps a 15 pound casting and carries it to grinding wheel. Worker grinds 20 to 30 castings per hour. Hazard Description: Reaching, twisting, and lifting 15 pound castings from the floor could result in a muscle strain to the lower back. Hazard Controls: 1. Move castings from the ground and place them closer to the work zone to minimize lifting. Ideally, place them at waist height or on an adjustable platform or pallet. 2. Train workers not to twist while lifting and reconfigure work stations to minimize twisting during lifts. Repeat similar forms for each job step.\nSample Job hazard Analysis Form Job Title:Job Location:Analyst:Date: Task #Task Description: Hazard Type:Hazard Description: Consequence:Hazard Controls: Rational or Comment:\nQuestions?

Both seem to have some cultural significance!","answer":"In Eight Treasures Rice Pudding, the number eight is considered lucky in Chinese culture because it sounds like the word for 'rich' (發) in Chinese. While traditionally made with eight different toppings of dried fruits and sweets, the exact number can vary based on preference.

Avoid using fibrous or bitter carrots.\nGrate Carrots Finely: Grate the carrots finely to ensure they cook evenly and become soft without any crunchy bits.\nUse Full-Fat Milk: Full-fat milk will yield a creamier and richer halwa.\nStir Frequently: Stir the halwa frequently to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan and to ensure even cooking.\nUse a Heavy-Bottomed Pan: A heavy-bottomed pan or kadai helps in even cooking and prevents burning.\nRoast Nuts in Ghee: Roasting the nuts in ghee before adding them to the halwa enhances their flavor and aroma.\nSaffron Infusion: If using saffron, soak a few strands in a tablespoon of warm milk and add it to the halwa for a beautiful color and subtle flavor.\nAdjust Sugar to Taste: The sweetness of Gajar ka Halwa (Carrot Pudding) is adjustable. Add sugar gradually and taste as you go to achieve your desired level of sweetness.\nAdd Cardamom for Flavor: Cardamom powder adds a wonderful aromatic touch. You can also use a pinch of nutmeg or a few drops of rose water for variation.\nPatience is Key: The key to a delicious Gajar ka Halwa (Carrot Pudding) is patience. Allow the carrots to cook and absorb the milk and flavors slowly for the best results.\nGarnish Creatively: Get creative with your garnishes. In addition to raisins and nuts, you can add edible silver leaf (varak) or grated khoya for a traditional touch.\nReheating: Gajar ka Halwa tastes even better the next day. You can reheat it in a pan or microwave with a little milk to restore its creamy consistency.\nServe Warm or Cold: Gajar ka Halwa can be served warm, at room temperature, or chilled, depending on your preference.\nStorage: Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It can be kept for a few days.\nCommon Mistakes to Avoid When Making Gajar ka Halwa\nUsing the Wrong Carrots: Using the wrong type of carrots, like fibrous or less sweet varieties, can result in a less flavorful halwa. Always choose sweet and fresh carrots.\nInadequate Grating: Grating the carrots too thickly can lead to uneven cooking and a less smooth texture. Grate them finely for the best results.\nInsufficient Cooking: Failing to cook the carrots and milk mixture long enough can result in a raw taste and crunchy texture. Be patient and allow the mixture to cook down and thicken properly.\nSkipping Roasting Nuts: Roasting nuts in ghee is essential to enhance their flavor and aroma. Skipping this step can make the halwa less aromatic.\nNot Stirring Often: Frequent stirring is crucial to prevent the halwa from sticking to the bottom of the pan and burning. Neglecting this can lead to burnt flavors and a messy cleanup.\nOverloading with Sugar: Adding too much sugar at once can make the halwa excessively sweet. Add sugar gradually, tasting as you go, to reach the desired level of sweetness.\nUsing Low-Fat Milk: Gajar ka Halwa is at its best when made with full-fat milk. Using low-fat milk can result in a less creamy and rich texture.\nNot Adjusting Spices: Spice adjustments are key to achieving the right flavor balance. Not adding enough cardamom or using too much can affect the overall taste.\nImproper Garnishing: Garnishing plays a vital role in the appearance and flavor of the halwa.\nRushing the Process: Gajar ka Halwa requires patience. Rushing the cooking process can lead to undercooked carrots, a less creamy texture, and insufficient flavor infusion.\nNot Reheating Properly: If reheating, do so gently in a pan or microwave with a little milk to restore the creamy consistency. Reheating without milk can make it dry.\nHere’s a general approximation for a 100-gram serving of homemade Gajar ka Halwa (Carrot Pudding)\n- Calories: Approximately 150-200 calories.\n- Fat: Around 6-10 grams of fat, primarily from ghee and nuts.\n- Carbohydrates: Approximately 20-25 grams of carbohydrates, primarily from carrots and sugar.\n- Protein: About 2-3 grams of protein.\n- Sugar: Approximately 10-15 grams of sugar, largely from the added sugar and natural sugars in carrots.\n- Fiber: Minimal dietary fiber content.\nGajar ka Halwa (Carrot Pudding) is a delicious but indulgent dessert, so it’s best enjoyed in moderation.

{"question":"How do container growing considerations differ between potatoes and fall vegetables in terms of care requirements and yield expectations?","answer":"When growing in containers, potatoes require more attention and care and produce smaller yields compared to growing in raised garden beds. Fall vegetables like spinach, herbs, and salad plants can be successfully grown in containers, window boxes, and hanging baskets without significant yield reduction. Both types of plants can be grown in containers, but potatoes are notably more demanding and less productive in contained spaces.","context":["Now that the leaves are turning and the days are growing shorter, if you’re tempted to pack away your gardening gloves…don’t!\nAt the Regenstein Fruit & Vegetable Garden, we’re as busy as ever. Our cool-weather crops include brussels sprouts, spinach, and toscano kale. Fall is a great time to grow vegetables—insects die off, weeds wither, and moisture is plentiful. If you don’t have much space, remember that you can grow vegetables in containers, window boxes, and hanging baskets.\nDon’t say good-bye to your summer garden yet\n- Document the good, the bad, and the ugly. Walk around your garden making notes, drawing pictures, and taking photographs; document challenges and successes, problems, tasks, and ideas for next year. Make a list of the plants that worked and should be planted again.\n- Bring in twigs, nuts, berries, and seedheads to dry for fall decorations or winter wreath making. Gather the stems into bunches, and secure them with a rubber band. Hang the bunches for several weeks to dry in a warm spot (but out of direct sun).\n- Harvest herbs to dry, freeze, or use fresh.\n- Lift tender perennial herb plants like rosemary and lavender to replant in pots. Annual basil lasts for several additional weeks in a sunny kitchen window.\nOther prep work\n- Remove debris such as leaves, clippings, and bits of fruits and vegetables. Garden sanitation is important to remove the overwintering habitat for many insects. Cucumber beetle and squash bugs overwinter on leaf litter and create problems in the spring.\n- Perform bed prep and broad forking—break up densely packed soil now to avoid working heavy soils in the spring (when you do so, you further compact the soil and destroy soil structure). Fall prep ensures that the bed will be ready for early peas around St. Patrick’s Day.\n- Add organic matter to feed the soil rather than using fertilizers to feed the plant.\n- Add mulch, thumb deep, to help maintain soil temperature and moisture.\n- Everbearing raspberry bushes produce their fall crop on the top half of the canes.

After all, potatoes are one of the most versatile ingredients, growing your own is a must!\nEarly varieties are generally ready for harvest after 90 days, but late varieties might take upwards of 110 days. Potatoes are root vegetables that are easy to plant, and they grow abundantly. There are over one hundred varieties of potatoes, with different shapes, sizes, colors, and also growth times.\nKeep reading to know how long different kinds of potatoes take to grow and how to give your growing potatoes the best conditions.\nHow Long To Grow Potatoes Before Harvesting?\nThe average time to grow potatoes before harvesting is two to four months; this time period is based on a wide variety of potatoes. The specific growth period for your potatoes heavily depends on the type of potato you are growing.\nWhen you are growing potatoes, the maturation time is an extremely important variable. Different potato varieties have their own Days To Maturity (DTM). It is recommended that you know what your specific potato type’s DTM is so you can be best prepared. The DTM begins from the day you plant the potatoes.\nThe varieties of potatoes can be placed into three categories: early varieties, mid-season varieties, and late varieties. See below for the average growth time range for each of the three varieties.\n|Early varieties||These varieties of potatoes take less than 90 days to mature. These potatoes are a good fit for almost any garden.||Irish Cobbler, Mountain Rose, Norland, Caribe, King Harry|\n|Mid-season varieties||These varieties of potatoes take around 100 days to mature.||Viking, Red Pontiac, Yukon Gold, Red LaSoda|\n|Late varieties||These varieties of potatoes take 110 or more days to mature. The potatoes in this category tend to grow heavy tubers, which store excellently.||Elba, Kennebec, Butte|\nMoreover, the new potatoes are ready to be harvested in 60 days or ten weeks. “New potatoes” are the potatoes that are harvested earlier than usual to have smaller-sized and more tender potatoes.\nIf you’re having trouble finding the variety you want locally, Johnny’s Selected Seeds is a great online source for acquiring quality seed potatoes.\nOther Factors That Affect Potato Growth Periods\nNow we know that planted potatoes need the following to reach their best growth potential.\n- Plenty of sunlight\n- Loose, fertile soil\n- An inch of water weekly\nOther factors also play a role in how long it takes for you to grow your potatoes:\n|Where you are planting your potatoes||Potatoes can be planted and grown in pots, containers, or even potato-specific “grow bags”; all of these need more attention and care and produce smaller yields. A raised bed in the garden is easier and more efficient for growing a large harvest of potatoes.|\n|Where you buy your seed potatoes||The seed potatoes are cut-up pieces of whole potato tubers that have sprouted and potatoes that can sprout. You must buy your seed potatoes from a farm store or a catalog, as those can be planted and grown. The potatoes in grocery stores are usually treated to not grow sprouts. Ensure you have healthy seed potatoes to begin with.|\n|What kind of tubers you choose to plant||You can work with tubers that have sprouted on them already. You can also pre-sprout the potato yourself by placing them on your kitchen counters and wait for them to sprout. The pre-sprouted potatoes take less time to harvest than non-sprouted potatoes.|\n|Positioning of seed potatoes in the soil||You must plant the seed potatoes eight to nine inches deep under fertile soil. Each potato piece should be at least 12 inches apart from each other from all sides. These measurements are important as it affects how fast and efficient the potatoes are in taking in nutrients and growing in time.|\n|Fertilizer||The amount and quality of fertilizer you use can also affect the potatoes’ harvest time. Which fertilizer to use depends on your potato variety type.|\nHow Late Can You Plant Potatoes?\nGenerally, you can plant potatoes early in the gardening season. You can plant them as early as you see that the frost is out of the soil. Frost’s action is where the soil water is frozen or thawed; either of these is not good for growing potatoes. If you don’t want any risk with the soil frost, however, you can plant your potatoes one or two weeks after the last spring frost.\nYou might want to plant potatoes later to avoid any soil frost, or maybe you want to plant potatoes later on for your own personal reasons. Whichever the reason, it is good to know how late you can plant your potatoes.\nThere is no “one rule” for how late you can plant your potatoes because it depends on multiple factors:\n|Ideal weather temperature||Potatoes grow best when the weather temperature is around 45°F (or 7 to 8 °C). Cooler weather is preferable for potatoes.|\n|Ideal soil temperature||The best soil temperature is 60°F to 70°F (or 16°C to 21°C). The minimum soil temperature to grow potatoes in is 50°F (or 10°C).|\n|Ideal soil quality||You want soil that is loose and crumbly, but not dried out. Soil that is too dry will not deliver water and nutrients properly to the planted potatoes. Soil that is too wet becomes sticky and is difficult to work with. Additionally, too much moisture will rot your planted potatoes.|\n|Days to Maturity (DTM)||You must know your potato type’s DTM. You can figure out how long the ideal weather and temperatures will last and compare that with the DTM. The lower the DTM is, the later you can plant your potatoes. The higher the DTM is, the earlier you must plant your potatoes.|\n|Water||The general rule of thumb for growing potatoes is giving them an inch of water weekly. Be aware of heavy rain seasons. You want to plant and harvest before too much water reaches your potatoes.|\nOverall, the soil’s condition, not necessarily the date and time, is in charge of the potato’s optimal growth and harvest time. You need to figure out how the season and the daily weather will affect the soil’s quality and determine how late you can plant your potatoes while keeping the DTM in mind.\nKeep in mind that if the weather gets too hot, the potatoes will not be in the best condition when it is harvest time. This is why it is better to avoid planting too late; the potatoes will begin to grow nicely, but as the summer heat and humidity rises, the affected soil will ruin your potato harvest.\nHere is a very general potato planting month schedule based on the area where you live:\n|Northern regions||Potatoes can usually be planted in early April and mid-April.|\n|Center regions||Potatoes can usually be planted in winter, from September to February.|\n|Southern regions||Potatoes can usually be planted in January and February.|\nOverall, it can take from less than 60 days to more than 100 days. Furthermore, loose and crumbly soil in a cooler temperature is what potatoes love to grow in.\nNow you should know how long it takes to grow potatoes before their harvest time. There is no one size fits all answer. This is because there are plenty of different kinds of potatoes, each with its growth period. Furthermore, many other factors affect the growth and harvest period too.\nSubscribe To My Newsletter\nGet The Latest Updates, News, and Special Offers from Redemption Permaculture!\nAs An Added Gift For Subscribing Receive A Free PDF Download Of My Book: From Home To Small Town Homestead – Over 180 pages"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5009e040-239b-4db2-b64c-071cc448172e>","<urn:uuid:94673676-f707-4101-b819-e0979d566e8e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Compare the human rights arguments used to advocate for both same-sex marriage and abortion access in Northern Ireland","answer":"For both issues, advocates emphasized that Northern Irish citizens were being denied basic human rights available elsewhere in the UK. On abortion, the UN Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women Committee condemned Northern Ireland's law as a 'grave violation of rights.' Similarly, Amnesty International argued that states cannot discriminate regarding the right to marry based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and that marriage should be available to same-sex couples in Northern Ireland just as in the rest of the UK. Both reforms were framed as human rights matters that should not be subject to devolved government control, with advocates emphasizing that 'human rights are not a devolved issue.' The lack of these rights was seen as making Northern Irish citizens 'second-class citizens within the UK.'","context":["Marie-Claire Bradley, a Bristol-based medical student from Northern Ireland, discusses the ongoing issue of abortion in response to debate heard at the BMA’s Annual Representative Meeting 2019, subsequent court cases and imminent legislative change.\nIn June this year, I listened to discussion on the above motion at BMA ARM 2019 in Belfast for the pictured motion which clarifies and sets out a framework for the implementation of BMA’s 2016 policy that abortion should be treated in line with other forms of healthcare and decriminalized across UK and Northern Ireland and policy from 1984, 1985 and 2003 which specifically supports the reform of law in Northern Ireland. The air hung thick, humidity emanating from hot palms and from under stiff collared necks.\nSince then, a number of momentous legal shifts towards the fulfilment of this motion have been achieved. In July, a majority of MPs backed the bill brought by MP for Walthamstow, Stella Creasy to repeal Sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 – which make abortion a criminal offence in Northern Ireland. As a result, the law governing abortion in Northern Ireland, the Offences Against the Person Act 186, is due to change three days from the time of writing (on 21st October), if the devolved assembly does not re-convene before then. Interim rules currently govern the care of those seeking abortions in the meantime – these rules allow doctors to finally at least allude to the possibility of treatment in England without fear of legal reprisal. (1)\nOn 3rd October 2019, Sarah Ewart, (who was denied abortion despite scans definitively showing that the foetus was in viable) brought her case before the High Court in Belfast. The court considered the archaic wording of the 1861 Act – a near-blanket ban on abortion, except in cases where continuing the pregnancy would cause ‘physical and mental wreak’, as highlighted by Dr Kerr- speaker for the motion and member of Medical Students for Choice- at ARM. The court ruled that such a ban breaches the UK’s human rights commitments.\nAbortion will remain a criminal offence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, although, Northern Ireland is the only place where women and pregnant people face lifetime imprisonment for terminating a pregnancy, even in cases of rape, incest and foetal abnormality, and doctors and medical professionals also face life imprisonment for assisting. The potential for such a win for human rights in Northern Ireland is, joyously, a result of local political stalemate and governmental disregard for the region.\nThis departure from current archaic rules to better represent the will and the needs of Northern Irish people is particularly welcome in a time of such paralysing political uncertainty – The writer notes that the Act came into force 20 years before it was legally possible for women to own property. (2) At ARM in Belfast, Dr Kerr explained the influence that the criminalisation of abortion has had upon medical education – while the procedure affects 1 in 3 women and pregnant people, education on the subject across the UK is poor and medical students in Northern Ireland receive “little to no” training in this regard. Dr Kerr commented that the unavailability of the procedure leads to “forced pregnancy” which is “an act of violence and assault” and indeed, as Dr John Chisholm, Ethics Committee Chair, later mentioned, the UN Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women Committee condemned the law on abortion in Northern Ireland as a “grave violation of rights under the Convention”. Dr Chisholm, also echoed the words of the proposer of the motion, Dr Anthony Lempert and Dr Noel Sharkey, speaking for the motion, in stipulating, “human rights are not a devolved issue”.\nThere was a common preoccupation amongst speakers against the motion who feared that any such legislative overreach may impact upon the peace in Northern Ireland:-\nSpeaking against, Dr Dominic Whitehouse opened with the phrase, “peace is precious and fragile” and subsequently brought to the attention of ARM; the lack of an active assembly at Stormont for two years, the murder of “female journalist reporting on riots in Creggan area of Derry” and “letter bombs being delivered by dissident republicans to London airports and Waterloo station” as evidence that peace in Northern Ireland is once again dwindling and implying that the enactment of the legislative changes laid out in the motion would amount to a return to “colonial rule” and thereby threaten the peace.\nThe unnamed “female journalist” to whom Dr Whitehouse refers is Lyra McKee, her tragic and untimely death highlighted the pertinence of her investigative work unpicking the stories of young people left behind by the Peace Process. Lyra McKee actively campaigned for LGBTQ+ rights, was pro-choice and in favour of the decriminalisation of abortion.\nDr Rachael Pickering, also speaking against the motion, emphasised that being “from Shropshire” meant that the legislative change suggested was “imperialist”. Dr Pickering told ARM that Northern Ireland is “politically conservative”. In fact, the writer notes that the fifth Northern Ireland Peace Monitoring Report, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Trust, lists the necessity of “reform of abortion law and equal marriage” alongside the potential impact of Brexit as issues that need to be solved in order to further secure peace in Northern Ireland, citing evidence from the Northern Ireland Life and Times survey and opinion polls which show that “the majority of the population in NI support liberalizing the law on these issues”. The odd notion that the backdrop of political instability in Northern Ireland which was originally caused by Direct Rule should be an excuse for further denial of human rights in Northern Ireland is somewhat absurd.\nDr Pickering, an English Representative, was correct in saying that English Representatives probably shouldn’t dictate the consensus of Northern Irish people. The fifth Northern Ireland Peace Monitoring Report notes that the views of socially conservative political parties in Northern Ireland “are at odds with” the view of Northern Irish people. (3) Indeed, as Dr Lempert notes, 59% of people in Northern Ireland have voted in favour of decriminalisation. The consensus of Northern Irish people is for the motion.\nThe voice of this much needed Northern Irish perspective, came when Dr Noel Sharkey spoke in favour for the motion stressing the need for legislative change to ensure that Northern Irish people have the same human rights as people in the rest of the UK, emphatically stating that, “As a gay man I cannot marry my partner.” He explained that the lack of devolved government was not a reason to stall reform of legislation as the underlying health issues are “becoming more toxic and dangerous” as a result. Closing the debate, he powerfully stated that, the “Criminal framework is not preventative, it simply exports the problem […] it is time to trust women. Human rights is not a devolved issue. Instead of giving women in Northern Ireland air-fares, it is time to give them healthcare.”\nThreatening uncertainty surrounding the border in Ireland casts a heavy shadow over economic well-being and the maintenance of the hard-won peace in the region and the right to choose hangs in the balance until Monday when Secretary of State, Julian Smith, will be forced to legalise abortion and same-sex marriage before 13 January 2020. Smith’s video tweet on 14th October urged the devolved executive to sit and discuss the law on abortion before the 21st October deadline immediately followed sit down talks between the DUP and Cabinet. Accusations ensued from MP Stella Creasy that the right to abortion is being used as a “bargaining chip” by the Government in the scramble to bend the DUP over to accept their Brexit deal. Indeed, the next day a subsequent statement from the DUP called for Stormont to sit once again to “oppose the extreme liberalisation” of the law.\n- Sheldon, S., The Decriminalisation of Abortion: An Argument for Modernisation (Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, Vol. 36, No 2 (2016) pp. 334-365 https://academic.oup.com/ojls/article-pdf/36/2/334/25346004/gqv026.pdf\n- Pt 5.

This means that marriage should be available to same-sex couples in Northern Ireland, just as it is now in England and Wales and will shortly be in Scotland. ... With politicians continuing to block equality, it is now inevitable that same-sex couples in Northern Ireland will take a legal challenge on the basis of inferior treatment with regards to the right to marry and found a family.\" 1\nWebmaster's comment in 2014 [Bias alert]:\nWith three out of three attempts having failed to proceed with marriage equality, it would seem that the courts are the best option now available to the LGBT community. Otherwise, couples will continue to be denied the status, respect, and stability that is associated with marriage. Also, the UK would end up with couples changing status from married to not married just by crossing one of its internal borders.\nWith England, Wales and Scotland having achieved marriage equality, and with all other major English-speaking countries having done the same (except for Australia and parts of the United States) it seems inevitable that Northern Ireland will soon achieve marriage equality perhaps through the legislature or more likely via the judicial path which has proven to be very successful in the U.S.\nWhat does the Northern Ireland public think of same-sex marriage?\nMany public opinion polls have been conducted. They show a gradual rise in the acceptance of same-sex marriage:\n1989: An unidentified poll found that 76% of Northern Ireland adults believed that same-sex relationships were \"always wrong.\" 2\n2012: The Northern Ireland Life & Times (NILT) poll found that only 28% of the public believed that such relationships were wrong. 2 The poll's sample size was 1,200 people. Thus, the margin of error would have been close to ~+mn~2.9% percentage points. That means that, if the same poll had been repeated 20 times, the results would be expected to be between 25 and 31% for 19 times out of the 20 tries.\n2013-JUN-06: The Northern Ireland Life & Times conducted another poll, asking a specific question about same-sex marriage:\n\"Do you think marriages between same-sex couples should or should not be recognized by the law as valid, with the same rights as traditional marriages?\"\nResults were: 57% favored marriage equality; 32% were opposed; 11% were undecided or unresponsive. Northern Ireland by mid-2013 was ahead of the U.S. in terms of acceptance of SSM. As with polls in the U.S.:\n- A larger percentage of women favored SSM than men.\n- A larger percentage of younger adults favored SSM when compared to seniors. This included support from 72% of young adults aged 18 to 24; and 74% of older adults 25 to 34.\nGreatest support came from those who were not religiously affiliated at 73%; Catholics were 65% in favor of equality; Protestants were 44% supportive. 3\n2014-FEB-05 and later: The ISideWith web site conducts polls on the Internet to estimate public opinion. 4 They ran a poll for residents of Northern Ireland asking the question:\n\"Do you support the legalization of same sex¬ marriage?\"\nThe polling opened on 2014-FEB-05 and was still collecting data on 2014-MAY-03. Results on the latter date were 76% in favor of marriage equality and 23% opposed to same-sex marriage. This polling agency filters out the votes coming from outside the country and also filters out duplicate votes. So it has considerably more credibility compared to the next poll.\n2014-APR-29: The Belfast Telegraph conducted a poll of somewhat limited accuracy on their web site. They asked the question: \"Should gay marriage be legalized in Northern Ireland?\"\nResults were: 78% favored marriage equality; 21% were opposed; 2% were undecided. 5 Unfortunately, there is no way to know whether those who vote were a truly random sample of the public. Also, Internet surfers who do not reside in Northern Ireland may have voted. However, their results are reasonably credible because they agree closely with the ISideWith poll.\nAmong those aged 16 to 34, support was 85%! Among all females, support was 77%.\nThere was a noticeable faith-based split: 80% of Catholics and 60% of Protestants supported marriage equality.\nThere were also major differences with different political party affiliation: Support was 83% among the Alliance Party, 80% among Sinn Fein, 76% among SDLP, 62% among UUP and 50% among DUP.7\nJohn O'Doherty, spokesperson for Love Equality -- a pro-LGBT non-profit agency in Northern Ireland, said:\n\"This poll demonstrates that not only is there overwhelming support for marriage equality in Northern Ireland, but that support is only increasing over time.\nIt is clear that the people of Northern Ireland agree with us that marriage equality is one of the defining civil rights issues of our time and that it should immediately be made law.\nThose who continue to prevent marriage equality in Northern Ireland are not going to succeed. All they are doing before its inevitable introduction are merely enacting an injustice against their own citizens and worsening Northern Ireland's already abysmal reputation regarding LGBT rights.\" 6\nThe percentage of persons polled who oppose marriage equality dropped by 5 percentage points to 22%; the percentage who did not have an opinion or who refused to answer increased by 2 percentage points to 8%. That itself is an interesting development because it may demonstrate that a significant percentage of people are in the process of changing their minds and drifting towards support.\n2018-APR: Sky Data poll on same-sex marriage: Sky Data conducted a poll on public support of same-sex marriage. Results were: 76% favored marriage equality; this is an increase of eight percentage points since a poll in 2015, 18% are opposed to same-sex marriage. 6% had no opinion or did not answer. Support for marriage equality in Northern Ireland is significantly greater than in the U.S.\nPatrick Corrigan of Amnesty International and also of the Love Equality campaign said:\n\"We welcome this huge and ever-growing level of support for marriage equality in Northern Ireland. Whatever else people in Northern Ireland may remain divided on, it is clearly not marriage equality. We are calling on the UK Government to recognize this huge public support for change. With no functioning devolution at Stormont, it is now time for the UK Government to legislate to bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK and Ireland and to end discrimination against the LGBT+ community.\"\n2018-OCT: Two Labour backbenchers in the UK Parliament launch bill to legalize same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland:\nNick Duffy, writing for Pink News, said:\n\"The Northern Ireland executive collapsed in January 2017 due to a breakdown in the¬ power-sharing agreement between the ... [Democratic Unionist Party] (DUP) and Sinn F√©in [parties]. The Northern Ireland Assembly and executive have been suspended ever since.\nWith no future agreement in sight, LGBT+ campaigners in Northern Ireland say the onus is on the UK government and the Irish government to secure an equal marriage settlement.\" 10\nWith movement on marriage equality in the Northern Ireland government stalled, two members of the UK Parliament (MPs) -- Stella Creasy and Conor McGinn -- initiated a equal rights amendment. Rather than simply repealed the measure that banned same-sex marriages, the amendment directs the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley to:\n\"... issue guidance [to Northern Ireland government departments specifying] how to exercise¬ their functions in relation to the incompatibility of the human rights of the people of Northern Ireland with [the region‚s laws on marriage and abortion access].\nThe bill was passed by the UK House of Commons by a vote of 207 to 117, a 64% affirmative vote. 102 Conservative MPs, nine DUParty MPs and four Labour MPs¬ rejected the amendment. Half of the MP's did not vote because little notice was given in advance of the vote.\nPatrick Corrigan, the Northern Ireland Programme Director for Amnesty International, said in a statement:\n\"[The UK] Parliament has spoken this evening and the government must listen.\nThe government should now provide proper legislative time to the Private Members‚ Bills sponsored by Diana Johnson and Conor McGinn which are currently working their way through Parliament. Without that support, people in Northern Ireland will continue to live as second-class citizens within the UK.\nWe want to pay tribute to all the MPs from a range of parties across Westminster who backed this move and to [MPs] Stella Creasy and Conor McGinn for their leadership in the Commons.\"\nGrainne Teggart, the Northern Ireland Campaign Manager for Amnesty International, said:\n\"People in Northern Ireland are being denied rights enjoyed by those in other parts of the UK on issues such as marriage equality and access to abortion.\nThis Commons vote is a significant step toward ensuring that people in Northern Ireland can access those rights as equal citizens. It is clear there is a strong cross party constituency of support at Westminster for change.\nWomen in Northern Ireland are suffering under the current legislative regime. That suffering must be brought to an end and it is within the power of the government to do so. It is time for Government to end the inequity citizens here face. Our work will continue until that happens.\" 8,9,10\n2019-JUL-09: Members of the Northern Ireland Parliament vote overwhelmingly in favor of implementing marriage equality during mid 2020-JAN:\nThe MPs voted 383 to 73 in favor of a bill to extend marriage to same-sex couples in Northern Ireland. Seventeen MPs abstained from voting. Those voting against the bill included 64 members of the Conservative party, eight from the Democratic Unionist Party, and one cabinet minister.\nPatrick Corrigan is the Northern Ireland director of Amnesty International and part of the Love Equality coalition. He said:\n\"This is an incredible moment and a huge cause for celebration. Marriage equality in Northern Ireland is finally a reality. ... For more than five years, same-sex couples in the rest of the UK have been able to get married whilst this right has been denied to citizens in Northern Ireland. Now, in just three months‚ time, we could see the first same-sex couples here tying the knot. So many people have been campaigning for this for so long. At points it seemed unachievable, but we never gave up. Today‚s a day for the history books.\" 11\n\"Proud to have supported this amendment which passed with a majority of 310.\nEvery citizen of the UK should be able to marry who they love. The fact that people in Northern Ireland have been unable to has torn at the social fabric of our country.\" 12\nAn unidentified Pink News writer indicated that marriage equality there is not \"a reality\" yet.\" They wrote:\n\"The clause will require secondary legislation, and will only come into force if power-sharing talks fail to restore devolution by October 21.\nShould the Stormont executive become functional by this deadline, the amendment will become void.\" 12\nHowever, there was a change in plans. The British government announced on 2019-SEP-09 that the legislation will come into effect on 2020-JAN-13. Since couples have to wait for 28 days after they file their notice of intention before they can actually marry, this means that the first couples will be able to marry on 2020-FEB-14. Appropriately, this is on St. Valentine's Day!\nPatrick Corrigan, director of Amnesty International for Northern Ireland, said:\n\"We are now working closely with government ministers and officials to ensure that the legislative obligations are met, in time and in full, so that couples here can start to enjoy the same rights as elsewhere in the UK and Ireland. ... We now look forward to the sound of Valentine’s Day wedding bells.\"\nLord Duncan, the Northern Ireland Office parliamentary under secretary of state, said:.\n\"What we have to ensure is that wherever the law mentions ‘husband and wife’ and ‘man and woman’ it has to be corrected to reflect the change. We’re working to identify all areas where legacy language exists. The legislation impacted by this covers pensions, benefits and so on. We want to make sure that on that date in January, we don’t miss something. So we’re working assiduously to ensure that absolute legal certainty is granted, exactly as you would be if you were marrying as a heterosexual couple.\" 13\nThis will make Northern Ireland the last large English speaking country to attain marriage equality.\nHowever, the new law will not guarantee that same-sex couples will be able to obtain a religious marriage. Of all the many Christian denominations in Northern Ireland, only the Scottish Episcopal church, the Quakers, and The United Reformed Church, and All Souls congregation in Belfast of the Presbyterian Church. In addition, the Unitarian church, Liberal Judaism and Humanists in Northern Ireland will marry couples of the same sex. 14\nA Church of Ireland spokesperson said:\n\"The Church of Ireland affirms, according to our Lord’s teaching, that marriage is in its purpose a union permanent and lifelong, for better or worse, till death do them part, of one man with one woman, to the exclusion of all others on either side.\" 14\nThe following information sources were used to prepare and update the above\nmenu.

{"question":"How omega3 and polyphenols help heart - which more important?! plz explain","answer":"Both omega-3 fatty acids and polyphenols contribute to heart health in different ways. Omega-3 fatty acids help balance eicosanoids (the body's superhormones), with studies showing that increased omega-3 consumption resulted in 76% lower incidence of second heart attacks and reduced risk of heart failure by half in study participants. Meanwhile, polyphenols in olive oil directly improve blood cholesterol and arterial function, with research showing they can reduce oxidized LDL levels by 3.2 U/L and increase HDL cholesterol by 1.74 mg/dl (where each 1 mg/dl increase correlates with a 2.3% decrease in heart disease). Both compounds are important for heart health, working through different mechanisms to protect cardiovascular health.","context":["Article Archive >> Good Health\nDo You Know Your Fat Facts?\nby Jeanne Rhodes\nThis week a series of questions and answers will help clarify some vital and very useful information about dietary fat.\nQ) There are several different kinds of fats - which should we be aware of?\nA) Saturated, trans, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated.\nQ) Which of these is the most damaging to health?\nA) Trans fat, followed by saturated fat. A large study found that trans fat, a primary ingredient of margarines and shortening is especially unhealthy. Walter Willet of the Harvard School of Public Health states that although unknown to most consumers, trans fat appears to be the worst fat. The biggest sources are hidden - cookies, crackers and commercial baked goods as well as french fries and other deep-fried foods. Be aware that “hydrogenated” or “partially hydrogenated” oil on food labels means trans fat.\nTrans fat raises the “bad” LDL cholesterol and lowers the “good” HDL. Saturated fat is unhealthy but is not quite as bad as trans - it raises both HDL and LDL cholesterol.\nQ) How can you visually identify a saturated fat?\nA) It will be solid or semi-solid at room temperature - butter, lard, fat on meats, etc.\nQ) Which of the fats are healthier choices?\nA) Polyunsaturated and Monounsaturated because they are both good for the heart as well as many other organs and body functions. Monounsaturated oils, especially olive and canola raise “good” HDL cholesterol while lowering “bad” LDL cholesterol. In addition, monounsaturated oils are excellent for increasing essential fatty acids specifically the omega 3’s, which are inadequate in today’s American diet.\nQ) Is trans fat listed on food labels?\nA) Currently, trans fat is not required to be listed on food labels. You can estimate trans fat by looking at total fat grams and then subtract the listed grams of saturated fat and unsaturated fat from this total. Also, look at the ingredients listed. Trans fats are found in hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils.\nQ) Do we need to eat fat in order to lose fat?\nA) Yes! Increasing omega 3 essential fatty acids to a healthy balance will in turn allow a healthy balance of eicosanoids - the body’s superhormones. Eicosanoids are made by every cell of the body and have been referred to as the “molecular glue” that holds the human body together. In 1982 the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded for eicosanoid research. Almost every disease state from heart disease and cancer to obesity can be viewed as an imbalance of eicosanoids. Eicosanoid balance depends on a healthy omega 6 to omega 3 balance of 1:1 to 4:1 in the diet. Currently, the American diet is too high in omega 6’s with an omega 6 to omega 3 balance of 20:1. Substituting omega 3 choices (olive & canola oils, fish, veggies, etc.) for some of the omega 6 choices (processed and fried foods, red meat, etc.) will help balance essential fatty acids which will then balance eicosanoids - essential to life itself as well as weight loss.\nQ) Will a blood test let me know if my eicosanoids are balanced?\nA) No, they are not found in the blood, which explains why it took science so long to identify them and begin to understand their functions.\nQ) Are there research studies to verify the tremendous impact omega’3 have on health?\nA) Yes, probably hundreds of studies by now. Here are a few:\n* 324 women who increased omega 3’s (salmon, etc.) eliminated their risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (Epidemiology May ’96)\n* Supplements of omega 3’s lengthened remissions for 23 patients with Crohn’s disease (New England Journal of Medicine 6/13/96)\n* Menstrual cramps were reduced with fish oil supplements (American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, April ’96)\n* Children with an increased omega 3 rich fish diet were 25% less likely to have asthma than those who did not eat the fish (Medical Journal of Australia 2/5/96)\n* 295 men with an increased omega 3 (fish) diet had half the risk of heart failure (Journal of American Medical Assoc. 11/1/95)\n* 883 men who’d had heart attacks had 29% less chance of death with low fat diet and increased omega 3’s (fish) (Lancet 9/30/89)\n* Lyon Diet Heart Study - 76% lower incidence of second heart attack, heart failure, stroke and death in heart attack survivors who were placed on an omega 3 rich diet as compared to the group on the American Heart Association’s “prudent” diet. (The Lancet, 1994)\nQ) Won’t eating fatty fish increase calories too high?\nA) Optimal health and weight is not a consequence of counting calories. It’s based on the complex hormonal responses that are initiated by the BALANCE of macronutrients you eat which makes food the most powerful drug you will ever ingest. This is yet another reason most diets fail - most conventional weight reduction diets are not in the necessary balance to correct the overweight problem.\nQ) Could you clarify what might be the best choices of fats and oils to include to get a healthy Omega 3 to Omega 6 balance?\nA) The following is very brief list, but remember that all oils and fats should be used in moderation for health as well as weight loss. A low fat approach with Omega 3 choices replacing some of the Omega 6 choices to provide a healthy balance of these two essential fatty acids will deliver the best results:\n* Saturated Fats & Oils\nPalm kernel oil\n* Omega 3 Oils\n*Olive oil is a monounsaturated oil that increases omega 3 uptake in the body’s cells\n* Omega 6 Oils\nSunflower seed oil\nCotton seed oil\nBottom Line: The best = a half-and-half mixture of Olive and Canola oils for better balance of omega 3’s in the diet. Both oils contain generous amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids. Olive oil is very valuable because of its abundance of antioxidants and squalene which has anti-inflammatory properties, slows blood clot formation, and lowers cholesterol. Olive oil also helps your body absorb the omega 3’s in your diet.\nRhodes, B.A., M.A., is a nutritionist, Wellness Lifestyle Strategist, Author, and Director of Rhodes Preventive Health Institute in Hagerstown.\n<< back to Articles on Good Health\n<< back to All Articles","This is a FACT.\nThe Mediterranean diet has longed been hailed as the healthiest diet for the heart, and in no small part to its predilection for olives and olive oil. A 2012 study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that healthy Mediterranean individuals who consumed olive oil on a daily basis had a 44% reduction in cardiovascular deaths as Mediterranean individuals who did not use olive oil. Recent research, however, has revealed that it’s not so much the monounsaturated fat content in olive oil that imparts olive oil’s heart healthy benefits, as it is the polyphenols in olive oil.\nOlive Oil’s Heart Healthy Benefits\nOlive oil is rich in oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat that, until recently, was thought to be the primary catalyst of olive oil’s heart healthy benefits. Oleic acid has been shown to increase healthful HDL cholesterol and lower harmful LDL cholesterol. There’s a kink in the oleic acid theory, however, because other oils high in oleic acid—like canola oil—do not exert any cardio-protective benefits.\nNew evidence is piling up, and it all points to the polyphenolic compounds in olive oil, which have demonstrated a direct influence on improved blood cholesterol and arterial function, which likewise enhance blood pressure, overall artery health, and a subsequent reduced risk in heart attack, stroke, and sudden death from a cardiac event.\nA study published in Medical Science Monitor in 2004 showed that adults who took 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil every day for 6 weeks had an average decrease of 31.5 mg/dl in total cholesterol and an average decrease of 30 mg/dl in LDL “bad” cholesterol. The recent Eurolive study points to the mechanism behind such benefit.\nResearchers gave healthy men 1 ½ tablespoons of either high-, low-, or medium-polyphenol olive oil each day for 3 weeks. At the end of the study, the men who drank the olive oil high in polyphenols showed an averaged reduced oxidized LDL level of 3.2 U/L while the men who drank low-polyphenol olive oil showed no improvement whatsoever. (Oxidized LDL is damaging to the heart because it seeps into the walls of the arteries, damaging the interior lining, prompting inflammation, and accelerating the atherosclerosis that can cause a cardiovascular event.) The men supplementing with high-polyphenol olive oil saw a 1.74 mg/dl boost in HDL cholesterol (a 1 mg/dl increase in HDL correlates with a 2.3% decrease in heart disease!).\nDecades long research also shows that olive oil can dramatically lower blood pressure…to the point that with daily supplementation you may be able to ditch those statins!\nOlive Oil’s Heart Healthy Components\n- Polyphenols, especially hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, but also verbascoside, help to neutralize free radicals before they can oxidize and damage cells and DNA…lower blood pressure…and protect against atherosclerosis.\n- Oleuropein helps treat hypertension, fight free radicals, and alleviate chronic inflammation.\n- Phytosterols lower LDL cholesterol levels in the blood by blocking the absorption of cholesterol in the small intestine.\nTips for Purchase\nOpt for extra-virgin olive oil, which uses “first pressed” premium quality olives that are less refined. For perspective, refined olive oils have a mere 2.7 mg/kg of polyphenols compared to extra-virgin olive oils, which have 150-350 mg/kg of polyphenols. Because the quality of olive oil varies according to processing methods, temperature, soil, growing conditions, etc., it’s best to review the “Buyer’s Guide to Olive Oil” at extravirginity.com.\nAccording to the American Olive Oil Producers Association, olive oil is heat stable at up to 410°F."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4a524d0c-2905-491e-bd25-26594518af3d>","<urn:uuid:094b22bb-a7dc-404d-90bf-0198d4e9ebf4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Tortuga Bay in Galapagos and Botanical Beach in Vancouver Island differ in terms of their marine wildlife viewing opportunities?","answer":"Tortuga Bay and Botanical Beach offer different marine wildlife viewing experiences. At Tortuga Bay, visitors can observe sea lions, marine iguanas, Sally-lightfoot crabs, and blue-footed boobies, with sea turtles visiting during nesting season. In contrast, Botanical Beach features tide pools filled with purple, red and orange starfish, sea urchins, blue mussels, white gooseneck barnacles, green sea anemones and sea cucumbers. Additionally, Botanical Beach is known for whale watching, particularly Grey Whales during their March-April migration, and sea lions from late August through May.","context":["Coming in at #10 on TripAdvisor’s Top 25 Beaches in the World for this year is Tortuga Bay, Galapagos. And with good reason. In this post, we invite you to discover why it is that so many travelers from around the world voted to have this beach cap off their top ten pieces of paradise.\nTortuga Bay is located on Santa Cruz Island, the largest island in the central region of the archipelago. The island itself is home to abundant wildlife and a spectacular slice of coast that holds a sense of tranquillity and oneness with nature unlike anywhere else. It’s capital, Puerto Ayora, is the most populated urban center in all of the islands. Despite the strong presence of civilization, however, an immaculate beach lies not all that far from here…\nMany cruises, if not all, have Puerto Ayora as a pit stop as part of their Galapagos tours. It’s worth mentioning that the Finch Bay Galapagos Hotel is right around the corner as well. While in town, you can stroll throughout the docks, pier, and town center and then visit the Charles Darwin Research Station (with its brand-new Lonesome George Exhibit!). This data-gathering location is a biological research station that is operated by the Charles Darwin Foundation. The main mission of scientists working there is to provide professional advising for conservation efforts in the Galapagos Islands. The most well-known effort at the center is the captive breeding program for giant tortoises, but other monumental efforts are taking place here too. Visitors can see baby tortoises in semi-captive conditions, as well as tortoises that are about four or five years of age and are ready to be repatriated to their home islands.\nNot many visitors to Santa Cruz get a chance to visit Tortuga Bay, due to a lack of time. Those that do manage to stay on the island for more than a day, however, are always strongly advised to check it out. It’s obvious why.\nMany turtles inhabit the nearby waters, and some will come to land on the shores during their nesting season, hence its name. On the way there, you’ll get to stroll down a walkway (approx. 2.5 km/1.5 mi) among a giant cacti forest where finches come to feed on the attractive yellow flowers and Galapagos flora. As you get closer to the shoreline, the gentle sound of waves turns into a magical serenade of ambient music, summoning you to come closer. Since this recreational area is open to hikers and nature lovers alike (without the requirement of a guide), you can explore it at your own pace.\nThere are two large sandy environments here. The first bay is wide and open, where long sets of waves continuously roll and marine iguanas leave tracks in the sand as they look for shade. The second bay, which is at the very end of the first, is a secluded beach reserved for those who prefer a quieter location. Your eyes can go wild here as you witness one of the few places on Earth where giant cacti meet the ocean and the tropical coast is dotted with mangroves. It’s a beautifully bizarre combination!\nTortuga Bay is protected and very calm. It’s no wonder why those who extend their time on the islands after an expedition cruise love it here. In some areas, big waves prevent you from swimming but in others, calm shallows will invite you to playfully splash around alongside the beach. You’ll also feel compelled to explore the rocky shorelines with your snorkeling gear, as marine life thrives well here (including sea lions and Sally-lightfoot crabs). Keep an eye on plunging blue-footed boobies as well! An aerial show may very well be happening overhead.","Botanical Beach is located only a short 5 min drive from Handsome Dan’s Cottages, or 115 km, and approximately a 2hr 10min drive from Victoria\nSome Info about Botanical Beach:\nVisiting Port Renfrew and not hiking at Botanical Beach would be like visiting New York City and not going to the Statue of Liberty. Botanical Beach and nearby Botany Bay can be accessed at the end of Cerantes Road from the large roundabout parking lot in the Juan de Fuca Provincial Marine Park which includes a great nearby picnic table area. Botanical Beach offers one of the best opportunities to view intertidal marine creatures and plants on Vancouver Island. The area is a protected zone, so please take nothing but photographs.\nTo Get the Best of your Visit: Plan it at low tide and check the Port Renfrew Tide Chart\nWhat to wear: Wear water-resistant shoes with sturdy soles as the going is always wet. Even during the lowest tides of the year – December and January, June and July The prospect of being caught out here will make your adrenal gland flutter.\nAt the parking lot you will find two trailheads. One leads to Botanical Beach and the other to Botany Bay. The trail is a loop trail, so no matter which you choose, it will return you to the parking lot. See the picture of the trail above. The complete loop is 2.7km. From the parking lot, Botany Bay is 0.7km to a set of stairs that will lead to the beach and into the Bay. From here you have a choice, you may do the Beach to Beach trail, or do the loop trail.\n- Beach To Beach Trail: Only attempt this at low tide. Be sure to check the Tide Chart. Follow the stairs and go down into the Bay where you can hike towards the left (south) from Botany Bay along the rocks to Botanical Beach and explore all the tidal pools on the way. It is truly spectacular. Some rock climbing is involved, nothing too crazy, but I do not suggest it for young kids and elderly people. Remember to stay back from the high tide points and keep your eyes peeled for rogue waves. They are exciting and fun to watch from a distance, but are dangerous close up. Although you wouldn’t want to be anywhere near here at high tide, it’s staggering to imagine how conditions must boil in there during winter storms.\n- The Loop Trail: Great choice if the tide is high, or if some people in your party like to do the beach to beach way, and you rather have a beautiful pleasure walk into the rainforest. Do the trail from the top of the stairs. This will lead you to Botanical Beach as well, and eventually back to the parking lot. The trail is absolutely beautiful. There are many great ocean vista view points to look down onto the beach as you travel the trail, which is perfect for storm watching in the winter months.\n- Tide Pools: Botanical Beach is known for its Tidal Pools, the Great Botanical Loop Trail, Storm Watching in the winter months and an abundance of Wildlife. It is one of the most amazing places on the entire West Coast, particularly at low tide.\nThis is when visitors can walk a long way out across flat sandstone and granite outcroppings to view tide pools filled like jewel boxes with brightly coloured marine animals. Purple, red and orange starfish and sea urchins, blue mussel shells, white gooseneck barnacles, green sea anemones and sea cucumbers. So significant is this location that a research station was first established here in 1900 by a team from the University of Minnesota.\nThe organisms that live here must be able to handle a wide range of conditions. When the tide is out there are significant changes in temperature, predators, food sources and salinity. Each creature has adapted to contend with these variable conditions.\nOrganisms that cannot cope with drying will survive in the tide pools or in shaded crevices. There you will find Sea Stars, chitons and anemones. The Sea Stars often pile together to reduce moisture loss. Barnacles, snails and mussels are able to survive by closing up tightly with a small amount of water inside their shells. Purple sea urchins have established a particular niche in the soft sandstone. Their sharp, hard spines help to wear away the indentations in which they live.\nIf you have the chance, do both trails. They are truly spectacular. And the beach to beach with the tidal pools is a must.\n- Wild Life: Killer Whales and Grey Whales have often been observed swimming past the beach or feeding just off of the point. The best time for seeing Grey Whales is during their migration from the Mexican coast to Alaska during March and April. Sea lions can be found here from late August through May.\nBear and Cougars:\nRemember this is bear and cougar country so please take the usual wildlife precautions."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:23d55b62-f39a-4039-afbe-6d976ba1c40f>","<urn:uuid:210c787a-305f-41e6-ba83-7b3b48b9ba56>"],"error":null}

As evil descends on the small town of Brim, four ill-equipped teens facing impossible odds combine their unique skills to become freedom fighters and save their kingdom from ruthless invaders. This great responsibility brings many adventures – both scary and entertaining – because to become a Knight of Panterra, they must learn to ride DINOSAURS!\nShowrunner Simon Barry (Ghost Wars, Van Helsing, Continuum) was brought on board to executive produce and oversee the writing of two scripts, with support from the Shaw Rocket Fund. “When Omni approached me about Knights of Panterra, I immediately saw the potential for a family series that would set itself apart in scope and technical challenges. With The Jim Henson Company as our partners, I know we will be able to deliver on the promise of this ambitious adventure,” said Barry. Sam Ruano (Killjoys, Lost Girl) and Rachel Langer (Ghost Wars, The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco) wrote the scripts, with strategic input from executive producer and lead director Zach Lipovsky (Kim Possible, Mech-X4). Jamie Piekarz (Super Mighty Makers) is also an executive producer and key creative contributor to the series.\nLisa Henson, CEO and President of The Jim Henson Company and Stanford will serve as executive producers.

{"question":"How does the feeding frequency and amount differ between regular aquarium fish and goldfish when it comes to maintaining healthy water conditions?","answer":"For regular aquarium fish, they should generally be fed once a day, with all food being consumed within a minute to prevent waste settling on the tank floor. In contrast, goldfish can be fed two to three times a day but only in very small pinches. Due to goldfish's unique physiology (lack of stomach), they never feel full and will continue eating as long as food is available. Overfeeding goldfish is particularly problematic as it can lead to swim bladder problems and blocked intestines. For both types of fish, excess food can lead to dirty water and poor water quality, but this is especially critical for goldfish. It's important to note that underfeeding goldfish is far less detrimental than overfeeding them.","context":["As with any living being, it is of vital importance that your fish receives a healthy, balanced diet. Diverse types will have different needs, some variety of aquarium fish will prefer fresh or frozen food, while others will be content with the humble fish flake. Discover just what your fish will favour using my helpful guide.\nBasically, there are four types of fish food- fish flakes, fish pellets, frozen food, and dried food such as algae and seaweed.\nFish flakes are possibly the most common form of fish food. You can buy specific types that will be tailored to the kind of fish you own, and they’re ideal for creating a nutritious base to your pet’s diet. Some flakes are designed to meet the nutritional needs of specific varieties of fish, some are made to counter nutritional imbalances, while others are balanced to enhance colour or growth or even to encourage spawning.\nMuch the same as fish flakes, fish food pellets are a good stable food source. You can buy different types to suit where your fish like to discover their food, whether that’s on the surface of the tank, in the gravel, or mid-way between. This is because pellets are available in forms that are either denser or lighter than water. This means the fish are able to feed in a more natural way. Certain varieties of fish like to feed off the bottom of the tank while others prefer to feed on the water surface. In the same way as flakes, pellets come in many variations, each with an explicit purpose.\nFrozen foods are a great option to provide a little treat every now and again. Typical frozen fish foods include krill and plankton. Frozen foods are available from most pet shops in a wide variety – from squid and shrimp to spirulina algae and vegetables. You will also find processed, vitamin enhanced staple diets as well as aquarium delicacies like insect larvae. The assortment of frozen foods available can deliver wide-ranging and steady nourishment for most fish. The procedures that the foods go through during freezing significantly diminish the danger of disease transmission when compared to live or fresh foods while still preserving a high nutritional value.\nFreeze-dried foods have all of the moisture removed from them during the manufacturing process significantly extending the long shelf life and making storage easier. Many worms, insect larvae, crustaceans are offered in freeze-dried forms. One drawback with freeze dried foods is the freeze-drying process can often remove vitamins from the food, so freeze dried foods should not be expected to make a balanced and complete diet on their own. It should be noted that freeze-dried foods can absorb a lot of water, and will expand more than you might think when looking at them in the package. I recommend you moisten them before feeding to your fish to keep your fish from overeating.\nGenerally, you should only need to feed your fish once a day, nevertheless, the trick with feeding them is to make sure there is nothing leftover after a minute or so of giving it to them. If you feed them too often, or if food begins to settle on the tank floor, the water can carry a higher level of unnecessary waste, which will ultimately adversely affect the welfare of your fish.","So many people originally buy Goldfish believing that they are an easy pet to take care of. Whilst this is for the most part true, they do require a little more maintenance and care than many would initially think. For one, their tank needs cleaning regularly and secondly, their diet needs to be monitored for overfeeding as well as the efficiency of delivering all the nutrition they need with the small amount of food they require. Here, we look at the best foods for goldfish that goldfish owners can buy to ensure that their fish lead as healthy a life as possible. We also investigate how to feed goldfish should you go abroad and whether it is possible to buy fish food pellets that are designed for other breeds. Our buying guide will support a novice goldfish owner no end in being able to provide and care for their new pets so that they do not pass away within months of purchase. Goldfish can actually live up to 10 years if cared for properly.\nTetra goldfish food is a name synonymous with good quality produce and the best goldfish food that is available to buy on the market. This particular product is an excellent example of that given that it is nutritionally balanced and designed to be easy to digest. The result is healthier fish that leave the water cleaner so that owners do not have to clean the tank as regularly. Feeding goldfish with this product is also incredibly easy owing to the dispenser design that allows goldfish owners to give fish food for goldfish without having to touch the goldfish food itself.\nComes in a variety of sizes\nEasy to digest formula for cleaner water\nComes with dispenser lid for feeding goldfish hands free\nThe difference that this Repashy Goldfish food can make to your pets is remarkable.

The general consensus that goldfish do not live much longer than a year is a very common misconception. In fact, goldfish when properly looked after, can live up to 10 years when in a goldfish tank. While maintenance of a goldfish tank is part and parcel of keeping your goldfish fit and healthy, their food is also an integral part of their well being. Owners therefore need to know what a goldfish needs in terms of nutritional requirements and therefore what they need to eat.\nSo what do goldfish eat? And what should their goldfish food or goldfish pellets contain to ensure that your goldfish stay fit.\nSpecifically in terms of feeding goldfish what they need nutritionally, the best goldfish food will differ from other pond fish food or regular fish food as it contains far less protein and far more carbohydrates. Goldfish food will be made with goldfish particularly in mind, so it’s best to choose goldfish flakes or goldfish pellets as a generic tub of fish food will not meet the bodily needs of your goldfish.\nThe difference between goldfish flakes and goldfish pellets is that flakes will float and pellets will sink. What you choose will be up to you, but you should think about the following things. Firstly, how big your fish are. Pellets tend to be far bigger than goldfish flakes so it may be best to go for flakes if your fish are young. Additionally, pellets are more difficult to remove from your goldfish’s tank which is worth bearing in mind for when you clean a tank’s water.\nHowever, a disadvantage to goldfish flakes given that they float is the fact that goldfish will ingest air whilst eating them. This can be bad for their digestive systems. Plus flakes more easily lose nutritional value when their container has been opened. The air causes them to lose some of the efficacy when compared to pellets.\nThere are a number of other things that are suitable for feeding goldfish. When in the wild, goldfish will commonly eat a mixture of crustaceans and insects as well as plants and smaller. If possible, look for goldfish food that contains a mixture of these elements. The best goldfish food will contain some form of vegetables, shrimps or even perhaps some bloodworms. Freeze dried foods or even live food can contain these foodstuffs more easily, though live food is more commonly linked with a risk of disease. Frozen food tends to remove this risk factor.\nOne important thing to remember is that whatever type of fish food for goldfish you give to your pets, you should never over feed them. It is so easy to do, but it can be dangerous as any surplus amounts of goldfish flakes, fish food pellets or otherwise can stay in the water and make it too dirty for your fish to be able to breathe easily.\nAdditionally, goldfish have a very different physiology to a human body and one such difference is their lack of stomach. They therefore never feel full so will continue to eat as long as there’s food available. If they eat too much they can suffer from issues such as a swim bladder problems or even blocked intestines. One good way to check if your regular amount of food that you give to your fish is too much is if they leave a long line of faeces after them in their tank.\nTo avoid this, you can feed a goldfish two or three times a day, but only ever a very small amount. This amounts to tiny little pinches of food. A good rule of thumb is to keep adding these tiny pinches for around a minute and your goldfish should be able to eat all that food in that time and that’s all. Remember to remove any food that has been uneaten in that time so that it does not rot in the water.\nFinally, it is a good notion to realise that actually feeding your goldfish too little is far less detrimental than feeding your goldfish too much.\nAs previously mentioned, there are a couple of types of standard goldfish food. Goldfish pellets and goldfish flakes are the most popular and have both have their advantages and disadvantages. However, you can also buy specific goldfish food for specific types of goldfish. Bearing this in mind, the market has the option to buy tetra goldfish food, betta fish food and hikari fish food all of which are made with the nutritional requirements of specific types of goldfish in mind.\nIf you are tempted to feed your goldfish meat, remember first to trim off every single piece of fat. These fats from mammals are incredibly hard to nigh on impossible for goldfish to digest so that their bodies cannot cope with these when ingested. The problem is made even worse when the water temperature goes under 15 degrees Celsius at a time.\nIn fact, the water temperature within a tank can materially affect what and how much a goldfish eats. The lower the temperature, the less the body is able to metabolise the food that you feed them. Water temperature for them is ideal at around 20-21 degrees Celsius or 70 degrees fahrenheit. However, if the temperature goes too low, don’t feed them at all. If it falls below 46 degrees fahrenheit, fish cannot properly digest their food.\nA: Feeding goldfish should ideally happen two to three times a day at most and only ever a small few pinches at a time. If you feed them any more than this you run the risk of contaminating their water with rotting food as well as giving them a painful dose of indigestion which their bodies are not designed to deal with very capably at all. If you are unsure as to what a few small pinches amounts to, think about how big a goldfish eyes are and ensure that the pinch is never bigger than this. Plus, if they don’t consume everything you have sprinkled into their water within one to two minutes, take out the surplus food to protect against dirty water and digestive issues.\nA: Whilst obviously not ideal, goldfish that live in aquariums can actually survive for almost two weeks without eating or being fed.\nTheir omnivore diet and physiology helps them to live so long without food. However, forgetting to feed them regularly is not to be encouraged. While they can survive without food for so long, it does not mean that the time spent without eating is not unduly stressful for them.\nThat being said, if you are very worried that you are overfeeding your pet goldfish, it is better for them to go without food one or two days a week than to continue as you were. This helps to improve the quality of the water in your fish’s tanks and helps prevent them getting sick.\nA: Betta fish food or other types of tropical fish food are suitable for feeding goldfish. The difference between these types of goldfish flakes is that the tropical type is made for warmer waters and colder waters. This results a variance of protein that is included. When fish live in warmer waters, they are far more capable of digesting higher amounts of protein. Given that most of us live in warm houses that naturally keep our goldfish tanks at higher temperatures, Betta fish food is therefore suitable for use as fish food for goldfish.\nA: Goldfish are one of the easier pets to deal with when going on vacation given that you do not need to give them their goldfish food daily for them to survive. However, going a few days without goldfish food can actually be fairly stressful for your pets so there are a number of ways you can get around this.\nFirstly, look at feeding goldfish with slow release food blocks. They’re fairly inexpensive ways to ensure that your fish get fed slowly for the entire time you are away. They work by being a convocation of safe to eat plaster of paris that have been made with a number of bits of goldfish food. When put in water, over a few days the plaster of Paris dissolves slowly so that these bits of fish food for goldfish, be they goldfish pellets or goldfish flakes, are released into the water. This manner of feeding goldfish is suitable for up to 3 or 4 days. However, there are some slow release goldfish food blocks that can be found that will last up to two weeks. All you need to do is put one in your pet’s tank and remember to lock your front door behind you.\nSecondly try using a mechanical dispenser. It is actually possible to feed goldfish over a long period of time with a mechanical dispenser. They are predominantly designed to be suitable for use with goldfish flakes and goldfish pellets.They will release food into your fish’s tank a few times a day thus feeding your goldfish what they need. There will be some fish tanks that have dispensers made by the brand of tank that will release fish food pellets, but there are some generic mechanical dispensers too. It is good practice to use any mechanical dispenser you do buy in feeding goldfish before you go on holiday. Do so for about a week and you will ensure that any teething problems with the dispenser will come to light before your leave your fish unsupervised.\nTetraFin Balanced Diet Goldfish Flake Food for Optimal Health\nWe marked out this particular Tetra goldfish food as the best goldfish food that money can buy given the amount of scientific research and development that has been packed into it to result in a food that makes a huge improvement to a goldfish’s life.

Severe anaphylactic reactions can be fatal. Most people experience allergy symptoms only as a minor annoyance. However, a small number of allergic people are susceptible to a reaction that can lead to shock or even death. Fortunately, anaphylaxis is rare. The death rate from anaphylaxis is about 1 out of every 2.5 million people per year.\nAnaphylaxis is often triggered by substances that are injected or ingested and thereby gain access into the blood stream. An explosive reaction involving the skin, lungs, nose, throat, and gastrointestinal tract can then result. Although severe cases of anaphylaxis can occur within seconds or minutes of exposure and be fatal if untreated, many reactions are milder and can be ended with prompt medical therapy.\nWhat Does Anaphylaxis Mean?\nTo fully understand this term, we need to go back almost 100 years. The story begins on a cruise aboard Prince Albert I of Monaco’s yacht. The Prince had invited two Parisian scientists to perform studies on the toxin produced by the tentacles of a local jellyfish, the Portuguese Man of War. Charles Richet and Paul Portier were able to isolate the toxin and tried to vaccinate dogs in the hope of obtaining protection, or “prophylaxis,” against the toxin. They were horrified to find that subsequent very small doses of the toxin unexpectedly resulted in a new dramatic illness that involved the rapid onset of breathing difficulty and resulted in death within 30 minutes. Richet and Portier termed this “anaphylaxis” or “against protection.” They rightly concluded that the immune system first becomes sensitized to the allergen over several weeks and upon re-exposure to the same allergen may result in a severe reaction. You will recall that an allergen is a substance that is foreign to the body and can cause an allergic reaction in certain people.\n- The first documented case of presumed anaphylaxis occurred in 2641 B.C. when Menes, an Egyptian pharaoh, died mysteriously following a wasp or hornet sting. Later, in Babylonian times, there are two distinct references to deaths due to wasp stings.\n- Charles Richet was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1913 for his work on anaphylaxis.\nRichet went on to suggest that the allergen must result in the production of a substance, which then sensitized the dogs to react in such a way upon re-exposure. This substance turned out to be IgE. He was right on target.\nIn the first part of the 20th century, anaphylactic reactions were most commonly caused by tetanus diphtheria vaccinations made from horse serum. Today, human serum is used for tetanus prevention and the most common causes of anaphylaxis are now penicillin and other antibiotics, insect stings, and certain foods.\nIn 1956, Mary Hewitt Loveless showed that the injection of wasp venoms could cause anaphylaxis in individuals allergic to wasps. She subsequently used wasp extracts to successfully immunize such individuals.\nHow Common is Anaphylaxis?\nThe exact prevalence of anaphylaxis is unknown. The available statistics probably underestimate the true frequency because reactions are not always reported. Milder reactions may be attributed to an asthma attack or a sudden episode of hives. More serious, fatal episodes might be reported as a heart attack since the indicative signs of hives, swollen throat, and asthma can fade quickly. Thus, it is quite possible that even the true incidence of fatalities due to anaphylaxis is both under- recognized and under-reported. Regardless of precise statistics, we need to do a better job of preventing and treating anaphylaxis. The importance of awareness, early recognition, and prompt treatment of this disorder must be stressed.\nWhat are common causes of anaphylaxis?\nThe causes of anaphylaxis are divided into two major groups:\n- IgE mediated: This form is the true anaphylaxis that requires an initial sensitizing exposure, the coating of the mast cells and basophils by IgE, and the explosive release of chemical mediators upon re-exposure.\n- Non-IgE mediated: These reactions, the so called “anaphylactoid” reactions, are similar to those of true anaphylaxis, but do not require an IgE immune reaction. They are usually caused by the direct stimulation of the mast cells and basophils. The same mediators as occur with true anaphylaxis are released and the same effects are produced. This reaction can happen, and often does, on initial as well as subsequent exposures, since no sensitization is required.\nThe terms anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid (meaning “like anaphylaxis”) are both used to describe this severe, allergic reaction. Anaphylaxis is used to describe reactions that are initiated by IgE and anaphylactoid is used in reference to reactions that are not caused by IgE. The effects of the reactions are the same, however, and are generally treated in the same manner.\nAlthough it may appear that IgE mediated anaphylaxis occurs upon a first exposure to a food, drug, or insect sting, there must have been a prior, and probably unwitting, sensitization. You may not remember an uneventful sting or be aware of “hidden” allergens in foods. You will, however, remember the anaphylactic reaction that occurs as a subsequent response.\n- Although likely underestimated, about 10,000 cases of anaphylaxis occur per year in North America, with about 750 fatalities per year.\n- Foods and insect stings are the most common causes of anaphylactic reactions that result in death. Foods cause approximately 50-100 fatalities per year. Insect stings cause about 50 deaths per year.\nHow can we recognize anaphylaxis?\nIt is worth mentioning a few general observations regarding the features of anaphylactic reactions. Be aware, however, that these guidelines are not always consistent or reliable for a particular individual.\n- The severity of the reaction varies from person to person.\n- Subsequent reactions to the same trigger are typically similar in nature.\n- The more rapid the onset of symptoms, the more severe the reaction is likely to be.\n- A history of allergic disease (rhinitis, eczema, asthma) does not increase the risk of developing IgE mediated anaphylaxis, but it does incline the person to a non-IgE mediated reaction.\n- Underlying asthma may result in a more severe reaction and can be more difficult to treat.\n- The risk of anaphylaxis may diminish over time if there are no repeated exposures or reactions. However, a person at risk should always expect the worst and be prepared.\nWhat will I feel during an anaphylactic reaction?\nThe symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction may occur within seconds of exposure or be delayed 15 to 30 minutes or even an hour or more later (typical of aspirin and similar drugs). Early symptoms are often related to the skin. Flushing (warmth and redness of the skin), itching (often in the groin or armpits), and hives are common initial findings. These symptoms are often accompanied by a feeling of “impending doom,” anxiety, and sometimes a rapid, irregular pulse. Throat and tongue swelling resulting in hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing frequently follow. Symptoms of rhinitis or asthma may occur causing a runny nose, sneezing, and wheezing, which may worsen the breathing difficulty. Vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps may develop. About 25% of the time, the mediators flooding the blood stream cause a generalized opening of capillaries (tiny blood vessels) which results in a drop in blood pressure, lightheadedness, or even loss of consciousness. These are the typical features of anaphylactic shock.\nWhat happens next?\nThere are three possible outcomes:\n- The signs and symptoms may be mild and fade spontaneously or be quickly ended by administering emergency medication in the form of epinephrine (adrenaline). In this outcome, the symptoms do not subsequently recur from this particular exposure.\n- After initial improvement, the symptoms may recur within 4 to 12 hours (late phase reaction) and require additional treatment and close observation. Recent evidence suggests that a late phase reaction occurs in fewer than 10% of cases.\n- Lastly, the reaction may be persistent and more severe, thus requiring intensive medical treatment and hospitalization. This may occur up to 20% of the time with certain exposures.\nEpinephrine, which is also known as “adrenaline,” is a drug that acts immediately to cause the blood vessels to contract, thereby preventing fluid leakage. Epinephrine also helps relax the bronchial tubes, thus relieving breathing difficulty. It also lessens stomach cramps and stops itching and hives. More importantly, epinephrine helps prevent the release of more mediators.\nBeta-blocker medications commonly used to treat high blood pressure, angina, thyroid disorders, migraines, or glaucoma can make it very difficult to reverse anaphylactic reactions, which may then become severe.\nCould it have been something else?\nSeveral disorders may appear similar to anaphylaxis. Fainting (vaso-vagal reaction) is the reaction that is most likely to be confused with anaphylaxis. The key differences are that in a fainting episode, the affected person has a slow pulse, cool and pale skin, and no hives or difficulty breathing. Other conditions, such as heart attacks, blood clots to the lungs, and panic attacks can also be confused with anaphylaxis.\nDiagnosis - Rounding Up the Likely Suspects!\nOnce you think that you might have had an anaphylactic reaction, the first order of business is to see an allergist. The allergist will assess whether or not the reaction was indeed allergic in nature. Usually, a careful and detailed medical history and selected blood or skin tests can identify the cause. Be prepared to recall your activities before the event, the food and medications you ingested, and whether or not you had any contact with rubber products.\nIf you develop flushing, itching, hives, or other allergy symptoms while exercising, STOP IMMEDIATELY. If this has happened before, always carry an emergency epinephrine injection with you and never exercise alone.\nHow do we manage anaphylaxis?\nThe optimal management of anaphylaxis saves lives. An affected or at-risk person must be aware of possible triggers and early warning signs. If you are prone to these reactions, you must be familiar with the use of emergency kits and always have them with you. Emergency measures and prevention are central to management. As always, allergic diseases are best treated by avoidance measures, which will be reviewed in detail below.\nEmergency Measures for Anaphylaxis\nIf you suspect that you or someone you are with is having an anaphylactic reaction, the following are important first aid measures. In general, try to perform these in the order that they are presented.\n- If available, inject epinephrine immediately. The shot is given into the outer thigh and can be administered through light fabric. Rub the site to improve absorption of the drug.\n- Call emergency services or 911 IMMEDIATELY.\n- For reactions to insect stings or allergy shots, place a tourniquet between the puncture site and the heart. Release it for a few seconds every 10 minutes.\n- Place a conscious person lying down and elevate the feet if possible.\n- Stay with the person until help arrives.\n- If trained, begin CPR if the person stops breathing or doesn’t have a pulse.\nShots of epinephrine can be given through light clothing such as trousers, skirts, or stockings. Heavy garments may have to be removed prior to injecting.\nAfter 10 to 15 minutes, if the symptoms are still significant, you can inject another dose of epinephrine if available. Even after the reaction subsides, it is strongly advised that you go to an emergency room or allergist’s office immediately. Other treatments may be given, such as oxygen, intravenous fluids, breathing medications, and possibly more epinephrine. Steroids and antihistamines may be given but these are often not helpful initially and do not take the place of epinephrine. However, they may be more useful in preventing a recurrent delayed reaction.\nDo not be surprised if epinephrine makes you feel shaky and causes a rapid, pounding pulse. These are normal side effects and are not dangerous except for those with severe heart problems.\nTwo situations deserve special attention at this point since they are not covered elsewhere but are particularly interesting.\nRegarding the first situation, in the 1970’s, it was noted that exercise could cause anaphylaxis. Exercise-induced anaphylaxis (EIA) usually occurs with prolonged, strenuous exercise. Conditioned athletes such as marathon runners are frequently affected. The reaction may occur while exercising shortly after eating a meal, after eating specific foods (i.e. lettuce, shellfish, and celery) or after taking aspirin. It appears as though food or aspirin loads the gun and exercise pulls the trigger. Early symptoms are usually flushing and itching, which may progress to other typical symptoms of anaphylaxis if the exercise continues. Pre-medication with antihistamines or other drugs does not consistently prevent EIA. Exercise avoidance is the most effective treatment. If this is not feasible, exercising with a “buddy” and carrying emergency kits is mandatory.\nIn the second situation, when no cause can be found for anaphylaxis, it is termed idiopathic. Recent reports suggest that 25% of all episodes of anaphylaxis are idiopathic. Many of those affected have underlying allergy or asthma conditions. Extensive allergy testing for foods may uncover an unusual food allergy that is responsible for these reactions. For frequent episodes of anaphylaxis, your physician may recommend a combination of antihistamine, cortisone, and a medication to widen the airways of the lungs (bronchial dilator) to help reduce the severity of attacks.\nPrevention Measures for Anaphylaxis\nPreventing anaphylaxis is the ideal form of treatment. However, that may not always be easy since insect stings are frequently unanticipated and allergic foods are often hidden in a variety of different preparations. A consultation with an allergist is vital in helping you identify the trigger(s) and providing you with information and instruction on how to best avoid them. You will learn how to use emergency kits and how to become prepared for any reaction in the future.\nThese are three situations in which preventive treatment might be offered by the allergist.\n- Allergy shots may be suggested to some people with wasp, yellow jacket, hornet, honey bee, or fire ant reactions. This form of treatment gives 98% protection against the first four insect reactions, though somewhat less protection against fire ant reactions.\n- Pre-medication is most helpful in preventing anaphylaxis from x-ray dyes. Alternative dyes that are less likely to cause reactions may be available.\n- Desensitization to problematic medications is often effective. This process is accomplished by gradually increasing the amount of the medication given under controlled conditions. Sensitivities to penicillin, sulfa drugs, and insulin have been successfully treated in this way.\nAnyone known to be at risk for anaphylaxis should wear a Medic-Alert bracelet that clearly states the allergic trigger, the risk of anaphylaxis, and the availability of an epinephrine kit.\nPeople with anaphylaxis to medications should take new medications by mouth whenever possible since the risk of anaphylaxis is higher with injections.\nSince avoidance is not fail safe, a person at risk for an anaphylactic reaction must be adequately prepared in an emergency to handle a reaction. It is recommended that everyone at risk carry epinephrine injection kits designed for self-administration. These kits are available by prescription only and come in two forms:\n- Epi-pen is a spring-loaded automatic syringe that delivers a predetermined dose (0.3mg) when the tip is pressed hard for several seconds. An Epi-pen junior is available for children under 33 pounds and contains half of the dose.\n- Ana-kit contains a preloaded syringe and needles with two 0.3mg doses of epinephrine. These are injected under the skin or into the muscle of the thigh. An antihistamine, alcohol swab, and a tourniquet are included in the kit.\nHere are some important points to remember regarding the kits:\n- Ask you doctor to explain the use of the kit carefully and practice with the demonstrator kit.\n- Check expiration dates and replace outdated kits.\n- Keep kits out of direct sunlight, which may effect the drug.\n- Additional kits should be brought to school or work.\n- Always have kits with you or readily available.\n- Make sure that your friends, relatives, exercise buddies, and co-workers are aware of your condition and know what to do in case of a reaction.\nAnaphylaxis At A Glance\n- Anaphylaxis is the most severe allergic reaction and is potentially life threatening.\n- Anaphylaxis is rare. The vast majority of people will never have an anaphylactic reaction.\n- The most common causes of anaphylaxis include drugs, such as penicillin, insect stings, foods, x-ray dye, latex, and exercise.\n- The symptoms of anaphylaxis may vary from hives, tongue swelling, and vomiting, to shock.\n- If you are at risk, avoidance is the best form of treatment.\n- If you have a history of serious allergic reaction, always have an epinephrine kit available - it could save your life.\nDiseases and Conditions Center\nAll ArmMed Media material is provided for information only and is neither advice nor a substitute for proper medical care.

{"question":"What are the environmental benefits of native plant landscaping, and how does it impact home value in the real estate market?","answer":"Native plants provide multiple environmental benefits: they don't require herbicides or pesticides, need less watering from potable water supplies, and better support local pollinators and birds. From a real estate perspective, native plant landscapes have become a significant selling point in residential homes, with the American Society of Landscape Architects consistently ranking native plants as a top design element for six consecutive years. These landscapes can reduce water use by 50-80%, decrease maintenance time by 80%, and generate 60% less green waste compared to traditional landscaping.","context":["I’m working on a new PowerPoint (PPT) presentation on pollinators. Although I’ve done many presentations on natural landscaping, I’ve never done one focused on pollinators, so I thought I should understand a little more about pollination before I started developing the PPT. Here’s what I came up with…. [Read more…]\nMost of you already know that native plants – once established – do not require the use of chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides to maintain their beauty. Or that they don’t require extra watering from our precious supply of potable water. Or that our native pollinators and birds generally prefer native plants for nectaring and seed.\nBut did you know that there is a small army of habitat heroes around the country helping to make sure everyone is in the know? If you did or didn’t, you will want to attend the premier showing of Hometown Habitat – Stories of Bringing Nature Home featuring thoughout Doug Tallamy, author of Bringing Nature Home.\nThe film is directed by Catherine Zimmerman. Its message: All of us have the power to support habitat for wildlife and bring natural beauty to our patch of the earth.\nThe film also features local Town of Grand Chute resident Donna VanBuecken and Green Bay resident Ned Dorff. Filmmaker Catherine Zimmerman toured the United States for over two years gathering stories to present in her inspiring film. Through the words of many local habitat stewards, her environmental documentary highlights the critical role native plants play in the survival of local ecosystems.

The book is an introduction to meadowscaping and encourages readers do away with pesticides, reduce lawn and return their land to beautiful, natural habitat for native plants and wildlife.\nThere are good resources for helping us pick the right native plant for the right place on the nursery websites listed in my earlier post. There are also non-nursery on-line programs available to help with plant selection.\nNATIVE PLANT SELECTION SOURCES\nAudubon has a program called Native Plants Database. It’s easy to use. Just put in your e-mail address and zip code and a number of tabs pop up showing lists of native plants, what they host, local resources for native plants and next steps. It also references butterflies, caterpillars and birds use.\nThe Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center‘s Native Plants program has been around for a long time. This program asks for your state and a variety of site characteristics (habitat type, light, soil moisture, etc) and then brings up a list of suitable plants. It also includes a comprehensive database of native plants which includes a variety of information from description of blooms and leaves and growing conditions to benefits and distribution in the USA and Canada.\nThere’s also the NWF’s (National Wildlife Federation) Native Plant Finder program based on Doug Tallamy‘s research on which trees host which caterpillars. Here you also put in your zip code and it brings up appropriate native plants and butterflies and creates a list for you.\nAnother program is TNC’s (The Nature Conservancy) Grow Wild. Here you pick a region and a series of icons pop up to help you describe your site which then produces suggested plants. Or, you can simply scroll further down the page and select plants based on your plant hardiness zone.\nLOCAL PLANT SEARCH PROGRAMS\nThere are also many localized plant search resources. For example, the Missouri Botanical Garden has a program called Plant Finder. Although this listing includes non-natives, you can select for only Missouri natives by soil type, amount of light, height of plants, etc.\nThe Morton Arboretum has an extensive Search Trees and Plants program for both natives and non-natives broken down by a variety of site information including the hardiness zones. It also allows you to select for landscape use and season of interest as well as growth rate. Don’t forget to select the native locale.\nAnd the Grow Native website from the Missouri Prairie Foundation that includes a Native Plants Database for wildlife besides all the typical site selection criteria.\nSPECIALIZED PLANT SEARCH PROGRAMS\nThere are also sites devoted to plant selection for specialized gardens such as raingardens from the Central Ohio Rain Garden Initiative‘s Quick Guide to Native Plants for Rain Gardens. Or pollinators from the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation. See their Pollinator-Friendly Plant Lists. And for monarch butterflies such as the listing of Milkweed Species Beneficial to the Monarch Butterfly developed by the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service.\nIf you are using other plant selection programs to help you design your gardens and natural landscapes, don’t hesitate to let me know by adding a comment to this post or by sending me an e-mail.\nThis is the time of year native plant nurseries send me reminders about ordering native plants early.

For the sixth year in a row, native plants were top of the list (either #1 or #2).\nSouthern California real estate listings often call out yards as “water-saving” or “native landscape,” whether or not the description is accurate. In stark contrast, the National Association of Realtors 2018 Remodeling Impact Report on outdoor features advised that the most effective way to increase a home’s value is by hiring a standard lawn care service.\nThis indicates that native plant landscapes are, indeed, selling points for residential homes but haven’t yet become the standard.\nWhen preparing a house for sale, it may seem logical to limit investment to design of the home’s interior, but green builders need to know that green buyers are looking for the whole package, yard included. That means moving beyond low-water use to a landscape that helps regenerate local nature: a native plant landscape. These gardens complement the values package of green buildings and add a distinctive element that sets them apart from the competition.\nMarketing the Entire Green Package\nWhile featuring native plants is not a fantastic leap for green builders, there are some challenges to marketing them. Some of the same appeals of green buildings apply to native plant gardens.\nNative plants use 50 percent to 80 percent less water, reducing a home’s overall water use. They also reduce maintenance costs, requiring 80 percent fewer hours spent on yard work. Lastly, using native plants creates 60 percent less green waste, with no weekly mowing.\nIn addition to their cost effectiveness, native plants create beautiful and distinctively “green” curb appeal; a healthier environment for people and pets, with no fertilizers and fewer pesticides; and a livelier garden that supports birds, butterflies, and other wildlife.\nUp Close with Natives\nA major barrier to the widespread adoption of native plant gardens is lack of exposure. Developers have certainly heard of native plants, but they and their customers may not be sure what those gardens really look like. Garden tours are a wonderful (and fun!) way to learn about native plants. California Native Plant Society chapters around the state offer tours each spring, but the Theodore Payne Native Plant Garden Tour is the grand dame of them all. Our tour has been an annual event since 2003. Each year we feature a range of landscapes from professionally designed and maintained estates to owner-managed suburban front yards. Spanning Los Angeles County, 30-45 gardens show coastal to inland inspiring examples. Between tours, an online archive includes hundreds of images of exemplary gardens. Find it at TheodorePayne.org.\nWholesalers and Green Home Builders\nA third challenge facing green builders is ready access to landscape-size plants, but wholesalers are gradually increasing their stock. As green builders continue requesting that California natives and municipalities require native plants as part of their landscaping codes for residential construction, wholesalers will respond with larger and more varied inventories. This transformation has taken place in Northern California, and it can take place in Southern California too.\nNative plant landscapes are the cutting edge of residential green design. With their cost savings, many amenities, and great beauty, they are sure to attract green homebuyers.\nKitty Connolly is the Executive Director of Theodore Payne Foundation for Wild Flowers & Native Plants.

{"question":"How does water hardness protect both koi and lobsters from environmental threats?","answer":"Water hardness provides protective benefits for both koi and lobsters against environmental threats. For koi, harder water helps lock down toxic metals such as zinc, lead, and copper, which can easily dissolve and become dangerous in soft water. Additionally, higher water hardness provides better buffering capacity against pH changes. For lobsters, the minerals in their shell create a basic, 'unstirred layer' between their body and the seawater, serving as a protective barrier. This barrier, which makes lobsters feel slippery to touch, helps protect them from bacterial infections. When this mineral-based protection is compromised in either species, they become more vulnerable to environmental threats and diseases.","context":["Guide to Koi Pond Water Hardness 2020 (Testing GH & Ideal Parameters)\nWater hardness, or “general hardness”, refers to the mineral content in water, which includes calcium, magnesium, borate, silica, and iron. These metal ions are a result of carbonic acid within rain dissolving mineral-rich rock, such as limestone, as it runs naturally through layers of sediment, rivers, and streams. Along the way the water picks up dissolved minerals, and the more minerals it picks up, the harder the water is considered. In areas with little limestone or dolomite formation, water is usually considered soft, as it contains much less dissolved mineral content.\nWithin both the aquarium and pond hobbies, general hardness is used to determine the total dissolved mineral concentration in water to ensure it’s safe (or optimal) for fish keeping. Depending on where you live, your water will have varying degrees of hardness, and may contain a different concentration of the various metal ions that contribute to its overall hardness. Calcium (Ca++) usually makes up 2/3 of a waters total hardness parameters, with the remaining 1/3 being magnesium (Mg++) and trace amounts of other metal ions – this is also why it’s sometimes called “calcium hardness”.\nWater hardness parameters are often measured in ppm (parts per million) or milligrams per liter (mg/L), and can be thought of simply as the total amount of metal ions dissolved within an aqueous solution.\nNote: The different terms for water hardness are commonly confused with “carbonate hardness”, which actually has nothing to do with water hardness and is a different topic altogether. Alongside general hardness, you also have other closely linked water quality parameters known as alkalinity and KH (carbonate hardness). This is where confusion can arise, as not only do you measure these in similar ways, but the definitions sometimes overlap depending the source of literature. To make things simple, we only touch upon alkalinity in this article and use the term KH (carbonate hardness) as it’s more common within the koi hobby.\nHard Water Vs Soft Water – What’s Better for Koi Carp?\nA long debated topic within the koi keeping hobby, and one that is still actively discussed within the modern trade. Depending on hobbyist you ask, some will claim that soft water is better for koi, and others will stand by hard water..\nLooking deeper into the science behind water hardness in aquatic culture, all things seem point to a single conclusion: harder water is better for koi, so long as the hardness comes from calcium and magnesium – but why is this the case?\nA major concern with very soft water is the potential lack of dissolved salts, such as calcium and magnesium, which are important for the regulation of electrolyte (salt) levels within blood of fish through a process called Osmoregulation. Calcium and magnesium ions, found in higher concentrations in harder water, are essential to many important biological processes of fish, such as the ability to create new bone tissue, scales, blood-clots, and metabolic reactions. Fish, including koi carp, will actively absorb both calcium and magnesium from the surrounding water or from their food source, with dissolved calcium being particularly important for the regulation of salt levels within the blood. Having a higher presence of free-ionic calcium within a koi pond helps reduce the loss of other important salts, such as sodium and potassium, during the excretion of bodily fluids. Both sodium and potassium are vitally important in koi and work to maintain healthy heart, nerve, and muscle tissue (1). Calcium works to not only prevent the loss of these salts from the blood, but is also required for the re-absorption of new salts that are lost throughout the day (2). Without calcium, such as in extremely soft water, koi will need to use much higher amounts of energy to replenish lost salts within the blood, which can lead to less growth, weak bones, and frequent illness.\nAs well as this, harder water helps lock down toxins extremely well, including metals such as zinc, lead and copper, which can easily dissolve in soft water and become dangerous. Carbonates and bicarbonates are also essential to the biological processes of many micro-organisms and bacteria, including the beneficial bacteria in your filter box. They will consume a large volume of carbonate compounds from the water on a daily basis, and this is one of the reasons regular water changes are important in koi keeping – the replenishment of trace minerals and alkalinity (i.e., carbonates). As a final note, and although water hardness does not always equate to higher alkalinity, if the hardness is due to calcium and magnesium ions, your pond will have higher buffering capacity against dangerous changes in pH – also known as its KH value. The higher the KH, the more stable your pond pH will be against possible swings in pH and crashes.\nHow to Test Water Hardness in Koi Ponds – What are Ideal GH Values?\nYou can test general hardness with many commercial testing kits, such as API Ponds GH Testers, but this is also where things can become confusing in terms of definitions. General hardness, in most pond applications, will refer to the total concentration of dissolved calcium++, magnesium++, and other trace metal ions in water, with the results are often presented as mg/L (ppm) calcium carbonate [CaCO3]. Results are displayed in this way as CaCO3 has a molecular weight of 100, which makes it easier to equate values in comparison with other molecules.\nIt should be noted that KH measurements in areas of high limestone hardness will often be identical to the GH measurement, as both are presented as total mg/L [CaCO3]. This can be confusing at first and may give the impression that the separate tests are incorrect, but it’s actually normal in most cases. This is because the “calcium” makes up the hardness, and the “carbonate” makes up the KH (alkalinity), and although their individual weights within the molecule are different, together they’re still measured as just calcium carbonate [CaCO3] – hence the same result. Taking this into account, and avoiding the inner details of alkalinity (a topic for another time), an “ideal” KH range would be very similar to an “ideal” GH range, as both are formed primarily of calcium carbonate.\nIf you’d like to get an accurate measurement for just calcium by weight, not including magnesium and other potential metals, we recommend a test kit designed for calcium hardness, rather than general hardness, such as Taylor Technologies Calcium Kit.\nAlthough it is difficult to determine ideal parameters for koi, a commonly accepted range within the aqua culture industry is a free calcium++ concentration of 25-100 mg/L (ppm), which equates to an approximate GH hardness of 65-250 mg/L (ppm) CaCO3. Taking this further, many fresh water fish, including wild carp, have a calcium blood concentration of around 100 mg/L (ppm) (3), so for optimal osmoregulation and bodily function, a hardness as high as 250 mg/L CaCO3 could still be considered within the ideal range. Where hardness is due to limestone, the CaCO3 hardness results often reflect a mix of both free calcium and magnesium, with trace amounts of other ions.\nThe table below shows approximate free calcium water concentrations converted to general hardness parameters in mg/L (ppm), with green being the optimal average range for freshwater fish, including koi carp:-\n|Free Calcium [Ca++] (mg/L) (ppm)||General Hardness [CaCO3] (mg/L) (ppm)|","While out here on the Bigelow at the southern edge of the Northeast Channel, we’ve caught some lobsters, and just in time. Sailing with us is Joe Kunkel, a former professor and now professor emeritus at UMass Amherst, who is investigating a shell disease found on some lobsters.\nShell disease is an epizootic, or temporarily prevalent and widespread, disease found on lobsters. Unofficially, it’s suggested to be caused by a bacterium called Aquamarina. It’s denoted by circular lesions on the top part of the carapace. The lesions start out microscopic, but once visible, hundreds of organisms, such as other bacteria, protozoans and nematodes, can be found living in the infected area. During the 1980s, about 1 in 10,000 lobsters may have been seen with shell disease. By the late 1990s, hot spots with up to 70% of the population showing signs of lesions were seen in the Narragansett and Buzzards Bay areas.\nJoe suggests that the prevalence of the disease increases as the lobsters’ vulnerability to it increases. This means the shell’s protective ability plays an important role. Minerals composing the shell include calcium, phosphate and magnesium. The chemical reactions between these minerals dissolving in the surrounding sea water create a basic (high pH), ‘unstirred layer’. Think of it as a barrier between the lobster and seawater where a lot of mineral mixing is happening. Have you ever noticed that a lobster feels a little slippery? The slippery feeling is that protective barrier.\nIn order to grow, lobsters molt their hard, exterior shell. Leading up to molting, a reserve of calcium carbonate and minerals in the endocuticle, or inner shell layer, are reabsorbed through the epidermal cell layer. A new, soft shell matrix is formed underneath the old shell. Once molted, they eat their old shell, bringing all the rest of the minerals back into their body. They use the reabsorbed and eaten minerals to establish their new shell. It takes about seven days for the shell to feel hard, and it’ll be several more weeks until the shell reaches its maximum hardness. But their new shell has to be bigger so they also need to consume more minerals from their diet. This time of shell establishment is the vulnerable phase when shell disease may sneak in.\nIf a lobster isn’t able to consume enough added minerals, the new shell could be thinner or weaker in some areas. As global warming changes the temperature and chemistry of the ocean, lobsters may find it increasingly difficult to obtain the necessary amount of minerals, added to what they already have stored, and regrow a shell to its maximum thickness and hardness as well as building reserves for its yet bigger shell next year. Possibly, those areas of mineral thinness, or shell weakness, are spots of vulnerability to shell disease. If the protective barrier isn’t as effective, the lobsters are rendered more vulnerable, giving the bacteria a chance to establish a lesion.\nThe mineralization is a process that spans multiple years, and the lobsters need an adequate mineral supply to achieve a healthy cuticle that is not vulnerable to infection. We are making it harder for the lobsters by feeding them low-calcium bait. We could possibly have a healthier lobster population in the face of ocean acidification if we feed them a higher calcium carbonate bait. – Joe Kunkel\nBut if a lobster has shell disease, not all is lost! If they are able to shed their shell, the disease goes with it, and they are safe. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. First, younger lobsters benefit from multiple molts a year as they are growing very fast. They are rarely killed because shell disease does not have the time to develop to advanced stages. For older lobsters, molting is reduced to once a year in the summer. This means that if the lobster is vulnerable to shell disease due to a compromised shell, it may develop lesions at some point during the year. As a result, the most severe cases are expected right before molting. As long as the infection hasn’t made its way through the epidermal cell layer, the lobster has a chance to molt the shell and have a new beginning, disease free with a new shell. Otherwise, the infection enters the blood stream and kills the lobster.\nFemales have an added hurdle to overcome because they don’t molt while carrying eggs. Molting for these females may be delayed for up to six months! This means any lesions on the shell have six more months to reach the blood stream. Large, healthy and reproductively successful females are extremely important for sustaining a population, so it’s disconcerting to see this condition having an exaggerated effect on females.\nBut where there are problems, there are people seeking solutions. One idea is to supplement their diets by feeding lobsters in their traps with bait that contains more minerals needed for shell growth. Another idea is to harvest them sooner after they molt. This may decrease the amount of lobsters caught with shell disease as it hasn’t had time to establish itself. Lobsters with shell disease are usually either discarded or if abundant they are sent to the cannery. Since the lesions are only on the cuticle, the meat is perfectly fine. Lobsters with shell disease are not desirable for boiling in the shell because the lovely cherry red color is replaced with a rusted-metal look.\nAboard the NOAA Ship Henry B.

{"question":"What are the recommended maintenance practices for bermudagrass in terms of fertilization and irrigation, and how should these practices be modified when dealing with stem maggot infestations?","answer":"Bermudagrass requires plenty of nitrogen in its soil and benefits from fertilizer application. With proper fertilization, frequent mowing, and adequate watering, it produces a dense, dark green turf. However, when dealing with stem maggot infestations, maintenance practices need to be adjusted. If BSM damage occurs early in the regrowth stage (when grass is 6-8 inches tall), the damaged grass must be removed before applying insecticides. For effective BSM control, insecticide applications should be made with at least 12-15 gallons of water per acre to ensure adequate canopy penetration, and spraying should be done when flies are most active - typically before 11 a.m. and targeting about 8 inches above the soil surface.","context":["You spend a lot of time and money on your lawn and don’t want to see it wilt in dry, scorching conditions. With climate change making rainfall unpredictable, you may want to select drought-tolerant grass for your yard. In this article, we’ll introduce you to the top 10 drought-tolerant grasses.\nTurfgrass can use up a lot of water, and in periods of drought, landscaping is often the first target for water restrictions. Luckily, there are drought-tolerant grasses available for all Hardiness Zones – a handy metric the USDA uses to determine which plants thrive in which regions.\nThese drought-tolerant turfgrasses will keep your yard green no matter the weather.\nZoysiagrass is a drought-tolerant warm-season turfgrass that does particularly well in transition zones where lawns experience both brutal heat and chilling cold. It thrives with little maintenance and occasional watering, and tolerates cold, heat, and shade.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 6-11\nVarieties: Meyer, Zenith (zones 6-7); Cavalier, Zorro, Emerald, El Toro, Zenith, Zeon (zones 8-10)\nCare: Zoysiagrass will take longer to establish than other turfgrasses, but once settled it requires less mowing and repairs itself. Full sun is best, but it can tolerate shade.\nCost: Zoysiagrass sod has an average cost of around 50 cents per square foot.\nBuffalograss is the only grass native to North America used as turfgrass, making it perfect for homeowners who prefer to grow native species. This warm-season grass gets its name from the American bison, who eat it as a forage diet.\nBuffalograss is among the most heat- and drought-tolerant turfgrass species. Historically, it’s perfect for lawns in the western prairie and plains, but cultivars have developed to extend its adaptation regions.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 3-9\nVarieties: Legacy (zones 3-6), Prestige (zones 5-9), Bison, Bowie, Plains\nCare: The best time to plant is late spring or early summer. Proper irrigation is important while planting, but once established, it can survive without watering and it should only be watered to prevent dormancy or keep the grass growing.\nBuffalograss is low density, so it’s at risk of weed competition. Don’t overfertilize or use products that aren’t labeled for buffalograss.\nCost: Buffalograss is more expensive than other turfgrass varieties due to the difficulty of harvesting seeds. Seed packets run around $8 per ounce.\nBermudagrass can be considered a convenient turfgrass option or a troublesome weed, depending on the needs of your yard. In agriculture, it’s considered a pest for corn fields and vineyards and is difficult to eradicate due to its deep rhizomes and seed production. As a lawn grass, however, its resilience makes it appealing for homeowners in warmer climates.\nNative to tropical and subtropical regions, Bermudagrass thrives with heavy rainfall but can survive in arid climates with some supplemental watering. Its ability to go dormant and produce seeds under stress conditions helps it survive extreme drought.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 3-9\nVarieties: Sunturf, Tiflawn\nCare: Bermudagrass needs plenty of nitrogen in its soil, so you may want to apply fertilizer. With frequent mowing and adequate fertilization and watering, Bermudagrass produces a dense, dark green turf. It does produce a lot of pollen, however.\nCost: Bermudagrass seed costs between $7 and $10 per pound.\n4. Kentucky Bluegrass\nKentucky bluegrass is less drought-tolerant than other fescues, but its ability to go dormant under stress helps it weather drought with reduced watering. This cool-season grass is adapted to a wide range of climates, and can handle both warm summers and cold winters.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 3-9\nVarieties: Kentucky bluegrass has hundreds of cultivars due to its long history of development, including Galaxy, Merion, and Windsor.\nCare: Kentucky bluegrass is particularly drought-tolerant when it’s young, but thatch buildup will reduce its resilience. It can be paired with other drought-tolerant grasses to increase lawn health and shade tolerance.\nCost: Kentucky bluegrass seed costs around $7.50 per pound.\n5. Red Fescue\nRed fescue is a low-maintenance, cool-season grass that thrives in shade and cold conditions. It’s a perfect companion for Kentucky bluegrass and can go dormant in the summer to weather drought.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 1-7 (perennial); 8-10 (annual)\nVarieties: Creeping red fescue, Chewings fescue\nCare: Red fescue doesn’t need much fertilizer or water. It should be mown relatively high. While it does well in shade, cold, and drought, it has low heat tolerance.\nCost: Creeping red fescue seed runs around $7 per pound, while Chewings fescue seed is approximately $6 per pound.\nBahiagrass is a warm-season grass that’s native to South America and particularly common in the Southeast U.S. Its deep root systems and prolific seed production make it tolerant of drought, shade, and poor drainage, and it’s also resistant to many pests and diseases.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 7-10\nVarieties: Common bahiagrass, Pensacola bahiagrass\nCare: Bahiagrass should be planted in the spring to avoid the worst of weed competition, and be sure to keep control over weeds during establishment.\nCost: A five-pound bag of bahiagrass seed is available for around $35.\n7. St. Augustinegrass\nSt. Augustinegrass is a shade-tolerant warm-season grass. Native to the Gulf Coast, it creates a lush blue-green lawn with dense turf. It has a high tolerance for salt, making it ideal for coastal regions. It’s also drought-tolerant and won’t need watering until it shows signs of stress.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 8-11\nVarieties: Palmetto, Floratam, Raleigh, Mercedes, Bitterblue, Jade\nCare: St. Augustinegrass can be high maintenance and should be mown at the recommended height and fertilized regularly. It is susceptible to winter injury and damage from chinch bugs.\nCost: St. Augustinegrass installation is typically around 80 cents per square foot.\nDrought-Tolerant Ornamental Grasses\nIf you’re looking to add drought-tolerant accents to your yard, check your local ordinances first. In Nevada, a recent water conservation law now bans the use of decorative grasses at office parks, housing developments, and street medians.\nWith these hardy ornamental grasses, however, you’ll save water and keep your front yard fresh.\n1. Fountain Grass\nFountain grass provides an elegant appearance, with clumps of draping leaves and flower spikes that sway in the breeze. It prefers dry soils with full sun, making it a great choice for a drought-tolerant yard, but it can thrive in partial shade and most soil conditions.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 4-10\nVarieties: Fox Trot (zone 4), Cassian (zones 5-6), Redhead (zones 5-6)\nCare: Fountain grass can become invasive in warmer climates, and it may struggle to survive in wet years. It’s recommended to divide and replant clumps every three years to rejuvenate the plant, though for smaller ones this may not be necessary.\nCost: A gallon pot of fountain grass costs about $25.\n2. Blue Fescue\nBlue fescue is also known as sheep grass, and it’s prized for its drought tolerance and beautiful silver-blue to blue-green color. In mild climates, it stays green year-round. Blue fescue is a versatile plant that thrives in many conditions and can be grown in rock gardens, rain gardens, or as landscape edging.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 4-9\nVarieties: Elijah Blue, Sea Urchin, Boulder Blue\nCare: Blue fescue can be short-lived in wet soil and areas with high temperatures. It should be trimmed back to 3 or 4 inches in early spring to remove dead foliage and allow new growth.\nCost: “Boulder Blue” blue fescue plants are available for about $15.\n3. Prairie Dropseed\nPrairie dropseed is a unique ornamental grass native to the Great Plains, though it’s also found in some parts of the Midwest and Northeast. This resilient warm-season grass overwinters by turning a beautiful bronze color, and in the summer, it grows tiny pink-and-brown flowers with a smell that resembles licorice or popcorn.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 3-9\nVarieties: Tara, Morning Mist\nCare: Prairie dropseed tolerates both drought and periodic wet conditions. Once established, it requires very little care aside from removing old foliage in early spring, and doesn’t have any serious pest problems. It’s difficult to start from seed and is often grown from plugs or divisions.\nCost: A 12-pack of plugs costs about $30.\nFAQ About Drought-Tolerant Grasses\nDrought-tolerant grass can weather periods of drought on minimal water through dormancy and other adaptations. “Drought-tolerant” shouldn’t be confused with “drought-resistant” – the latter means that a plant can survive on NO water for long periods of time.\nTo keep your grass healthy in drought, reduce fertilization, water deeply and less frequently to encourage longer root growth, and mow your grass at the highest recommended height.\nYes, mowing your grass at the highest recommended height will increase leaf area to encourage more photosynthesis, allowing grass to better survive stress periods like drought.\nWhen to Call a Lawn Care Pro for Help\nIf you’re brainstorming the perfect drought-tolerant grasses for your yard, a professional can provide insight on the best options for your area and your lawn’s needs. Whether you’re choosing between options or need help setting up your drought-tolerant yard, our LawnStarter pros are just a call or click away.","Declaring war on bermudagrass stem maggot\n|By Lisa Baxter|\nThe author is an extension forage specialist with the University of Georgia who is based in Tifton.\nThe bermudagrass stem maggot (BSM; Atherigona reversura Villenueve) has severely damaged bermudagrass pastures and hayfields throughout the southeast U.S. since it was first discovered in southern Georgia. Since the 2010 discovery, the BSM has spread throughout the Southeast, damaging bermudagrass hayfields and pastures as far north as North Carolina and Kentucky and as far west as Texas.\nCurrent control protocol\nAlthough pyrethroid insecticides are the most effective way to control the adult BSM, they are not effective on the larva or pupae. It is the larval feeding at the uppermost node of the plant that will kill the top two to three leaves on the stem, giving the forage canopy the characteristic “frosted” appearance.\nIf the BSM damage occurs near the end of a regrowth cycle (within a week of harvest), the yield loss is estimated to be less than 10 percent, so harvest can proceed as normal. However, if the hay crop is damaged at an early stage of regrowth (for example, 6 to 8 inches tall), it will not grow out of the damage. When this occurs, it is crucial to remove (mow and harvest, if possible) the damaged grass before making an insecticide application.\nThe adult BSM can be controlled with two applications of pyrethroid insecticides, one sprayed seven to 10 days after harvest and one sprayed seven to 10 days after the first application. Each chemical is different, so be sure to read and follow the labeled rate and instructions.\nTwo applications are necessary to effectively suppress the BSM population and protect the bermudagrass during the most sensitive phases of regrowth. While this recommendation is certainly effective, recent research has discovered simple ways to improve the effectiveness of the insecticide applications and fine-tune the recommendation for your own farm.\nScout early and oftenYou can easily use sticky traps or sweep nets to collect and identify the adult BSM fly in the field. To date, sticky traps have only been useful for alerting the producer to the presence of the BSM. Fly counts on sticky trap cards have not been observed to correlate with fly populations. If sticky traps are used, secure the traps to stakes at 8 inches above the soil surface.\nSweep net estimates have been found to be relatively accurate predictors of actual fly populations in the field. It is not uncommon to find 50 to 80 flies in a sample of 10 sweeps during July to September (peak BSM damage season). This translates to about 300,000 to 500,000 flies per acre.\nWhen using a sweep net, sweep deep into the canopy, as the adult BSM does not fly very high. While the flies are more active in the morning hours, it is difficult to sweep if dew is present. Scout your fields just after the morning dew dries off the grass, or around noon.\nTransfer your sample (about 10 to 15 sweeps) to an “insect cube” or a plastic bag and place it in a freezer for five to 10 minutes. Remove the cube/bag from the freezer and count the number of flies. If you have observed a significant (30 percent) level of damage in your field and find at least 40 to 50 flies in your sample, then it’s time to employ the appropriate control strategy.\nDon’t spray until necessary\nResearch has shown that the BSM only significantly reduces herbage mass from late July to September each year. This would generally correspond to the third, fourth, and/or fifth harvest of the year for bermudagrass hay producers in the Deep South states. If the BSM population is not large enough to significantly reduce herbage mass outside of this peak season, then it is not necessary or economical to spray pyrethroid insecticides during the early (May to June) and late (October) harvests.\nScouting for the adult BSM flies with sweep net samples can help determine when you need to start spraying. Deferring insecticide applications until at least July would not only reduce economic inputs but would also slow the potential resistance of the BSM to pyrethroids by preventing their overuse.\nPenetrate the canopy\nIn our experience, the BSM do not fly very high or far (less than 10 feet) in any single instance of flight, even after being disturbed. Preliminary results from on-farm research collaborations with county extension agents and coordinators have shown that the BSM fly is most active 8 inches above the soil surface and before 11 a.m. Therefore, normal spray boom heights should be effective for chemical applications.\nSince the BSM flies tend to remain deep in the canopy, applications that do not penetrate the canopy may have limited success. Apply the insecticide in at least 12 to 15 gallons of water per acre to ensure adequate canopy penetration.\nCurrently, there are more than a dozen active research trials at the University of Georgia (UGA) related to various aspects of BSM management. The Georgia Beef Commission has supported much of our past and current research efforts. The goals of these trials are to better understand the BSM’s life cycle, screen new insecticides, and fine-tune the management recommendations. In addition, the USDA-ARS forage breeding team in Tifton, Ga., has screened potential new lines for their tolerance to BSM damage. Six potential lines were selected from the group and are undergoing additional testing for yield and forage quality.\nA new UGA Extension bulletin, “Managing bermudagrass stem maggots,” is available online at www.georgiaforages.com or for immediate download by scanning the QR (Quick Response) code provided.

{"question":"How do R-values and humidity levels work together to impact home comfort? I'd love to understand both aspects!","answer":"R-values and humidity levels are both crucial factors in home comfort. R-value measures an insulating material's thermal resistance or ability to resist heat flow - higher R-values indicate better insulation performance. The R-value is determined by factors including material type, thickness, and density. For optimal home comfort, insulation with appropriate R-values should be combined with proper humidity control. The ideal indoor humidity level during heating season should be between 30-40%. When humidity exceeds 40% during cold weather, it can lead to problems like condensation on cold surfaces and reduced insulation effectiveness. The type and amount of insulation needed varies based on climate, heating/cooling systems, and specific areas requiring insulation. Various insulation types are available, from blanket insulation (most common) to spray foam, each with different R-values and applications.","context":["Insulation adds to the overall comfort and energy-efficiency of your home. How well it does its job depends largely on its r-value. Almost everyone has a basic idea of how insulation works. You place it in empty spaces between the walls to prevent air from passing through. It’s the mechanisms behind this that make it a little more complex.\nUnderstanding Convection, Conduction, and Radiation\nConvection, conduction, and radiation are the three basic mechanisms of heat flow.\n- Convection – refers to the circulation of heat through liquids and gases. It explains why warm air rises while cooler air remains low in your home.\n- 2. Conduction – describes the way heat moves through solid objects.\n- Radiation – radiant heat always travels in a straight line. It heats solid objects along the way that are capable of absorbing its energy.\nMost insulation materials are designed to slow conductive heat flow. It also slows convective heat flow, although to a lesser extent. You can also buy radiant barriers or reflective insulation that reduce radiant heat absorption by reflecting heat away instead of absorbing it.\nIn any setting, heat will flow from the warmer area to one that is cooler until it reaches the same temperature. In your home, that means that heated air inside will flow into adjacent areas that are cooler such as garages, basements, attics, and outdoors. This is why an insulated garage door can help make your entire home more comfortable and fuel-efficient. During the summer when air is cooled indoors, heat comes into your home. Insulation can be used to keep warm air indoors or outdoors.\nWhat Is an R-Value?\nR-value is the measurement of an insulating material’s thermal resistance, or ability to resist heat flow. The higher the R-value, the better it is at insulating. The R-value is assigned based on a number of factors including the type of material it is, the thickness, and its density. Some types of insulation have R-values based on temperature, moisture accumulation, and aging. Insulation that is made from layers of various materials are rated according to the R-values of each individual layer.\nChoosing Insulation for Your House\nThe more insulation you install in your home, the greater the R-value will be. Not all homes require the same degree of insulation. You need to consider the climate where you live, the type of heating and cooling used, and which areas you need to insulate.\nTypes of Insulation\nThere are many types of insulation on the market for you to choose from. You’ll need to know where you want to install the insulation and the R-value before you choose insulation. The proper installation makes a huge difference in whether the insulation performs to its R-Value. Some are suitable as DIY projects while you need to hire professionals to install others. The basic types of insulation are:\n- Blanket: Batts & Rolls – Made from mineral wool, plastic, or natural fibers and used in unfinished walls, floors, and ceilings.\n- Concrete Block Insulation – Includes foam board place on the outside of walls in new construction and on the inside of walls of existing homes. Good for unfinished walls and foundation walls.\n- Foam Board (Rigid Foam)– Made from polystyrene, polyisocyanurate, or polyurethane. Used in unfinished walls, floors and ceilings, and unvented low-slope roofs.\n- Insulating Concrete Forms (ICFs)– Foam boards or blocks used in unfinished walls for new construction.\n- Loose–Fill and Blown-In – Made from fiberglass, cellulose, or mineral wool. Used in enclosed existing or new wall cavities, unfinished attic floors, hard-to-reach areas.\n- Reflective System– This includes foil-faced kraft paper, polyethylene bubbles, plastic film, or cardboard. Used in unfinished walls, ceilings, and floors. A reflective system really doesn’t have an R-value due to the way it reflects heat flow instead of absorbing it.\n- Rigid Fibrous or Fiber Insulation– Made of fiberglass or mineral wool. Used in ducts of unconditioned spaces and other places where insulation is needed to withstand high temperatures.\n- Sprayed Foam and Foamed-In-Place – Materials include cementitious, phenolic, polyisocyanurate, and polyurethane. Used in enclosed existing walls, open new wall cavities, and unfinished attic floors.\n- Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs)– Made of foam board or liquid, foam insulation core, and straw core insulation. Used in unfinished walls, floors, ceilings, and roofs for new construction.\nOf these types, blanket insulation is the most commonly used type of insulation, most often in fiberglass. This type of insulation comes in widths that are suited for use in walls and attics, making self-application easier. When using insulation with a lower R-value than needed, this type of insulation can be used in more than one layer.\nDraft-Proof Windows and Doors\nInsulating your home starts with selecting the right insulation for all the empty spaces where air gets in or out. Draft-proofing all of your doors and windows helps even more. Weather stripping is an inexpensive and easy way to block drafts around windows and doors. Don’t overlook places like pipes that lead outside or old door sweeps.\nGarage doors are frequently overlooked when considering the overall energy-efficiency of a home. The fact is that it’s often the largest opening to the home. Whether your garage is heated or not, an insulated door can help stop the transfer of air between your home and the outdoors. There are some beautiful choices in insulated garage doors available today. They also come in a range of R-values, typically between R-8 and R-32.\nIf your garage door still has some life left in it, another option is to insulate your door. A simple DIY project could result in a more comfortable home and significant savings on your energy bill. If your door is outdated and in need of repair, it might be time to start shopping for an energy-efficient replacement.\nContact Coastal Garage Doors to get a free estimate and get an honest quote for a new insulated garage door. There’s a lot to love about insulated doors including greater durability, quieter operation, and better protection for your car. A warmer garage is more convenient and comfortable, even if you’re just passing through!","The word \"moisture\" refers to water vapor mixed with air.\nMost of the moisture generated in the home is dissipated by the movement of moisture-laden\nair out of the home. As homes become more energy-efficient, the number\nof paths of escape are reduced, and dealing with moisture becomes more\nDuring the heating season, the indoor humidity level should\nhover around 30 percent to 40 percent. When indoor humidity exceeds 40\npercent during cold weather, moisture problems begin to appear. One symptom\nof a high humidity level is condensation forming on cold surfaces.\nlevels of humidity are often the result of too much moisture vapor generated\nHEATING AND VENTILATION magazine provides builders with reference data on sources of water vapor. For instance, cooking for a family of four adds 4.5 pounds of moisture a day to a house. Each shower contributes half a pound; a weekly laundry, 30 pounds; human occupancy contributes 6 to 3 pounds per day; dish washing 1.2 pounds, etc.\nSo you see that the modern living of a family of four can easily release 150 pounds, or more than 18 gallons of water per week into the air in your home!\nAll of this moisture MUST eventually escape from your home.\nCondensation will occur whenever\nthe window surface is cool enough to allow moisture in the air to condense\non it, which is why some condensation can be expected in the winter - condensation should be controlled as much as possible since it can damage the window's components, cause the wood to rot and saturate the wall insulation reducing its effectiveness.\n(An example of condensation: A glass of ice water sweats because the warm air that surrounds the glass meets the cold surface and causes....you guessed it, Condensation)\nMoisture on the inside of the storm window (or outside pane).\nIndicates that the prime window is allowing air and moisture to leak\nout to the storm window where it condenses. Stopping these air leaks with\ncaulk and weather stripping will stop the condensation and ultimately save\nyour window. It is also important to understand that too little humidity\nis bad for your house. Manufacturers claiming that low humidity (15 percent)\nis best for windows may be covering for a poor quality product. Good windows\nshould not have excessive condensation at normal humidity levels (30 percent\nto 40 percent).\nMoisture on the inside of a window pane:\nThis is a sign that airborne water is trapped in the house due to poor\nair circulation and exchange.\nMoisture between single pane windows and exterior storms:\nStorm window frames are made with a breathing hole that permits condensation\nto escape. These breathing holes often become plugged or puttied shut over\ntime. When this happens, moist air becomes trapped and condensation appears.\nTo fix the problem, unplug the holes.\nSteps to Reduce Excessive Humidity:\nRecognize that the best way to stop condensation is to reduce the moisture\nin the inside air. Here are a few tips:\nVent gas burners and clothes dryers to the outside. Dryer and kitchen range exhaust fans should never be vented to the attic.\nInstall exhaust fans in the kitchen, bathrooms, and laundry rooms.\nControlling or covering other sources of humidity (radiator water pans, fish tanks, large numbers of plants, etc.).\nInstalling a dehumidifier.\nOpening fireplace damper.\nVentilating the crawl space or basement: Install foundation vents or leave a basement window cracked in the fall or early winter to ventilate your basement or crawlspace.\nAnother positive measure is to connect a small duct from the outdoors\nto the return side of a forced-air heating system, so that fresh air is\ndrawn into the house whenever the system is operating. A damper placed\nin this duct will allow the home owner to control incoming air.\nA simpler method is to simply crack a window somewhere in the home.\nVentilating the attic: Because of vapor pressure, the moist warm air from your home can go right through your ceiling into your attic. If your attic is not ventilated, the humid air will condense on the cold underside of your roof. This condensation can start to rot the roof boards, cause ice dams, or drip down onto the ceiling below and damage your plaster, paint, and attic insulation.\nWall Insulation: To prevent or reduce condensation problems inside your walls and protect your insulation, the side of the insulation\nexposed to high vapor pressure (warm side in winter) must be covered with\nmaterial that will impede the natural drive of moisture to flow through\nthe inside surfaces of exterior walls, toward the lower vapor pressure\noutside. To be effective, such a material must have a high resistance to\nmoisture flow. The material is usually called \"vapor retarder.\"\nMore on this subject in the Home Insulation section."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e06c8e68-8627-438b-b4c9-902b3d113382>","<urn:uuid:0d0669ae-ed1f-4e40-984e-de79ecd76ebc>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Please explain how freeze-dried fish food works and what precaution should take when using it?","answer":"Freeze-dried foods have all moisture removed during manufacturing, giving them a long shelf life and easy storage. They're available in forms like worms, insect larvae, and crustaceans. However, they can expand significantly when moistened and the freeze-drying process can remove vitamins, making them unsuitable as a complete diet. It's recommended to moisten them before feeding to prevent fish from overeating.","context":["As with any living being, it is of vital importance that your fish receives a healthy, balanced diet. Diverse types will have different needs, some variety of aquarium fish will prefer fresh or frozen food, while others will be content with the humble fish flake. Discover just what your fish will favour using my helpful guide.\nBasically, there are four types of fish food- fish flakes, fish pellets, frozen food, and dried food such as algae and seaweed.\nFish flakes are possibly the most common form of fish food. You can buy specific types that will be tailored to the kind of fish you own, and they’re ideal for creating a nutritious base to your pet’s diet. Some flakes are designed to meet the nutritional needs of specific varieties of fish, some are made to counter nutritional imbalances, while others are balanced to enhance colour or growth or even to encourage spawning.\nMuch the same as fish flakes, fish food pellets are a good stable food source. You can buy different types to suit where your fish like to discover their food, whether that’s on the surface of the tank, in the gravel, or mid-way between. This is because pellets are available in forms that are either denser or lighter than water. This means the fish are able to feed in a more natural way. Certain varieties of fish like to feed off the bottom of the tank while others prefer to feed on the water surface. In the same way as flakes, pellets come in many variations, each with an explicit purpose.\nFrozen foods are a great option to provide a little treat every now and again. Typical frozen fish foods include krill and plankton. Frozen foods are available from most pet shops in a wide variety – from squid and shrimp to spirulina algae and vegetables. You will also find processed, vitamin enhanced staple diets as well as aquarium delicacies like insect larvae. The assortment of frozen foods available can deliver wide-ranging and steady nourishment for most fish. The procedures that the foods go through during freezing significantly diminish the danger of disease transmission when compared to live or fresh foods while still preserving a high nutritional value.\nFreeze-dried foods have all of the moisture removed from them during the manufacturing process significantly extending the long shelf life and making storage easier. Many worms, insect larvae, crustaceans are offered in freeze-dried forms. One drawback with freeze dried foods is the freeze-drying process can often remove vitamins from the food, so freeze dried foods should not be expected to make a balanced and complete diet on their own. It should be noted that freeze-dried foods can absorb a lot of water, and will expand more than you might think when looking at them in the package. I recommend you moisten them before feeding to your fish to keep your fish from overeating.\nGenerally, you should only need to feed your fish once a day, nevertheless, the trick with feeding them is to make sure there is nothing leftover after a minute or so of giving it to them. If you feed them too often, or if food begins to settle on the tank floor, the water can carry a higher level of unnecessary waste, which will ultimately adversely affect the welfare of your fish."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8749aa26-942f-424c-8c97-1d0b646cd246>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Please explain how immune system problems caused by stress affect both mouth and hair health?","answer":"Immune system problems caused by stress can affect both mouth and hair health in distinct ways. In the mouth, immune system issues can contribute to oral lesions and canker sores, which can be painful and affect quality of life. For hair health, stress-related immune system complications can lead to alopecia areata, an autoimmune condition where the body's natural defenses become confused and attack healthy hair follicles, resulting in coin-shaped patches of hair loss on the scalp and beard area. Both conditions are triggered by inflammation related to immune system dysfunction.","context":["Very few people enjoy trips to the dentist. How often do you hear someone declare that they can’t wait to go for their regular tooth cleaning? The grinding, the chipping away with sharp instruments, and the polishing is enough to make most squirm just reading this. But, while the experience may be unpleasant, it is extremely important to get regular dental checkups and to maintain overall oral health.\nWhile we often think of oral health issues as being isolated to the mouth and teeth, oral health and total overall health are linked. Poor oral hygiene can, of course, lead to issues such as tooth decay and gum disease. However, it can also result in cardiovascular disease, endocarditis, and potentially premature birth. Conversely, common disease states such as diabetes and osteoporosis can cause oral health issues. Additionally, some common medications such as antihistamines, diuretics, and decongestants can have a negative impact on oral health factors such as saliva production. Therefore it is important to maintain good oral hygiene for both healthy and unhealthy individuals.\nSo what preventative steps can we take to maintain oral health? Well the first should be easy, as all of us learned it from the time we were toddlers. Brushing at least twice a day helps to remove acid build up on the teeth from the breakdown of food, thus preserving the protective enamel that coats the teeth. Brush thoroughly, being sure to contact all surfaces of the teeth. If brushing after each meal isn’t always possible, rinse your mouth with water after eating to help wash away food particles. And while recent research has called into question the benefits of flossing, it is certainly not harmful to floss at least once a day to provide an even more thorough cleaning.\nMuch like all other aspects of health, what we ingest plays a large role in oral health. Tobacco usage has a large negative impact on dental health and should be avoided. Likewise, high sugar containing beverages like soda and juices should be limited, as sugar can wear on the enamel of the teeth. Additionally, obtaining the right amount of calcium in the diet is essential as that can help to strengthen the teeth.\nFinally, bite the bullet and see your dentist regularly. Not only are routine checkups great for maintaining hygiene, but they can also spot issues such as cavities early before they become difficult (and expensive!) to treat. Visit the dentist at least twice per year, and whenever toothaches or jaw pain appears.\nWhile we often think oral health issues are limited to being treated in the dentist’s office, and many are, such as cavities and root canals, as a pharmacist, I often treat patients experiencing some difficult conditions related to the oral cavity.\nOne of the most common complaints patients present to us with in the community pharmacy is dry mouth. This can be the result of many different factors such as medication, other disease states, or improper diet. Obviously staying properly hydrated is a key factor to treatment in this arena, but sometimes, that is not enough. In those cases, patients can benefit from over the counter products that help to increase mouth lubrication, such as Lubricity™, a topical spray used after each meal. For patients with extremely difficult to treat dry mouth, medications which enhance salivary production, such as pilocarpine, can be made in special dosage forms like lozenges or lollipops. By sucking on the lozenge or lollipop, the patient gets an increase in saliva production while avoiding side effects in the rest of the body from the drug.\nAnother condition we see quite often in our practice is patients with oral lesions. These sores, such as canker sores, can be extremely painful, and interfere greatly with quality of life. These conditions can result from a variety of factors, be it stress, diet, or other illnesses, and can be stubborn to treat. Some of the best treatments for these are oral medicated mouth rinses which combine multiple drug classes, such as steroids, antibiotics, antifungals, and anesthetics, into one rinse. These rinses often go by names such as “Rothwell’s” or “Magic Mouthwash”, and are swished around in the mouth regularly throughout the day to coat the sores, and help to both soothe irritation and speed healing.\nFinally another condition we sometimes see is “burning mouth syndrome”. Burning mouth is just what it sounds like in that it often causes a strong tingling or burning sensation throughout the mouth. This sensation is often felt on a consistent basis and can be quite difficult to deal with. Many patients experiencing this may benefit from over the counter supplements like lipoic acid which may help to alleviate the nerve sensation. For those patients with difficult to treat instances of burning mouth, medications such as clonazepam and capsaicin can be made into mouth rinses or lozenges. By placing these medications in the mouth, the overactive nerves causing the burning are in effect numbed out, and the patient achieves relief.\nThese types of specialty medications and supplements listed above are generally found at pharmacies which specialize in vitamin supplementation and the art of compounding, such as Pine Pharmacy in Williamsville.\nFollowing proper oral hygiene and having any dental issues addressed in a timely fashion is a great way to keep your mouth clean and healthy, and stop it from affecting other aspects of your health. Don’t ignore it, or else you will find yourself regularly in the dentist’s chair, and paying a lot of hefty dental bills. Remember, there is a reason root canals are often used as a metaphor for some of the most unpleasant things in life, so do your best to prevent them!","Stress can build up for many different reasons, but can it cause hair loss? It may sound like a made-up fact, but stress-related hair loss is very real. The irony is that losing your hair in itself can be a very stressful experience, so many men fall into a vicious cycle. The good news is that hair loss from stress is rarely permanent, so long as you can control or manage whatever it is that’s putting you under pressure. This guide will give you the facts on stress and hair loss to help you bounce back.\nThe link between stress and hair loss\nWe shed between 50 and 100 hairs a day, which is just a small number compared to the other 150,000 hairs on your scalp. Problems occur when this hair doesn’t grow back. If stress is causing your hair to fall out, you may have what’s known as telogen effluvium. This is when the body releases high amounts of the stress hormone cortisol. It’s what gives us our fight or flight response, which is why it’s common to feel on edge when you’re stressed. Unfortunately this process causes a hormonal imbalance that temporarily turns off your hair follicles and pushes them into a ‘resting phase’. This resting phase happens while your body deals with whatever threat it’s detecting. In this case, stress.\nDifferent types of stress-related hair loss\nTelogen effluvium isn’t the only cause of stress-related hair loss. Some men may find that stress causes problems with their immune system which then attacks the hair follicles; some even uncontrollably pull their hair out themselves. We’ll explain more in this section.\nThere’s a good chance you’ve heard of alopecia. If you haven’t, it’s when you begin to lose hair from separate parts of your scalp. This is different from male pattern baldness, which often starts at the crown or recedes from the forehead. There are different types of alopecia, but the one we’re concerned with is alopecia areata. If you suspect alopecia areata you’ll likely notice coin-shaped patches around your scalp and beard area.\nAlopecia areata is triggered by inflammation, brought on by complications with your immune system. It’s what we call an autoimmune disease: the body’s natural defenses get confused and begin attacking healthy cells. Alopecia areata is more common in people going through severe stress. That could be from trauma, injury or a sudden death. We all manage stress in different ways and we all have methods of coping, although some can be more harmful to your recovery than others.\nYou’ll probably be aware of trichotillomania without having ever known the name. Trichotillomania, or trich, is a mental health condition that causes people to pull their hair out. Often a person might pull their hair out as a direct response to a stressful situation or they might not be aware that they are doing it. The reasons for trich are fairly unknown, but doctors liken it to the imbalance of brain chemicals that causes OCD.\nHow to know if your hair loss is caused by stress\nAs well as obviously feeling stressed, there are many other tell-tale signs to be aware of if you experience hair loss. For starters, hair loss from stress is more sudden and likely to occur in random places of your scalp. Male pattern baldness, which is often hereditary is a more gradual process. You may notice your hair thinning out over several years or your father may have gone bald or receded at a similar age as you.\nWhat if you were stressed several months ago but aren’t stressed now? Many men say they’ve begun losing hair weeks, months or years after feeling stressed. That’s because the hair loss cycle isn’t immediate. You may have to wait several months for your hair to grow back naturally or in the worst circumstances several years, which is why many men opt for medication. We’ll explain this in more detail later on.\nCommon questions about stress and hair loss\n1. Can stress cause hair loss and will it grow back?\nThe answer to both questions is yes. The three main conditions that cause stress related hair loss are telogen effluvium, alopecia areata and trichotillomania. Thankfully, hair loss from stress is usually temporary.\n2. Can stress and anxiety cause hair loss?\nYes. When we feel anxious our bodies go into their fight or flight mode, which triggers the hormone cortisol. This process places the scalp in a resting period. As a result, the hair that’s shed isn’t replaced, which leads to thinning or balding.\n3. How do you stop hair loss from stress?\nThe best way to stop stress-related hair loss is to manage whatever it is that’s causing you stress in the first place. There are varying levels of stress and everyone differs in how they handle it.\n4. Can stress cause bald spots?\nSevere stress can cause alopecia areata, which often leaves bald spots in different parts of the scalp. This is due to inflammation brought on by your immune system. Other hair loss is categorized by thinning or hair simply falling out in large chunks.\nManaging your stress and hair loss medication\nBecause stress is so common there are multiple options available to get you back on track. The first place to start is a visit to your doctor, as they can refer you to a specialist therapist. If you’re not prepared to go down this route, then the other most effective way to cope with stress is to open up. Speaking to friends or family can really help. When we find ourselves in a stressful situation we have a tendency to think and act irrationally. Speaking to someone that’s less involved is often the best way to get perspective and clarity on a difficult situation.\nAs for hair loss medication, the most effective treatment is finasteride, which is also available under the brand name Propecia. Finasteride works by inhibiting the sex hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is a common cause of hair loss in men who are born more sensitive to DHT. We also offer minoxidil (also sold under the brand name Rogaine), which helps aid hair regrowth. Remember, stress is temporary and so is stress-related hair loss.

{"question":"Could you explain the unique characteristics of Sumatran teas? I'm particularly interested in learning about different varieties and their flavor profiles.","answer":"Sumatran teas, grown in rich volcanic soil, are known for their consistent quality year-round and are excellent for blending. Several notable varieties include: Light Roast Sumatra Oolong with passion fruit aroma and roasted chestnut notes; Black Pearl, naturally sweet with Washington Red apple taste; Sumatra Oolong Barisan, a high-altitude tea with floral and vanilla notes; Sumatra BOP, offering medium to strong brew with smooth finish; and Indonesia Gunung Dempo, known for its light liquor with hints of maltiness, considered one of the world's great teas.","context":["Still known as a premiere producer of coffee (as in “a cup of java,” since Java is one of the coffee growing islands there), Indonesia (formerly the Dutch East Indies) also had a reputation for the quality of its black teas. They have grown tea for over 200 years, with those teas having a reputation for producing a light and slightly sweet infusion, mainly used in mixes.\nIndonesia, made up of more than 14,000 islands spread over 3,100 miles along what is known as the ring of fire, is a country of diversity with numerous languages, ethnicities, cultures, and customs. However, instead of an Indonesian tea culture, they have a mixture of different tea cultures and tea ceremonies. You can find a Japanese tea culture, a Chinese tea culture, or watch a tea ceremony obviously influenced by India. Even influences from the Netherlands and England are around.\nAccording to various records, the first tea was planted in 1684 on Java by the Dutch, in control of the islands since 1602 under the Dutch East Indies Company banner. They used seeds from Japan for the China tea bush cultivar called Camellia Sinensis var. sinensis. The gardens didn’t flourish since the Dutch government who were in control of the islands for around 300 years didn’t have experienced staff. In 1835, they tried again, turning the gardens over to experienced private planters. The gardens thrived this time.\nSumatra, one of the main islands for tea growing with its rich volcanic soil, produces black teas known by their garden marks. They are generally the same quality year round, are good for blending, and produce a soft to medium strength cup of tea.\nSome Sumatran Teas:\n- Light Roast Sumatra Oolong — This tea has a unique aroma and flavor of passion fruit, and the light roasting brings out notes of roasted chestnuts and honey.\n- Black Pearl — A beautiful black tea that is naturally sweet with a taste said to be like Washington Red apples.\n- Sumatra Oolong Barisan — Delicate, high quality, comparable to the best Green Oolongs from Taiwan. Grown at high altitude and processed by skilled tea workers. Steeps up a fragrantly floral liquid with a jade-green color and a mild grassy flavor that turns to lush, buttery floral and vanilla notes.\n- Sumatra BOP — A medium to strong brew with a great smooth finish and an orange liquid.\n- Indonesia Gunung Dempo — The liquor tends to be light with a hint of body and maltiness and is considered one of the world’s great teas.\nA specialty in some Sumatran coffee huts is teh telur (tea with egg). It’s pretty basic and easy to make:\n- Crack a raw egg into a tall glass. [see disclaimer below]\n- Add 2 heaping spoonfuls of sugar.\n- Whip into a thick froth.\n- In a separate pot steep some strong Sumatran tea.\n- Pour (through a strainer, if you steep loose leaves) into the glass with the egg/sugar froth.\n- Whisk tea and froth together.\n- Add a generous pour of sweetened condensed milk.\nTo enjoy this tea the way the locals do, pour some into a saucer to cool it and then sip from the saucer. This also avoids egg froth moustaches.\nTry a Sumatran tea or a blend containing some of the black tea version for a very enjoyable taste. As for that raw egg concoction, try at your own risk.\nDisclaimer: Eating raw or undercooked eggs carries a risk of salmonella poisoning.\n© Online Stores, Inc., and The English Tea Store Blog, 2009-2014.

{"question":"What are the key advantages of the Virtual Machine welding control system, and what safety precautions must be taken when using welding equipment in confined spaces?","answer":"The Virtual Machine welding control system offers several key advantages: it ensures high process reliability and reproducibility by splitting welding processes into optimized individual processes, delivers superior welding quality with spatter-free results, provides maximum flexibility for complex process types, and achieves high energy efficiency (90-95%). Regarding confined space welding safety, specific precautions are mandatory: ventilation must be provided at a minimum rate of 2,000 cubic feet per minute per welder, gas cylinders and welding machines must be left outside, equipment on wheels must be securely blocked, and safety belts and lifelines must be attached to welders for quick emergency removal. Additionally, all makeup air drawn into the confined space must be clean and respirable to prevent toxic fume accumulation or oxygen deficiency.","context":["The source of best welding quality - process control virtual machine\nToday more than 5000 Virtual Machines control various arc- and spot welding systems in active production facilities worldwide, especially in the automotive field.\nWhat is the Virtual Machine?\nAll welding processes as well as processes of thermal spraying of any kind, whether hand-held or robot-controlled, must be controlled very precisely and flexibly.\nPhysical parameters, e.g. the material type of the materials to be welded, material thicknesses, current, voltage, wire feed, electrode forces, process gas flow and time have to be optimally matched in different applications and also different welding technologies. For example, in arc wire spraying the requirements vary up to an extremely individual and fine process management. At the same time, the exact reproducibility of these complex processes (process reliability) must be ensured in industrial applications.\nThis is exactly what has been done successfully by the process control \"Virtual Machine\" (Virtual machine according to Puschner, P.) at ELMA-Tech since its foundation. The Virtual Machine can therefore rightly be regarded as the essential technological core of ELMA-Tech welding technology.\nAs a welding process control, it solves the management of complex joining processes with a maximum reproducibility and with the least possible programming effort. As a process control for thermal spraying (e.g., wire arc spraying), it provides a fully flexible adjustment of spray parameters for optimized adhesion and extremely fine injection molding.\nHistorical continuity and fundamental practical knowledge\nSince 1970 Prof. Dr. Peter Puschner has developed state-of-the-art control and power electronics for welding technology. The basic techniques involved have found wide acceptance in the entire welding technology and mark the innovation point in electronic welding equipment. Worldwide patents emphasizes the innovative nature of the ELMA-Tech developments.\nIn 1997 a new control system for technological processes was implemented on the basis of these technological developments: the virtual machine. The virtual machine is used as welding process control in the by now third generation exclusively by ELMA-Tech and establishes the technological top-level that ELMA-Tech takes nowadays.\nHow does the Virtual Machine works?\nNote: the following section provides a very rough and fuzzy explanation of the Virtual Machine (VM). The explanation of the structural sequences in the computer system of the VM itself has been omitted.\nThe basic idea behind the concept of the VM as welding process control for electronic generators is highly simplified as follows: do not attempt to control the physical variables occurring in the welding process such as current and voltage of an electronic generator, since these are not exactly deterministic predeterminable due to the complexity or freedom degrees of the process.\nInstead: break down the individual process conditions during welding in very small time units or segments. Provide for your real welding machine for each of this time units a \"complete machine\" or an optimized generator, which are optimized exactly for this unit. Repeat this dismantling process according to the requirements of the respective welding task up to the end of the welding process.\nThe static and dynamic control implemented in the VM evaluates these rapidly changing process conditions. These are sequences which are happening in the thousandth of a second. The VM responds to each different state in the range of its cycle frequency of 20 kHz, thus within 50 microseconds.\nIn other words: depending on the process state, the VM provides within one second up to 20,000 different generators with optimum characteristics for a high-quality and optimal welding result. For this purpose, it uses a database, which is designed as an expert system with all necessary physical parameters, which optimally describe such generators in terms of their dynamic and static operating behavior.\nTherefore the control concept of the VM makes it possible to configure the electronic generator of the welding machine with a cycle time of 50 microseconds completely new in terms of statics and dynamics. The parameters for statics and dynamics can be selected in physical quantities as “real text”, so that a 100% reproducibility of the process control is given.\nThis makes it possible to adjust the current source characteristics optimally for different process requirements in the simplest phase-dependent manner and, for example, to meet the requirements of the arc or its plasma..\nWhy are we talking about a ‘Virtual’ Machine?\nSince each of these generators, looked at from the outside, represents classical elements of electrical engineering in their effect, for example, internal resistors or chokes, which actually act in conjunction with the process, but which are not present in reality and therefore do not generate losses, the use of the term \"virtual\" machine will be clarified - namely, as an option for a variety of possible generator states to be realized.\nOn the other hand, the computer system of the virtual machine has characteristics of a virtual system from the point of view of information theory.\nThirdly, the measuring technology of the ELMA-Tech spot welding machines have a virtual character, because it \"acts\" as if it would measure certain electrical quantities directly on the surfaces of the electrode caps of a spot welding gun, even though no measuring leads are placed there..\nAdvantages of the Virtual Machine\nThe immense advantages of using the ELMA-Tech process control vary depending on the application. However, there are some basic advantages common to all applications.\n- High process reliability means reproducibility\nThe splitting of a welding process or even of a thermal injection process into a multitude of individual processes, each of which is maximally optimized by a practice-oriented, evidence-based parameter database, ensures maximum reproducibility in accordance with carefully prepared welding programs. This is especially true for very complex processes.\n- Best welding quality\nThe exact process control of the ELMA-Tech welding machines by the welding process control Virtual Machine guarantees a very high quality of the welding results and the results of thermal spraying. In arc welding, for example, the \"very cold\" MIG AC process produces superior, warp-free seam qualities with absolutely spatter-free droplet transfer for thinnest aluminum plates and stainless steels.\n- Maximum flexibility and fast adaptability\nComplexe process types can be decomposed into different, arbitrary optimizable phases or segments, as required for example in MIG-MAG welding or in further arc welding processes. Thus, the current energetic guidance can be adapted precisely to process requirements.\n- High energy efficiency\nA generator controlled by the virtual machine always works with the efficiency of the power section (90 - 95%) irrespective of the current process state and thus is significantly superior to conventional generators in the energy yield.\nGenerators powered by a virtual machine do not offer fixed parameters to a stochastically running process, but a workspace in which the source and the process can agree on current optimal working points. This provides excellent process stability.\nEspecially in resistance spot welding this principle, combined with a virtual measurement of voltage and current at the electrode cap surfaces of the spot welding guns, ensures an optimum energy input, which can dispense with high contact pressure of the electrode arms and massive current application.\nPlug & Weld spot welding by fully automatic\nA particular advantage is the use of the virtual machine in resistance spot welding. The fully automatic point welding process is a clear and unique feature of the ELMA-Tech resistance technology and has introduced the Plug & Weld principle since 2003:\nStart the machine - select automatic mode - weld!\nSheet thicknesses and material types are automatically detected by the welding control.\n- No welding sample preparation required in advance\n- No further parameterization necessary\n- Recognize and weld high-strength steels\n- Mix different materials without parameter setting in one welding process\n- Weld easily up to 10 mm total sheet thickness\n- Aluminum welding of thin plates up to 3 mm (car body repair)\n- No need to teach staff anymore\n- Effective energy input (as much energy as necessary for an optimal result\n- Welding parameter assurance and quality assurance during spot welding\n- The SpotQS Viewer software is used to record and evaluate welding parameters for vehicle-specific spot welds. The parameters as well as the welding result can be written to the USB flash drive after finishing a welding job. The recording of the welding result corresponds to the image of the QS traffic light in the operating front of a spot welding machine.\nThe process sequence in resistance spot welding\nThe process model of the Virtual machine has 4 distinguishable tasks to carry out to ensure a high-quality weld:\n- Test of initial state through targeted energy input. Distinction between total-, partial isolation and ideal initial conditions. Detection of total thickness and steel type.\n- Induce an initial “first-spot” by introducing a specific energy input. E.g. in case of a partial isolation, which is one of most common cases, the introduction of a specific energy input will cause the workpieces to join more easily.\n- Carrying out the actual welding process (current-time program). Here the applied energy amount is continuously added up so that the welding process will end when the machine reaches the desired value.\n- Determination of shunts etc. and compensation of possibly lost energy in the welding spot.\nThe Virtual Machine thus recognizes the condition of the parts to be welded, in particular whether there are shunts through structural adhesives, paint residues or other contaminants and adjusts the program accordingly to ensure a reproducible high quality spot weld.\nProcess control of the robot gun\nUnique automatic system, in which the robot positions the welding gun in place of the point to be welded and then gives the full responsibility to the gun and the welding control (Virtual Machine). The control performs the following steps:\n- Closing the gun’s arms with automatic balancing (float operation)\n- Force build-up and detection of the overall sheet thickness\n- Calculation of the point energy to be applied\n- Starting the welding process with a phase-dependent generator characteristic\n- Energy-guided welding process and terminating the process with the calculated spot energy\n- Determination of steel quality (normal / high strength)\n- Reheating according to the determined steel quality\n- Qualification of the course of the process\n- Opening of the clamp (7th axis function)\n- Disable the gun’s balance\n- Output of the accelerating contact FK to the robot\nELMA-Tech GmbH is the only manufacturer in the field of welding and coating technology with such a wide product spectrum. All systems are based on fast-clocked power parts with very low transformer weights in the range of resistance and arc.\n- Resistance technology\nMobile and stationary spot welding machines\nManual- and robot-guided spot welding guns\n- Arc technology\nMobile arc welding machines\nHigh-power current sources for stationary heavy-duty applications\n- Surface coating\nMobile power sources for thermal spraying\nHigh-performance current sources for thermal spraying (arc welding)\nVM3 - the third generation\nOn the one hand, the constant optimization of the VM technology consists of the up to date improvement and adaptation of the hardware and operating software of the control module.\nOn the other hand, a substantial consolidation and expansion of welding programs as well of the physical process parameters take place. These parameters have either been gained in the course of customer projects or have been developed in the in-house application engineering during test welds and are now running evaluated into the VM database. In this sense the \"knowledge\" of the VM is constantly growing. Thus the VM3 is \"wiser\" than the VM2.\nCompared with the predecessor generation, the third generation of the VM comes with faster processors and a more up-to-date operating system for the communication exchange with the actual process control, which responds even much faster to adjustments of operator or robotic intervention.\nThe front panel of the VM3 (see picture) has been redesigned and consists of a 7 \"TFT color display (16: 9) with an 800 x 480 px resolution as well as LED backlight. The user interface of the VM3 is now completely multilingual. For example, the interface can be offered to Chinese-speaking users in Chinese language. Furthermore, the VM3 is prepared for networking in applications with the organizational design concept Industry 4.0.\nFor the use of ELMA-Tech welding technologies, these innovations on the operator's side guarantee noticeable improvements in the user-friendliness. With regard to the industrial process quality, the quality of the welding results or the results in the thermal spraying as a whole, the VM3 raises the bar once more upwards.\nFront panel of VM3\nVM structure and programs, all rights reserved, licensed by ELMA-IVG mbH, Aachen © Prof. Dr.-Ing.

{"question":"What are the key differences between how collectors approached trading cards socially in the past versus the current era? Please analyze the community aspects.","answer":"The social dynamics of card collecting have evolved significantly. In the past, collecting was primarily a face-to-face activity centered around local card shops and trading with friends. Today, while local shops remain important as social hubs, the community has expanded dramatically through digital channels. Modern collectors can connect globally through forums, Twitter, blogs, and participate in online group breaks where collectors gather in chat rooms to watch live box openings. These breaks create new ways to collect and socialize simultaneously. The current era offers more options for trading - from structured online deals where every penny of value is counted to casual friend-to-friend swaps. While there may be fewer total collectors than in the past, the internet has made it easier than ever to find and connect with other collectors who share specific interests.","context":["Collecting sports cards used to be simple. Every year, a handful of sets made their way to store shelves. Inserts were simple things like stickers or other one-per-pack premiums. Defining and chasing rookie cards wasn't a complicated process.

Find a Focus\nForget trying to get everything. You can't do it. So rather than ripping boxes and cases of every new product and tossing everything aside, find a focus for your sports card collection. Pick a theme or two and run with it. The options are endless and can be catered to your personal tastes. Some choose to build sets while others go after their favorite team. There are player collectors, autograph collectors and rookie card collectors. Many collectors are loyal to a specific brand. Others prospect with visions of future returns. There is no wrong focus.\nAnd don't be afraid to change your focus. As new sets come out, you may find you like a particular style of card. Or, you may choose to move on if your favorite player is traded or a set loses its appeal.\nBy getting a focus, you give yourself direction. It gives purpose to your collection. Without one, you'll likely find yourself throwing money around at random cards. And with today's prices, a lot of money can disappear very quickly.\n2. Set a Budget (and Stick to It)\nNext to finding a focus, setting a budget is probably the most important part of building your collection. It's easy to get carried away. Too easy. Deals pop up, rare cards surface, new sets come out -- all these vie for your extra cash. And if you're not careful and disciplined, you may find yourself eating more Kraft Dinner than you usually like.\nCards should always come from the money that's leftover after all the bills are paid. It sounds like a simple concept, but for many it's a tough proposition to keep.\nOnce you've decided how much you've got to spend on cards each month, stick to it. You might even want to create a simple spreadsheet or tally of your expenses.\nLook for ways to make you money go further. By shopping on eBay, you can often set your own price easily and without hassle. You can often negotiate at your local shop, but online auctions are a convenient way to hunt for bargains.\nAnd if some great deals pop up all at once? Pass some of them over. Or sell some of your collection. List on eBay. Set up at a local card show. Look at some other online sites. It has never been easier for collectors to turn their unwanted and extra cards into cash that you can then use to build your collection.\n3. Make a Wantlist\nOnce you've got your focus, compile a list of what you're looking for and type it out. Writing it on a napkin works, but there's a good chance your 5-year-old will come along and wipe the peanut butter and jelly off his face with it.\nTo take your wantlist a step further, upload it with something like Google Docs or onto Dropbox so it's with you anywhere you go. This is very handy when you stumble upon a shop while away on business or you hit up your local show.\nJust remember to update your wantlist as soon as it changes. It's easy to forget to cross something off once you've filed it away in a binder or box.\n4. Target the Whale\nWhatever your focus and no matter your budget, there's probably something rare and/or pricey that you've always wanted. Right now, it might be out of reach. But that doesn't mean you can't plan for it. Set aside a little bit of your card budget every month for a \"Whale Fund\" so that the next time one pops up, you'll be ready. Even if you're on an Opening Day budget, you can still own some Exquisite pieces.\nA big part of the thrill of collecting is the chase. It's great to have several inexpensive and easy-to-find pieces in your sites, but landing that cornerstone piece is one of the biggest rushes collectors can have.\n5. Make It a Family Affair\nAnything you can do with your family makes it that much more enjoyable. If the hobby is going to grow and thrive, it needs new collectors. Chances are, if your kids see that you're interested in something, they're likely to become interested as well. That might mean some compromises. Your daughter may not like baseball, but My Little Pony or Star Wars might be right up her alley. You might pledge your allegiance to the Yankees and your son might think Mr. Met is funny. Still, collecting cards is best shared.\nAnd don't think that it's just your kids you might want to get involved. You might even want to look for ways of getting your spouse or partner on board. My wife has always tolerated my collecting but she's never shown any interest. That was until we opened a box of Game of Thrones together. Like your kids, look for alternate options that might get them interested in busting packs with you.\n6. Try Something New\nYes, I know I said finding a focus was one of the most important things you could do with your collection. But you still need to try new things. That doesn't meant break a box of every new product. Rather, try some packs here and there. Trade for some cards from a sport you enjoy, but don't usually collect. Bounce back from a depressing episode of The Walking Dead with some cards from the show.\nExpanding your collecting horizons without going wild, can help your collection evolve. You may find you prefer a new brand. Or it may help solidify your current collecting direction.\n7. Get Social\nWhile there may not be as many collectors as there once was, it's hardly a ghost town either. Collecting is so much more enjoyable if you have someone to talk about it with. Even if you failed at getting your family on board, there's no excuse for not being social with the hobby. Join a forum, get on Twitter, start a blog. If you're a sports card hermit, things will get very boring.\nWhen many of my friends stopped collecting, I found a huge community online. Not only did it make collecting easier, it rejuvenated me and got me more excited about collecting than ever.\nWith the expansion of social media, getting connected has never been easier.\n8. Start Trading\nNow that you're connected with other collectors, you can leverage those relationships into getting some of the cards you want. By being social, you can also usually find someone who is looking for your extra cards.\nTrading is one of the purest forms of collecting. For many, the evolution of the hobby has taken it back to where it began. There are literally thousands of collectors online who swap cards. Some demand structured deals where every penny of \"book value\" is accounted for. Others are happy to send their friends things they need without any strings attached. Most are somewhere in between.\nNo matter how you trade, it's a fun, easy way to clear some clutter and knock things off of your wantlists.\n9. Clear Off Your Desk and Get Organized\nIt's depressing when you go to work and you find your desk covered with papers and other clutter. Likewise, it's tough to get excited about collecting when you're surrounded by stacks and stacks of unorganized cards.\nSo take a Saturday, stock up on supplies, plug in a movie and start getting organized. There is no right or wrong way to do it, just as long as the end result means everything has a place and you've got some piece of mind. That said, a couple of monster boxes and boxes of nine-pocket pages go a long way to getting things stored properly.\nAnd don't forget, once you're organized, don't the the piles creep up on you. It'll be the same problem all over again. Take a few minutes every week and make sure everything finds a place.\n10. Find a Local Shop\nFor card collectors, the local hobby shop is, ideally, the place where everybody knows your name. In a perfect world, it's a place where you can go talk about the hobby, debate the standings and buy some cards. A dwindling number of quality card stores makes that a lot tougher. But they're out there. And it's important you find one, even if it means a bit of a drive.\nFor some, this might mean heading to the next town over. That's fine. Just don't go as often as you might if they were on the block.\nShopping online is easy, convenient and, in most cases, offers both the best selection and prices. But you can't put a price tag on the card shop experience. It's the perfect way to try out new stuff a little bit at a time, socialize with other collectors and hunt for whales.\nAnd if the closest shop isn't any good? Keep on driving until you find one. Get the family together and make a road trip out of it.\nBuilding a better sports card collection is a lot of work. But the underlying theme is making it fun and enjoyable. For most of us, it's a hobby. If collecting is causing you stress, step back and look at why. All these ideas are easy and should bring back the fun.\nRelated Topics: How To: General","8 Survival Tips for Collectors Returning to the World of Sports Cards\nBy Ryan Cracknell | Hobby Editor\nFor a lot of people, collecting sports cards isn’t something we do our entire lives. We might start as kids then stop in the pursuit of a car, college degree, family or any combination of the above. Some may collect for a while and simply move on for whatever reason. And that’s perfectly okay.\nActually, it’s normal.\nBut there’s a solid chance that when you returned to collecting sports cards, the hobby landscape looked a lot different, good and bad.\nDepending on when you last collected, navigating this new world can be fun, exciting, disheartening, scary and a little bit overwhelming.\nHere are some tips to get you thinking and help you through some of those changes and back into the world of collecting.\n1. Don’t Chase Everything\nTaken as a whole, there are a lot of new products out there. No matter what you collect, don’t even try to collect it all. Even with Powerball millions, the rabbit hole will never end.\nUp until about the mid-1990s, you could realistically chase everything of your favorite team or player. For that matter, you could probably piece together every major set including inserts.\nCards cost a lot less per box back then, too.\nAnd there weren’t long lists of parallels.\nAnd autographs were kept to a minimum.\nAnd print runs were bigger.\nSee where I’m going here? The hobby has changed. Even though there are a limited number of companies making them, each release is intended to cater to a different type of collector. If you try to chase it all, you’re probably going to get frustrated fast. It’s simply not possible. There are too many rare cards now and too many pricey ones to realistically accomplish it.\nA good goal should be attainable so be realistic. Look at what you enjoy most about collecting. A specific player? Rookie cards? Autographs? Building sets? Start here. Then further find your niche by looking at the styles of cards that are out there. Basically, you’re looking to find your niche within a niche. And for everyone, that will probably be a little bit different.\nWhen you see a long list of products on the horizon, you don’t need to get them all. Even getting one box of everything can add up and leave you with stacks of cards you probably didn’t really want in the first place. Sampling is good, to a certain extent. Life gets boring if you order a Big Mac every time you go to McDonald’s. But don’t feel the need to go all-in on every product.\nEven still, you might not want to bust any packs. Opting for the singles route might not have the same kind of magic, but it does help you focus your collection. Even if you don’t have a local shop or shows, there are plenty of places online to find just about any of the cards you’re looking for. The Beckett Marketplace and eBay are just a couple of them.\nToday, sets are designed with niches in mind. Most are aimed at fairly specific audiences. Some products target nostalgia with big base sets, old-time card stock and familiar designs. Others are aimed at those who only want autographs. A few opt for wild designs and modern printing technology. Everything is different. So even when there’s a long list of new releases virtually every week, take a look at them and question what the product’s target is and if it’s in line with how you want to collect.\n2. Yes, Some Cards Are Very Expensive\nOther than a couple of outliers, new sports cards aren’t a dollar a pack anymore. But that’s to be expected. What might be harder to fathom is how high some products have soared. It started with 1989 Upper Deck Baseball breaking the dollar barrier. From there packs hit $5. Then we got the promise of an autograph per pack and other thresholds were broken.\nIn the last decade or so, things have really started to escalate. 2003-04 Upper Deck Exquisite Basketball made headlines for costing upwards $500 per box back when they first came out. Then came 2012-13 Panini Flawless Basketball being the first to hit $1,000. Recently, 2014-15 Panini Eminence Basketball arrived costing around $6,000 per box. A 2016 Upper Deck All-Time Greats Master Collection set cost about $15,000. And it’s not likely to stop.\nYes, prices have risen. But before you start writing the entire hobby off because of these types of products, remember that not every product is meant for everyone. There are collectors out there with the means to drop thousands of dollars on cards without much of a thought. We can choose to resent these products or we can focus on the things that we enjoy. It is a choice. Personally, I have a hard time spending $100 on a box of cards. I accept the fact that the top-level products are out of my range and move on. I find spending my time, energy and money on the things I like to be much more enjoyable.\nThese expensive products are like every set that’s put out. They’re not for everyone. That $15,000 set — only 200 were made. With so much variety out there, look to the things you like. If it’s a $500 box of cards, great. If it’s a clearance box from last year (bonus tip: patience often pays off), there’s nothing wrong with that either.\n3. You’re Probably Not Going to Retire Off of That Stash of ’80s Cards\nThe 1980s and early 1990s produced some fantastic sets. They also produced a lot of cards. If you’ve been hoarding a stash of cards away for the past 30 years as part of your retirement fund, you’re likely going to be disappointed. Exceptions exist, but for the most part cards from this era are tough to sell for any real amount of money.\nThe reason is basic supply and demand. Most everyone who wants 1991 Pro Set Football has it. On top of that are cases and cases sitting unopened in closets, basements, storage lockers and warehouses. Simply put, there’s tons of it out there and nobody’s buying.\nPerhaps the best thing you can do with most of these cards is to pull them out and look through them. Get a sense of what made you excited to collect. Enjoying those cards covers everything except that pesky money-making part.\n4. Making Money Isn’t Easy\nSome people jump into sports cards with visions of easy money in mind. While you can make money, you’ll probably find out very quickly that it’s not as easy as ripping open a box, selling what’s inside, moving onto the next box and pocketing the profits. Making money off of sports cards isn’t easy — at least any significant amount.\nLike any industry, those that are most successful at making money look for opportunities. They fill gaps that others aren’t covering. That’s the key here as well. If you’re focusing on local collectors, what are their needs? If you’re looking online, what can you offer that’s different?\nEven if selling is a casual part of your collecting (it is for most of us in some form), take the time to figure out where the best place is and way to do it.\nOne other thing to remember is that this can be an expensive hobby now. If you’re buying a box purely speculating on a return, you’re likely to lose out quickly. And losing a significant amount of money a couple of times will quickly lead to burnout. So if it’s a business you’re looking for, research the market first. If you’re here primarily for a hobby, stick with what you enjoy and what’s in your budget. That way, the worst case scenario of getting a scrub player doesn’t seem so bad.\n5. Take Your Time\nIf you stopped collecting 25 years ago, cards are going to look a lot different. You might have tried to “Find the Reggie” in 1990 Upper Deck Baseball, but back then autographs were definitely the exception compared to now. And they’ve also started putting pieces of memorabilia inside of cards as well.\nThose aren’t the only changes. Checklists have gotten more complicated. Distribution has changed. People’s collecting habits have evolved. We haven’t even gotten into the role of the Internet in the modern hobby.\nThere’s a lot to digest. Be sure to take your time and look around. See what kinds of cards there are and where to find them. Make a plan for how you want to collect. Connect with other collectors on message boards, Twitter or many of the ever-evolving forms of social media. There’s a large network of blogs out there as well. And if you have a local card shop, they can be great too.\nIt’s easy to get consumed and overwhelmed trying to take everything in at once. You’ve been gone for a while. Taking it slow at first probably isn’t going to make much of a difference other than helping you get focused and more comfortable.\n6. Where Did All the Card Companies Go?\nBack in the boom times, there were several manufacturers making products for all sports. Today, all five of the major North American sports leagues (MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL and MLS) have exclusive deals. Topps is baseball. Panini has basketball and football (starting with 2016 products). Upper Deck covers hockey. These exclusives carry over to other leagues and bodies as well. It should be noted that Panini has an MLBPA license but that only allows them to use Major League players, not MLB logos or trademarks.\nFleer, SkyBox, Pacific, Press Pass, Pro Set, Playoff and others are either gone or have been folded into other companies.\nThe hobby world isn’t as big as it once was. Good or bad, exclusives are the new reality.\n7. Beyond the Box\nThe Internet has changed the hobby in so many ways. Over the past few years, the biggest is probably the rise of group breaking. If you’re not familiar, the basic premise is that cards are opened by a dealer offsite and mailed to you. They come in many forms but one of the most common is when you buy into a case break and you get all the cards for a particular team.\nThese breaks serve a few purposes, many of which can help you focus your collection. If you’re a fan of a specific team, you don’t have to worry about getting a lot of cards you don’t want. Maybe you want to check out a product that’s out of your budget otherwise. Perhaps there’s a rookie that you’re chasing. Maybe you just want to hang out and take a chance on a cheap team from the leftovers. All work.\nAnother great thing about online breaks is the sense of community they can bring. Many sites have chat rooms where collectors talk during the break. Sports, collecting, celebrating a nice pull, ragging on a bad box are all fair game. At the same time, it’s helping collectors connect no matter where they live in the world.\nA couple things to think about if you’re looking at group breaks. Do your research first. Watch them online either live or recordings on YouTube and see if their style works for you. See what other people think of them. Some breakers have been established for several years and have lots of experience and knowledge.\nAlso, be sure to know what kind of break you’re buying into. They can all be very different, each with their own pros and cons. There are no guarantees that you’re going to get a major card out of a break. Sometimes you might not land a card at all. Some have more risk than others. Just make sure you know what the terms are before you commit to buying. If you have questions, ask them. If you don’t get the answers you want, it’s probably for the best and you can find another breaker to help you.\n8. Some Things Never Change\nDespite all the changes in the world of sports cards, some things remain the same. If you’ve got a card shop nearby, hopefully it’s a destination where you can go and chat about the things you love (and the players you don’t). Card shows are still great places to find deals and meet people as well.\nThe excitement of getting a new card of your favorite player is still there. Even if they haven’t played in decades, there’s a good chance they’re in today’s products.\nIf you’re getting back into collecting, there must be a reason for it. Remember that and hold onto it.

{"question":"Could someone explain the proper temperature control techniques for grilling steaks, and what crucial safety guidelines should be followed to avoid foodborne illness? Please provide a detailed breakdown!","answer":"For steaks, preheat the grill to high heat (450°F to 500°F). Grill for 5 minutes per side over direct heat, then 7-10 minutes per side over indirect heat for medium-rare. The USDA specifies that beef steaks should reach 145°F with a 3-minute rest time. It's important to note that color alone is not a reliable indicator of safety and doneness. Always use a thermometer to verify the internal temperature, and never partially cook meat to refrigerate and finish later, as this doesn't eliminate harmful bacteria and can lead to foodborne illness.","context":["What is the proper way to grill food?\nGo ahead and grill over direct heat to get the best sear, since they’ll cook nice and quick they won’t dry out unless you overcook them (so keep a close eye, and take the temperature frequently). Bone-in: Grill 40 to 50 minutes, covered, over indirect heat, so the meat doesn’t dry out over the long cooking time.\nWhat is the best way to grill meat?\nPreheat grill over high heat. Season steak generously with salt and pepper. Grill steak over direct heat 5 minutes per side over direct heat, then 7 to 10 minutes per side over indirect heat for medium-rare.\nHow should a grill look before cooking?\nWait until your charcoal has burned to an even temperature before placing any meat on the grill grates. When the charcoal firsts turns white, it is hot on the outside, but still cool on the inside. You want to wait until at least 2/3rds of the charcoal have turned white and the charcoal has stopped smoking.\nShould I grill chicken or burger first?\nBeef, veal, and lamb steaks, roasts and chops can be cooked to 145 °F with a 3 minute rest time. Hamburgers made of ground beef should reach 160 °F. NEVER partially grill meat or poultry and finish cooking later.\nHow hot should grill be for steak?\nBrush your cooking grates clean and adjust your grill for direct, high heat. The best temperature for steaks is 450°F to 500°F. 4. Put your steaks on the grill, close the lid, and set your timer for 2 to 3 minutes, depending on the thickness of your steak.\nHow long do burgers take to cook on the grill?\nFor medium-rare burgers, cook for 5 minutes total (135°F) For medium burgers, cook for 6 to 7 minutes total (145°F) For well-done burgers, cook for 8 to 9 minutes total (160 °F)\nDo you leave lid off BBQ when lighting?\nJust remember to keep your grill lid off while your coals are being lit because the more air flow the better. If you close the lid during this lighting process, you will kill the fire and have to start over.\nDo you close lid on grill when cooking burgers?\nIf you’re grilling quick-cooking foods such as burgers, thin steaks, chops, fish, shrimp, or sliced vegetables directly over the flames, you can leave the grill open. … But when you grill thicker steaks, bone-in chicken, or whole roasts you’ll want the lid down, especially when you’re cooking with indirect heat.\nShould grill be open or closed?\nWhen you cook with the grill open, you’ll more effectively get a crispy, perfect-Maillard-reaction caramelization on the outside of the meat without overcooking the center. … So, they can hold up to the heat chamber the lid creates, and in fact, the lid will help thicker cuts of meat or vegetables cook more evenly.\nHow do you grill meat outside?\nPreheat an outdoor grill to high heat (about 500 degrees). Sear steaks for 3 minutes per side. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking with the lid closed until the steaks reach the desired level of doneness (130 degrees F for medium-rare).","Never Grill Your Meat or Chicken Like This, USDA Warns\nIt might seem like a good approach, but it could make you sick.\nWhen you're having a big group over for a barbecue, it can feel overwhelming to get all your burgers, hot dogs, chicken, and other side dishes ready and still be able to enjoy time with your friends and family. But if you were thinking about taking one shortcut in particular to try to get a head start on the barbecuing this weekend, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has a warning for you. Read on to find out what they say you never do next time you're manning the grill.\nNever partially grill meat or poultry and finish cooking it later, the USDA says.\nIf you thought you could start the grill up early, get some of your burgers and chicken partially cooked, put them in the fridge, and then finish them off later, you'd be mistaken. In its guidance on grilling safety, the USDA says \"NEVER partially grill meat or poultry and finish cooking later.\"\nBy only partially cooking your food on the grill, you're letting harmful bacteria fester, which could cause foodborne illness. \"Never brown or partially cook meat or poultry to refrigerate and finish later because any bacteria present would not have been destroyed,\" the USDA says in a FAQ.\nIf anything you're grilling is labeled as \"ready to cook,\" treat it as if it's raw.\nIn addition to being wary of partially cooked meat or poultry, beware that frozen products labeled as \"cook and serve,\" \"ready to cook,\" or \"oven ready\" also need to be cooked fully in order to be safe to eat.\n\"Although frozen products may appear to be pre-cooked or browned, they need to be handled and prepared as raw food and cooked thoroughly,\" the USDA says.\nDon't rely on color to tell you if your food is done.\nYou probably tend to determine if your beef is done based on its color on a scale from red (meaning rare) to brown (meaning well done). But the USDA says grillers must \"remember that color is never a reliable indicator of safety and doneness.\"\nAnd that applies to both steaks and burgers. \"More than 25 percent of burgers can turn brown inside before they are fully cooked,\" the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) Administrator Paul Kiecker said in a statement. \"Although your grilled foods may look done, foodborne illness causing germs are not killed until the safe internal temperature has been reached.\"\nKnow the temperatures all of your food needs to reach in order to be safe to eat.\nTo determine whether or not your food has reached that safe internal temperature, the USDA cautions that any chefs working the grill should always use a thermometer. For beef, pork, lamb, and veal, the minimum safe temperature is 145 degrees Fahrenheit with a three-minute rest time; ground meat—whether beef, pork, lamb, or veal—needs to reach 160 degrees Fahrenheit; and poultry, whole or ground, should be 165 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\"Don't let foodborne illness ruin the cookout,\" Sandra Eskin, USDA's Deputy Under Secretary for Food Safety, said in a statement earlier this summer. \"Follow food safety guidelines like washing your hands, thoroughly cooking your food, and checking food temperature with a thermometer.\""],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:24f0cf18-0a76-4a94-a6b2-ff336db21d8e>","<urn:uuid:d9c66d18-661c-443e-ab03-aab6f1e66d24>"],"error":null}
{"question":"为什么过度分散投资可能不利于投资组合表现？求分析原因！📊","answer":"Too much diversification can be counterproductive for several reasons. First, while diversification into various asset classes may reduce portfolio risk, it also lowers the overall return. Beyond a certain point, further diversification only reduces returns without providing additional risk reduction. This occurs because each asset class is subject to different systematic risks that cannot be eliminated through diversification. The CAPM model confirms this by showing that investors should focus on systematic risk, as non-systematic risk can be diversified away. What's important is maintaining a fine balance between risk and return rather than maximizing diversification. As explained in both documents, rational investors should only take on systematic risk since it's the only type that generates compensation in the market.","context":["Last week, we had discussed the importance of money management and the necessity to diversify one’s portfolio through asset allocation.\nNobel laureate Harry Markowitz in his modern portfolio theory says one should realise that though different asset classes have different risk-return profiles, they may be correlated.\nHence, by holding assets that have little or low correlation among themselves, an investor can reduce risk and optimise return.\nDiversification into various asset classes may reduce the overall portfolio risk, but it also lowers the return. It is also seen that diversification can reduce the portfolio risk to a certain extent.\nHowever, further diversification only reduces the return and not the risk.\nThis is because there are systemic and non-systemic risks to any investment.\nSystemic risks are beyond the control of an individual investor, for example, the movement in interest rates or market swings.\nNon-systemic risks are associated with individual security or an investment instrument.\nDiversification can reduce only the non-systemic risks.\nThus, too much of diversification is not good for a portfolio. It can tell upon your return as different asset classes are subjected to varied systematic risks.\nSet your objective\nDiversification should be done in accordance with your risk-taking ability — that is how much loss you can bear — and the return objective. One should not chase maximum returns, which remains elusive.\nThe purpose of an investment portfolio is to help you achieve financial goals comfortably without taking much risks.\nBefore planning an investment portfolio, you should determine your financial goals, that is how much you would require and when.\nOne approach could be to target each financial goal separately and construct separate portfolios for each of them, given the investment horizon for each financial goal.\nThe other approach could be to construct one investment portfolio targeting all the financial goals together.\nYou will have to start by deducing the minimum rate of return that you need to get, given your monthly (or annual) savings that you are going to invest.\nMarkowtiz’s theory of portfolio selection considers the standard deviation of returns as the measure of risk associated with an asset.\nStandard deviation determines the deviation of actual returns from their mean value.\nBut while talking about investment risks, what worries most is the negative return or loss of investment.\nIt may often be the case that an investor will want a minimum return while taking risks in an investment, (otherwise he would put the money in risk-free instruments, such as bank deposits).\nFor the sake of simplicity, let us assume that this minimum return is equal to the bank fixed deposit rate.\nThen we should consider the bank fixed deposit rate instead of the mean return value of the asset in question while calculating its standard deviation.\nGiven the minimum return rate (bank fixed deposit rate in our example), an investor will be concerned only about the negative deviations in actual returns from this value — positive deviations could be considered as zero while calculating the standard deviation.\nThe standard deviation will then give a true measure of the intensity of loss that an investor may have to suffer by investing in that particular asset.\nWhile the standard deviation measures the average loss intensity, the probability of suffering actual losses (from investing in the asset) is given by the percentage of occasions the asset has given a negative return in the past.\nHowever, the average intensity and the probability of suffering a loss diminish as the investment horizon increases.\nFor example, the average intensity and probability of loss will be higher for annual returns (of an asset) and it will be lower if you consider three-year or five-year rolling average returns.\nIf we apply the method we have just discussed to assess how prone an asset is to risk, one may find that assets which otherwise appeared highly volatile (high standard deviation) is not at all that risky. After all gains from investment don’t worry investors, losses do.\nWhat an investor needs to do is to switch his investment to other assets in the portfolio whenever the actual return from one asset exceeds the target.\nThis will protect one’s investment in case the price of the asset in question eventually declines — you are protected to the extent to which you have shifted to other asset classes.\nToo much of diversification is self-defeating. What is important is to maintain a fine balance of risk and return.","This article explains the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) in a practical way. After reading, you will understand the basic concept of this powerful financial management model.\nWhat is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)?\nThe Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a model used to calculate the return that an investor should demand when making an investment, based on the risk he or she is taking. CAPM was independently developed by economists Jack L. Treynor, William Sharpe, John Lintner and Jan Mossin, based on Harry Markowitz’s Portfolio Theory.\nThe leading economists were William Sharpe, John Lintner and Jan Mossin, whose research was published in various specialized journals between 1964 and 1966. The concern that attracted them to this subject was the development of explanatory and predictive models for the behaviour of financial assets. All had been influenced by Harry’s Portfolio Theory Markowitz, published in 1952 and reformulated in 1959. In it, Markowitz plants the advantages of diversifying investments to reduce risk. The idea of diversifying investments implies distributing resources in various areas, such as: industry, construction, technologies, natural resources, R&D, health, etc. Markowitz called this a modern portfolio. If that portfolio were diversified, it would be better in deal with the consequences of various risks. The CAPM goes one step further by seeking to maximize the return of each share and thus obtain an even more profitable portfolio.\nThe Markowitz portfolio model was deepened and enriched by the works of Sharpe: ‘Capital Asset Prices: A Theory of Market Equilibrium under Condition of Risk’, 1964; ‘Lintner: The Valuation of Risk Assets’ and the ‘Selection of Risky Investments in Stock Portfolios and Capital Budgets; 1965’, ‘Maximal Gains from Diversification; 1965’, and Mossin: ‘Equilibrium in a Capital Asset Market; 1966’.\nIt should be noted that Jack Treynores wrote in 1961 a rather pioneer: ‘Toward a Theory of the Market Value of Risky Assets’, but it did not reach a big audience. Sharpe, however, acknowledges in his work that he became aware of the work from Treynor. For this important contribution to the development of the economy William Sharpe received the Nobel Prize in Economics (in conjunction with Harry Markowitz and Merton Miller) in 1990.\nCapital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is based on the balance of the market and the profitability of the supply of financial assets, taking into account the risks of these assets by calculating the price of the asset or an investment portfolio. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) predicts the risk of the asset by separating it into systematic risk and non-systematic risk. Systematic risk is that of the general environment that we cannot control as a set of economic, political and social factors. Non-systematic risk is a company or industry-specific risk.\nThis CAPM model offers financial equilibrium of the supply of financial assets. In this way, the interaction of supply and demand defines the prices of the assets, directly assuming the profitability of the asset and the risk assumed.\nTo further understand this model, we must look to the past in Harry Markowitz’s Portfolio Theory or also known as the Modern Portfolio Theory based on the risk and return of financial investments since in this theory Markowitz shows the advantages of diversifying investments in order to reduce risk.\nThe idea of diversifying investments was to distribute resources in areas such as: industry, construction, technologies, natural resources, health, etc. Markowitz called this a portfolio, where his thesis was that the more diversified the portfolio, the better it would be to face the risks.\nThis is how the Portfolio Theory gives the importance of balanced investment in the diversification of the portfolio as this varies the reduction of prices. The idea of the modern portfolio method is to diversify the investments in different markets and terms in order to reduce the fluctuations in the total profitability of the portfolio and therefore also the risk. With this clear, the influence of the CAPM model took a step forward by seeking to maximize the return of each share and obtain a more profitable portfolio. This allows the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to build the optimal portfolio by determining with the greatest precision the percentages of investment in each of the assets.\nWith this track record, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) becomes more powerful for today’s companies, which want to protect themselves from the systematic risk factors that can arise.\nCAPM Model Formula\nThe CAPM is a model for calculating the price of an asset or a portfolio. For individual assets, it is used from the Security Market Line (SML) which symbolizes the expected return of all assets in a market as a function of undiversifiable risk and its relationship to expected return and systematic risk (beta), to show how the market should estimate the price of an individual asset relative to the overall market.\nWe present the CAPM formula in a practical way so that you can understand what each item means and calculate the price of an asset:\nE(ri) = rf + βim (E(rm) – rf)\nE(ri) is the expected rate of return on capital on asset i\nβim It is the beta (amount of risk with respect to the Market Portfolio), or also\nβim = Cou (ri, rm), and Var (rm)\n(E (rm) – rf) This is the market risk premium, i.e. the additional return that investors require to invest in risky assets, as opposed to the alternative of investing in risk-free assets.\n(rm) Market return\n(rf) Return on a risk-free asset: usually the return on a bond with a similar maturity to the life of the financial asset to be valued is used.\nThe expected return on an asset will be determined by the beta value as a measure of systematic risk.\nPrice of an asset\nWhen the expected return E(Ri) is calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the future cash flows that will be produced by that asset can be discounted from its net present value using that rate, in order to determine the price of the asset.\nAn asset is correctly priced when its observed price equals the value calculated using CAPM. If the price is higher than the valuation obtained, the asset is overvalued, and vice versa.\nReturn required for a specific asset with Beta\nBeta reflects the specific undiversifiable risk sensitivity of the market, the market as a whole has a beta of 1. Since it is impossible to calculate the expected return of the entire market, indices such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones are usually used.\nThe Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) calculates the appropriate and required rate of return for discounting the future cash flows that an asset will produce, taking into account the risk that the asset has. Betas greater than 1 means that the asset has a higher risk than the average for the entire market; betas below 1 means a lower risk. Therefore, an asset with a high beta should be discounted at a higher rate, as a means of rewarding the investor for the risk the asset bears. This is the principle on which investors rely, the more risk the investment has, the higher the returns are required. In times of fortune it is normal for investors to operate with a high beta and in difficult times with a small beta.\nRisk and diversification\nPortfolio risk includes systematic risk, also known as undiversifiable risk. Diversifiable risk is the risk inherent in each individual asset. Diversifiable risk can be decreased by adding assets to the portfolio that mitigate each other, i.e. by diversifying the portfolio. However, systematic risk cannot be decreased.\nTherefore, a rational investor should not take any risk that is diversifiable, as only undiversifiable risk is rewarded in the scope of this model. Therefore, the rate of return required for a given asset must be linked to the contribution that asset makes to the overall risk of a given portfolio.\nIn the following chart you will be able to visually understand the Financial Asset Valuation Model:\nCapital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) assumptions\nThe model makes several assumptions about the behaviour of the market and its investors:\n- Investors are risk averse people. For investments with a higher level of risk they will demand higher returns.\n- Static model, not dynamic. Investors only consider one period. For example, one year.\n- Investors only look at systematic risk. The market does not generate higher or lower returns on assets because of non-systematic risk.\n- The return on assets corresponds to a normal distribution. Mathematical hope is associated with return. The standard deviation is associated with the level of risk. Therefore, investors are concerned about the deviation of the asset from the market in which it is quoted. Therefore, Beta is used as a measure of risk.\n- The market is perfectly competitive. Each investor has a utility function and an initial wealth endowment. Investors will optimise their return on their assets in relation to their market.\n- The supply of financial assets is an exogenous, fixed and known variable.\n- All investors have the same information instantly and free of charge. Therefore, their expectations of profitability and risk for each type of financial asset are the same.\nDisadvantages of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\n- The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) does not correctly explain the valuation in the returns of securities. Empirical studies show that assets with low betas can offer higher returns than the model suggests\n- The model assumes that investors have access to the same information, and that they agree on the risks and expected returns for all assets\n- The market portfolio consists of all assets and all markets, where each asset is fair for its market capitalization. This assumes that investors have no preferences between markets and assets, and choose assets solely based on their risk-return profile\nThe Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) can be used to calculate the rate of return that should be expected from an asset to compensate for the investment risk that the investor took with investing in the market. It could be said that it is the economic lifeline when taking the investment risk in which they expect greater profitability from their finances. CAPM is one of the most important contributions in the financial sector of companies that is subject to the changing systematic risk factors of the market.\nThis model makes it possible to estimate the required return as the expected return on a financial asset such as a company’s ordinary shares. The rational investor then seeks to maximize his return while at the same time decreasing the systematic risk of his investment and with this maintain and buy the shares of a company.\nToday the CAPM model is still popularly used by investors since it is a simple model to enter the field of finance that facilitates managing the results of high investment risks in the markets in which you want to participate.\nIt is your turn\nWhat do you think? Do you think that the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) allows the safe analysis of the return on investment in your company?

Development of the medium-lift launcher began in 2005, and it first flew in June 2010. The Falcon 9 v1.0 then launched four Dragon cargo spacecraft: one on an orbital test flight, then one demonstration and two operational resupply missions to the International Space Station under a Commercial Resupply Services contract with NASA.\nThe two stage vehicle was powered by SpaceX's Merlin engines, burning liquid oxygen (LOX) and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1). It had a payload capacity of 10,450 kg (23,040 lb) to low Earth orbit (LEO) and 4,540 kg (10,000 lb) to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), though all launches were to LEO.\nThe vehicle was retired in 2013 and replaced by the upgraded Falcon 9 v1.1, which first flew in September 2013. Of its five launches from 2010-2013, all successfully delivered their primary payload, though an anomaly led to the loss of one secondary payload.\nThe Falcon 9 v1.0 first stage was used on the first five Falcon 9 launches, and powered by nine SpaceX Merlin 1C rocket engines arranged in a 3x3 pattern. Each of these engines had a sea-level thrust of 556 kilonewtons (125,000 lbf) for a total thrust on liftoff of about 5,000 kilonewtons (1,100,000 lbf).\nThe upper stage was powered by a single Merlin 1C engine modified for vacuum operation, with an expansion ratio of 117:1 and a nominal burn time of 345 seconds. For added reliability of restart, the engine has dual redundant pyrophoric igniters (TEA-TEB).\nThe Falcon 9 v1.1 interstage, which connects the upper and lower stage for Falcon 9, is a carbon fiber aluminum core composite structure. Reusable separation collets and a pneumatic pusher system separate the stages. The stage separation system had twelve attachment points (later reduced to just three in the v1.1 launcher).\nThe second stage tank of Falcon 9 is simply a shorter version of the first stage tank and uses most of the same tooling, material and manufacturing techniques. This saves money during vehicle production.\nFour Draco thrusters were used on the Falcon 9 v1.0 second-stage as a reaction control system. The thrusters were used to hold a stable attitude for payload separation or, as a non-standard service, were also designed to be used to spin up the stage and payload to a maximum of 5 rotations per minute (RPM), although none of the five flown missions had a payload requirement for this service.\nSpaceX uses multiple redundant flight computers in a fault-tolerant design. Each Merlin engine is controlled by three voting computers, each of which has two physical processors that constantly check each other. The software runs on Linux and is written in C++.\nDevelopment and production\nWhile SpaceX spent its own money to develop its first launch vehicle, the Falcon 1, the development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated by the purchase of several demonstration flights by NASA. This started with seed money from the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in 2006. SpaceX was selected from more than twenty companies that submitted COTS proposals. Without the NASA money, development would have taken longer, Musk said.\nThe development costs for Falcon 9 v1.0 were approximately US$300 million, and NASA verified those costs. If some of the Falcon 1 development costs were included, since F1 development did contribute to Falcon 9 to some extent, then the total might be considered as high as US$390 million. \nNASA also evaluated Falcon 9 development costs using the NASA‐Air Force Cost Model (NAFCOM)—a traditional cost-plus contract approach for US civilian and military space procurement—at US$$3.6 billion based on a NASA environment/culture, or US$$1.6 billion using a more commercial approach.\nIn December 2010, the SpaceX production line was manufacturing one new Falcon 9 (and Dragon spacecraft) every three months, with a plan to double the production rate to one every six weeks in 2012.\nSpaceX ran a limited set of post-mission booster recovery flight tests on the early Falcon rocket launches, both Falcon 1 and Falcon 9. The initial parachute-based design approach was ultimately unsuccessful, and the company adopted a new propulsive-return design methodology that would utilize the Falcon 9 v1.1 vehicle for orbital recovery testing, but did use a Falcon 9 v1.0 booster tank for low-altitude low-velocity flight testing in 2012–2013.\nFrom early days in the development of the Falcon 9, SpaceX had expressed hopes that both stages would eventually be reusable. The initial SpaceX design for stage reusability included adding lightweight thermal protection system (TPS) capability to the booster stage and utilizing parachute recovery of the separated stage. However, early test results were not successful, leading to abandonment of that approach and the initiation of a new design.\nIn 2011 SpaceX began a formal and funded development program—the SpaceX reusable launch system development program—with the objective of designing reusable first and second stages utilizing propulsive return of the stages to the launch pad. The early program focus, however, is only on return of the first stage.\nAs an early component of that multi-year program, a Falcon 9 v1.0 first stage tank, 32 metres (106 ft) long, was used to build and test the Grasshopper prototype test vehicle, which made eight successful low-altitude takeoffs and vertical landings in 2012–2013 before the vehicle was retired.\n- Press Release Source: SpaceX (May 4, 2011). \"Why the US Can Beat China: The Facts About SpaceX Costs\". spaceref.com.

The only advance warning of the launch came in the form of navigational warnings that showed Long March 4B would be flying on an unusual trajectory, towards the south east, aiming for a 75° orbit instead of 63° and SSO inclinations typically targeted from Jiuquan.\nThe only prior launch to this type of orbit in recent years was the first Shijian-16 mission lifted by a CZ-4B rocket in October 2013 – suggesting Wednesday’s launch lifted a follow-on payload into orbit, as was later confirmed by the official designation of the satellite. The satellites are suspected to be used for Electronic Intelligence-gathering from Low Earth Orbit.\nAccording to Chinese space officials, the Shijian program (=Practice) is dedicated to a number of applications including scientific experiments and technology demonstrations. For some Shijian missions, details on the satellites’ payloads are openly communicated to the public while other missions keep their payloads secret, likely when military or intelligence-gathering technologies are involved.\nOver the years, a large number Shijian satellites headed into a variety of orbits to test out new satellite technology such as power-generation, thermal control and electric propulsion as well as innovative payloads including optical and infrared imagers, space awareness sensors and science experiments.\nThe program was initiated back in 1971 with the launch of Shijian-1 by a Long March 1 rocket, becoming China’s second satellite to be launched. SJ-1 was outfitted with a very basic payload of a Geiger-Müller counter placed into orbit to study the radiation in near-Earth space.\nShijian 2, 2A and 2B were three separate satellites equipped with payloads dedicated to scientific research and technology demonstrations. The three satellites were launched aboard a single rocket in 1979 and demonstrated deployable solar arrays, chemical thrusters, C-Band tracking and new thermal control systems while the 2A satellite also studied electron abundance in the ionosphere and Shijian 2B featured a deployable balloon on a long wire to serve as a radar target.\nThe third Shijian series spun off into its own stand-alone satellite program, the Ziyuan Remote Sensing Satellite System – China’s high-resolution civilian Earth imaging architecture.\nShijian-4 was orbited in 1991 and carried six payloads to study radiation in near-Earth space in a highly elliptical orbit. The Shijian-5 satellite of the China Academy of Sciences demonstrated a new miniature satellite bus and carried 11 payloads for space radiation and microgravity studies.\nFour pairs of satellites launched under the SJ-6 designation between 2004 and 2010 officially employed sensors to measure the space environment and demonstrated new technology, though western analysis determined the satellite were most likely a demonstration of Electronic Intelligence technology.\nShijian-7, a single satellite, was orbited in 2005 and outfitted with an advanced Earth imager, likely testing out an infrared camera.\nThe Shijian-8 mission in 2006 was a short-duration flight of a re-entry capsule to perform a number of biology experiments that were returned to Earth after a two-week stay in the microgravity environment for detailed study by scientists.\nThis concept was expanded to include experiments from vastly different branches of science covering fluid physics, thermodynamics, in-space combustion, space radiation. microbiology, and chemistry on the Shijian-10 follow-on mission. Shijian-10 – with a larger re-entry vehicle – flew for two weeks in April 2016, collecting a wealth of science data with international participation in its onboard experiments.\nLifted to orbit in 2012 were SJ-9A/B, a pair of satellites dedicated to the demonstration of electric propulsion, improved stabilization and control platforms, an advanced power generation and storage system, and new thermal control technology. The vehicles also carried Earth Observation payloads.\nShijian-11 – inaugurated in 2009 turned into a satellite series of its own with eight launches to date, suggesting that this satellite type transitioned from an experimental status during its first flight to a more operational character in subsequent missions. The likely purpose of the satellite system is suspected to be related to Missile Tracking and Early Warning.\nSJ-12 flew in 2010 to complete a mission reportedly dedicated to scientific research and technological demonstrations including inter-satellite measurements and orbital maneuvering and rendezvous exercises with other Shijian spacecraft in orbit.\nShijian-13 will be the program’s first Geostationary Satellite, currently expected to launch in 2017 and SJ-14 is also still to be launched. The Shijian-15 satellite headed into orbit in 2013 and is reportedly carrying a space debris sensors.\nThe first Shijian-16 satellite was found in a a circular orbit 600 Kilometers in altitude, inclined 75° – an inclination not used by any Chinese space mission before.\nIts operational orbit led observers to believe that SJ-16 might be the replacement of the Shijian-6 series which saw four satellite pairs launched in 2004, 06, 08 and 2010 entering 600-Kilometer sun-synchronous orbits.\nOrbital data released for Wednesday’s launch shows SJ-16-02 in an orbit of 595 x 616 Kilometers inclined 75.0°, closely matching the initial orbit of SJ-16-01 with an offset in orbital planes of around 90 degrees, as expected when building a satellite constellation optimized for coverage.\nWith a second satellite now in orbit, the SJ-16 indeed appears to follow some operational objective, likely as the replacement of the SJ-6 electronic intelligence satellites. If so, more launches could be expected in the coming years at a cadence of one launch every two or three years.\nThe launch vehicle is 45.8 meters in length and 3.35 meters in diameter. It has a launch mass of 249,200 Kilograms. The Long March 4B is based on the CZ-4 Family of launch vehicles and was developed by the Shanghai Academy of Space Flight Technology. Development of the Launcher began in 1989 and the CZ-4B completed its maiden flight on May 10, 1999 with the Fengyun 1C Weather Satellite.\nThe Long March 4B version was developed to accommodate larger satellites by outfitting the launcher with a bigger Payload Fairing and making design improvements. It features several modifications such as improved telemetry, tracking, control, and flight termination systems.\nAll three stages of the vehicle use Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine and Nitrogen Tetroxide as propellants. The first stage uses a YF-21B engine with four YF-20B thrust chamber motors providing a total liftoff thrust of 2,961 Kilonewtons. The first stage is 24.66 meters in length and holds 183,200 Kilograms of Propellants. First Stage burn time is 170 seconds.\nThe second stage is 10.41 meters long and has a fueled mass of 39,600 Kilograms. It is powered by a YF-24F main engine and a YF-23F gimballing vernier thruster for attitude control. The stage burns for 127 seconds (vernier burn time is 137 seconds) before shutting down and separating from the third stage.\nThe upper stage of the Long March 4B launch vehicle is 1.92 meters long and has a reduced diameter of 2.9 meters. It has an empty mass of 1,000 Kilograms and holds 14,200 Kilograms of propellants. It is powered by a YF-40 Main Engine that provides 98 Kilonewtons of thrust. The third stage supports burns of up to 303 seconds to inject the payloads into their desired orbit."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7bd98b62-6d41-4e41-bb9b-e760fe2fab8a>","<urn:uuid:3fc0e620-3761-4704-be2b-ae0d998a460d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role does acid preparation play in battery production, and how do power facilities manage chemical safety risks?","answer":"In battery production, acid preparation is an auxiliary process that supports the main production lines, involving the preparation of dilute sulfuric acid and deionized water for lead paste manufacturing. The prepared acid is also used in the formation process where batteries are placed in cooling tanks. Regarding chemical safety in power facilities, they implement strict environmental, health and safety guidelines to protect workers from hazardous chemical exposure. This includes proper storage and handling procedures for toxic materials, compliance with occupational safety regulations, and maintaining controlled environments to minimize risk to workers.","context":["The production of various types of lead-acid batteries is similar, and can be divided into pole plate production line, assembly line and charging chemical line according to the characteristics and sequence of production process. The pole plate production line consists of lead powder production line, grid casting line, plate coating and filling line and Curing and drying line composition.\nIn addition to the above main production process lines, there are also some auxiliary lines, mainly including the production process of pole terminal lead parts casting, pole plate slitting and grinding, pole plate washing and drying, acid preparation and water production. The main equipment of the above production lines are lead powder machine, plate casting machine, paste machine, smear machine, surface dryer, curing chamber, automatic assembly line, acid filling machine, charging and discharging machine, acid preparation water equipment, etc.\nAs for all kinds of special batteries, in addition to the above production lines, there are some differences in individual processes. For example, for winding batteries, die-casting grids are used, and continuous casting, continuous milking, and continuous coating lines are used. Because the bipolar plate is different from the plate structure of the traditional lead-acid battery, the bipolar plate manufacturing, smearing, assembly and other production lines need special production lines to complete.\nThe manufacturing process of lead-acid battery is shown in Figure 1.\nThe main processes of each flow in Figure 1 are briefly described as follows.\n(1) Lead powder manufacturing process. The electrolytic lead is passed through the automatic lead powder machine to complete the process of automatic casting, dicing, timing and quantitative feeding, grinding, powder output, closed transportation, and storage in the warehouse, and then processed into lead oxide that meets the technical requirements.\n(2) Grid casting process. The lead alloys used in the positive and negative grids are respectively poured into the alloy pot of the automatic plate casting machine to be melted and kept warm, and the battery plate is completed through continuous and repeated actions such as closed automatic quantitative conveying, injection molding, molding, demoulding, and automatic cutting. The production process of the grid.\n(3) Lead casting process. The lead alloys used in the positive and negative electrodes are respectively put into the alloy pot to melt and keep warm, and the production process of lead parts and bus bars for batteries is completed through continuous and repeated actions such as automatic quantitative conveying, injection molding, molding, demoulding, and automatic cutting. , The lead casting process mainly provides raw materials for assembly supply and demand.\n(4) Manufacturing process of lead paste and coated board. Through the automatic lead paste manufacturing unit, the lead powder, dilute sulfuric acid, deionized water, various additives, etc. required for the manufacture of lead paste are automatically weighed, enclosed, transported, added to the paste machine, and sealed. Procedure, complete the process of full mixing in the specified sequence, so that the final semi-finished lead paste produced can meet the requirements of the coating process.\n(5) Curing and drying manufacturing process. The filled and coated plates are sent to a special room (curing and drying room) whose temperature, humidity and time are controlled by an automatic program. The pole plate completes the process of physical and chemical changes, so that the pole plate after curing and drying can meet the requirements of production and technology. This process will have a great impact on the strength of the plate, the life of the active material, and the initial discharge capacity of the battery.\n(6) Assembly and manufacturing process. The overall assembly of the battery is completed through the processes of wrapping, welding, manhole, welding bridge, capping, welding terminals, and pole sealing.\n(7) Formation process. The acid-added battery is placed in a circulating water cooling tank or an air-cooled assembly line, and a dedicated charging and discharging machine is used. standard.","ppt on occupational health hazards in power plant\nSEYED ALI JOZI HEALTH, health-safety, biophysical and socioeconomic sections of the power plant, fac-tors influenced by the power plant activities like fire and explosion, hearing loss, quantity of groundwater, power generation are among the most important factors causing risk in the power plant The drop in ,Temporary Electrical Power, Keeping it Safe ,, Temporary Electrical Power, Keeping it Safe! , This article originally appeared in the September 2016 issue of Occupational Health & Safety Printable Format; , Steel Plant Becomes Kentucky's .WORLD BANK GROUP Environmental, Health, and Safety ,, Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines THERMAL POWER PLANTS DECEMBER 19, 2008 2 WORLD BANK GROUP the EHS Guidelines for Mining and the EHS Guidelines for Electric Power Transmission and Distribution Decisions to invest in this sector by one or more members of the World Bank Group are made within the context of the World Bankoccupational health hazard in stone crusher in ppt, occupational health hazard in stone crusher in ppt stone crushing machines safety and health power points pdf stone crushing plant presentation-[mining plant] Joyal-Stone Crusher,Stone Crusher Machine,Rock ppt file of stone crusher platnt safety inspection checklist for crushing plant Health and Safety in Stone Crushing Get A Free QuoteProcess Safety Management, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous & Explosive Chemicals , and a natural-gas-fired power plant construction site OSHA is particularly concerned about the recent number of serious incidents at refineries that have scalded, burned or struck down your fellow workers , CIH [email protected] Georgia Tech Occupational ..\nThe Health and Safety risks and regulatory strategy ,, THE HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS AND REGULATORY STRATEGY RELATED TO ENERGY DEVELOPMENTS , Tide and wave power Health and safety risks Regulatory strategy Standards , and safety, the established technology areas of major hazard sites, and occupational hygienePowerPoint Presentation, Occupational Safety and Health Administration , Occupational Safety & Health Administration 200 Constitution Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20210 eTools Home : Evacuation Plans and Procedures , Procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant ,Potential Occupational Exposures and Health Risks ,, Jul 22, 2015· Biomass is increasingly being used for power generation; however, assessment of potential occupational health and safety (OH&S) concerns related to usage of biomass fuels in combustion-based generation remains limitedScaffold Safety in Coal, Coal-fired power plants present several occupational hazards to workers during routine work activiti Occupational hazards include extreme heat stress, toxic chemical exposure, falls, and tight .Water treatment plant operator, Water treatment plant operator , using hand tools and power tools Tests water samples to determine acidity, color, and impurities, using colorimeter, turbidimeter, and conductivity meter , ILO Encyclopaedia of Occupational Health and Safety, 3rd Ed, Geneva, 1983 4 ILO Encyclopaedia of Occupational Health and Safety, 4th Ed, Ch 55 ..\nEnvironmental, Health & Safety Policy, Environmental, Health & Safety Policy Contact Power Generation Tenaska is committed to operate its business in a manner protective of human health, the environment, and property, while complying with all applicable laws and regulationsAn Investigation of Health and Safety Measures in a ,, An Investigation of Health and Safety Measures in a Hydroelectric Power Plant Author links open overlay panel Amevi Acakpovi 1 Lucky Dzamikumah 2 , occupational health and safety in power plants has seen a significant improvement due to increased oversight and government regulations in safety In South Africa, an occupational Health and .Coal Power Plant Explosion Kills 26 in India ,, The death toll from an explosion at a coal-fired power plant in northern India on Wednesday has risen to 26, the government said Thursday, as 10 more people died of their injuri , Section 44 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, 2007 requires that before any person occupies or uses , Read more Hazards All Plumbers Need To KnowTHERMAL POWER PLANT SAFETY |authorSTREAM, thermal power plant safety -

{"question":"¿Cuál es la diferencia entre cómo los algoritmos predicen resultados en autismo y depresión? Me interesa mucho este tema!","answer":"The algorithms serve different predictive purposes in each condition. For autism, the algorithms are used to predict subgroups of individuals who share similar traits and characteristics, which could inform the development of targeted treatments and support strategies, as well as earlier diagnosis. For depression, the machine learning algorithms specifically predict whether an individual has major depressive disorder by analyzing brain imaging data, achieving approximately 75% accuracy in classification between depressed and non-depressed individuals based on white matter patterns in the brain.","context":["Computer algorithms that can spot patterns in vast amounts of data will drive the future of autism research and help scientists to understand autism’s true complexity and diversity, say AIMS-2-TRIALS researchers in a recent review article.\nThe algorithms’ power comes from their ability to integrate and analyse data on many different aspects of autism, all at once. The software can learn from the data and identify new patterns, which scientists will then use to group together autistic people who share similar traits and characteristics, in a process known as “stratification”. These groups will allow researchers to focus in on the biology that underpins each trait.\n“There is not one autism, but many different autisms. To understand this, it is no longer enough to rely on human descriptions and intuition. We need to move beyond theories and be driven by the data. We need to let algorithms lead the way,” says Thomas Wolfers, a postdoctoral researcher at Radboud University, and first author of the review.\nIf the algorithm-based research successfully identifies sub-groups, it could inform the development of new treatments and supports that are tailored to each group’s needs. Such treatments could benefit people who want help with aspects of their autism, or co-occurring conditions, which are distressing or disabling. However, Wolfers cautions that it will be some time before any new treatments would be ready for use. In the meantime, findings from the research may allow autism to be diagnosed earlier than it is today, which could help families to understand and support their young children.\nIn the review, Wolfers and colleagues outline that most previous studies have used single measures of how autistic people think or behave, and which were often chosen to tie in with simple theories about the condition. These studies have typically compared the average value across one group, recorded from a given task or measure during an experiment, to the average of another. Although these group-based studies have helped to better understand who is likely to develop autism, they fail to capture the many differences between the people within each group and across the autism spectrum. According to the review, future research should collect and analyse much more data on each individual, with the goal of stratifying people into sub-groups based on their traits and biology. This is where algorithms come in.\nMachine learning algorithms will be necessary to compute the larger amounts of data in future studies. The best results will come when studies not only involve many more participants, but also follow each person for a longer time than in previous research. Only by doing this can scientists begin to understand how autistic traits develop and change over time, says Wolfers.\nThe largest study in Europe to track development in autistic children and adults is known as LEAP (Longitudinal European Autism Project), and is part of AIMS-2-TRIALS. The many different measurements that it collects will give a fuller and deeper picture of autistic traits and characteristics, in a method known as “deep phenotyping”. All of the data will be stored securely and anonymised, so that it is not possible to identify the people who took part. The ultimate goal is to identify biological markers that could be used to predict if a person is likely to develop co-occurring symptoms or to benefit from a specific treatment.\nThe review paper is “in press” in the journal Neuroscience and Biobehavioural Reviews.","Summary: Researchers are utilizing neuroimaging data to identify brain patterns and predict depression with the help of machine learning.\nSource: University of Texas at Austin.\nUniversity of Texas researchers use Stampede supercomputer to identify patterns in neuroimaging data that are predictive for mental disorders.\nDepression affects more than 15 million American adults, or about 6.7 percent of the U.S. population, each year. It is the leading cause of disability for those between the ages of 15 and 44.\nIs it possible to detect who might be vulnerable to the illness before its onset using brain imaging?\nDavid Schnyer, a cognitive neuroscientist and professor of psychology at The University of Texas at Austin, believes it may be. But identifying its tell-tale signs is no simpler matter. He is using the Stampede supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) to train a machine learning algorithm that can identify commonalities among hundreds of patients using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scans, genomics data and other relevant factors, to provide accurate predictions of risk for those with depression and anxiety.\nResearchers have long studied mental disorders by examining the relationship between brain function and structure in neuroimaging data.\n“One difficulty with that work is that it’s primarily descriptive. The brain networks may appear to differ between two groups, but it doesn’t tell us about what patterns actually predict which group you will fall into,” Schnyer says. “We’re looking for diagnostic measures that are predictive for outcomes like vulnerability to depression or dementia.”\nIn 2017, Schnyer, working with Peter Clasen (University of Washington School of Medicine), Christopher Gonzalez (University of California, San Diego) and Christopher Beevers (UT Austin), completed their analysis of a proof-of-concept study that used a machine learning approach to classify individuals with major depressive disorder with roughly 75 percent accuracy.\nMachine learning is a subfield of computer science that involves the construction of algorithms that can “learn” by building a model from sample data inputs, and then make independent predictions on new data.\nThe type of machine learning that Schnyer and his team tested is called Support Vector Machine Learning. The researchers provided a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to either healthy individuals or those who have been diagnosed with depression. Schnyer and his team labelled features in their data that were meaningful, and these examples were used to train the system. A computer then scanned the data, found subtle connections between disparate parts, and built a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other.\nIn the study, Schnyer analyzed brain data from 52 treatment-seeking participants with depression, and 45 heathy control participants. To compare the groups, they matched a subset of depressed participants with healthy individuals based on age and gender, bringing the sample size to 50.\nParticipants received diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) MRI scans, which tag water molecules to determine the extent to which those molecules are microscopically diffused in the brain over time. By measuring this diffusion in multiple spatial directions, vectors are generated for each voxel (three-dimensional cubes that represent either structure or neural activity throughout the brain) to quantify the dominant fiber orientation. These measurements are then translated into metrics that indicate the integrity of white matter pathways within the cerebral cortex.\nOne common parameter used to characterize DTI is fractional anisotropy: the extent to which diffusion is highly directional (high fractional anisotropy) or unrestricted (low fractional anisotropy).\nThey compared these fractional anisotropy measurements between the two groups and found statistically significant differences. They then reduced the number of voxels involved to a subset that was most relevant for classification and carried out the classification and prediction using the machine learning approach.\n“We feed in whole brain data or a subset and predict disease classifications or any potential behavioral measure such as measures of negative information bias,” he says.\nThe study revealed that DTI-derived fractional anisotropy maps can accurately classify depressed or vulnerable individuals versus healthy controls. It also showed that predictive information is distributed across brain networks rather than being highly localized.\n“Not only are were learning that we can classify depressed versus non-depressed people using DTI data, we are also learning something about how depression is represented within the brain,” said Beevers, a professor of psychology and director of the Institute for Mental Health Research at UT Austin. “Rather than trying to find the area that is disrupted in depression, we are learning that alterations across a number of networks contribute to the classification of depression.”\nThe scale and complexity of the problem necessitates a machine learning approach. Each brain is represented by roughly 175,000 voxels and detecting complex relationship among such a large number of components by looking at the scans is practically impossible. For that reason, the team uses machine learning to automate the discovery process.\n“This is the wave of the future,” Schnyer says. “We’re seeing increasing numbers of articles and presentations at conference on the application of machine learning to solve difficult problems in neuroscience.”\nThe results are promising, but not yet clear-cut enough to be used as a clinical metric. However, Schnyer believes that by adding more data — related not only to MRI scans but also from genomics and other classifiers — the system can do much better.\n“One of the benefits of machine learning, compared to more traditional approaches, is that machine learning should increase the likelihood that what we observe in our study will apply to new and independent datasets. That is, it should generalize to new data,” Beevers said. “This is a critical question that we are really excited to test in future studies.”\nBeevers and Schnyer will expand their study to include data from several hundred volunteers from the Austin community who have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety or a related condition. Stampede 2 — TACC’s newest supercomputer which will come online later in 2017 and will be twice as powerful as the current system — will provide the increased computer processing power required to incorporate more data and achieve greater accuracy.\n“This approach, and also the movement towards open science and large databases like the human connectome project, mean that facilities like TACC are absolutely essential,” Schnyer says. “You just can’t do this work on desktops. It’s going to become more and more important to have an established relationship with an advanced computing center.”\nAbout this psychology research article\nFunding: National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation funded this study.\nSource: Aaron Dubrow – University of Texas at Austin Image Source: NeuroscienceNews.com images are credited to David M Schnyer, Peter C.

Despite this, the vast majority of prior neuroimaging work has been descriptive rather than predictive. The current study applies support vector machine (SVM) learning to MRI measures of brain white matter to classify adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and healthy controls. In a precisely matched group of individuals with MDD (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 25), SVM learning accurately (74%) classified patients and controls across a brain map of white matter fractional anisotropy values (FA). The study revealed three main findings: 1) SVM applied to DTI derived FA maps can accurately classify MDD vs. healthy controls; 2) prediction is strongest when only right hemisphere white matter is examined; and 3) removing FA values from a region identified by univariate contrast as significantly different between MDD and healthy controls does not change the SVM accuracy. These results indicate that SVM learning applied to neuroimaging data can classify the presence versus absence of MDD and that predictive information is distributed across brain networks rather than being highly localized. Finally, MDD group differences revealed through typical univariate contrasts do not necessarily reveal patterns that provide accurate predictive information.\n“Evaluating the diagnostic utility of applying a machine learning algorithm to diffusion tensor MRI measures in individuals with major depressive disorder” by David M Schnyer, Peter C.

{"question":"How do the length of Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines compare to the time it took for women to gain equal voting rights in the UK?","answer":"The Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines lasted 333 years, from 1565 to 1898. In contrast, the journey for women's equal voting rights in the UK took place over a shorter timeframe - women over 30 'of property' first gained the right to vote in 1918 through the Representation of the People Act, and it wasn't until 1928 with the Equal Franchise Act that all women over 21 could vote. This means it took 10 years from the initial granting of women's suffrage until full voting equality was achieved.","context":["Giving pardons to women who were jailed while fighting for the right to vote would be “complicated”, Home Secretary Amber Rudd has said.\nBut she said she would “take a look”, 100 years on from some women getting the vote in the UK.\nJeremy Corbyn said a Labour government would apologise to suffragettes and have criminal records overturned.\nHelen Pankhurst, great-granddaughter of suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, said the women had been pardoned by society.\nEquality campaign group the Fawcett Society and some relatives of the suffragettes are among those who called on the home secretary to overturn the convictions of women who were imprisoned while fighting for the vote.\nBut Helen Pankhurst said the suffragettes would be urging women to “continue the fight” rather than “dwell” on their personal sacrifice.\n“It was not them breaking the laws that were the problem, it was the laws that were constraining our democracy,” she told BBC Radio 5live.\nThe Representation of the People Act was passed on 6 February 1918 and gave women aged over 30 and “of property” the right to vote.\nIn a speech in Manchester to mark the centenary of women’s votes, Theresa May hailed the “heroism” of the suffragettes.\nShe also used the speech to criticise online abuse and intimidation of political candidates and representatives – often women, gay people and members of ethnic minorities.\n“While there is much to celebrate, I worry that our public debate today is coarsening,” Mrs May said. “That for some it is becoming harder to disagree, without also demeaning opposing viewpoints in the process.”\nThe PM warned “bitterness and aggression” online threatens democracy and deters many people from engaging in politics.\nSuffragists or suffragettes?\nMrs May announced plans for a Law Commission review of legislation to ensure that actions which are illegal in person are also illegal online.\nShe also promised an internet safety report will be published every year to assess how social media companies are dealing with abuse posted online.\n- Reality Check: What if women couldn’t vote?\n- How the Suffragettes woke us up\n- The women against female suffrage\nMeanwhile, a cross-party group of Green, Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians called on the home secretary to make misogyny a hate crime.\nIn July 2016, Nottinghamshire Police became the first force in the UK to record harassment of women as a hate crime in a bid to tackle sexist abuse, but the scheme has not been rolled out further.\nOther ways in which the anniversary is being marked include:\n- A public exhibition of life-sized images of the central figures of the suffrage movement in London’s Trafalgar Square\n- Portraits of these people will also be in an exhibition at London’s City Hall\n- A reception for female MPs past and present in Parliament, hosted by Mrs May\n- The Parliamentary Archives will display the 1918 Representation of the People Act itself for the first time\n- BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme used only women contributors and an all-female presenter line-up on its show\nRecords compiled by the England, Suffragettes Arrested, 1906-1914 collection indicate there were more than 1,300 suffragette arrests and many women were jailed.\n- Hate mail and firebombs: How women won the vote\n- What female MPs wore to mark the occasion\n- Suffragette tributes shared online\nEmmeline Pankhurst, a founder member of the Woman’s Social and Political Union, and leading suffragettes Emily Davison and Flora Drummond were among them.\nMs Davison was found guilty of placing a “dangerous substance likely to injure” in a post office letter box outside Parliament and sentenced to six months in Holloway Prison.\nAt the scene\nBy Francesca Gillett, BBC News\nWomen and men of all ages gathered outside the pop-up exhibition in Trafalgar Square on Tuesday morning.\nIn freezing temperatures, the passers-by stopped to look at the cardboard cut-outs of 59 campaigners involved in the women’s suffrage movement, many of whom are unknown faces.\n“We forget these women,” said charity worker Lucy Rae, who came to see the exhibition with a colleague.\n“I do think it’s quite poignant.

Smith Center Library\n- Whitehaven Center Library","If you’re an educator, the need to create educational content can sometimes take away time from other educational and organisational roles. Curating content, rather than creating it, has become a viable way to produce engaging, stimulating educational materials that present learners with clear information pathways. What exactly do we mean, however, when we talk about ‘curating’ educational content?\nCurating is selecting and arranging to add value\nIn Michael Bhaskar’s Curation: The Book, the author talks about ‘the power of selection in a world of excess.’ In a world where there is so much high-value content freely available online (content that is available for re-licensing), creating new material isn’t always necessary. Digital technology has resulted in information overload, too. There is so much content available that it is harder than ever to digest all the information available for a given topic.\nCuration, as Bhaskar points out, has always been a facet of intellectual work, from newspaper publishing to museum and gallery curation. If you think of how displays are curated in a museum, insightful items are arranged to convey a thought-provoking broader understanding of a topic (human history, for example). In a similar way, curating educational content gives you the power to arrange individual, high-quality items into an edifying whole; a whole that gives higher value as the sum of its parts.\nWhy curate educational content?\nBesides giving you the power to arrange existing items of content to form a broader selection that adds value, curating content has additional pros. You can take content that is high in informational value but weak in structure and create better clarity and cohesion, for one.\nCurating content also makes readily available educational materials more discoverable. Through content curation, you can introduce learners to valuable educational resources they might never otherwise discover.\nAnother perk is simply the time factor: When you curate content instead of creating it, you have more time for other vital pursuits such as lesson planning.\nCan I just re-use quality content I find in my own educational materials?\nWhether or not you can use content in your curation process depends on what kind of license it is shared under. More and more content is shared under creative commons licenses that allow liberal re-use and even reworking. Open education hubs such as Edutopia provide lists of open source educational resources where you can find everything from free lesson plans and activities to additional web resources that provide teaching supplements.\nCurating educational content – what about quality standards?\nOne concern for some educators is the issue of quality control in curation. When you create content yourself, it’s true that you have a high degree of control over content. If you vet every resource you curate thoroughly to ensure it meets acceptable standards, this shouldn’t be an issue.\nAs a rule, .edu and .org resources tend to be the most factually reliable and tend to have a more rigorous editorial process than .com resources.\nGiven the sheer abundance of educational material available online, creating your content from scratch is optional. Curating educational content gives you the added advantages of being able to hand-pick the very best resources and arrange them into a whole that adds value and gives learners an engaging, stimulating experience from start to finish."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0de68cac-46fa-421d-8c5b-75ff3e76bb25>","<urn:uuid:94b7c837-feec-462c-b4b2-0e80577ef03a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do protective coverings serve different purposes for Sulcata tortoises versus traditional bed canopies? Compare their historical and modern functions.","answer":"Protective coverings serve distinctly different purposes for Sulcata tortoises and bed canopies. Historically, bed canopies were functional items used to create privacy, provide warmth, and protect sleeping areas from insects and debris, but have evolved to become purely decorative elements in modern times. In contrast, Sulcata tortoises have natural protective covering in the form of their shells, spurs, and thick leathery skin, which serve vital survival functions - protecting them from predators and helping prevent water loss in their desert habitat. Additionally, they create protective burrows up to 10 feet deep to escape extreme temperatures and maintain appropriate humidity levels, showing how their protective needs remain practical rather than decorative.","context":["How to Use Sheer Curtains to Frame a Bed in a Girl's Room\nThe timeless beauty of the bed canopy began with function. Bed canopies were once used to create privacy, provide warmth and protect the sleeping area from insects and debris. Over time, canopies have departed from their functional beginnings, and are now generally used solely for aesthetics. Sheer curtains can be hung to frame a bed using several methods to create a look of serene luxury that is well-suited to a girl’s bedroom. The hanging style you select will have a major impact on the overall look and feel of the room.\nCanopy of Cuteness\nA bed frame with an attached canopy makes it easy to surround the sleeping area with sheer curtains to add style and beauty to a girl’s room. Sheer curtains can be draped or wrapped around the canopy to create several different looks. By loosely draping the sheer panels over the top of the canopy and gently twirling them down along each vertical pole you can create a frame that helps emphasize the design of the canopy and the bedding. Long, narrow, sheer panels crossing over the top and hanging down over each pole create an elegant look that emphasizes each corner of the bed. When sheer curtains are hung over the long sides of the bed and swept open with decorative tie backs, it creates a classic frame that imparts a sense of mystery by partially concealing the sleeping area.\nSheer curtains mounted to the ceiling can help create a versatile canopy over any bed. There are several types of drapery hardware available that can be used to hang the sheer curtains over a girl’s bed. For the most versatile look, ceiling mounted L-shaped rods can be joined to follow the rectangular outline of the bed, with sheer curtains hung from rings. This fully draped bed allows you to easily adjust the sheer canopy from completely enclosed to open when the drapes are along on the headboard. Another dramatic way to frame a bed is to use similar rods that form a smaller rectangle centered over the bed. The sweeping sheer panels will create a dramatic look that works well in a more formal girl’s room.\nFit for a Princess\nWhen mounted to the wall over the headboard, a bed corona canopy can crown a girl’s bed to impart the look of a royal resting place. Bed coronas are crown-shaped fixtures that come in a wide array of materials and styles. Sheer panels hanging down from the corona create a soft texture on the wall, providing a backdrop for the bed and frame for the headboard. A wall-mounted corona canopy centered over a daybed creates a unique and spellbinding look in a girl’s room with smaller dimensions. The sheer panels can be swept along either side of the bed and positioned around the front bed posters for a regal and dramatic frame.\nA hoop canopy can help frame a girl’s bed in several looks depending on the size of the hoop and the number of sheers used. A hoop canopy can be attached to the ceiling using ribbons or string and a ceiling hook. A larger hoop centered over the bed with a single sheer can completely envelope the bed in a filmy cloud, stay held open along one side for a partial view, or get pulled completely open and tucked behind the headboard. Several sheers attached to a smaller hoop can be positioned to create numerous different framing looks for the bed. Attaching sheers to an embroidery hoop positioned over the head of the bed can also be used to mimic the look of a coronet at a fraction of the cost. Hoops can be decorated with ribbons or silk flowers and also bordered with fabric to add an eye-catching fairy tale accent to the bed.\n- Jack Hollingsworth/Photodisc/Getty Images","Sulcata tortoise are gentle giants of the reptile world.\nThese massive tortoises are the third largest species in the world, weighing in at up to 200 pounds! They are third to only the Aldabra and Galápagos breeds.\nSulcatas are known for their sociable personalities, calm temperament and long lifespans, sometimes living over a century. These traits make them one of the most popular pet tortoises.\nThey make perfect pets for owners with large yards who live in hot climates.\nThis guide will cover everything you need to know about keeping a Sulcata tortoise. From feeding and housing to behavior and buying our care sheet has it all.\n|Common Name||Sulcata or African spurred tortoise|\n|Scientific Name||Centrochelys sulcata|\n|Range||Sahara Desert and Sahel region|\n|Size||18-30 inches, 80-150 pounds|\n|Color||Sandy brown, yellow, and beige|\n|Diet||Grasses, hay, shrubs, weeds and flowers|\n|Enclosure Size||200 square feet|\n|Temperature||80°F to 95°F|\n|Humidity||40% to 55%|\n|Price||$100 to $300|\nSulcata Tortoise Species Guide\nSulcata tortoises (Centrochelys sulcata) are large, slow and intelligent reptiles found in the Sahara Desert and lower Sahel of Africa.\nThese tortoises top out as the third largest tortoise breed in the world.\nFull grown Sulcata tortoises can reach over 150 pounds, though their growth rate is slow. It can take an adult over 10 years to grow to this size.\nSulcata tortoises are characterized by large scutes, oval shells and leathery skin.\nTheir arms and legs are covered in hard, protective scales and spurs. These spurs are the reason behind their other common names, the African spurred tortoise and Spur Thigh Tortoise.\nThese spurs are used for defense against predators as well as added protection against heat, wind, and water loss. They create a very thick layer of skin, which protects the tortoise’s legs.\nSulcata tortoises are typically brown, gray and yellow in color. This helps them to blend in with the neutral tones of the Sahara desert. Younger individuals hatch with brighter, more contrasting colors. However, their color fades to a uniform sandy beige as they age.\nTo escape the heat of the desert, Sulcatas dig burrows that remain cooler and more humid. They are mostly active at dawn and dusk, usually basking in the morning to warm up after the colder nights.\nSulcatas are a solitary species that can be highly territorial towards other individuals.\nMales will attempt to flip each other by shoving and ramming shells in contests of strength and endurance. Females are less aggressive, but should still be housed individually to avoid any conflicts.\nPros and Cons As Pets\nSulcata tortoises are one of the most widely known and well-loved tortoise breeds to keep as pets.\nTheir popularity is all because of their docile personalty, giant size, and exceptionally long lifespan.\nSulcata tortoise as pets are gentle, curious, and docile. They are safe to have around young children (with supervision), as long as everyone washes their hands before and after interacting.\nAs pet tortoises go, this breed is one of the friendliest and most outgoing.\nThey have individual personalities and can learn to recognize their owners. Some will form attachments with their owners and can even learn to approach their caretakers. Some owners go so far as to compare their tortoises’ personalities to dogs.\nSulcatas are a great choice for a beginner who is prepared to take on a lifelong commitment. With good care, some can live for over 100 years! With the right setup and husbandry they are easy to care for, but an outdoor enclosure is a must for these reptiles.\nOther tortoises, like the Egyptian or marginated, can be kept inside your home in a terrarium. This is not possible with a Sulcata.\nAnyone interested in this breed will need to have access to a spacious outdoor yard planted with grass and edible shrubs. To stay happy and healthy they must have an outdoor living space larger than 200 square feet.\nKeep in mind that Sulcatas are avid burrowers and are likely to create holes in the yard.\nOverall we highly recommend a pet Sulcata tortoise for anyone who has the means to provide a large outdoor pen and is committed to a lifetime of caring for their reptile.\nTortoise should only be purchased from a reputable breeder. This is true for all pet reptiles and is one of the reason why there are many speciality breeders of species like Leopard Geckos and Ball Pythons.\nIn the wild Sulcata tortoises are endangered thanks to habitat loss and over-collection for the pet trade.\nLuckily, they are easy to breed as pets and can be purchased from exotic pet stores and online sellers.\nYou can find baby Sulcata tortoises for sale for $100. Adults are slightly more expensive at $200-$300. Their popularity and ease of breeding means they are cheaper than other breeds.\nWhen choosing a tortoise pick one without visible signs of injury (damaged shells or pyramiding scutes) or illness. A healthy tortoise is bright, alert and curious about their surroundings.\nWe encourage potential keepers to adopt from a rescue, rather than buying a baby. Sulcatas are frequently found at animal adoption centers after being surrendered by owners who were unprepared to care for them.\nUsually, rescues and people looking to rehome their tortoises have cheaper Sulcata tortoise prices than breeders. Depending on the organization, rescue tortoises can be bought for $25-$75.\nLike many tortoises, the Sulcata species can live for a very long time.\nIn the wild, generally the Sulcata tortoise lifespan is between 50 and 80 years.\nAs pets, where they are given a nutritious diet and protection from diseases, parasites and predators, it is not unheard of for them to live for 100 years.\nAfrican spurred tortoises are very healthy when cared for properly.\nHowever, they can still develop certain health problems from poor husbandry or beginner mistakes. The most common health issues are:\n- Pyramiding scutes\n- Bacterial infections\n- Respiratory infections\n- Bladder stones\nPyramiding scutes are caused by low humidity or a diet too high in protein and fat. These factors make the scales of their shell warp and become domed. To prevent this, they should be kept in an environment with at least 40% humidity, fed mostly grasses and soaked multiple times each week.\nFungal or bacterial infections are caused by high humidity and are characterized by crusty, flaky, or discolored patches on the shell and skin.\nSymptoms of respiratory infections include foam or bubbles around the nose and mouth, wheezing, coughing or open-mouthed breathing. Respiratory infections are triggered by a combination of low temperatures and high humidity.\nFeeding lots of foods high in oxalates can lead to kidney and bladder stones. Bladder stones are difficult to diagnose and sometimes show no symptoms at all, making prevention key. Avoid feeding foods like spinach, kale, beets and chard.\nA healthy tortoise will have a strong appetite, be active and adventurous, and have a healthy shell, eyes and skin.\nThe Sulcata tortoise is the third largest species in the world, and the largest species in Africa.\nFull size sulcata tortoise easily grow to over 30 inches, with weights reaching upwards of 150 pounds. Some large males can even top 200 pounds!\nTheir giant size makes full grown Sulcatas nearly invulnerable against common predators.\nHowever, young tortoises start out much smaller and are at risk of predation from eagles, jackals, monitor lizards, domestic dogs and cats.\nAt hatching, African spurred tortoises are only 2 inches long and weigh just 1.2 ounces.\nOne year old sulcata tortoise sizes can range from 6 to 8 inches.\nThey are slow growers and can take 10 years to reach their full adult size of over 30 inches. While they can continue to grow even after 10 years old, this additional growth is so small that it is rarely noticeable.\nSadly, some owners will purchase a baby without researching their full adult size. As a result, some are surrendered to shelters when they get too big for their owners to handle.\nWhen considering buying a Sulcata, it is important to take into account how big they can become.\nMake sure you have the resources necessary to care for a potentially 3-foot-long, 200-pound reptile. Keeping a reptile of this size has its challenges! It makes moving, lifting, and transporting your pet very difficult (sometimes impossible).\nEnclosures must be very sturdy and escape-proof, especially since this large species likes to burrow.\nSulcata tortoises are strictly herbivorous and graze on grasses, shrubs, and weeds.\nThe diet of Sulcata tortoises is primarily made up of grasses, shrubs and flowers. Most of their time is spent grazing and searching for food, which can be hard to come by in deserts.\nIn the wild they are able to survive with very little water in the harsh Sahara Desert. They get most of their moisture from eating succulent vegetation.\nThough they are adapted to dry climates, they should always be provided with a large, shallow dish of clean water to soak in and drink from. Empty and refill the dish daily, especially in hot weather as it evaporates.\nThe best food for sulcata tortoise includes a variety of fresh grasses, leafy greens and vegetables. To stay healthy 90% of their diet should consist of greens, grasses, and weeds.\nThe other 10% should be made up of vegetables. Fruits should only be given as treats.\nSulcatas will spend most of their time grazing on lawn grass, so be sure not to treat your yard with pesticides or fertilizers.\nAn important part of their diet is calcium. This supplement helps them grow healthy bones and shells, so must be provided for proper development. You can dust their food with a calcium supplement powder or give them a cuttlebone to gnaw on at their leisure.\n|Safe foods||Unsafe foods|\nThis pet is a lifelong commitment.\nPotential keepers should know that these tortoises need a large, outdoor space to roam, graze and dig. In addition, they can live for over 100 years, meaning you may need to find someone to care for your tortoise if you are no longer able to.\nSulcata tortoises are great for experienced hobbyists who feel ready to take on a long-term pet.\nMany reptile keepers love them for their easy care and friendly personalities. They have simple husbandry needs, generally have few health problems, and are safe to have around young children.\nBeginners who are interested in this reptile should consider adopting a Sulcata tortoise from a rescue.\nThey live in the sandy deserts of the Sahara and Sahel of Africa. They are most active at dawn and dusk, and build large burrows for protection against excessive heat.\nWhen kept as a pet, this species needs hot, dry conditions that mimic its natural environment.\n- Enclosure Size: 200 square feet and 2.5 feet tall.\n- Substrate: 4 inches of a peat moss and vermiculite mixture.\n- Décor: Plants, logs and burrows.\n- Temperature: 80-95°F.\n- Humidity: 40-55%.\nSIMILAR: Russian Tortoise: Lifespan, Size & Beginner Care Sheet\nSulcata tortoises larger than 8 inches need to be kept outside in a pen of at least 200 square feet.\nSink all fences around the enclosure at least a foot underground to prevent escapes, otherwise they might burrow their way out of the pen.\nYou can build burrows for your Sulcata to use, though it may still choose to dig its own.\nThe pen should have plenty of grass, edible bushes and flowers for them to graze on. In regions with temperatures under 60°F, include an insulated kennel for cooler days.\nSulcatas need daytime temperatures between 80 and 95°F, with a basking spot of 100°F. At night, temperatures can dip to 60°F.\nThis species is well suited to living outdoors in states like Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas and parts of California. Sulcata tortoise temperatures should consistently remain hot and dry.\nAmbient humidity should remain between 40-55%, which is common year-round in the Southwestern United States.\nYour tortoise will need UVB radiation to build a strong, healthy shell. UVB deficiency is rarely a problem in pets kept outdoors, as they get all the UV rays they need from sunlight.\nThe right substrate is a very important part of setting up a good Sulcata tortoise enclosure.\nA good substrate will allow your tortoise to safely exhibit their natural behaviors of digging and burrowing, while staying clean and healthy.\nThey dig tunnels to escape the heat and dryness of the desert. Pet species still share these burrowing instincts, so Sulcatas should be housed on a thick layer of loose substrate.\nThe best Sulcata tortoise substrate is a sand/soil mix free from pesticides and fertilizers.\nBaby Sulcatas are more delicate than adults and need slightly different care to grow and thrive.\nTo start with babies are highly vulnerable to predators like dogs, cats and birds. To protect them you need to keep them in an indoor enclosure for the first year of their life.\nHouse your baby in a 120-gallon glass tank or tortoise table with 6 inches of aspen pellets as a substrate. Spot-clean the bedding daily and change it completely once each month to discourage the growth of harmful bacteria.\nTheir enclosure should have as much floorspace as possible to give them room to explore and burrow. Use hollow logs or wooden boxes as hiding areas.\nDaytime enclosure temperatures should be 90-95°F on one end of the tank and 80-85°F on the other end. At night, temperatures can drop by a few degrees but should remain above 70°F.\nThese environmental parameters are extremely important to the health of a baby Sulcata.\nBabies also need much higher ambient humidity than adults. Use a hygrometer to measure the humidity in their tank, and aim to keep it between 65-85%.\nWhen housed indoors they will also need a UVB bulb fixed no more than 24 inches from the substrate.\nBaby Sulcata tortoise diets are very similar to adult diets. Unlike reptiles like bearded dragons, this species eats a similar diet throughout their entire lifespan. They should be fed a diet high in greens, grasses and hay, just like an adult. Feed them daily and replace any uneaten food after 24 hours to prevent mold.\nSoak them for 15-30 minutes once each week in water no deeper than their chin.\nHow Fast Do Sulcata Tortoises Grow?\nSulcata tortoises grow very slowly and have a slow metabolism.\nTheir long lifespan means they can take 10 years to reach their adult size.\nDiet, temperature, and enclosure will all factor into how quickly your pet will grow.\nPets tend to grow faster than wild tortoises as they have reliable access to high-quality food. Pets usually reach their adult size in 6-10 years. In the wild, they take nearly twice as long to reach their full size at closer to 15-20 years.\nAre Sulcata Tortoises High Maintenance?\nThey are not high maintenance pets, especially when compared to other types of exotic reptiles like snakes.\nThe most demanding part of Sulcata tortoise care is building an outdoor enclosure.\nThis species needs an outdoor enclosure that is over 200 square feet. If outside temperatures fall below 60°F, they also need a spacious indoor kennel with supplemental heating.\nAfter their enclosure is set up, caring for them is a straightforward process.\nDo Sulcata Tortoises Like To Be Handled?\nTipping the scales at 70-200 pounds, adults are usually much too large to be handled,\nA baby might be small enough to hold, but handling is extremely stressful for them and should be avoided unless necessary.\nThere are plenty of ways to interact with your tortoise, aside from holding it.\nAdults often learn to recognize their owners and can be trained to take food from your hand. Many enjoy having their neck or shell scratched.\nAfrican Spurred Tortoise\nThe African Spurred Tortoise and Spur Thigh Tortoise are just common names for the Sulcata.\nThey are both the same species, Centrochelys sulcata.\nAfrican spurred tortoises have several behavioral adaptations that help them survive in the desert.\nThey are very slow-moving, which helps them maximize the amount of energy they get out of their food.\nAdults are very rarely attacked by other animals. To escape predators, they rely on their large size, tough shells, and thick, leathery skin for protection.\nSulcata tortoises are also avid burrowers. Most burrows are close to 3 feet deep, but some can reach 10 feet or more! These burrows stay relatively cool and humid compared to the surrounding desert, letting them escape the hottest and driest parts of the day.\nPet Sulcata tortoise love to dig and will often excavate their own burrows.\nThey should be housed alone, as they are highly territorial and aggressive toward each other.\nSulcata tortoises are giant, slow and intelligent reptiles.\nThey are easy to spot because of their large scutes, oval shells and protective spurs. These spurs are the reason behind their common names, the African spurred tortoise and Spur Thigh Tortoise.\nThe Sulcata tortoise is the third largest breed in the world.\nFull size this species can easily grow to over 30 inches, with weights over 150 pounds.\nBefore buying one, keepers should be aware that males can grow to 200 pounds. They can also live for over 100 years, making them a lifelong commitment.\nThese friendly, outgoing tortoises are one of the most personable breeds around. They are a fantastic pet for experienced hobbyists who feel ready to take on a long-term pet.\nWhat do you love about these gentle giants?

{"question":"What are the current therapeutic possibilities for striatal neurogenesis, and what treatment options exist for managing Huntington's disease symptoms?","answer":"Regarding striatal neurogenesis, researchers suggest that increasing the generation or promoting the survival of new neurons might offer therapeutic possibilities, particularly for conditions affecting the striatum. For managing Huntington's disease symptoms specifically, several treatment options are available: medications can provide relief from physical and psychiatric symptoms, physical therapy helps improve coordination and balance, occupational therapy assists with daily activities, speech therapy aids in communication and swallowing problems, and psychotherapy helps with emotional and mental challenges. However, while these treatments can help manage symptoms, they cannot stop the disease's progression.","context":["Adult humans continuously produce new neurons in the striatum, a brain region involved in motor control and cognitive functions, and these neurons could play an important role in recovery from stroke and possibly finding new treatments for neurodegenerative disorders, according to a study published by Cell Press February 20th in the journal Cell. To detect the birth of new neurons in the striatum, the authors used a method that measures carbon-14 found in human DNA as a result of above-ground nuclear testing more than half a century ago.\nThe findings reveal a surprise finding of new neurons in a human brain structure where they haven't been previously described. The discovery may open up new avenues to treat diseases and disorders that affect the striatum.\n\"A wide variety of disorders may affect the striatum, including acquired conditions such as stroke and also genetically inherited disorders such as Huntington's disease,\" says study author Aurélie Ernst of the Karolinska Institute. \"We identified a unique pattern of neurogenesis in the adult human brain that might potentially be useful for the development of novel therapies for some of these neurological diseases.\"\nAdult humans and other mammals produce immature neurons in several brain regions, including the lateral ventricle wall. In rodents, new neurons in this brain structure migrate to the olfactory bulb -- a brain region involved in odor perception. But this is not the case in humans, possibly because the sense of smell is less important for us than for other mammals. The fate of new neurons born in the lateral ventricle wall of humans had been a mystery.\nAttempting to address this question, Jonas Frisén of the Karolinska Institute and his team used an innovative method for dating the birth of neurons. Their strategy takes advantage of the elevated atmospheric levels of carbon-14, a radioactive form of carbon, caused by above-ground nuclear bomb testing more than 50 years ago. Since the 1963 nuclear test ban treaty, atmospheric levels of carbon-14 have declined at a known rate. When we eat plants or animal products, we absorb carbon-14, and the exact atmospheric concentration at any point in time is stamped into DNA every time a new cell is born.\nBy measuring the carbon-14 concentration in DNA from the brain tissue of deceased humans, the researchers found that neurogenesis occurs not only in the lateral ventricle wall in adult humans, but also in an adjacent brain region called the striatum. By contrast, neurogenesis in this brain region was significantly reduced in patients who had Huntington's disease, which is characterized by uncontrolled movements and cognitive decline due to the progressive loss of striatal neurons.\n\"The identification of a subset of neurons that is renewed in the adult human striatum raises the question whether this process can be taken advantage of for therapeutic purposes,\" Ernst says. \"Increasing the generation or promoting the survival of new neurons might offer an attractive possibility in some cases.\"\n- Aurélie Ernst, Kanar Alkass, Samuel Bernard, Mehran Salehpour, Shira Perl, John Tisdale, Göran Possnert, Henrik Druid, Jonas Frisén.

There is no cure, but there are ways to cope with this disease and its symptoms.\nHuntington’s disease is much more common in people with European ancestry, affecting about three to seven out of every 100,000 people of European descent.\nThere are two types of Huntington’s disease: adult onset and early onset.\nAdult onset is the most common type of Huntington’s disease. Symptoms usually begin when people are in their 30s or 40s. Initial signs often include:\nSymptoms that may occur as the disease progresses include:\nThis type of Huntington’s disease is less common. Symptoms usually start to appear in childhood or adolescence. Early-onset Huntington’s disease causes mental, emotional, and physical changes, such as:\nA defect in a single gene causes Huntington’s disease. It’s considered an autosomal dominant disorder. This means that one copy of the abnormal gene is enough to cause the disease. If one of your parents has this genetic defect, you have a 50 percent chance of inheriting it. You can also pass it on to your children.\nThe genetic mutation responsible for Huntington’s disease is different from many other mutations. There isn’t a substitution or a missing section in the gene. Instead, there is a copying error. An area within the gene is copied too many times. The number of repeated copies tends to increase with each generation.\nIn general, symptoms of Huntington’s disease show up earlier in people with a larger number of repeats. The disease also progresses faster as more repeats build up.\nFamily history plays a major role in the diagnosis of Huntington’s disease. However, a variety of clinical and laboratory testing can be done to assist in diagnosing the problem.\nA neurologist will do tests to check your:\nIf you’ve had seizures, you may need an electroencephalogram (EEG). This test measures the electrical activity in your brain.\nBrain-imaging tests can also be used to detect physical changes in your brain.\nYour doctor might ask you to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. This evaluation checks your coping skills, emotional state, and behavioral patterns. A psychiatrist will also look for signs of impaired thinking.\nYou may be tested for substance abuse to see if drugs might explain your symptoms.\nIf you have several symptoms associated with Huntington’s disease, your doctor might recommend genetic testing. A genetic test can definitively diagnose this condition.\nGenetic testing may also help you decide whether or not to have children. Some people with Huntington’s do not want to risk passing the defective gene to the next generation.\nMedications can provide relief from some of your physical and psychiatric symptoms. The types and amounts of drugs needed will change as your condition progresses.\nPhysical therapy can help improve your coordination, balance, and flexibility. With this training, your mobility is improved, and falls may be prevented.\nOccupational therapy can be used to evaluate your daily activities and recommend devices that help with:\nSpeech therapy may be able to help you speak clearly. If you can’t speak, you will be taught other types of communication. Speech therapists can also help with swallowing and eating problems.\nPsychotherapy can help you work through emotional and mental problems. It can also help you develop coping skills.\nThere is no way to stop this disease from progressing. The rate of progression differs for each person and depends on the number of genetic repeats present in your genes. A lower number usually means that the disease will progress more slowly.\nPeople with the adult-onset form of Huntington’s disease usually live for 15 to 20 years after symptoms begin to appear. The early-onset form generally progresses at a faster rate.

{"question":"What essential safety checks should be performed on a vehicle for regular driving, and what additional emergency items should be carried during winter?","answer":"For regular driving, safety checks include performing a 360° inspection of the vehicle, checking headlights, tire pressure, windshield wipers, and fluid levels. The vehicle should be in proper working condition and have adequate gas. For winter driving, additional emergency items that should be carried include: a cellphone with charger, ice-scraper, snow brush, shovel, traction aids (sand or cat litter), tow chain, jumper cables, flashlight with extra batteries, road flares or glow-sticks, blankets, dry clothes, bottled water, snacks, and necessary medications. These items are crucial for survival if stranded in harsh winter conditions.","context":["Driving may seem simple to the experienced motorist, but it requires constant observation and focus to keep you and your passengers safe. Whether you’re driving to a familiar location or setting out for a new destination, driving conditions are unpredictable. Each time you drive, you encounter unexpected road conditions, changing weather, and even new drivers around you.\nA study from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that in 94% of major accidents, motorist mistakes were to blame. The environment caused only 2% of accidents, 2% were caused by vehicle issues, and 2% were attributed to “unknown” causes. This means that human error is common, but it can be decreased, or even eliminated, with a few adjustments to your driving style.\nSmith System‘s driver training is an innovative program designed to reduce collisions. Two thousand companies across the globe have been trained with the Smith System, including Flagger Force. All Flagger Force employees must complete Smith Driving training, both in the office and out in the field. As part of their safety training, this helps employees avoid potential hazards, react to changing conditions, and reduce risks when on the road. Below are some interesting facts to keep in mind while traveling.\nTHE SMITH DRIVING SYSTEM’S 5 KEYS TO SAFETY\nAim High in Steering\nRemember to aim high to keep your focus point well ahead of your vehicle. This extended view of the road will alert you to the traffic ahead and any upcoming dangers. Having a longer eye lead also increases your evaluation time and your range of vision. Because you are paying attention to the area far ahead of your vehicle, it also helps you to avoid rear-end collisions.\nA driver should align their attention high enough so they can view the road as a whole and not just a few feet ahead. Eye lead, or how far forward you’re looking while driving, should extend to the distance you’ll travel in the next 15 seconds, as shown in this graphic.\nGet the Big Picture\nAiming high will help you stay more aware of what’s in front of you. To recognize the cars beside and behind you, use your rearview mirror and side mirrors to help you maintain 360-degree awareness. By checking your mirrors every 5 to 8 seconds, you greatly diminish the visual barriers that may mask the dangers of distracted, angry, or even impaired motorists.\nKeep Your Eyes Moving\nThe third standard of the Smith System is to remain alert. The combination of a static line of sight and the repetitive motion while driving often sends drivers into “a trance”. One way to prevent this dangerous condition is to keep surveying all parts of the road by moving your eyes consistently. Avoid focusing on objects for more than two seconds. By combining road recognition with constant eye movement, you will stay awake, aware, and able to recognize signs of hazards on the road.\nLeave Yourself an Out\nThe fourth principle of the Smith System is to create an escape route for every situation. As you drive, work to make sure that other drivers don’t box you in between vehicles. When you give yourself room to anticipate hazards, you’re much less likely to get into an accident that is the result of others’ careless behaviors. One of the smartest ways to leave yourself an out is to maintain a cushion of distance. Make sure extra space surrounds your vehicle. This extra space will give you more time to react and the ability to anticipate the actions of other drivers.\nMake Sure They See You\nDon’t assume that the other motorists see you, are alert, or even that great at driving. Seek eye contact with other motorists in intersections, and always use the proper warning devices that may include signals and horn honking at the appropriate times. The key to safe driving is clear communication.\nThe Smith Five Keys are a safety guideline that provides helpful techniques for all kinds of driving conditions. When you follow these five keys, you have more control over your environment to avoid potential hazards. As the roads get busier, keep these useful safety keys from the Smith System Driver Improvement Institute in mind.\nWant Even More Safe Driving Tips?\n- Make sure your vehicle is in proper working condition. Perform a circle of safety, or 360° inspection of your car before and after enter your vehicle. Check to see if anything is out of place, check for dings, check to see if your headlights are working, and make sure that your tires aren’t low.\n- Allow for weather. Check the weather forecast before you leave for your trip. Add travel time onto your trip if you are driving in rain or snow. Make sure your vehicle’s wipers are functioning. Check to see if you have the proper wiper fluid in for summer or winter. During the winter, check snow tires or make sure you have scrapers. Make sure your fog lights are working.\n- Take a break. Don’t run your vehicle for extended periods. If you’re traveling long distances, be sure to take pit stops along the way. Not only will this help your engine rest, but it will also give you breaks that will keep you alert.\n- Be prepared. Pack a to-go bag that includes bottled water, food, necessary medicine, flashlights, blankets, and an emergency power supply. Don’t let your gas tank get too low, in case you get stuck in weather or traffic for prolonged periods.\n- Review Your Route. Think about the roads you’ll be traveling, and the conditions in your destination. What is the environment like? How close is the nearest gas station? Are there any major work zones in the area? It’s smart to do a little research on your route before heading out. You’ll gain a better perspective on your destination and travel path—and you may even find a new town to explore along your route.\nBy following this safe driving advice, you’ll be better prepared for the unexpected and better equipped to tackle those summer travel plans. No matter where you’re traveling, get there safely.","Why Not Being Prepared for Winter Driving Could be Fatal\nIt can happen to anyone, your drive seems to be going smooth and boom! Your car starts skidding. It can be both frightening and dangerous experience but knowing how to react when dangerous situations arise, what to check before driving, what to keep in your car for emergencies and what to do if you become stranded in your car will help keep you safe and could even save your life.\nWith winter weather, slow and steady always wins the race, but knowing how to react when trouble strikes can help you avoid accidents and keep your tires on the road. Making sure you follow safe winter driving practices is the best way to proactively avoid winter accidents and other dangerous situations.\nThe most important thing to remember about winter driving is to take it slow. Quick maneuvers are the number one cause of scary skids and spin outs. Many people like to cling to their security blanket thought of their SUV being immune to winter weather. In practice this can be quite the opposite. The heavier your vehicle is and the higher the center of gravity is the more likely the vehicle is to react poorly to rapid driving maneuvers in winter weather. Just slowing down and keeping in mind that no vehicle is impervious to winter driving hazards will help you avoid an unexpected accident.\nIn winter weather many things can happen to hinder the visibility of road signs and other important signals that we use every day to make sure our drive is safe. Being over confident of your route and missing one of these while traveling in winter weather could be very dangerous since your car needs an increased distance to stop without sliding. Take it slow and be observant.\nEvery vehicle requires an increased distance to safely stop without sliding in winter weather. Momentum just works, trying to stop abruptly on a slippery surface will illustrate this very clearly in a dangerous way. Anti-locking brake systems have been mandatory in all cars since September of 2011 and these braking systems are your friend in winter weather. Before ABS was implemented in cars you had to manually pump the brakes like crazy to stop quickly and maintain steering control. Now with ABS built into all newer cars, if you have a car equipped with ABS you can just hit the brakes and your ABS takes care of the rest. You’ll notice a pulse like feeling from the pedal or possibly an almost grinding “thunk-thunk-thunk” type of sound. This is normal and lets you know that the system is rapidly pumping your brakes for you. You can still steer your vehicle with the system fully engaged, this helps you slow down and maintain control.\nNever assume all-wheel-drive will help you stop. Having all four wheels working for you will help keep you moving forward in slippery situations but stopping will require adequate braking. Many people like to assume that having AWD is the mechanical cure all for winter weather but making sure you still have an adequate stopping distance is very important to avoid unwanted skids or worse accidents.\nI know what you’re thinking, if the music is too loud than you’re too old right? With winter driving that’s all wrong. Being able to hear your tires while you’re driving in winter conditions can be a huge indication about the surface you’re driving on. If you can hear the crunch your tires on snow, it’s an indication that you’ve got traction but are on a potentially dangerous surface. When the tires go surprisingly silent this is an indication that you could be driving on sheer ice, a much more dangerous surface to drive on with very little traction. Simply hearing this change can help you safely adjust your driving to fit the surface you’re currently on.\nYou’ve taken all the proactive steps you can, you’re turning right at the next intersection and the back of your car starts to slide left instead. DON’T PANIC. Turning in the direction of the rear wheels (in this case to the left) will help you bring the car back in line with itself. This action is called oversteer and it’s what happens when the back of a car slides out of alignment with the rest of the car and the driver steers in the opposite direction to re-align the car. When doing this it’s important to remember that at this point your car has already lost traction and is in a slide. Make sure you are gentle with your steering wheel and have a firm grip with both hands, and ease off of the gas. Hitting the brakes or punching the gas will only make the slide worse.\nWhether you’re just an everyday motorist or if your company sends its employees out in company owned vehicles, checking and maintaining the following systems can help prevent dangerous situations while driving in winter weather.\nMaking sure your brakes are providing even and balanced braking is important as well as making sure the brake fluid is at the proper level to help combat the increased stopping distance required when driving in slippery weather.\nNeglecting your cars thirst in cold weather could result in a frozen line and could end up causing a major headache in cold weather. To avoid this make sure your windshield wiper fluids are topped off, your coolant is at an adequate fill level and your gas and oil levels aren’t too low.\nMake sure your ignition system is functioning properly and that your battery is fully charged with clean connections. Then make sure your alternator belt is in good shape and has the right tension.\nCarbon monoxide poisoning is a serious threat, it’s very important to make sure your exhaust pipe is clear of snow at all times. A clogged exhaust pipe will send dangerous exhaust fumes into your car and can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning.\nMake sure you have enough tread left on your tires. Bald tires don’t fare too well in slippery conditions. Switching to winter/snow tires in the cold months helps most people manage the longevity of their tires while maintaining better traction in winter conditions.\nMake sure all of your external lights and mirrors are functioning properly and are clear of obstruction from snow. Make sure your defrosters are working correctly and clear your windshield and wipers of any ice and snow. Make sure you clean all of the snow off of your car before hitting the road. In some areas it’s illegal to drive a car that hasn’t been cleared of snow. Not to mention it’s very dangerous for other drivers if a large piece of ice or chunks of snow go flying into traffic while you’re driving. DO NOT USE HOT WATER. Using hot water to clear your windshield of ice and snow is a bad idea unless you enjoy looking through cracked glass. Make sure you use a scraper and brush that are designed for automotive use, no one wants to scratch up their paint job or windows. It’s always a good idea to switch over to a low-temperature anti-freeze for your windshield wipers when dealing with winter driving. Whether you opt for the low-temperature anti-freeze or the regular blue stuff, make sure you’re topped off before hitting the slush, salt and sand covered roads.\nBeing prepared is your best defense for dealing with winter weather. If you find yourself stuck on the side of the road in heavy winter weather being properly prepared could save your life.\nHaving a means of communication is essential if you’re stuck and need help. Keeping a cellphone or two-way radio available in your car can help you make sure you’re able to call out for help in an emergency. Make sure you have the charger available for your cellphone or extra batteries for your radio.\nIf you find yourself stuck in winter weather, having the tools needed to clear the snow and help you clear that ditch are essential. Keep an ice-scraper and snow brush easily available to clear your windows and car of snow. If you know you’re traveling through exceptionally bad winter weather keeping a shovel and traction aids (bag of sand or cat litter) available is great to help you bail yourself out of a chilly situation. Being able to clear the snow from in front of and behind your tires and applying a traction aid to the areas in front of and behind your drive wheels will help you out when you find yourself stuck in deep snow. Keep in mind that the more you spin your tires when you’re stuck the deeper the hole you’re digging yourself into gets. Also, you create more resistance to movement in either direction when your front wheels are turned sharply in either direction. It’s best to try and keep your front tires as straight as possible. Keeping a tow chain in your car can help bail you out when all else fails, but you’ll need a friend (or nice passerby) with a truck to help tow you out. Keeping jumper cables or a battery powered jump pack in your car is a great idea for any season, you never know when your battery may die. In the winter this is more likely, when temperatures drop so does the performance of batteries.\nWhen you’re stuck on the side of the road, or worse in the road, being seen can be the difference of life or death. If you’re involved in a multiple car accident on a highway in heavy winter weather, stay in your car and make sure your lights are on. It’s very dangerous to exit your car in the middle of a multi-car accident. Other motorists may not be able to see you away from your vehicle and could accidentally hit you or your vehicle. Making sure that the headlights and tail lights are on will help make yourself more visible in this situation and the metal frame of your car can help protect you from oncoming motorists. Using a flashlight or any other type of illuminating object will help you stand out in a snow storm. A road flare or glow-stick are great to put out in the road near your car to indicate your there and stopped. Extra batteries are always a good idea if you’re deciding to keep a flash light in your car for emergencies.\nSometimes there’s no avoiding getting stuck. Planning ahead can help keep you comfortable and safe while you wait for help. Blankets and a change of clothes will be essential to help you stay warm and make sure you have a dry set of clothes. This is important when trying to combat hypothermia that could set in if you’re stuck for a long period of time. Keeping bottled water and snacks is important if you are traveling in a remote area through winter weather. Being stuck in hazardous weather far away from people can be fatal if you’re stuck for a long period of time without food and water. If you know you’re traveling far and could get stranded far from other people if you take any medications you’ll want to bring them along in case of an emergency.\nKnowing what to do when you’re stranded in your car in winter weather is essential to survival in these harsh conditions. Thankfully you’ve prepared a solid winter emergency kit after reading our article and have all the tools you need to stay safe while you call and wait for help.\nFirst things first, make sure you’re visible. Calling for help won’t do you any good if the person coming to bail you out can’t see you. It will also help protect you from passing motorists who may not be able to see you. Make sure there are no oncoming motorist and exit your car carefully. Using your flashlight inspect your exhaust pipe and make sure that it’s clear of snow. If you have a road flair this is a good time to use it to make sure you’re seen on the road.\nOnce you’ve made sure the exhaust pipe is clear and you’re illuminated, start the car for a short period of time and run the heater to help bring the temperature in the car up while you call for help with your cellphone or radio. Make sure to only run the car for short periods of time to avoid running out of fuel. While you wait it’s recommended to bundle up with a blanket or additional clothing to help reduce the chances of frostbite or hypothermia.\nWe can’t control the conditions on the road but we can mitigate the dangers involved with driving in winter conditions. Knowing how to react when dangerous situations arise, what to check before driving, what to keep in your car for emergencies and what to do if you become stranded in your car will help keep you safe and could even save your life. Please drive safe and always take every precaution you can when driving in winter weather."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a2d0704f-51d4-444a-abc8-05c041d90e13>","<urn:uuid:fbca2ecb-4878-43ee-be95-e046b4ebb693>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do you calculate throughput in Sagarmala projects? Break down the formula and explain what TVE means in detail.","answer":"Throughput is calculated using the formula T = R - TVE, where R is revenue and TVE represents totally variable expenses. TVE specifically refers to the cost of raw materials or services that are directly incurred to produce the products sold or services delivered. Throughput analysis is unique because it treats direct labor as a fixed expense and doesn't allocate fixed costs to products and services. This method focuses on cash flows rather than traditional cost accounting.","context":["Authorized Share Capital in the case of Sagarmala happens to be INR 1000 crore, and is the number of stock units Sagarmala Development Company Limited (SDCL) has issued in its articles of incorporation. This ASC is open, in that share capital isn’t fully used, and there is ample room for future issuance of additional stock in order to raise capital quickly as and when a demand arises. SDCL can increase the authorized capital at anytime with shareholders’ approval and paying an additional fee to the RoC, Registrar of Companies.\nCapital Budgeting: Business determines and evaluates potential large expenditures/investments. Capital Budgeting is generally a long-term venture, and is a process that SDCL would use (and uses) to identify hat capital projects would create the biggest returns compared with the funds invested in the project. The system of ranking helps establish a potential return in the future, such that the SDCL management can choose where to invest first and most. Let us simply call it the first and most principle of budgeting. Blue Economy that instantiates itself via Sagarmala in India has options to choose from as regards its Capital Budgeting, viz.\n- Throughput analysis – This defines the main motives behind a project, where all the costs are operating costs, and the main emphasis is on maximizing profits in passing through a bottleneck. The best example for Sagarmala speculatively thought out is the marking of Western Shipping Corridor for container traffic and posing a livelihood threat to traditional fishermen. Throughput is an alternative to the traditional cost accounting, but is neither accounting, not costing, since it is focused on cash flows. It does not allocate fixed costs to products and services sold or provided and treats direct labour as a fixed expense. Decisions made are based on three critical monetary variables: throughput, investment or inventory and operating expenses. Mathematically, this is defined as revenue minus totally variable expenses, the cost of raw materials or services incurred to produce the products sold or services delivred. T = R – TVE.\n- Net Present Value (NPV) – this s the value of all future cash flows, either positive or negative over the entire life of an investment discounted to the present. NPV forms a part of an intrinsic valuation, and is employed for valuing business, investment security, capital project, new venture, cost reduction and almost anything involving cash flows.\nNPV = z1/(1 + r) + z2/(1 + r)2 – X\n, where z1 is the cash flow in time 1, z2 is the cash flow in time 2, r is the discount range, and X is the purchase price, or initial investment. NPV takes into account the timing of each cash flow that can result in a large impact on the present value of an investment. It is always better to have cash inflows sooner and cash outflows later. this is one spect where SDCL might encounter a bottleneck and thereby take recourse to throughput analysis. Importantly, NPV deliberates on revolving funds.\n- Internal Rate of Return (IRR) – this is an interest rate at which NPV from all cash flows become zero. IRR qualifies attractiveness of an investment, whereby if IRR of a new project exceeds company’s required rate of return, then investment in that project is desirable, else project stands in need of a rejection. IRR escapes derivation analytically, and must be noted via mathematical trial and error. Interestingly, business spreadsheets are automated to perform these calculations. Mathematically, IRR is:\n0 = P0 + P1/(1 + IRR) + P2/(1 + IRR)2 + …. + Pn/(1 + IRR)n\n, where P0, P1,…, Pn are cash flows in periods of time 1, 2, …, n.\nWith a likelihood of venture capital and private equity expected in Sagarmala accompanied with multiple cash investments over the life-cycle of the project, IRR could come in handy for an IPO.\n4. Discounted Cash Flow – this calculates the present value of an investment’s future cash flows in order to arrive at current fair value estimate for an investment. Mathematically,\nDCF = CF1/(1 + r) + CF2/(1 + r)2 + CF3/(1 + r)3 + … + CFn/(1 + r)n\n, where CFn are cash flows in respective n periods, and r is discount rate of return.\nDCF accounts for the fact that money received today can be invested today, while money we have to wait for cannot. DCF accounts for the time value of money and provides an estimate of what e should spend today to have an investment worth a certain amount of money at a specific point in the future.\n5. Payback period – mathematically, this is defined as:\nPayback Period = Investment required/Annual Project Cash flow\nThis occurs the year plus a number of months before the cash flow turns positive. Though seemingly important, payback period does not consider the time value of investment/money, and is quite inept at handling projects with uneven cash flows.\nSagarmala is a 3-tier SPV structure\nPrivate Players/PPPs OR EPCs/Turnkey – the latter are used for projects with high social impact or low IRR.\nExpenses incurred for project development will be treated as part of equity contribution by SDCL, or, in case SDCL does not have any equity, or expenses incurred are more than the stake of SDCL, SPV will defray SDCL. Divestment possibilities cannot be ruled out in order to recoup capital for future projects."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7c130ecf-8ce7-4c00-b4c0-14511e13ccf8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the connection between grocery store energy management and refrigerant environmental concerns?","answer":"Grocery stores are implementing Energy Management Systems (EMS) to track and manage energy consumption, typically achieving 10% reduction in energy use and 4% reduction in energy costs. These systems monitor temperatures in refrigeration equipment and send automatic alerts for irregularities. This energy management is crucial because refrigeration systems, which use HFC refrigerants, have significant environmental impact. HFCs have a warming potential thousands of times greater than CO2, leading to international efforts through the Kigali Amendment to phase them out. Natural refrigerants like propane and ammonia are being adopted as more environmentally friendly alternatives to reduce this impact.","context":["With COVID-19’s impact on consumer habits and expectations, grocery retailers have had to make significant changes over the past three years, forcing facilities management leaders to adapt and innovate as needed. It turns out this was valuable experience — as we emerge into the post-pandemic era, it’s clear there are only more changes on the horizon for grocers in 2023 and beyond, especially given current economic trends and the rise of sustainability legislation.\nKeep reading to learn about some of the most significant grocery trends facilities management leaders should expect to see in the coming year.\n2023 Grocery Industry Trends Facilities Management Leaders Need to Know\n1. Adapting Spaces to New Shopping Habits\nAs retailers compete to meet the needs of increasingly convenience-conscious consumers, we’ll continue to see grocery store facilities getting makeovers in 2023. Inside Intelligence expects “click and collect,” also known as BOPIS (“buy online pickup in store”) to continue to drive a significant portion of the retail market, accounting for over 40 percent of US grocery ecommerce sales by 2026. Additionally, grocers are seeing higher demand for hot grab-and-go meals as well as healthier to-go options for the increasingly wellness-minded consumer. As a result, grocery facilities management leaders should expect to oversee more post-pandemic building retrofits, and there will be more importance than ever placed on the management of refrigeration and other food and beverage equipment designed to keep ready-to-go meals safe for shoppers.\n2. Sustainable Refrigeration Practices\nOne of the lowest hanging fruits in terms of reducing carbon emissions for grocery retailers, implementing sustainable refrigeration management practices will be top of mind in 2023. The average supermarket uses thousands of pounds of HFC refrigerant and has a leak rate of about 25 percent of the refrigerant charge every year, according to the North American Sustainable Refrigeration Council (NASRC).\nFacilities managers can help reduce emissions of HFCs in the following ways:\n- Implement an effective refrigeration and gas containment program: Take a proactive approach by making leak detection part of every technician service call and using refrigerant leak monitoring systems.\n- Strengthen maintenance regimes: A maintenance program designed to enhance refrigeration performance, for instance with regular case cleaning, will help reduce energy use and GHG emissions, as well as avoid costly product loss when cooling systems break down.\n- Transition to natural refrigerants: As retailers make updates and plan new construction, investing in the right refrigerants and equipment is critical for meeting federal regulations, which phase down the production and use of HFCs by 85 percent by 2036. Natural refrigerants, including CO2, ammonia, and propane, are considered the more eco-friendly solution to reduce HFC emissions by grocery and superstore retailers, according to the NASRC.\n3. Fast EV Charging Stations\nThanks to the passing of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the U.S. is seeing an unprecedented push for electric vehicles, which has led more and more grocery retailers to add EV charging stations as a convenience for shoppers. In particular, grocers are eager to adopt the latest fast charging stations, which thanks to recent significant advancements in the technology, can power up EVs within 15 minutes.\nNot only that, there will be more emphasis on converting grocery fleets to electric, necessitating special EV charging stations specifically for delivery trucks. In addition to taking advantage of uncapped tax credits available through the IRA, grocery stores can help offset infrastructure costs by adding a digital ad revenue stream integrated with charging technology.\nBut while the adoption of EV charging infrastructure is critical for continued growth, most retailers currently don’t have the electrical capacity to offer this convenience to customers at full scale, which means facilities management leaders will be looking for new technologies and best practices to help reduce demand on the energy grid in the coming years.\n4. Investment in Technology and Data Analytics\nIt’s no surprise that as part of an industry-wide trend toward increasing efficiencies and monitoring energy consumption, grocery facilities management leaders are investing in new technology systems and data analytics — especially as energy prices continue to rise at the same time that technologies are becoming more affordable. Here are some of the most leading-edge tools facilities managers are exploring this year:\n● Energy Management Systems (EMS)\nAn EMS helps grocery stores track and manage energy consumption and meet sustainability goals for reducing carbon emissions. According to UNIDO (the United Nations Industry Development Organization), the majority of companies that have implemented EMS have seen two to three times the annual energy savings as those without an EMS.\nAn EMS is best paired with a data analytics platform, such as City’s Spark+ system, an IoT-powered energy management software tool that consolidates all the data from a grocery facility’s EMS systems. Continuously monitoring temperatures in refrigeration and other food and beverage equipment to ensure compliance with food safety requirements, it sends automatic alerts in case of any irregularities, helping prevent energy waste as well as product loss. Through City’s EMS services, large grocery chains averaging 45,000-square-foot stores typically see a 10 percent reduction in energy use and a 4 percent reduction in energy cost.\n● Predictive Technology\nPredictive maintenance helps grocery store facilities managers avoid issues before they lead to equipment failure, unexpected downtime, and the loss of product. Predictive maintenance tools can utilize various technologies in predictive analytics, including ultrasound technology, infrared analysis, vibration analysis, laser-shaft alignment, and AI and machine learning. As a testament to the potential of this technology, SOUNDTech+, the City branded ultrasound predictive maintenance tool powered by DST, has a track record of preventing catastrophic refrigeration failure with 99% accuracy.\n● IoT Framework\nThrough a network of sensors placed on multiple assets across multiple systems, smart technology gives visibility into energy consumption and allows for central control over equipment. Utilizing both predictive analytics and real-time data and allowing energy management systems to communicate with each other, such an IoT system can reduce energy consumption and costs. It can also make it easier for grocery facilities managers to make fully informed decisions that will help protect perishable food products and ensure food safety.","Energy costs of condensate and other waters\nThe following chart shows you the energy costs (from pumping, transport, cooling, and/or treatment) of various sources of water…\nNote the especially high end of the kWh/gallon range for on-site AC (air conditioning) condensate (an active condensate source). Active condensation occurs on mechanically cooled surfaces (surfaces cooler than the air temperature)—where a generated power source such as electricity is needed to cool the surface on which the atmospheric water (moisture in the air) condenses. Excerpted from Rainwater Harvesting for Drylands and Beyond, Volume 1, 3rd Edition.\nNote the typically free on-site waters highlighted above within the red borders — especially AC condensate—, and how their energy costs can range from 0 kWh per gallon/liter to 360 kWh per gallon (95 kWh per liter). A kWh is a kilowatt hour of energy.\nThe average household in\nArizona consumes 1,095 kWh/month\nU.S. consumes 920 kWh/month\nWorld 250 kWh/month\nThe zero energy costs for various water sources reflected in the chart above typically result from harvesting those waters with no energy-consuming pumps or water treatment. Energy costs are incurred once pumps or mechanical water treatment is used. Or, in the case of AC condensate, the high energy cost does not reflect the use of pumps, but rather the large amount of energy the air conditioning unit itself consumes when on.\nDue to the high-energy cost of the manufacture and use of air conditioning units (and their harmful chemical refrigerants – see next section), I don’t consider their condensate to be a truly sustainable on-site water source (even if renewable energy is the power source). But if air conditioners are already on site and used, you ought to at least harvest and use their condensate in beneficial ways, rather than just wastefully drain it away.\nSee appendix 9 of Rainwater Harvesting for Drylands and Beyond, Volume 1, 3rd Edition for charts and examples that show the water costs of different energy sources and the carbon costs of different energy sources in order to make more beneficial and informed choices in your life.\nThe refrigerant in air conditioners, refrigeration units, freezers, and ice machines is a major contributor to climate change\nAccording the book Drawdown, the number one cause of climate changing gases in our atmosphere is the chemical refrigerants used in refrigerators and air conditioners.1\nAs reported in the book, Losing Our Cool: Uncomfortable Truths About Our Air-Conditioned World (and Finding New Ways to Get Through the Summer) by Stan Cox, “The air-conditioning of buildings in America is responsible for a quantity of carbon dioxide equivalent to what would be produced if every household in the country bought an additional vehicle and drove it an average 7,000 miles (11,200 km) per year.”2\nThis is horrifying due to the massive use and ever-expanding growth of the use of such appliances. But the main problem is not the appliances, but the chemical refrigerants used within them. And as history shows there is a path that could remedy this.\nIn the past, the chemical refrigerants (specifically chlorofluorocarbons [CFCs] and hydrochlorofluorocarbons [HCFCs] used to absorb and release heat) in refrigerators and air conditioners used to deplete the ozone layer of our atmosphere, and created massive holes (over entire countries) in the ozone layer. That ozone layer is essential for healthy life on our planet because it absorbs, and protects us from, the sun’s ultraviolet radiation.\nThanks to countries around the world agreeing to, and signing, the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer; CFCs, HCFCs, and other ozone-depleting chemicals such as those that used to be used in aerosol cans and dry cleaning; have been phased out of use. As stated in the book Drawdown, “It took two short years from the discovery of the gaping hole (in the ozone layer) over the Antarctic for the global community to adopt a legally mandated course of action. Now, three decades later, the ozone layer is beginning to heal.”3\nThe replacement chemical refrigerant to CFCs and HCFCs, is primarily hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which does not destroy the ozone layer, but HFCs’ capacity to warm the atmosphere is one thousand to nine thousand times greater than that of carbon dioxide!4\nAs Drawdown states, “In October 2016, officials from more than 170 countries gathered in Kigali, Rwanda, to negotiate a deal to address the problem of HFCs. Despite challenging global politics, they reached a remarkable agreement. Through an amendment to the Montreal Protocol, the world will begin phasing HFCs out of use, starting with high-income countries in 2019 and then expanding to low-income countries — some in 2024, others in 2028. HFC substitutes are already on the market, including natural refrigerants such as propane and ammonium.”5\nThe Kigali Amendment took effect January 2019, and over 65 countries have ratified the agreement,6 but as of this writing the U.S. is not one of them.7 Though on January 27, 2021 President Biden took the first steps for U.S. ratification.8\nCommunicate to your politicians and policy makers the importance of ratifying the Kigali Amendment; and make changes in your own lives, by reducing or eliminating your reliance on, and use of, appliances using HFC refrigerant (Rainwater Harvesting for Drylands and Beyond, Volume 1, 3rd Edition gives you many strategies to do this), and dispose of the refrigerant in a way that will keep it out of the atmosphere (Construction and Demolition: How to Properly Dispose of Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Equipment, https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/documents/ConstrAndDemo_EquipDisposal.pdf, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, accessed 11-1-2019).\n1.

{"question":"What similarities exist between Classical Athenian and Biblical approaches to blood pollution and community involvement in executions?","answer":"Classical Athenian and Biblical laws shared several unique features regarding homicide and execution. Both systems recognized the concept of blood pollution (miasma in Greek law) and involved the community in carrying out death sentences. In Athens, indirect methods of execution like throwing people into chasms or using exposure were preferred to avoid religious pollution from direct killing. Both legal systems also allowed for stoning by the community as a method of execution, and both gave the victim's relatives responsibility for initiating prosecution of the murderer. These features were not present in other ancient Near Eastern legal codes.","context":["The death penalty in Classical Athens\nThis entry was posted on April 6, 2017.\nThe latest issue of Ancient History has an article by Murray Dahm on the death of Socrates. We don’t really go into much detail in the issue as far as Classical Athenian law is concerned. For this blog post, I want to use the death of Socrates to briefly discuss how the Athenians of the fifth and – especially – the fourth centuries BC handled the most extreme form of punishment: the death penalty.\nThe law in Classical Athens\nWhen writing became widespread, laws were recorded to ensure that justice and punishment were no longer arbitrary. Laws weren’t scribbled onto papyrus rolls and hidden; instead, they were engraved into wood or stone and put up for public display. As Douglas MacDowell, a foremost authority on ancient Greek law, put it: ‘A Classical Greek could think of a law as a physical object’ (The Law in Classical Athens , p. 42).\nThe earliest known Athenian lawgiver was Dracon, who wrote down a set of laws in 621/620 BC. The punishment for breaking almost any law was supposedly death (according to Plutarch), and it’s perhaps no surprise that we derive our word ‘draconian’ from this man. It’s difficult to gauge whether or not Plutarch’s summary is accurate. The idea of the Athenians accepting laws that would sentence people to death for relatively minor offences like stealing apples or being convicted of ‘idleness’ seems odd to say the least.\nSince we’re relatively well informed about the laws of Classical Athens, there are a few books available for those who want to learn more. Aside from the book by MacDowell cited earlier, you can also check out his Athenian Homicide Law in the Age of Orators (1963), A.R.W. Harrison’s two-volume study The Law of Athens (1968 & 1971), and S.C. Todd’s more modern The Shape of Athenian Law (1993). MacDowell also wrote a very handy little book called Spartan Law (1986) that offers a nice contrast with the works on Classical Athens.\nThe death penalty was the most severe form of punishment in Athens and usually reserved only for the most severe offenders of the law. Socrates’ case is, in fact, rather peculiar, and Murray Dahm does a good job in issue 9 of summarizing how the sentence came to be. The death sentence was generally reserved for those who had been found guilty of intentional homicide. By contrast, the punishment for unintentional homicide was generally exile, and the person found guilty of that was allowed to keep his property.\nIn an Athenian homicide case, each side was allowed to make two speeches, with the prosecutor and the defendant speaking in turn. At the end of his first speech, the defendant was allowed to go into exile, which was a convenient way for someone who feared conviction of saving his own life. Once the speeches were over, the jury did not leave to deliberate, but immediately cast their votes. The presiding magistrate (called a basileus, ‘king’) pronounced verdict based on the vote. Someone found guilty of intentional homicide would be sentenced to death and his property would be confiscated.\nOf course, these rules applied to Athenian citizens who had been found guilty of murdering a fellow Athenian citizen. We’re not as well informed about murder cases involving the slaying of a foreigner, a resident alien, or a slave, but the general assumption is that punishments were less severe, ranging from possible exile to almost certainly the payment of a fine. In the case of a slave, the fine would have had to be paid to the slave’s owner; in the case of an alien, to that person’s relatives.\nThe death penalty in Classical Athens\nThe punishment was usually meted out immediately after the trial. Again, the case of Socrates was exceptional. We know of three different forms of execution. The first involved throwing the sentenced person down a deep chasm or pit (barathron or, in the fourth century BC, orygma). Later, it seems that people were first killed and their remains tossed into the pit. MacDowell suggests that throwing living people down a chasm for them to die – on impact or later – was no longer practised in the fourth century BC (op. cit., p. 255).\nThe second method was through the use of a tympanon. This has been the source of some confusion. A late lexicographer, as explained by MacDowell in his Athenian Homicide Law (pp. 111 – 12), explained that the tympanon was shaped like a club, and that it was later replaced by a sword, suggesting that criminals were beaten to death. MacDowell and other writers, including Todd, suggest that it was a board stuck into the ground to which the victim was fastened and left to die of exposure and thirst, in a manner roughly similar to crucifixion.\nThe third method was death by drinking hemlock. This was how Socrates ultimately met his end. Supposedly, the Thirty Tyrants in 404/403 BC had sentenced a few other men to drink hemlock. But these instances are rare, and limited to the years around 400 BC. Death by hemlock appears not to have been used before 404/403 or after 399 BC, except in the case of suicides. As such, it seems unlikely that it was ever very common.\nMacDowell writes that it ‘is remarkable that neither hanging nor decapitation seems to have been used.’ I’m not sure that this is so remarkable. Murdering a person caused religious pollution (miasma), from which a person had to be ritually cleansed. This is the reason why, in so many stories of Greek mythology, unwanted infants are left to die from exposure rather than simply killed – the act of killing a person would have had serious consequences on the executioner and whoever aided him (possibly including the jury and the presiding magistrates).\nInstead, the ancient Greeks in general preferred to sentence people to death in indirect ways: by throwing them into a precipice, tying them still alive to a board to die of exposure, or indeed by having the convicted criminal drink a cup of hemlock. In this way, the people involved in carrying out the sentence did not run the risk of being regarded as murderers themselves.","After the introduction (covered in my previous post) Russell Gmirkin divides chapter three of Plato and the Creation of the Hebrew Bible, “Biblical, Ancient Near Eastern and Greek Laws” into thematic sections:\n- laws relating to homicide,\n- laws relating to assault,\n- to theft,\n- to marriage and inheritance,\n- to sexual offences,\n- to slavery,\n- to social legislation (concerning resident foreigners, widows, orphans, the poor, disabled persons, etc.),\n- to livestock,\n- to property crimes and agricultural law,\n- to commerce,\n- to military law,\n- to treason,\n- to “religious” or laws concerning the sacred,\n- and finally general ethical laws.\nEach section documents details the three sources of laws — biblical, ANE and Greek — and concludes with a comparative discussion.\nNear Eastern law codes included Hittite laws, the law codes of Eshnunna (LE), Hammurabi (LH), Ur-Nammu, Neo-Babylonian and Middle Assyrian laws and palace decrees and the Telepinu Edict. Points of Greek law are drawn from the writings of Plato, Aristotle, Lysias, Demosthenes, Xenophon, among others including Aeschylus and Andocides.\nThe chapter extends to 109 pages and includes 369 endnotes and a bibliography of over 140 titles.\nThis post looks at one of the above sections and Russell Gmirkin’s observations on the extent of the biblical laws’ similarity or otherwise to counterparts in the Near Eastern and Greek worlds.\nAll three geographical regions unsurprisingly stress the importance of lex talionis, of vengeance and deterrence as intended purposes of their legislation with respect to murder or even accidental killing.\nBut there are a number of significant points Greek and biblical law share that are nowhere found among our surviving evidence for laws in Mesopotamian and Asia Minor civilizations. These Greek-biblical similarities include\n- the recognition of different psychological states in determining appropriate punishments\n- the idea of blood pollution in the land\n- the responsibility of the relatives of the victim to initiate prosecution of the murderer\n- the possibility of at least temporary sanctuary in a temple\n- and the option of exile\n- stoning by the community\n- the killing of an animal responsible for killing a person\n- killing a burglar entering a house at night was justifiable homicide (ANE law required the execution of such a burglar but it is not stated that a house-owner himself could justifiably kill the burglar in the act)\n“State of mind”\nOn the first point, the recognition of “state of mind” factors in determining penalties, Gmirkin writes:\nPlato’s Laws contained an innovation on the Athenian laws for intentional homicide by distinguishing premeditated and unpremeditated homicide. Plato held that those murders committed with cold premeditation received a greater punishment in the form of a longer term of exile than those commit ted on impulse with no forethought, despite an equal degree of malice (Plato, Laws 9.866d-869e; cf. Chase 1933: 168-9,171-2; Loomis 1972: 93—4; MacDowell 1978: 115; Gagarin 1981: 35).\nHere is part of Plato’s explanation:\nFor murder is committed in passion by those who, on a sudden and without intent to kill, destroy a man by blows or some such means in an immediate attack, when the deed is at once followed by repentance; and it is also a case of murder done in passion whenever men who are insulted by shameful words or actions seek for vengeance, and end by killing a man with deliberate intent to kill, and feel no repentance for the deed. We must lay it down, as it seems, that these murders are of two kinds, both as a rule done in passion, and most properly described as lying midway between the voluntary and the involuntary. None the less, each of these kinds tends to resemble one or other of these contraries; for the man who retains his passion and takes vengeance, not suddenly on the spur of the moment, but after lapse of time, and with deliberate intent, resembles the voluntary murderer; whereas the man who does not nurse his rage, but gives way to it at once on the spur of the moment and without deliberate intent, has a likeness to the involuntary murderer; yet neither is he wholly involuntary, but bears a resemblance thereto. Thus murders done in passion are difficult to define,—whether one should treat them in law as voluntary or involuntary. The best and truest way is to class them both as resemblances, and to distinguish them by the mark of deliberate intent or lack of intent, and to impose more severe penalties on those who slay with intent and in anger, and milder penalties on those who do so without intent and on a sudden. For that which resembles a greater evil must be more heavily punished, that which resembles a lesser evil more lightly. So our laws also must do likewise. . . . .\nIf a man with his own hand slay a free man, and the deed be done in rage without deliberate intent, he shall suffer such other penalties as it is proper for the man to suffer who has slain without passion, and he shall be compelled to go into exile for two years, thereby chastising his own passion.\nCompare Exodus 21:13\n12 “He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death. 13 However, if he did not lie in wait [i.e. there was no premeditation], but God delivered him into his hand [i.e. indicating this was an instance of intentional homicide], then I will appoint for you a place where he may flee.\nThe explanatory phrases I have added are from Gmirkin’s endnotes.\nWe also have in this example a reference to exile as a form of penalty, something unknown in our records of ANE laws.

{"question":"What obstacles do traditional manufacturing facilities face in adopting new energy management systems compared to the advantages that modern BEMIS (Building Energy Management Information Systems) offer? What's the key difference? ¿Cuál es la diferencia principal?","answer":"Manufacturing facilities face significant obstacles including production-focused mindsets, high capital costs ($150,000-$250,000), lack of budget allocation, and resistance to systems that might interfere with existing production controls. They require extensive validation from industry experts and established OEMs before implementing new systems. In contrast, BEMIS offers clear advantages through real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and automated optimization. These systems can analyze equipment performance, send alerts about potential issues, and automatically adjust operations to save energy. They can integrate with multiple building systems and provide remote access to data and controls, while offering flexible implementation that doesn't disrupt core operations. The key difference is that BEMIS is designed to enhance operations without risk, while manufacturing facilities view any new system as a potential threat to production.","context":["Buildings and Facilities Energy Efficiency Insights: Part 1\nOver the lifetime of a building, up to 75% of its costs will be associated with operations. That can translate to 10-20 percent of annual indirect expenses in industries such as retail, real estate, transportation, and manufacturing where managing facilities is a key aspect of doing business. Advances in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies offer opportunities reduce these costs by optimizing operational elements like maintenance, occupant experience, and energy consumption. However, IoT adoption lags in the buildings and facilities management space.\nWe sat down with energy and technology expert Kevin Klustner to discuss the state of buildings and facilities management as well as insights around optimizing energy efficiency. Kevin is the executive director of the University of Washington’s Center for Advanced Materials and Clean Energy Technologies (CAMCET). His past experience includes executive roles at a variety of companies in the technology and energy spaces. Prior to CAMCET, he was the CEO of Powerit Solutions, a cloud-based industrial energy efficiency platform, which was acquired by Customized Energy Solutions. Kevin has also served as CEO of Verdiem, an energy efficiency software company, and Chief Revenue Officer of Witz, a national construction company.\nPart 1 of our conversation follows below. Part 2 is available here.\nBsquare: At its core, is buildings and facilities management really about energy management? In other words, for companies in this space—be it a bank, retailer, manufacturer, or grocery store—is it actually about optimizing energy use and operations?\nKevin: In any facility you’ll find all kinds of control systems, whether it’s to manage the production line, HVAC, refrigeration, you name it. So, there are a lot of things that require power inside these buildings, making energy an important part of overall management. However, it’s not the only important part.\nKevin: It depends on the industry. For instance, in manufacturing, the answer is no. At any plant, production is at the top of the list. It’s the key to the business, and the production managers on the manufacturing floor don’t want anything to screw it up. That’s not to say energy consumption isn’t material to the bottom line, but any initiatives to improve efficiency cannot impact production. Installing other types of systems and controls makes them very nervous unless it’s blessed by their experts.\nNow with commercial buildings, I think it [energy management] is a high priority because energy represents such a big portion of expenses. Furthermore, the systems inside a commercial building are much less complicated than those on a manufacturing floor, and installing energy management systems doesn’t run the risk of damaging the core product. So, in that area, I think energy management can rise towards the top of the list because of the potential cost savings. You can impact the bottom line and integrating won’t screw anything up—you’re not going to shut down production, for example.\nKevin: That’s a broad question, but yes. The “don’t mess with my production line” attitude I just mentioned is one of the most prominent examples. That output prioritization mindset isn’t going away, so finding a solution that works seamlessly with the existing control systems is critical.\nTo overcome this roadblock, it’s helpful to understand how those existing systems ended up on the production line in the first place. OEMs like Rockwell Automation and Johnson Controls built up multibillion-dollar businesses selling instruments, controls, and software into the manufacturing space. This didn’t happen overnight. These companies spent a long time with experts and have developed an expertise and credibility inside the manufacturing world. Now plant managers will take their recommendations, especially if they’re already using products from the same OEM in other areas of process control.\nCompanies should look for the same commitment in an energy management solution. Has the solution vendor put in that effort to build up credibility in your respective industry? Will they send technical people, experts on site to really work with your SMEs to figure out the best way to implement a solution?\nMajor players in control manufacturing have not necessarily integrated energy management into their product lines yet. I think they want to do that and partnering with companies specializing in energy management is the logical next step. Integrating an existing energy management system into process controls that are already in place can help these bigger, established OEMs to bring solutions to market on a shorter, more efficient timeline.\nThe capital outlay associated with integrating into the production line is also a big obstacle, and always has been. These systems can go for upwards of $150,000 to $250,000. Yearly budgets don’t necessarily include a line item for energy management, it’s an afterthought. The problem is that energy management is viewed as really nice to have, but it’s not a must-have. And a lot of the times decision-makers have never even budgeted for anything like that, so ignorance of how to even find the money compounds the problem.\nLack of awareness is a major underlying issue. Energy management is not necessarily top of mind in day-to-day operations at a steel plant or food processing plant. They’re focused on production and want to leave those systems sacrosanct. So, to initiate the mindset shift that an energy solution won’t screw up production and warrants a budget line item, an organization must first recognize that this is a problem they need to solve and there are competitive benefits to doing so.\nThat said, energy management is starting to crawl up the ladder in terms of mindset and awareness. More and more companies are setting sustainability goals and energy consumption goals. It’s good timing to begin thinking about this because I think energy consumption will become a mainstream business concern that we’ll begin to see incorporated into the planning for all kinds of new buildings and facilities, such as production plants and office parks.\nKevin: Well, external sustainability drives corporate decisions in terms of doing something to address the issue. Once a company embraces it [sustainability] and sets a goal to reduce its carbon footprint by 50%, then it becomes a key performance metric. And that’s when new line items start to show up in the budget. This forces production managers to think about energy consumption and how to manage it in the context of their production facilities.\nOf course, it’s a little bit different with buildings outside the manufacturing sector, because the landlord doesn’t pay the electricity or energy bills. They just pass it along to the tenants. That said, green buildings—and energy efficiency by extension—are increasingly becoming a selling point. So now construction of energy-efficient new buildings is on the rise, which requires better overall controls and energy management systems built in from the start.","New Content Updates\nEducational Webcast Alerts\nBuilding Products/Technology Notices\nAccess Exclusive Member Content\nBy James Newman\nEnergy Efficiency Article Use Policy\nThe U.S. average retail price of electricity in the commercial sector has been on the rise, according to data collected by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Fortunately, technology and tools exist today that help facility managers keep track of how their buildings use energy, and help pay for energy upgrades to keep costs down.\nWhile energy costs are going up, total energy used in a building can go down. Moreover, not only can you reduce the overall costs of energy, but you can also reduce the many costs associated with building operations and maintenance and make your building more attractive to tenants and buyers.\nTechnological tools available today can deliver efficiencies, cost savings and convenience not imagined 15 or even 10 years ago. Consider, for example, the evolution of the BAS.\nBAS and EMS traditionally stored all the information they collected on a single “owner’s” computer where they could be reviewed only on-site, on that specific computer. Today’s systems, with additional sensors that collect temperatures, pressures, and percentages of various important parameters, keep much more data and store it in a way that anyone with proper clearance can access. Now facility managers on- or off-site have real-time data and can know in an instant what is happening with their HVAC, lighting, security, or elevator systems, and can control them remotely.\nThese cloud-based EMS, now sometimes called building energy management information systems (BEMIS), collect and process data in real-time. They help facility managers know what their various systems are doing at any given moment, and also where there might be an issue in the future. They can analyze the operation of a piece of equipment such as a chiller, a cooling tower, a pump, lighting fixtures, or even an elevator or escalator, to alert the facility manager to potential problems.\nSeveral types of BEMIS are available. The right one for a building depends on what is needed and the budget. One type is programmed to know how the building equipment is supposed to operate in optimal circumstances. It can notify someone when a piece of equipment or system is operating outside of its given parameters. Another type can develop algorithms that show when equipment begins to move outside the boundaries in which it had been operating when it was first installed.\nA BEMIS gives the building engineer, facility manager or even the building owner information, and therefore, control. The system can send simple written messages via e-mail or text, or audible or visual alerts. The message tells the maintenance personnel that everything is proceeding as it is supposed to, e.g., a green light, or that a problem might be coming, e.g., a yellow or orange light, or that there is a problem now, e.g., a red light. Having this information, and the ability to act on it remotely, greatly minimizes complaints and risk, all while saving money for the building owner and making tenants happier. BEMIS also help lower costs — often automatically — by lowering speeds on motor-driven equipment, lowering wattage on lamps, or even turning off non-essential equipment or systems.\nWhen upgrading to a BEMIS, be sure that the various technologies and control systems already in a building can communicate with each other. Today, it is not just the HVAC or the lighting, but all the systems in the building, including the elevators and escalators, and often even the security and fire alarm systems (unless those systems have to be on their own), to mention only a few.\nNew Technology, Cloud-Based BAS Lead To Energy Efficiency\n7 Ways To Finance Energy Efficiency Projects\nHow Green Building Certification Has Helped FMs Save Energy"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7c49b5bd-2d6a-428f-ad3f-e53e85caf064>","<urn:uuid:4c0258df-ada3-4bb0-931e-67163cfe5cf3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key similarities between the wall assembly mechanisms in parasitic Eimeria and the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, particularly regarding their protective components?","answer":"Both Eimeria and Candida albicans share common wall components that are important for protection. The sporocyst wall of Eimeria contains tyrosine-rich proteins and is biochemically similar to its oocyst wall. Similarly, Candida albicans contains chitosan and dityrosine in its walls, components that are also found in pathogenic fungi but are absent from mammalian cells. These shared components are significant because they are involved in environmental protection and could be potential targets for drugs, as they are not found in mammalian extracellular matrices.","context":["Discovery of a tyrosine-rich sporocyst wall protein in Eimeria tenella\n© Walker et al. 2016\nReceived: 4 January 2016\nAccepted: 24 February 2016\nPublished: 2 March 2016\nEimeria is an important genus of apicomplexan parasites. A defining feature of these parasites is the oocyst, which is transmitted into the environment via the faeces of definitive hosts. The oocyst wall contains cross-linked, tyrosine-rich proteins and protects eight infectious sporozoites, housed in pairs within a second walled structure, the sporocyst. The biochemical basis for sporocyst wall formation is not known.\nHere, we report the discovery of a novel tyrosine-rich protein, EtSWP1, in Eimeria tenella. Like the tyrosine-rich proteins of the oocyst wall, EtSWP1 is an intrinsically disordered protein with the tyrosine residues concentrated in a specific region of the protein, located immediately following the region of intrinsic disorder. We engineered E. tenella to express mCherry-tagged EtSWP1 and showed that the tagged protein localises specifically to sporocyst walls, indicating that the biochemistry of sporocyst wall assembly is analagous to that of oocyst walls.\nTyrosine-rich proteins are known to be key components of the oocyst wall and we now demonstrate, using gene and protein analyses combined with genetic manipulation, that a novel tyrosine-rich protein is specific for the sporocyst wall. This finding is important because it shows that the biochemistry of these two distinct walls is similar and, hence, brings targeted disruption of sporulation and, therefore, potential neutralisation of oocysts in the environment, a step closer.\nKeywordsEimeria Coccidia Apicomplexa Oocyst Sporocyst Dityrosine bond\nApicomplexan parasites of the genus, Eimeria, cause coccidiosis in a variety of livestock and poultry; in the case of the latter, the industry loses in excess of US$2 billion dollars per year due to coccidiosis . These obligate intracellular parasites are highly contagious, due primarily to the resilient nature of the oocyst, an important developmental stage that is transmitted into the environment via the faeces of definitive hosts. The oocyst wall is the primary barrier between the harsh external environment and the infectious cargo, eight dormant sporozoites. However, these sporozoites are further housed in pairs within four sporocysts, a structure that is itself characterised by a protective barrier, the sporocyst wall.\nSeveral oocyst wall proteins have been identified and characterised to different degrees  including: a cysteine-rich protein, EtOWP6, which is found in the outer layer of the oocyst wall and is related to a family of proteins found in other apicomplexan parasites, namely Cryptosporidium parvum and Toxoplasma gondii; a histidine-rich protein, which localises to the inner oocyst wall; and, GAM56 and GAM82, proteins that are found in wall forming bodies type 2 of macrogametocytes, contain tyrosine-rich regions, and are processed into smaller, tyrosine-rich proteins, which are incorporated into the inner layer of the oocyst wall. GAM56 and GAM82 are also the major components of a transmission blocking vaccine to prevent coccidiosis in poultry . In contrast to oocysts, little is known about the biochemical composition of the sporocyst wall of coccidian parasites  despite recent transcriptome profiling of different E. tenella developmental stages [5, 6].\nAmongst the 17 genes listed in Fig. 1a, ETH_00000115 stands out; the gene model is predicted to encode a protein that has 7.1 % tyrosine residues (16 of 224 amino acids), which is more than twice that of the next highest (encoded by ETH_00025345). This is potentially significant because, like the oocyst wall, the sporocyst wall of E. tenella fluoresces blue under UV excitation (Fig. 1b,c), a feature that indicates the possible presence of cross-linked tyrosine-rich proteins . Moreover, the predicted amino acid sequence (Fig. 1d) of ETH_00000115 shows that most of these tyrosines are confined to a specific region of the protein, which is analogous to the amino acid sequences of GAM56 and GAM82.\nWe searched for homologues of ETH_00000115 in other Coccidia but, with the exception of a highly conserved protein in Eimeria necatrix (Fig. 1d), conventional BLASTP analysis against non-redundant protein databases failed to identify homologues of ETH_00000115, including in any other Apicomplexa. Furthermore, ETH_00000115 showed no homology to any previously described protein domains, except for a predicted N-terminal signal peptide, identified using the SignalP 4.1 Server at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP . However, by searching for the KY-rich sequence, YKCKKAKGKGKYYKK, we were able to identify a putative homologue in Eimeria brunetti, the otherwise ED-rich region and C-terminal sequence of which are dominated by numerous poly-alanine stretches (Fig. 1d). Like ETH_00000115, the E. necatrix and E. brunetti proteins contain a distinct KY-rich region. All three proteins contain only three cysteine residues but these appear to be strategically placed, with the first near the cleavage site of the signal peptides and the other two at the start of the KY-rich regions, separated by a conserved HGYK sequence.\nIn both GAM56 and GAM82, the tyrosine-rich regions are also rich in serine residues whereas in ETH_00000115, the tyrosine residues are accompanied by lysine residues. Upstream of, and almost directly adjacent to the lysine and tyrosine-rich (or KY-rich) domain is a 22-residue acidic domain or “ED-rich” domain, which is composed of ten glutamic acid (E) and five aspartic acid (D) residues. Directly downstream of the KY-rich domain are two copies of an imperfect repeat, we have called Repeat 1 (Fig. 1e).\nQuantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to assess stage-specific expression of ETH_00000115. The relative transcript abundance of ETH-00000115 was determined relative to the et18s small subunit ribosomal RNA for each developmental stage using chicken infection regimens and PCR protocols exactly as described previously . The forward primer was 5′-CGCTGAGGAAGAAATGGAAG-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-TAAGTGCAAAAAGGCCAAGG-3′. Analysis by qRT-PCR confirms that ETH_00000115 transcript is highly abundant in sporulated oocysts but essentially absent in other stages, such as merozoites, gametocytes and unsporulated oocysts (Fig. 1f).\nThe tyrosine-rich oocyst wall protein, GAM56 is known to possess significant regions of intrinsic disorder within its structure, which is dominated by random coils, with some helices but few sheets/strands . Two repercussions of this are predicted : first, intrinsically disordered proteins are susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, as observed for GAM56; and, second, the inherent flexibility of disordered proteins may increase the possibility of tyrosine residues from individual tyrosine-rich proteins coming into the proximity of each other more readily, thereby facilitating crosslinking. We used DISOPRED3  to analyse the amino acid sequences of EtSWP1, EnSWP1 and EbSWP1 to determine if these proteins possess similar secondary structures to GAM56; DISOPRED3 has been used recently, with significant success, to identify regions of intrinsic disorder in the structure of apicomplexan proteins . We found that all three SWP1s were dominated by coil structures, with some helices and very little sheet/strand structures (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Analyses using I-Tasser [16–19] generated similar predictions (Additional file 2: Figure S2). DISOPRED3 also predicted significant regions of intrinsic disorder within all the SWP1s, most notably in the ED-rich region preceding the KY-rich sequence (Additional file 3: Figure S3); GAM56 is, likewise, intrinsically disordered just prior to the tyrosine-rich region. We therefore predict that SWP1 behaves similarly to GAM56 in wall assembly.\nBLASTP searches also failed to identify any homologues of EtSWP1 in the cyst forming coccidians, Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum or Hammondia hammondi, but, by searching for proteins with similar percentages of lysine, tyrosine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid, three sequences (TGME49_037080, NCLIV_050960 and HHA_237080) that are highly conserved across these three parasites were discovered (each with ~21 % identity with EtSWP1). However, TGME49_037080 has already been identified as more likely to be a component of the oocyst wall and not the sporocyst wall of T. gondii by transcriptomic  and proteomic  analyses.\nThere are other tyrosine-rich proteins indicated by transcriptomic analysis of T. gondii oocysts as being potential components of the sporocyst wall  but the localisation of these proteins specifically to the sporocyst wall has not been confirmed. The discovery that EtSWP1 is targeted specifically to the sporocyst wall is important because, in combination with the recent finding that the sporocyst wall contains cysteine-rich proteins , it shows that the construction of the sporocyst wall is biochemically similar to the oocyst wall despite being assembled via a different cell biology mechanism; in contrast to oocyst wall formation, which occurs via sequential, coordinated migration and disaggregation of veil forming bodies, wall forming bodies type 1 and wall forming bodies type 2 , the wall of the sporocyst forms via condensation of cytoplasmic material not contained in defined organelles or vesicles [22, 24]. Our discovery of a tyrosine-rich protein in the sporocyst wall brings targeted disruption of sporulation and, therefore, potential neutralisation of oocysts in the poultry house, a step closer.\nAnimal experimentation was conducted under protocols approved by the University of Technology, Sydney Animal Ethics Committee (protocol numbers 2008–96 and 2008–188) under a protocol (registration number 2012-11-9) and/or by the ethics committee, CEEA VdL, and according to French legislation (French Government Decree 2001–464) and EEC regulations (86/609/CEE).\nWe are grateful to the staff of the Ernst Facility at the University of Technology, Sydney, for their care of the chickens used in this study.

This grant is focused on elucidating the structure and mechanism of assembly of the outer two layers of the spore wall. These two layers, comprised of the polysaccharide chitosan and the polyphenol dityrosine, are absent from vegetative cells and enable spores to resist a variety of environmental stresses. Importantly, although chitosan and dityrosine are absent from vegetative cell walls in budding yeast they are present in the walls of many pathogenic fungi such as Candida albicans. Chitosan and dityrosine are not found in mammalian extracellular matrices, meaning that drugs may be found that specifically inhibit fungal cell wall assembly without affecting mammalian cells. The budding yeast spore wall provides an excellent model system to study fungal wall morphogenesis. Experiments in this grant are divided into three interrelated aims: (1) define the composition and structure of the outer spore wall and elucidate the biosynthetic pathways by which the components are synthesized and incorporated into the spore wall;(2) elaborate on our studies which have indicated that dolichol, an essential lipid required for glycosylation in vegetative cells, has a novel role in coordinating outer spore wall formation and (3) apply the knowledge gained from our studies of spore wall assembly to define the conserved genetic toolkit essential for construction of the chitosan/dityrosine module of in cell walls of Candida albicans.\nThe wall of fungal cells surrounds the cell and is the interface between the cell and its environment. In pathogenic fungi, proper function of the cell wall is important for survival in the host and drugs targeting cell wall assembly are effective antifungal agents. The spores of baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are not pathogenic but are surrounded by a complex coat, the spore wall, which includes many of the same components found in the walls of pathogenic fungi. We are using spore wall formation as a model system to unravel the biochemistry and genetics of fungal wall assembly. In particular, this application focuses on two polymers, chitosan and dityrosine, that are incorporated together into the wall. The chemical linkages between these polymers will be defined as well as the conserved genes required for their incorporation. The genes and activities identified in these studies will provide potential targets for the development of new antifungal drugs.\n|Omerza, Gregory; Tio, Chong Wai; Philips, Timothy et al.

{"question":"How do Victorian mechanical devices like the sheet-iron bellows compare to modern engineering approaches in terms of predicting mechanical failures?","answer":"Victorian mechanical devices like the sheet-iron bellows, powered by a turned-wood wheel, represent early mechanical engineering, while modern approaches focus on sophisticated failure prediction methods. Current engineering uses mathematical models to predict failures through fatigue equations, crack growth analysis, and damage accumulation calculations. For example, the Palmgren-Miner rule helps calculate how loading cycles contribute to damage, and monitoring systems can track deterioration through measurable parameters to predict when maintenance is needed before critical failure occurs.","context":["From a playful 20th century stamp licker to a ‘Time is Money’ calculating machine, here is a look at some of the fascinating gadgets, gizmos and mechanical devices going under the hammer in the next month or so.\nBeam pumping engine model\nThis exhibition-quality model of the Granville colliery beam pumping engine, measuring 3ft 10in (1.17m) high, is offered at Bohnam’s Gentleman’s Library Sale in London on January 30. It features a mahogany lagged vertical steam boiler with pressure gauge, a whistle, safety valve and brass chimney cap as well as brass and copper fittings and pipe work. The model is now operated by a chine drive from an electric motor. It is contained in a brass-bound, mahogany-glazed display case stand with a fixed plate reading Granville 1908. It has an estimate of £5000-8000.\nThe Kinora Viewer was an early form of motion picture technology, invented by Lumière in France in 1897. It worked on the ‘flip book’ principal, with a reel of images attached to the toothed wheel at the bottom and turned with the hand crank. The revolving images flipped over against the static peg and the moving pictures were viewed through the eyepiece.\nIn 1898 the British Mutoscope & Biograph company purchased the rights to the Kinora and it appeared on the market in 1902 where it was bought for home entertainment.\nThis model has a gilt lacquered viewer and oak plinth base with a maker’s plate to the frame. It is offered at Bearnes Hampton & Littlewood’s auction of March 6 where it has an estimate of £500-700.\nIt is part of the Philip Banham Collection of Optical Toys, Prints and Stereocopic which also features a zoetrope, a zograscope and a few antique kaleidoscopes. Kinora reels are also available at the auction.\nThe Columbian press\nThe Columbian printing press was invented by George Clymer of Philadelphia in 1813. It used the counterweight principle, increasing the amount of pressure that could be applied to the printing forme without causing physical strain to the pressman. It is also the most highly decorated of iron handpresses, including the Eagle counterweight which was a reference to Clymer’s homeland. He left in 1818 for the UK.\nIt is catalogued as ‘legendary’ by John McInnis Auctioneers of Masachusetts, US, which offers an example of the press in its four-day catalogue only sale, running until January 27. It has an estimate of $5000-10,000.\nMechanical calculating machine\nIn 1907 the German company Ludwig Spitz & Co started producing improved forms of the arithrometer which they sold as the TIM, which they said stood for “Time Is Money”. An example of the machine, the PAC250, goes under the hammer at Tennants Auctioneers in North Yorkshire on January 30 as part of its Scientific and Musical Instruments sale. Offered in working order, with some superficial wear, the machine has an estimate of £40-60.\nThe face of this 1950s penny-in-the-slot “Passion Tester” features 12 levels from ‘mild’ and ‘harmless’ to ‘hot stuff’ and ‘wild’, with lightbulbs to indicate each users’ degree of desire. Supplied by Tableau & Automata Devices, it measures 2ft 10in (86cm) high with an oak case and chromium plated cresting and mounts. Canterbury Auction Galleries includes it in its auction of February 5-6 (just in time for Valentine’s Day) where it has an estimate of £300-500.\nMechanical hearth bellows\nA Victorian sheet-iron mechanical hearth bellows, powered by a turned-wood wheel, is among the best gadgets included in the Harold Ward Collection, which goes under the hammer at Mellors & Kirk in Nottingham from February 6-7. The huge collection includes many lots of porcelain and fine art but also includes a selection of mechanical items and curiosities. The bellows is offered with a tinplate hand lantern with an estimate of £50-70. Also on offer are a glass Victorian rolling pin, a Goerge III mahogany table-top spinning wheel and a brass door rim lock believed to have belonged to the Brontë sisters.\nHutchinson Scott includes this early 20th century porcelain novelty stamp licker in the form of Humpty Dumpty in its New Year Catalogue Sale, running until January 26. It features a mechanical pop-out tongue, measures 5in (13cm) high and has an estimate of £100-150.","As we have seen in Chapter 4, failure rate often changes with time (Fig. 1 there). This is because the main causes of failures change with time. The early failures (stage I) are mostly caused by errors in design, manufacture, assembly, or building process or due to hidden defects, and the instant of their occurrence cannot be predicted. The failures in stage II (useful life) arise from external reasons (random overloading, collision with another object, climatic events, and errors of personnel) and also cannot be predicted. Only if the pertinent failure rate is known one can predict approximately how often failures can be expected and take suitable measures to mitigate their effects. The failures in stage III (aging and wear-out) arise due to the internal “weakness” of the object and appear after some time of operation even under appropriate conditions of use. Many objects fail due to wear, fatigue, creep, corrosion, or other processes of gradual deterioration. Fortunately, in such cases a possibility exists to predict (with higher or lower accuracy) the time when the object is about to fail, provided that the relationship between the load intensity and the rate of deterioration is known.\nTwo principal ways exist:\n1. If the basic mechanism of degradation is known, one can express the deterioration rate as a function of the characteristic load and then derive a formula for the calculation of the time to failure. For the known load, the time to failure can thus be predicted in advance (e.g. during the design stage). Vice versa, it is possible to find such dimensions of loaded parts, which will guarantee an acceptably low rate of deterioration and thus the demanded life.\n2. Due to deterioration, the load response of many objects also gradually changes. If a quantity characterizing the degradation is known (e.g. the magnitude of vibrations), it is possible to monitor its time development in the real object. These data can be extrapolated, and the time can be predicted at which the characteristic quantity reaches the critical value.\nBoth approaches may be combined. During design, the time to failure can be predicted, and during operation, this prediction is updated with respect to the actual time history of the operation and response. The object is never allowed in operation until the instant of expected failure. At a reasonable time before it, a check of its condition is made and a suitable time for repair or next inspection is proposed. Both cases will be discussed here in detail.\nPrediction of the time to fatigue failure from the law of material degradation\nA typical example is the fatigue of metallic parts under cyclic or periodic loading. If the characteristic stress is higher than the so-called fatigue limit, a small crack arises in the component after some time of operation and grows slowly, and when it reaches the critical size, the component breaks. The number of cycles to failure Nf depends on the stress amplitude σa in the loading cycle [1, 2]. In the simplest case, it can be expressed by the so-called S – N (or Wöhler) curve (Fig. 1):\nA and m are constants obtained by testing the material or component. Several variants of fatigue equation exist, but, basically, their character is similar to Equation (1). Sometimes, the stress range in the loading cycle, ∆σ = σmax – σmin, is worked with instead of the stress amplitude σa\nThis formula can be used in the dimensioning of a component for a certain prescribed life.\nTime to fatigue failure of objects with cracks\nEquation (1) does not assume any previous damage to the component. Sometimes, however, one or more cracks or similar defects are present in the body from the beginning. The behavior of bodies with cracks is studied by fracture mechanics [1 – 4]. Crack growth is influenced not only by the stress, but also by the crack size (Fig. 2). Both quantities form together a very important parameter, called stress intensity factor K,\nσ is the nominal stress in the crack region, a is the characteristic length of the crack, and Y(a) is a factor characterizing the crack shape and size and stress distribution. The subscript of K denotes the mode of crack opening; number I means simple opening, which is the most important case. If the stress intensity factor attains the critical value KC for the given material, fast fracture follows. The corresponding critical crack length is\nIn components exposed to periodic loading, the crack can grow very slowly even if the stress intensity factor is lower than the critical value. The period of subcritical crack growth can last from minutes to years and can be predicted via the relationship between the crack velocity and the stress intensity factor. The crack velocity v during the period most important for delayed failure (region II in Fig. 3a) can often be approximated by the Paris-Erdogan equation :\nda/dN is the increment of crack length per loading cycle, ∆KI is the range of stress intensity factor in the loading cycle, ∆KI = KI,max – KI,min, and B and n are the constants for the given material and environment. Inserting ∆KI from the modified Equation (3) into Equation (5) and separating a and N, one can arrive at the following expression for the number of cycles for the crack growth from the initial length ai to the length a\nFast fracture occurs if the stress intensity factor attains critical value KIC, also called fracture toughness. The corresponding critical crack length ac, used as the upper limit in the integral (6), is given by Equation (4), with σmax denoting the maximum stress in the loading cycle. The resultant formula for Nfin the simplest case (constant stress range, small crack enlargement, and thus Y ≈ const) is basically similar to Equation (1), with ∆σ instead of σa. The number of cycles to failure is roughly indirectly proportional to some power of the characteristic stress range or amplitude. It is thus possible in design to propose such dimensions of the cross-section that the stresses will be so low to guarantee the demanded lifetime.\nStatic fatigue, wear, and creep\nIn some materials, fatigue occurs even under constant load. Examples are glass and some ceramics as well as some metals in a corrosive environment. In this case, called static fatigue, it is possible to express the time to failure tf as a function of acting stress. The velocity v of very slow crack growth depends not on the amplitude but on the value of the stress intensity factor KI (Fig. 3b), and in the important part of the v(K) diagram, the velocity can be approximated by a power-law function\nThe relationship for the time to failure is similar to Equation (1) or (6) with the stress amplitude σareplaced by characteristic stress σ and the number of cycles Nf by the time to failure tf. The relationships similar to Equation (1) are also used for the prediction of the life of ball bearings and other components exposed to wear or of parts exposed to creep and other kinds of gradual deterioration. In all these cases, the time to failure is roughly indirectly proportional to some power of the characteristic load P\nthe time to failure in rotating parts can be expressed by means of a number of revolutions. Equation (8) is the simplest formula; the relationship in some cases is more complex. For details, the reader is referred to a special literature, for example [1 – 4].\nThe consequences of random variability of load and uncertainties in the determination of parameters in fatigue equation will be dealt with in Chapter 19.\nUntil now, we have assumed a constant load amplitude. Often, it varies. Figure 4 depicts a regular operation regime of a machine, with four characteristic stages. Examples of irregular or random regime are bogie of a car or components of an engine. In all these cases, the concept of damage accumulationis used. Various hypotheses and models have been proposed [1, 2]. Here, only the simplest concept of linear damage accumulation, also named the Palmgren-Miner rule, will be explained\nThe basic idea of the Palmgren-Miner rule is that every loading cycle contributes to damage and exhausts a minute part of the life. Damage (in fact relative damage) D is then defined as the ratio of the number of loading cycles, which the object has undergone, and the number of cycles (under the same kind of loading), which would cause failure\nFor example, if a component could sustain 1000 loading cycles until failure, then one loading cycle has exhausted 1/1000 of its fatigue life. Failure occurs if N = Nf, that is if D = 1 (in this case, D = 1 for N = 1000). Note the difference between N and Nf !\nIf the loading pattern is more complex, consisting of various loading blocks, each with different amplitude and different number of loading cycles (Fig. 4), the total damage is obtained as the sum of damages caused during the individual blocks,\nAgain, failure occurs if D = 1. In this way, it is possible to find the number of loading cycles or blocks until failure. If the damage, corresponding to one day of operation, is D1, then the object can sustain 1/D1 days before it fails.\nSpecial procedures have been developed for cases where the load changes irregularly, in a random way, such as constructions of airplanes or cars. For more, see [1 – 3].\nPrediction of the time to failure from the response\nThe gradual deterioration of many objects can be characterized by various quantities, such as amplitude of vibrations, noise level, deformation under load, or loss of material by wear or corrosion. The pertinent quantity (y) grows gradually to the critical value, corresponding to failure or just an unacceptable condition (Fig. 5). In some cases, it is possible to monitor this quantity and its development in time. These data can be fitted by a suitable function y(t), and the time to failure is predicted as such, for which y reaches the critical value yC (Fig. 5). The knowledge of yC is thus very important. However, it cannot be predicted accurately due to uncertainties in the determination of material parameters, loads, influence of environment, and other factors. For these reasons, the object may never be let in operation till the instant of expected failure. At a reasonable time before it, a check of its condition must be done. This time is denoted as alert, tA, with the appropriately chosen value yA. The determination of tA is also shown in Figure 5. At this time, the object is inspected, and the obtained value y(tA) serves as a base for the decision on the maintenance, renovation, termination of further operation, or allowing the object in operation until the next inspection. Practical examples are shown at the end of this chapter.\nProbabilistic aspects of the deterioration curves and lifetime prediction\nWhen dealing with the constants of a fatigue curve, taken from the material data sheets, or with the constants of a curve showing the development of a certain parameter with time, one must not forget that they are only approximate, obtained by testing several samples only. One should always be aware of the scatter of individual values. Actually, each curve corresponds to a particular specimen despite the same test conditions. The testing of many samples would thus give a group or distribution of S – N or similar curves (Fig. 6). The data can be processed in several ways. It is possible to use all experimental data points and calculate the parameters corresponding to the “average” curve, giving the “mean” times to failure. In this case, however, the actual times to failure will be in 50% of all cases longer than the times calculated using these parameters and in 50% shorter, which could be dangerous. The reliability of the prediction can be increased using confidence band around the regression curve based on the scatter of the individual values around this curve (see also Chapters 18 and 19). Another approach fits only certain quantiles of the times to failure for various stress levels. In this way, for example, the 5% quantile curve can be obtained. This is such curve that the probability of failing earlier is only 5%. Similarly, the curves for other reliabilities can be constructed. This approach is possible if many data points (several tens or more) are available.\nWhen taking the constants for calculations from a material database or literature, one should therefore know how they were obtained and to what conditions they correspond. Scatter also influences the values of other material parameters, such as strength, fracture toughness KIC, constants in the equation for subcritical crack growth or for creep, and so on. Also here, one must distinguish between the work with the mean values or with certain quantiles.\nThe uncertainty due to the scatter of experimental data must always be considered in the predictions of the time to failure or the alert time. The higher uncertainty, the longer time before reaching the critical state should an inspection be made. We return to this topic in Chapter 19.\nA component is loaded by the sinusoidal mechanical stress of the amplitude σa = 120 MPa. The fatigue (S – N) curve of the material (cf. Fig. 1) is Nf = Aσa– m, with the constants m = 4.0 and A = 5.0 × 1013(for σa given in MPa).\nTask. Determine the number of cycles to failure Nf. What part of the life will be exhausted after N = 20,000 loading cycles?\nSolution. Nf = Aσa–m = 5.0 × 1013 × 120–4.0 = 241,126 cycles.\nD = N / Nf = 20,000 / 24,1126 = 0.0829 = 8.29 %.\nDetermine the allowable stress amplitude for the component from Example 1.6/1 so that the component can sustain N = 600,000 cycles.\nSolution. The rearrangement of the S – N curve gives σa = (A/Nf)1/m. With N = 600,000 and the constants m = 4.0 and A = 5.0 × 1013, the allowable stress is 5.0 × 1013/600,0001/4.0 = 95.54 ≈ 95 MPa.\nNote. In reality, some factor of safety would be used, either for increasing the number of cycles to failure or for reducing the allowable stress. The stress can be reduced by more ample dimensioning.\nThe technical condition of a machine can be characterized by the amplitude y of vibrations. This amplitude was measured once a day. During 10 days, the following values were measured:\nTask. Fit the measured data: (a) by a straight line, and (b) by exponential function and predict:\n1. the amplitude on 14th day, and\n2. when the amplitude will reach the critical value yc = 1.00 mm.\nSolution. The measured data were plotted using Excel. Then, the command Add Trendline was used (Fig. 7). Linear approximation (a) was: y = a + bt = – 0.002667 + 0.054121t; the coefficient of determination, characterizing the quality of fit was r2 = 0.9445. Exponential fit (b) was y = 0.085250 × exp(0.19762t), with the coefficient of determination r2 = 0.9952. (Remark: The higher the r2, the better fit; r2 = 1 means perfect fit.)\nThe approximations have given the following amplitudes of vibrations on 14th day: ylin = 0.755 mm according to the linear fit, and yexp = 1.356 mm according to the exponential fit. The amplitude y = 1.00 mm could be expected for t = 18.52 days according to the linear fit and for t = 12.46 days according to the exponential approximation.\nOne can see the big differences between the predictions done using different approximations. Caution is necessary especially for longer intervals of predictions and also with respect to the consequences of a wrong prediction"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9a23dc55-cac7-4261-bf2c-e57456f161f2>","<urn:uuid:04e1c25f-d595-4ad3-8f66-b9132c7e6100>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you explain how the implementation of STEM programs in schools relates to the development of pre-teaching professional pathways for diverse educators?","answer":"STEM program implementation follows a structured framework with four levels of immersion, ranging from exploratory activities to full curriculum integration, where students engage in authentic problem-solving and community contribution. This systematic approach to STEM education connects directly to pre-teaching pathways, where programs focus on providing early hands-on science experiences for undergraduate students, particularly those from diverse backgrounds. The development of these pathways includes strategic recruitment, culturally responsive training, mentorship programs, and partnerships across organizations. Success stories demonstrate the importance of community support and strong mentoring, as shown by testimonials from future teachers who benefited from organizations supporting them professionally, financially, and emotionally throughout their journey to becoming STEM educators.","context":["Welcome to the STEM Immersion Guide\nAbout the STEM Immersion Guide\nThe STEM Immersion Guide was created as a tool to help educators establish and implement a vision for 21st century schools and classrooms in Arizona. It is written as an over-arching framework to help chart a course for integrating STEM education in Arizona schools and districts. The STEM Immersion Guide contains key design elements that support project-based, interdisciplinary STEM instruction by providing practical tools and information to enable teachers, schools and districts, and administrators that want to improve student outcomes by integrating STEM.\nWhere do I get started?\nStarting and implementing a STEM program will be an exciting adventure for everyone involved! The Arizona STEM Network, in partnership with Maricopa County Education Service Agency (MCESA), has created the STEM Immersion Guide as a framework to guide educators in Arizona and across the nation through the process of developing STEM programs. The Guide contains four levels (or models) of immersion, from Exploratory, Introductory, Partial Immersion, and Full Immersion. Listed under each of these models are key design considerations specific to six targeted categories: Leading, Teaching, Learning, Evaluating, Budgeting, and Sustaining.\nWhat is the history of the STEM Immersion Guide and how is it used?\nSTEM instruction is more than a change in curriculum (Download the History of the Guide).

{"question":"Did both the Higgs boson and Daya Bay experiments require international collaboration?","answer":"Yes, both experiments involved international collaboration. The Daya Bay experiment was conducted by an international collaboration of about 250 scientists, mainly from China and the USA. Similarly, CERN's Higgs boson research was an international effort at their facility in Geneva, Switzerland, where scientists from different countries, including American physicists like Solomey, have worked over the years.","context":["Herbert Steiner (E)\nResearch Area(s): Particle Physics\nHerbert Steiner received his B.S. in Engineering Physics in 1951 and his Ph.D. in Physics in January 1956, both from the University of California, Berkeley.

After a year as a Guggenheim and Ford Foundation Fellow at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland he joined the Berkeley Physics faculty in 1961. He served as chairman of the Physics Department from 1992 to 1995. He is a fellow of the American Physical Society and the recipient of an Alexander von Humboldt Senior American Scientist Award.

This parameter is crucial in determining to what extent CP-symmetry violation is present in the lepton sector. The experiment is being undertaken by an international collaboration consisting of about 250 scientists, mainly from China and the USA.\nThe antineutrinos are produced in a nuclear power plant in Daya Bay, China. Eight identical cylindrical detectors, 5 meters high and 5 meters in diameter, filled with liquid scintillator, are used to detect the antineutrinos. Two detectors are deployed in each of two near experimental halls located about 600 meters from the reactor cores, and four are in a far hall about 1-1/2 km away. Neutrino mixing causes neutrinos to change their character so that they no longer produce signals in our detectors. Because the mixing depends on energy and distance travelled a comparison of the interaction rates in the near and far detectors can be used to determine the mixing angle almost independently of detailed knowledge of the reactor performance. Within three months after the start of data taking in December 2011 the Daya Bay experiment was able to show that θ13 is not equal to zero, and subsequent data taking has yielded the world’s most accurate measurement of this angle.\nThe Berkeley group, consisting of Physics Department faculty members Professors Kam-Biu Luk and Herbert Steiner, two post-docs, three graduate students and 4-6 undergraduates has been involved in all aspects of this experiment. We tested, characterized and installed the 2500 photomultiplier tubes used in the Daya Bay detectors, measured light attenuation in the liquid scintillator, and have been making detailed studies of non-linearities associated with the energy determination of the neutrinos. We are, of course, also deeply involved in the analysis of the data.

The particle’s existence is considered fundamental to the creation of the universe.\n“One question is that now that we know there is this all-permeating Higgs field … where did it come from?” asked Solomey, the director of physics at Wichita State University since 2007. “How does it act? Maybe once we know that we can start to use it.”\nSolomey has several close ties to the half-century-long saga that ended Wednesday and began with a theory from Scottish scientist Peter Higgs and others in 1964 that such a particle existed.\nThe Higgs boson’s commonly used nickname in popular culture — the “God particle” — was coined by Solomey’s close friend Leon Lederman, in the title of Lederman’s popular book on particle physics, “The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?”\nThe nickname is cringe-inducing for most scientists because it indicates the particle’s discovery might tell us the genesis of creation. Solomey chuckled at its reference on Wednesday. Lederman recruited Solomey away from the University of Chicago to come work at the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1999.\n“Leon just needed a catchy title for his book,” Solomey said. “I know he regrets it. We’ve known each other for a long time.”\nSolomey, a Pittsburgh native, worked at CERN from 1985 to 1992 under Noble Prize winner Georges Charpak and earned his Ph.D. in particle physics from the University of Geneva in 1992.\nWhile at CERN, Charpak and Solomey worked to create high-density states of matters — states that would have been found at the beginning of the “Big Bang” — the cosmological event that explains the early development of the universe.\n“We did heavy ion collision,” Solomey said. “Trying to create an environment too hot for protons and neutrons. The key to any misconception of our work is that we were creating conditions that were at the beginning of the Big Bang. What we did was so controlled and in such a small space … you can’t release more energy than you put in.\n“And we were not generating huge amounts of energy.”\nThe discovery of the Higgs boson at CERN does raise the question: If scientists are creating a particle that professes to be the place where all mass comes from, how can they contain its growth? Does the Higgs boson present any danger to the planet?\n“There’s no danger because it takes a certain amount of energy to make it and you can’t get any more out of it than you put in,” Solomey said. “The (particle accelerator) is producing a certain amount of power and it’s not like it’s uncontrolled or there are an infinite number of (particles).\n“It is producing elementary particles, not anywhere near to producing a dangerous amount.”\nSolomey also stressed that the discovery of the Higgs boson could take a long time to fully understand, comparing it to the discovery of the electron by J.J. Thomson in 1897.\n“Imagine that after Thomson discovered the electron, that it took a good 50 to 100 years to learn how to use it, how to manipulate it,” Solomey said. “It showed us how to make televisions, how to make transistor radios, how to make medical imaging … how to sterilize our foods.\n“The discovery of the Higgs boson could lead to very new things … imagine anything that has mass and how it couples to different masses. We could apply these things to new, wonderful technologies. To do things when it’s critical to our basic science, our basic survival, always leads to an advance in applications.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fc93fab6-2296-4eab-a312-4089152a021f>","<urn:uuid:4838f9f1-deab-4d6f-a446-e0dff69e5ea5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Do both the Levant region and the Russian populations show religious influence on their genetic structure?","answer":"Based on the documents, while religious affiliation had a strong documented impact on genetic structure in the Levant region, leading to genetic stratification between different religious groups and influencing admixture patterns, there is no mention of religious influence on genetic structure in the Russian populations. The Levant shows clear evidence of religious-based genetic stratification, with conversion to Islam introducing major genetic rearrangements through admixture with culturally similar populations, while Christians and Druze became genetically isolated. In contrast, the Russian population studies focused on geographic and ethnic factors, with no mention of religious influence on their genetic structure.","context":["The Levant is a region in the Near East with an impressive record of continuous human existence and major cultural developments since the Paleolithic period. Genetic and archeological studies present solid evidence placing the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula as the first stepping-stone outside Africa. There is, however, little understanding of demographic changes in the Middle East, particularly the Levant, after the first Out-of-Africa expansion and how the Levantine peoples relate genetically to each other and to their neighbors. In this study we analyze more than 500,000 genome-wide SNPs in 1,341 new samples from the Levant and compare them to samples from 48 populations worldwide. Our results show recent genetic stratifications in the Levant are driven by the religious affiliations of the populations within the region. Cultural changes within the last two millennia appear to have facilitated/maintained admixture between culturally similar populations from the Levant, Arabian Peninsula, and Africa. The same cultural changes seem to have resulted in genetic isolation of other groups by limiting admixture with culturally different neighboring populations. Consequently, Levant populations today fall into two main groups: one sharing more genetic characteristics with modern-day Europeans and Central Asians, and the other with closer genetic affinities to other Middle Easterners and Africans. Finally, we identify a putative Levantine ancestral component that diverged from other Middle Easterners ∼23,700–15,500 years ago during the last glacial period, and diverged from Europeans ∼15,900–9,100 years ago between the last glacial warming and the start of the Neolithic.\nPopulation stratification caused by nonrandom mating between groups of the same species is often due to geographical distances leading to physical separation followed by genetic drift of allele frequencies in each group. In humans, population structures are also often driven by geographical barriers or distances; however, humans might also be structured by abstract factors such as culture, a consequence of their reasoning and self-awareness. Religion in particular, is one of the unusual conceptual factors that can drive human population structures. This study explores the Levant, a region flanked by the Middle East and Europe, where individual and population relationships are still strongly influenced by religion. We show that religious affiliation had a strong impact on the genomes of the Levantines. In particular, conversion of the region’s populations to Islam appears to have introduced major rearrangements in populations’ relations through admixture with culturally similar but geographically remote populations, leading to genetic similarities between remarkably distant populations like Jordanians, Moroccans, and Yemenis. Conversely, other populations, like Christians and Druze, became genetically isolated in the new cultural environment. We reconstructed the genetic structure of the Levantines and found that a pre-Islamic expansion Levant was more genetically similar to Europeans than to Middle Easterners.\nThese results suggest that population migration to Europe from the Near East could have started after the LGM warming and continued until the Neolithic. In addition, these results show that the modern European genetic component is more recent than would be expected from a component that developed from the initial peopling of Europe in the Upper Paleolithic ∼40,000 y.a.","- Research article\n- Open Access\nAnalysis of DNA variations in GSTA and GSTMgene clusters based on the results of genome-wide data from three Russian populations taken as an example\nBMC Genetics volume 13, Article number: 89 (2012)\nExtensive genome-wide analyses of many human populations, using microarrays containing hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, have provided us with abundant information about global genomic diversity. However, these data can also be used to analyze local variability in individual genomic regions. In this study, we analyzed the variability in two genomic regions carrying the genes of the GSTA and GSTM subfamilies, located on different chromosomes.\nAnalysis of the polymorphisms in GSTA and GSTM gene clusters showed similarities in their allelic and haplotype diversities. These patterns were similar in three Russian populations and the CEU population of European origin. There were statistically significant differences in all the haploblocks of both the GSTM and GSTA regions when the Russian populations were compared with populations from China and Japan. Most haploblocks also differed between the Russians and Nigerians from Yoruba, but, some of them had similar allelic frequencies. Special attention was paid to SNP rs4986947 from the intron of the GSTA4 gene, which is represented in apes by an A nucleotide. In the Asian and African samples, it was represented only by a G allele, and both allelic variants (G/A) occurred in the Russian and European populations.\nThe results obtained suggest the presence of common features in the evolutionary histories of the GSTA and GSTM gene regions, and that African subpopulations were involved differently in the formation of the European and Asian human lineages.\nThe results of genome-wide analyses of different populations can be used to study the patterns of DNA diversity in particular genomic regions containing specific genes or gene clusters. One interesting and functionally significant genetic system includes the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) genes that encode the different GSTs.\nThe GSTs are one of the key groups of detoxification enzymes. The chemistry of the reactions catalyzed by these enzymes is based predominantly on the conjugation of glutathione to the electrophilic centers of various substances, which leads to a loss of toxicity and the formation of more hydrophilic products. The important noncatalytic functions of the GSTs include their capacity to sequester carcinogens, their involvement in the intracellular transport of a wide spectrum of hydrophobic ligands, and their modulation of signaling pathways [1, 2]. Like most other human genes, the genes encoding the GSTs are polymorphic. It has been suggested that these polymorphisms are functionally significant and that the frequencies of their allelic variants differ among human populations . Until recently, only a limited number of GST polymorphisms had been studied (e.g., GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene deletions, a 3-bp deletion in GSTM3 intron 6, and SNPs in GSTP1 exons 5 and 6), and these were not sufficient to infer the genetic relationships of populations. It may be especially relevant that particular genes of some GST families are located close to each other, forming clusters in the genome . However, with advances in the methods of genome analysis, including high-throughput genotyping technologies, it has become possible to obtain and use more detailed information about the polymorphisms in regions of interest. Recently, Polimanti and co-workers (2011)  compared polymorphisms of the soluble GST genes in some reference populations using the HapMap database. In the current study, we examined the polymorphisms in two genomic regions, comprising clusters of GSTA and GSTM genes, located on different chromosomes, in three groups of Russians from the western (Tver), eastern (Murom), and southern (Kursk) regions of the European part of Russia. The analyses were based on both the comparison of allelic variation in individual SNPs and the haplotype diversity across the GST clusters. The genotypes were obtained from a genome-wide analysis of SNPs [6, 7], performed with Illumina microarrays. To compare the Russian populations with other populations throughout the world, we also included four populations from the HapMap Project in this study: Utah USA residents with ancestry in northern and Western Europe (СEU), Han Chinese from Beijing (CHB), Japanese from Tokyo (JPT), and the Yoruba people of Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI). Their genotypes were downloaded from the HapMap Project site . The data obtained showed high levels of similarity across the three Russian populations studied and between the Russian and CEU populations. However, the differences between them and the Asian and African populations were significant.\nDNA samples were isolated from blood samples obtained with the informed consent of Russian donors from western (Andreapol district of the Tver region), eastern (Murom district of the Vladimir region), and southern locations (Kursk and Oktyabrsky districts of the Kursk region) in the European part of Russia. Their ethnicity was determined by interview. All individuals were unrelated and represented the native ethnic groups in the regions studied (i.e., they belonged to at least the third generation living in a particular geographic region). The DNA was isolated from peripheral leukocytes with standard techniques, using proteinase K treatment and phenol–chloroform extraction .\nAll the DNA samples were genotyped at the Estonian Biocentre (Tartu, Estonia), using the Illumina Human CNV370-Duo (Tver and Murom samples) and Human 660W-Quad chips (Kursk samples), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In total, 288 Russian samples were genotyped (96 samples per population). Because the microarrays differed in the numbers of SNPs tested, the number of SNPs examined was standardized to obtain a set of loci that was consistent across all the populations analyzed. The set of loci was chosen by considering the chromosomal regions in which the GSTM and GSTA gene clusters are located. The sample sizes of the populations taken from the HapMap Project were: 165 individuals from CEU, 86 from CHB, 84 from JPT, and 166 from YRI.\nThe allele frequencies, their Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium status, and the SNP-based Wright’s fixation index (FST)  were calculated using the PowerMarker software package (v.3.0) . The pairwise linkage disequilibrium statistic (D')  was estimated and the haplotypes were inferred for adjacent markers using an accelerated expectation-maximization algorithm embedded in the Haploview software . The haplotype block patterns were defined using the block definition based on the linkage disequilibrium measure D' and its confidence interval. Linearized pairwise FST values were used to evaluate the genetic affinities between populations. The significance level was set at P < 0.05.\nFigure 1 shows 15 polymorphisms of the GSTA cluster, which is located at p12.1 of chromosome 6 over a 250-kbp area. The polymorphisms are presented according to their locations in relation to the genes. Based on the threshold value for the pairwise linkage disequilibrium between the SNPs (D' > 0.7) , six blocks were inferred in the GSTA cluster. All the haploblocks were identical in all the populations studied. Figure 1 shows the haploblocks for the Russian population from Tver. The corresponding data for the other two Russian populations were identical to the Tver data.\nTable 1 shows the allelic frequencies for all the polymorphic loci of the GSTA cluster in the Russian populations and in the HapMap populations. A comparative analysis showed no differences in the distributions of the SNP variants in the Russian populations, and similar allelic frequencies were found in the CEU population. However, the allelic distributions in the three remaining HapMap populations differed considerably from those in the populations of European descent.\nWe also calculated the fixation indices (FST) to quantitatively assess the levels of interpopulation frequency variation. Figure 2 presents the multidimensional scaling of the matrix of linearized pairwise FST values. The diagram shows that the Russian populations form a single cluster, with the CEU population close to them. However, the African YRI population and Asian CHB and JPT populations are situated at a considerable distance from them.\nTable 2 shows the frequencies of the haplotypes in each haploblock in all the populations analyzed. It is evident that different haploblocks contain different numbers of haplotypes. For instance, haploblock #1 has only two haplotypes, whereas haploblock #4 has four haplotypes. Some haploblocks, namely blocks #5 and #6 in the CHB and JPT populations and block #6 in the YRI population, were not inferred because the SNPs tested were monomorphic in these populations.\nThe comparison of the populations was based on the haplotype frequencies calculated for each block. The calculated probabilities (P values) presented in Table 3 show the results of this comparison. The statistically significant levels of P were set for each block using the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. The data generated showed no marked differences in the haplotype frequencies across the Russian populations and the CEU population. However, a comparison of the haplotype frequencies in the Russian populations with those in the Chinese, Japanese, and Nigerian populations indicated significant difference between them. Most P values were considerably lower than the specified levels. The exceptions were block #5 and, to a certain degree, blocks #1 and #4, where the pairwise P values for the pairs of Russian and Nigerian populations were higher than values specified for these blocks.\nThe GSTM gene cluster is located on chromosome 1 in the p13.3 region and accounts for 85 kbp. The 14 marker loci found within the cluster (Figure 3) are listed in Table 4. As in the GSTA cluster, similarities in the frequencies of the GSTM alleles were observed between the Russian populations and the CEU population. Different frequencies were observed for the samples from Asia (CHB and JPT) and Africa (YRI). The two-dimensional plot of FST-based distances was similar to the plot obtained for the GSTA cluster (data for the GSTM cluster are not shown).\nTable 5 shows the haplotype frequencies in the haploblocks of the GSTM cluster. As in the GSTA cluster, the numbers of haplotypes observed in the blocks differed. When we considered the P values for the pairwise comparisons (Table 6), there were no marked differences in the haplotype frequencies between the Russian populations from Tver, Murom, and Kursk, and the CEU population. However, statistically significant differences were observed in most comparisons of the Russian populations with the CHB, JPT, and YRI populations. The only exceptions were in block #1, where the P values for the pairwise comparisons of the haplotype frequencies of the Russian and Nigerian populations were much higher than the specified significance level.\nExtensive genome-wide analyses of many human populations, using microarrays containing hundreds of thousands of SNPs, have provided us with considerable information about global genomic diversity . These data can also be used to analyze the variability in local genomic regions, marking the evolutionary trajectories for both the main human groups and local populations.\nIn this study, we analyzed the variability of two genomic regions containing the genes of the GSTA and GSTM subfamilies. Our work was based on genotype data obtained from a whole-genome analysis of SNP genotypes performed with Illumina microarrays in three Russian populations. We compared these data with corresponding data from several HapMap populations.\nAlthough genes of GSTA and GSTM subfamilies are located on different chromosomes, our analysis of the polymorphisms in these two gene clusters showed similarities between them in terms of their patterns of allelic and haplotype frequencies across the populations examined. The haplotype spectra of the three Russian populations studied (from Tver, Murom, and Kursk), who share a common ethnic origin, were similar. No marked differences were also established between the three Russian populations and the CEU population, which clearly reflects their common European ancestry. In this context, it was interesting to find some similarity between the Russian samples and the Yoruba population from Nigeria in the haplotype frequencies of some blocks (mainly block #5 of the GSTA cluster and block #1 of the GSTM cluster). Because the European populations differed significantly from the populations of China and Japan in the haplotype spectra of all blocks in both clusters, we propose that these similarities can be attributable to some particular features of these haploblocks in the microevolutionary history of the populations. At the same time, the Russian and Nigerian populations differed significantly in the remaining haploblocks of both gene clusters.\nAnother interesting finding that warrants particular attention is SNP rs4986947 from block #6 of the GSTA cluster, located in the intron of the GSTA4 gene. In apes, this SNP site carries an A nucleotide . In the populations analyzed from Asia and Africa, another nucleotide (G) occurred at this SNP site with a frequency of 100% (the same is also true for two other African HapMap samples—Luhya and Maasai) . By contrast, in the European populations tested, including all populations from Russia, both alleles (G/A) are represented at this locus; i.e., the ancestral allele, containing A, is also present in these populations. Two possible explanations for this fact can be proposed. The first assumes substantial ancient gene flow (migrations) from Africa to the proto-West Eurasian (European) population after its divergence from the proto-East Eurasians . These migrations could have included individuals with the ancestral A allele at rs4986947, which is virtually absent from the reference African populations. The second explanation is that the mutation could have been reversed in part of the European population, thus returning to its ancestral state. The persistence of the A allele in Europeans may be attributable to natural selection, which can shape the interethnic variation in the GST genes, as has been demonstrated by Polimanti et al. (2011) . In addition to the Russian and CEU samples tested, the A allele at rs4986947 is also found at frequencies of around 6% in geographically distant European samples from Great Britain, Finland, and Italy . These quite low frequencies may be the result of balancing selection.\nIn summary, we have reported the results of a study of SNPs in two genomic regions carrying the genes of the GSTA and GSTM subfamilies. By using a haplotype-based approach, we have demonstrated a similarity in the patterns of allelic diversity between the GSTA and GSTM gene clusters in all populations studied. This leads us to propose that the evolutionary histories of these clusters share many features and mark the same events in the evolutionary trajectories of the main human groups.\nHayes JD, Flanagan JU, Joowsey IR: Glutation transferases.

{"question":"What's higher - the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct or the Millau Viaduct?","answer":"The Millau Viaduct is significantly higher than the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct. The Millau Viaduct has a pier reaching 343 meters (1,125 ft) in height, making it the tallest vehicular bridge in the world. In comparison, the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct rises 38 metres through the treetops.","context":["Words, artwork and soundscape: Rob St John\nThe Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in North Wales carries the Llangollen Canal high above the River Dee valley.\nDesigned by Thomas Telford and completed in 1805, the ‘Ponty’ spans over 300 metres across the wooded valley, its arches rising 38 metres through the treetops. The longest aqueduct in Great Britain, and the highest canal aqueduct in the world, the Pontcysyllte is both a Grade I listed building and a World Heritage Site.\nOur sound walk begins at the Trevor Basin close to the northern edge of the aqueduct, where early morning walkers crunch through frozen leaves and icy puddles as a thin mist lifts into a clear blue November sky. Approaching the aqueduct, the roar of the river wells up from below, its spate a memory of storms from the week before. The canal flows steadily southward across the aqueduct’s cast iron structure, a lightbox for suspended autumn leaves in washed out yellows and oranges: oak, ash, poplar, sweet chestnut.\nWe follow a path down the steep valley side below the aqueduct. The trace of climbing ivy removed from the masonry pillars resembles a watershed map or root system – capillaries and tributaries moving water through the valley. Contact microphones slipped between the cracks in the stonework record the movement of the melting water moving through the aqueduct: percussive clicks and abstracted rumbles. Hydrophones record the character of moving water on the valley floor: the Dee a stream of white noise; culverted streams sounding tuned and melodic in comparison.\nBack up on the aqueduct we look north-west towards Snowdonia, with the hills white with the first snows of winter, and east to the Cefn Mawr Viaduct, which carries the train line over the valley. The canal curves through a tunnel of trees south-east from the aqueduct, past a series of disused lime kilns where canal boats now moor. The line where the water laps the block work stone canal edge catches the low sun like a gleaming silver thread.\nAs the day progresses, the towpath becomes gradually busier with walkers, families and cyclists. The Dee valley below is a patchwork of green and white: a heat map of the sun’s arc across the morning. Robins and blue tits flit through the hedgerows, picking at hawthorn berries and rose hips. Wild clematis cascades onto the towpath like a waterfall of candyfloss. Crows bicker in neighbouring fields, dotted on telegraph wires like notes on an unruly stave.\nIn the dulling afternoon light we reach the Whitehouses Tunnel. Completed in 1802, and spanning 175 metres in length, it was one of the first canal tunnels in Britain constructed with a towpath. Walking through its narrow entrance, the birdsong of the surrounding landscape is quickly muted and replaced by the echoing drips of water falling from its brickwork arch. It is almost entirely dark in the middle of the tunnel, with only the half-moon patches of light at either end visible. Torchlight catches mini stalactites hanging from the ceiling and the grey, depthless flow of the water.\nA horn sounds outside as a barge prepares to navigate the tunnel. As it approaches, the roar of its engine and the churning water echoes into a long, rolling drone: the tunnel acting like a giant pipe organ tuned by the movement of air and water. In this tight space, the deep sound resonates through your body. As the barge leaves, the drone fades away, and the dripping water and faint birdsong slowly return.\nField notes on recording locations\nAround the Trevor Basin.\nOn the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct.\nWater moving through the aqueduct stone and metalwork (recorded using contact microphones).\nRiver Dee and tributaries on the valley floor (recorded using hydrophones).\nAlong the Llangollen Canal.\nIn the Whitehouses Tunnel.\nRob St John is an artist and writer based in Bowland, Lancashire.

Typically a viaduct connects two points of roughly equal elevation allowing passage over a valley, road, river, or other low-lying feature or obstruction.\nThe term ''viaduct'' is derived from the Latin\n''via'' for road and ''ducere'', to lead. It is a nineteenth-century derivation from an analogy\nwith ancient Roman aqueducts\nLike the Roman aqueduct\ns, many early viaducts comprised a series of arches of roughly equal length.\nThe longest in antiquity\nmay have been the Pont Serme\nwhich crossed wide marshes in southern France. At its longest point, it measured 2,679 meters with a width of 22 meters.\nViaducts are commonly used in many cities that are railroad\ncenters, such as Chicago\n. These viaducts cross the large railroad yard\ns that are needed for freight trains there, and also cross the multi-track railroad lines that are needed for heavy railroad traffic. These viaducts keep highway\nand city street traffic from having to be continually interrupted by the train\ntraffic. Likewise, some viaducts carry railroads over large valleys, or they carry railroads over cities with many cross-streets and avenues.\nMany viaducts over land connect points of similar height in a landscape, usually by bridging a river valley\nor other eroded opening in an otherwise flat area. Often such valleys had roads descending either side (with a small bridge over the river, where necessary) that become inadequate for the traffic load, necessitating a viaduct for \"through\" traffic. Such bridges also lend themselves for use by rail\ntraffic, which requires straighter and flatter routes. Some viaducts have more than one deck, such that one deck has vehicular traffic and another deck carries rail traffic. One example of this is the Prince Edward Viaduct\nin Toronto, Ontario\n, Canada, that carries motor traffic on the top deck as Bloor Street\n, and metro as the Bloor-Danforth subway line\non the lower deck, over the steep Don River valley\n. Others were built to span settled areas, crossing over roads beneath—the reason for many viaducts in London.\nViaducts over water make use of islands or successive arches. They are often combined with other types of bridges or tunnels to cross navigable waters as viaduct sections, while less expensive to design and build than tunnels or bridges with larger spans, typically lack sufficient horizontal and vertical clearance for large ships. See the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel\nThe Millau Viaduct\nis a cable-stayed road-bridge that spans the valley of the river Tarn\nin southern France. It opened in 2004 and is the tallest vehicular bridge in the world, with one pier's summit at 343 metres (1,125 ft). The viaduct Danyang–Kunshan Grand Bridge\nin China was the longest bridge in the world\nLand use below viaducts\nWhere a viaduct is built across land rather than water, the space below the arches may be used for businesses such as car parking, vehicle repairs, light industry, bars and nightclubs. In the United Kingdom, many railway lines in urban areas have been constructed on viaducts, and so the infrastructure owner Network Rail\nhas an extensive property portfolio in arches under viaducts. In Berlin the space under the arches of elevated subway lines is used for several different purposes, including small eateries or bars.\nPast and future\nwere built in major cities such as Boston\n), Los Angeles\n, San Francisco\nSome were demolished because they were unappealing and divided the city. In other cases, viaducts were demolished because they were structurally unsafe, such as the Embarcadero Freeway\nin San Francisco, which was damaged following an earthquake in 1989. However, in developing nations such as Thailand\nelevated expressways have been built and more are under construction to improve traffic flow, particularly as a workaround of land shortage when built atop surface roads. In Indonesia\nviaducts are used for railway\ns in Java\nand also for highway\ns such as the Jakarta Inner Ring Road\n. The Coulée verte René-Dumont\nin Paris, France\nis a disused viaduct which was converted to an urban park\nin 1993. In January 2019 the Alaskan Way Viaduct\nin Seattle was closed and replaced with a tunnel\nafter several decades of use due to being seismically unsafe.\n* Flying junction\n* List of bridge types\nCategory:Bridges by structural type"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:95edb6bf-0e4e-4965-b872-2100e1ab7693>","<urn:uuid:35d6c5be-e3d6-4ac7-939b-669f28e99e43>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the primary symptoms of Ankylosing Spondylitis in the spine, and what foods can help manage its symptoms?","answer":"The primary spinal symptoms of Ankylosing Spondylitis include inflammatory back pain with insidious onset lasting more than 3 months, morning stiffness lasting at least 30 minutes, and improvement with moderate physical activity. The pain typically diffuses into both buttocks and patients may wake up with pain and stiffness. As the disease progresses, it can cause the vertebrae to fuse together, leading to loss of spine flexibility and a stooped posture. Regarding foods that can help manage symptoms, fresh fruits and vegetables are particularly beneficial due to their high antioxidant content. These antioxidants have been shown to fight arthritis symptoms by protecting cells from free radicals that contribute to pain and inflammation. Additionally, incorporating fruits and vegetables helps provide essential minerals and vitamins needed to maintain overall health.","context":["Ankylosing spondylitis literally means fusing inflamed spine growing together.\nAnkylosing spondylitis is also known by many other names like rheumatoid spondylitis spondyloarthrite rhizomegalique,Marie-Strümpell disease and von Bechterew disease.\nAnkylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory joint disease which is a part of spondyloarthropathies. Reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthropathy, spondyloarthorpathy associated with inflammatory bowel disease, undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy, whipple disease and Behcet disease are other types of spondyloarthropathies.\nAnkylosing spondylitis is the most prevalent of the classic spondyloarthropathies\n[Read more on spondyloarthropathies]\nAnkylosing spondylitis primarily affects axial skeleton, usually begins in adolescence and early adulthood. The disease also affects peripheral joints as well, hip and shoulder being most common.\nThe prevalence of ankylosing spondylitis is 0.1-0.2% and may be higher in certain populations.\nHLA-B27 and ankylosing spondylitis are higher in whites and certain Native Americans than other populations.\nThe male-to-female ratio of ankylosing spondylitis is 3:1.\nPathophysiology of Ankylosing Spondylitis\nAnkylosing spondylitis and other spondyloarthropathies are chronic inflammatory diseases affecting the sacroiliac joints, axial skeleton, and, peripheral joints. These also affect organs other than joints like the eyes, skin, and cardiovascular system. The cause is not known but involves the interaction of genetic and environmental factors.\nThe spondyloarthropathies are associated strongly with HLA-B27, an HLA class-I gene.\nEntheses are the sites where tendons and ligaments insert. Inflammation of entheses is hallmark of ankylosing spondylitis and other spondyloarthropathies.\nCD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, macrophages, cytokines such as TNF-? and transforming growth factor-?, are important in the inflammatory mediators.\nInflammation leads to fibrosis and ossification at the site of enthesitis.\nSome people are genetically susceptible. Association with HLA-B27 is known. Other genes associated with ankylosing spondylitis include IL-1 gene cluster, CYP 2D6, ANKH and HLA-DRB1.\nPeople who are homozygous for HLA-B27 are at a greater risk for ankylosing spondylitis than those who are heterozygous.\nThe shared amino acid sequence of the HLA-B27 molecule is present in the antigen-binding region. A molecular mimicry is suggested mechanism where an environmental trigger (Klebsiella) causes presentation of an arthritogenic peptide from enteric bacteria by specific HLA molecules.\nMany patients with ankylosing spondylitis have subclinical gastrointestinal tract inflammation and elevated IgA antibodies directed against Klebsiella. The bacteria may invade the gastrointestinal tract of a genetically susceptible host, leading to chronic inflammation and increased permeability. Over time, bacterial antigens containing arthritogenic peptides enter the organism via the blood stream.\nLocalization of pathology to certain types of connective tissues (eg, entheses) may be explained by affinity of bacterial antigens to these specific sites probably due to biomechanical stress.\nAnkylosing spondylitis does not develop in every person who is HLA-B27 –positive, indicating that environmental factors are important.\nSpectrum and Progression of Disease in Ankylosing Spondylitis\nThe disease begins in the sacroiliac joints. Most patients have mild chronic disease or intermittent flares with periods of remission. Progression occurs from the lumbosacral region to involve other regions of spine\nPeripheral involvement is seen in 30-50% of the patients.\nThe disease causes inflammation at the site of insertion of ligaments and tendons on to bone. It is termed as peripheral enthesitis.\nThis often progresses from erosion and osteitis to ossification, resulting in telltale radiological signs of periosteal new bone formation.\nCommon sites of enthesitis are\n- Achilles tendon insertion\n- Plantar fascia insertion on the calcaneus or the metatarsal heads\n- Base of the fifth metatarsal head,\n- Tibial tuberosity\n- Superior and inferior poles of the patella\n- Iliac crest\n- Greater trochanter\n- Ischial tuberosity\n- Costochondral junctions\n- Distal scapula\n- Lateral epicondyle\n- Distal ulna.\nOther Systems involvement\n- Uveitis is the most common extra-articular manifestation [20-30% ]. Uveitis associated with other spondyloarthropathies\n- Cardiovascular involvement <10% of patients, typically those with severe long-standing disease.\n- Restrictive lung disease may occur in patients with late-stage ankylosing spondylitis. Costovertebral and costosternal involvement leads to limited chest expansion.\n- Amyloidosis is a very rare. This may result in renal dysfunction with proteinuria and renal insufficiency or failure.\n- Neural complications secondary to fractures of a fused spine\n- Asymptomatic inflammation of the proximal colon and terminal ileum has been observed in about 60%\n- Osteopenia and osteoporosis\nClinical Presentation of Ankylosing Spondylitis\nAnkylosing spondylitis primarily affects axial skeleton, usually begins in adolescence and early adulthood. The course of the disease is characterized by remissions and exacerbations.\nClinical presentation of ankylosing spondylitis varies from individual to individual.\nThe symptoms are related to inflammatory back pain, peripheral enthesitis, arthropathy, and constitutional and extra-articular involvement. Systemic symptoms like fever and weight loss may and fatigue is may occur. Morning stiffness is characteristic.\nInflammatory back pain\nInflammatory back pain is most common presenting feature which about 75% people present with.\nInflammatory back pain ha following features\n- Insidious onset\n- > 3 months of symptoms before presentation\n- Morning stiffness lasting at least 30 minutes, improvement of symptoms with moderate physical activity\n- Diffuse nonspecific radiation of pain into both buttocks\n- Patients may wake up in morning with pain and stiffness\nPain at the site of enthesisits like back of heel [Achilles tendon insertion], heel [ plantar fasciitis] occur in 30-50% of the cases.\nPain is reported mainly in hips, shoulders, and joints of the chest wall, including the acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular joints. Other peripheral joints are involved less frequently and to a milder degree.\nExamination may reveal tenderness of the sacroiliac joints and stiff spine. In later stages, kyphosis resulting in a stooped posture, typical of ankylosing spondylitis, may be noted.\nThis test is done to assess for range of motion in spine.\nSchober test is performed by marking a 10-cm length of the lumbar spine with patient in the erect position, starting at the fifth lumbar spinous process. After this, the patient is instructed to flex her spine maximally.\nRemeasure the distance between the marks. Normal flexion increases the distance by at least 5 cm.\nLoss of chest expansion (<3-cm difference between minimum and maximum chest diameter) is usually found only in patients with late-stage disease and is generally not helpful in diagnosis.\nPeripheral lesions are tender upon examination and may be associated with swelling. Carefully examine patients for tenderness upon palpation.\nInvolved joints should be examined for tenderness and restriction of motion. In later stages deformities of the joint may be seen.\nThese depend on the organ involved\n- Uveitis usually presents as acute red painful red eye with photophobia, increased lacrimation, and blurred vision. An attack lasts about 2-3 months\n- Cardiovascular involvement\n- aortic valve insufficiency.\n- Mitral valve insufficiency\n- Fibrosis of the conduction system may result in various degrees of atrioventricular block\n- Bilateral apical pulmonary fibrosis. Sometimese may get infected. Cough dyspnea, and hemoptysis may occur\n- Renal involvement in amyloidosis may result in urinary symptoms\nOther presentations are that of to atlantoaxial subluxation resulting in myelopathy, cauda equina syndrome and rarely Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis\n- Lumbar Disc Disease\n- Lumbar Spondylosis\n- Psoriatic Arthritis\n- Reactive Arthritis\n- Inflammatory bowel disease associated spondyloarthropathy\n- Juvenile idiopathic arthritis\n- Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis\nDiagnostic Work of Ankylosing Spondylitis\nNo laboratory tests are specific for ankylosing spondylitis. The diagnosis is made by combining clinical criteria of inflammatory back pain and enthesitis or arthritis with radiological findings. Two sets of criteria, are used for for diagnosis of spondyloarthropathies in general.\nNew York and Rome criteria are used widely for the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis.\n|New York Criteria (1984)||Rome Criteria (1961)|\n|Low back pain with inflammatory characteristics\nLimitation of lumbar spine motion in sagittal and frontal planes\nDecreased chest expansion\nBilateral sacroiliitis grade 2 or higher\nUnilateral sacroiliitis grade 3 or higher\n|Low back pain and stiffness for >3 months that is not relieved by rest\nPain and stiffness in the thoracic region\nLimited motion in the lumbar spine\nLimited chest expansion\nHistory of uveitis\n|Definite ankylosing spondylitis when the fourth or fifth criterion mentioned presents with any clinical criteria||Diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis when any clinical criteria present with bilateral sacroiliitis grade 2 or higher|\n- Normochromic normocytic anemia of chronic disease may be noticed in about 15%\n- Elevated / C-reactive protein 75%\n- Raised alkaline phosphatase is elevated in 50% of patients\n- Creatine kinase and serum IgA level may be elevated\n- Though it has an association, determining HLA-B27 status is not a necessary part of the clinical evaluation.\nRadiographs often diagnostic but in very initial period of the disease, the radiographs may entirely be normal as skeletal changes that could be depicted by radiographs come late.\nRadiographs show following features\nIt is is usually bilateral, symmetric, and gradually progress from blurring of the subchondral bone plate to irregular erosions of the margins of the sacroiliac joints to sclerosis, narrowing, and finally fusion.\nErosions of the subchondral bone of the sacroiliac joint are generally seen earlier in the lower portion of the joint.\nVertebral changes start in thoracolumbar spine and progresses proximally\nEarly radiographic signs include\n- Loss of normal concave contour resulting in square vertebra[due to erosions margins of these bodies]\n- Sclerosis of the superior and inferior margins of the vertebral bodies, called shiny corners or Romanus lesion\n- Ossification of the annulus fibrosus leads to the radiographic appearance of syndesmophytes. Over time, development of continuous (bridging) syndesmophytes may result in a fused spine, also termed as bamboo spine.\n- Radiographs of the pelvis may show ossification of iliac crest, ischial tuberosity, and femoral trochanter [ whiskering]. Occasionally, the symphysis pubis develops erosive changes (osteitis pubis).\n- Erosion, periosteal new bone formation, and, ossification, at the insertion of the Achilles tendon and the plantar fascia on the calcaneus.\n- Joint space narrowing in hips and shoulders along with degenerative changes. Ultimately, peripheral joints may undergo ankylosis.\n- Heterotopic bone formation may occur after total joint replacement, MRI/CT\nMRI or CT\nMRI/CT may show early sacroiliitis, erosions, and enthesitis that are not apparent on standard radiographs.\nThese investigations are not routinely done though.\nMRI and a CT scan may be useful in diagnosis of a spinal fracture in patients with late-stage spinal disease.\nTreatment of Ankylosing Spondylitis\nThere is no cure for ankylosing spondylitis. The objectives of the treatment are\n- Halting or slowing the disease progression\n- Pain relief\n- Relief from stiffness and fatigue\n- Maintenance of good physical and psychosocial functioning.\nDrugs, patient education, cognitive therapy and exercises are important in patient management.\nMedical Treatment of Ankylosing Spondylitis\nPatient should be educated about the disease and expectation from the treatment\nNo drugs have been proven to modify the course of the disease, although TNF-alpha antagonists have potential as disease-modifying agents.\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nNSAIDs improve the symptoms of the disease. Indomethacin may be more effective than other NSAIDs, although this has not been proven. Continuous treatment with NSAIDs appears to reduce radiographic progression in ankylosing spondylitis.\nSulfasalazine reduces spinal stiffness, peripheral arthritis, and the ESR, but no evidence shows that spinal mobility, enthesitis, or physical function is benefited.\nToxicities include rash, nausea, diarrhea, and agranulocytosis (rarely).\n- The TNF-alpha antagonists have been shown to be effective in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis. Etanercept,infliximab,and adalimumabare frequently used drugs. These agents have been shown to reduce inflammatory activity of spinal disease as assessed with MRI.\n- Bisphosphonates may modestly affect clinical disease activity in ankylosing spondylitis.\n- Anakinra is , a recombinant human interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist which may be effective in treatment-resistant ankylosing spondylitis.\nOral corticosteroids are occasionally helpful in controlling symptoms but should be used for short term only.\nLocal corticosteroid injections are useful for symptomatic sacroiliitis, peripheral enthesitis, and arthritis, although the response is not typically as rapid as in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\nExtra-articular manifestations are treated as per the presentation.\nExercise and postural training, is important to maintain function.\n- Spinal extension and deep-breathing exercises\n- Maintain spinal mobility\n- Encourage erect posture\n- Promote chest expansion.\n- Maintain an erect posture during daily activities\n- Sleeping on a firm mattress with a thin pillow reduces the tendency toward thoracic kyphosis.\n- Water therapy and swimming maintain mobility and fitness.\n- Vertebral osteotomy to correct spinal deformities\n- Joint replacement surgery for damaged joints. Risk of heterotopic bone formation can be reduced by using postoperative indomethacin\nComplications of Ankylosing Spondylitis\n- Spinal fusion\n- Severe kyphosis\n- Limitation of motion of the spine including cervical spine\n- Fractures in fused spine\n- Peripheral joint arthropathy\nAnkylosing spondylitis though cannot be cured carries overall good prognosis.\nPatients often require long-term anti-inflammatory therapy. Morbidity can occur due to spinal and peripheral joint involvement or, rarely, extra-articular manifestations.\nPoor prognostic indicators include peripheral joint involvement, young age of onset, elevated ESR, and poor response to NSAIDs.\nThe risk of mortality is increased in patients with ankylosing spondylitis who have severe long-standing disease and significant extra-articular manifestations.\nBecause of the joint involvement in the chest wall and the potential for pulmonary complications, include smoking cessation in recommendations.\nJuvenile Ankylosing Spondylitis\nJuvenile ankylosing spondylitis is clinically similar to adult ankylosing spondylitis.\nIn about 10-20% of all cases, onset occurs before age 16 years. Just like adult ankylosing spondiltis, male-to-female ratio is.\nEnthesitis is prominent early in the course of the disease, while spinal symptoms and limitation of motion may not be present until several years later. This featrure is in contrast to adult pattern.\nPeripheral arthritis and dactylitis are more common especially in lower limbs.\nSystemic involvement is more common. Features like fever, weight loss, anemia, leukocytosis are more common..\nMaking a diagnosis with certainty is difficult as X-rays of pelvis and spine are difficult to interpret in children and are often normal.\nGet more stuff on Musculoskeltal Health\nSubscribe to our Newsletter and get latest publications on Musculoskeletal Health your email inbox.\nThank you for subscribing.","Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a type of arthritis that affects your spinal cord, and it causes some of the vertebrae (bones in your spine) to blend together. This leads to loss of your spine’s flexibility, and so many people with the condition have a stooped or hunched over posture. It may also affect your ribs, in which case you may experience breathing difficulties. Ankylosing spondylitis typically affects a higher number of men than women, and it usually occurs in people during late adolescence or early adulthood (in between the ages of 15-25 years). There is no specific cause found yet, which can be said to result in ankylosing spondylitis. However, scientists believe that genetic factors can influence your chances of developing the disease, particularly if you have gene known as HLA-B27. At the same time, it is possible that you have this particular gene but never develop ankylosing spondylitis.\nThe initial signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis include a sensation of pain and stiffness in the hips and lower back, and you may experience these especially after you wake up in the morning or after long periods of physical inactivity. Ankylosing spondylitis most commonly affects the vertebrae of the lower back, the joint between your pelvis and the base of your spine, the cartilage between your ribs and breastbone, and the joints of your shoulders and hips. However, the pain and inflammation associated with ankylosing spondylitis is not restricted to these places, and you may experience inflammation in other parts of your body, including the eyes. If you have been experiencing pain in your lower back or buttock that turns worse in the morning, it may be time to consult a doctor to check if you have ankylosing spondylitis or some other health condition. If you notice any symptoms of the disease in your eyes, do not delay in seeing an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) in order to prevent damage and worsening of the symptoms.\nUnfortunately, there is no cure for ankylosing spondylitis; but treatments are available to manage your symptoms and reduce the pain and inflammation. Seeking medical help and following your doctor’s advice is vital to keeping your ankylosing spondylitis symptoms under control, but you can also combine some alternative treatments and lifestyle changes with the conventional treatment to get relief from the symptoms. It has been seen that diet plays an important role in managing the pain associated with arthritis, and the same goes for ankylosing spondylitis too. There are certain foods that are known to fight inflammation and contribute to your overall health so that you can manage your ankylosing spondylitis symptoms better. Sticking to a healthy diet plan and knowing which foods to avoid can be significantly effective in helping you reduce the progress of the disease in your body and keep the symptoms in check. Here are some do’s and don’ts for your diet, which can work on providing you relief from the symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis.\nFoods You Should Eat to Battle Ankylosing Spondylitis Symptoms\nEating a well-balanced diet is not only beneficial for your overall health, but can also help in combating the symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis. Here are some of the foods that you should include in your regular diet if you have ankylosing spondylitis.\n- Fresh fruits and vegetables: Fruits and vegetables, especially the colorful ones, contain high quantities of antioxidants. Studies have shown that these antioxidants can be effective in fighting the symptoms of various kinds of arthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis. This is because they work towards protecting the cells in your body from substances known as free radicals, which contribute to pain and inflammation. In addition, eating plenty of fresh fruits and veggies helps your body to get most of the minerals and vitamins that it needs to stay healthy and strong. If you aren’t in the habit of including such foods in your diet, start by replacing packaged snacks with your favorite fruits or vegetables. They make a healthy alternative to such snacks, which may seem tastier but have no nutritional value and are high on calories. You can also experiment with different salads, smoothies, and soups to increase your intake of such foods"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:059ca87d-dabe-43b7-a27f-80f2c03bfe0b>","<urn:uuid:4722627a-4709-4c05-9a19-beb04a5ca03a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which cleaning chemicals safe for COVID excluding bleach?","answer":"Safe cleaning chemicals for COVID-19 that don't include bleach are: ethanol or isopropyl alcohol (60-70%), hydrogen peroxide (0.5%), and acids like L-Lactic Acid and Citric Acid. These substances can inactivate the virus by disrupting its fatty layer. When selecting disinfectants, it's recommended to look for DfE (Designed for the Environment) products and avoid quaternary ammonium compounds, as these can cause asthma. It's important to note that these chemicals must be used according to manufacturer instructions, including proper contact time, to be effective.","context":["Food gives us energy. It provides all essential nutrients, carbohydrates, proteins, fats in our body for growth and development. Foodborne diseases can affect anyone irrespective of age. In 2018, 7th June was announced as World Food Safety Day. Today is the third anniversary of World Food Safety Day. This year's theme is \"Safe food today for a healthy tomorrow\". Consuming safe food gives long-term advantages to people. This also helps in forming connections between animals, people, plants, and the environment.\nCOVID and food safety of packaged items\nWhen COVID came, not much was known about it and its presence in food. Since then various food safety agencies have started assessing the risk of virus from food packaging. This COVID infection can come through respiratory droplets, aerosols from coughing, sneezing. Hence it was not considered a foodborne virus. Any kind of virus can survive at low temperatures. Freezing temperature is favorable for the virus to survive. So SARS-Cov-2 virus could survive on freezing food, but they are inactivated by cooking food at frequently high temperatures.\nThis virus was found to be stable at different pH values (3—10) at room temperature. It is hard to survive in the acidic pH of the stomach. This virus cannot multiply outside of its host. Thus it is unlikely to multiply or be found in food. The respiratory infection caused by this virus can get transmitted by indirect contact through the environment. It means if a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his mouth, nose, or eyes without washing their hands.\nTransmission of virus\nStudies were conducted on the survival of viruses on different types of a surface under different conditions. The virus was found to survive on different surfaces for different periods. The food safety agencies don't think of the contaminated surface as the main route of transmission of the virus. Therefore it was considered that coronavirus cannot get transmitted by food packaging material, but it can transfer by touching the contaminated surface and then touching the mouth, nose, and eyes. It is very important to clean and disinfect food contact surfaces.\n0.1 % Sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 % hydrogen peroxide, and 60-70 % ethanol inactivate the virus by disrupting the fatty layer that is a surrounding virus. So, COVID-19 can only be transmitted from person to person and aerosol transfer. Various workers that are into food processing establishments just need to follow proper hygiene measures by wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), masks, follow hand hygiene, and social distancing.\nFood Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) board for safety and regulation. It protects and promotes public health through regulation and supervision of food safety. Even FSSAI believes that there is no evidence of COVID spreading through food and one should not impose restrictions on the sale of frozen and chilled food products.\nImportance of food hygiene\nPrevent food from germs and their multiplication.\nEnsures healthy family living.\nKeeps healthy and prevents extra medical expenses.\nMinimizes the risk of food poisoning.\nIt keeps the insects and rodents out of the house.\nFollowing proper hygiene in the workplace, helps in business growth.\nStay healthy, stay fit","The coronavirus pandemic is not over. Many states have now begun to reopen their economies. More businesses and workplaces are being allowed to operate by following proper health and safety guidelines.\nReopening requires all of us to move forward together by practicing social distancing and other daily habits to reduce our risk of exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.\nThe CDC updated a cleaning and disinfecting guide that includes proper cleaning materials and how to determine areas that need cleaning. For more information, see the CDC’s website.\nAn article from The Perry Post shared some helpful information on the difference between cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting.\nCleaning, Sanitizing, Disinfecting: What’s the Difference?\nRemove Germs, Dirt, and Impurities by CLEANING.\nWith a standard cleaning product, you are physically removing the dirt and germs from surfaces, but you’re not necessarily killing them. However, simply by removing them, you’re lowering their numbers, and thus reducing the risk of spreading the infection.\nProducts like Windex and “All-Purpose Cleaners” fall under this category.\nLowering the Number of Germs to a Safe Level by SANITIZING\nThis is a step beyond cleaning. Sanitizing surfaces will kill a greater amount of the bacteria and is required for any surface that comes into contact with food.\nThe CDC explains that “a sanitizer is a chemical that kills 99.999% of the specific test bacteria in 30 seconds under the conditions of the test.” Therefore, while sanitizers can kill the majority of certain kinds of bacteria, sanitization products and techniques alone cannot eliminate all viruses.\nPurell Hand Sanitizer is an example of this type of product. Many restaurants use ‘sanitizers’ to clean dishes, as opposed to a harsh disinfecting chemical.\nDISINFECTING Kills Germs by Using Chemicals\nDisinfecting is a stronger decontamination method than sanitizating or cleaning alone, this is because of its ability to destroy the pathogens.\nDisinfectants are products that destroy all organisms in 10 minutes during the AOAC Use Dilution Test, a test regulated by the EPA to determine the efficiency of disinfectants.\nIn places where disinfecting is required, such as a medical facility, it’s more important to kill ALL germs, even if it takes longer, than it is to kill MOST of the germs quickly.\nSafer Disinfectant Options\n- Ethanol, isopropanol (isopropyl alcohol)\n- Hydrogen Peroxide\n- L-Lactic Acid, Citric Acid\nWhich Option Should I Consider? Sanitize or Disinfect?\nBefore you do either, you should always clean visible debris from the surface. Be sure to follow all manufacturer directions for any product you use, including any rinses that may be required.\nSanitizing is appropriate for food contact surface sanitizing,or on toys that children may place in their mouths.\nDisinfecting is appropriate for use on high-touch, non-porous surfaces such as counter tops, door and cabinet handles, toilets, and restroom sinks.\nUniversity of Washington Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences made a fact sheet which provides best practices for cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting surfaces to prevent the spread of disease while minimizing harmful chemical exposures.\nBest Practices for Safe and Effective Cleaning and Disinfecting\n- Develop a Plan\nDevelop and maintain a set of written standard operating procedures and criteria for when to clean, sanitize or disinfect. This should include schedules for routine cleaning operations and activities to be performed periodically.\n- Start by Asking: “Is it Necessary to Sanitize or Disinfect?”\n- If it’s not, use fragrance free soap/detergent and water or an all-purpose cleaner with Safer Choice, Green Seal or Ecologo labels. Soap inactivates the Coronavirus by dissolving the lipid (fatty) membrane that envelops the virus and allows it to stick to our cells. Soap and water, with microfiber cloths or mops can also get rid of 99% of bacteria.\n- Routinely Clean all Frequently Touched Surfaces\nThese surfaces include workstations, counter tops, light switches, railings, doorknobs, and equipment (such as steering wheels and machinery). Use the cleaning agents that are regularly used in these areas, following directions on the label. Select products with Safer Choice, Green Seal or Ecologo labels. Use a clean surface of the cloth to prevent cross contamination. Alcohol wipes can be used on electronics.\n- Select a Disinfectant or Sanitizer That Contain Less Hazardous Ingredients\nIf you determine disinfection is necessary, use products registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the List N: Disinfectants for Use Against SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19:\nLook for DfE (Designed for the Environment) products – the Responsible Purchasing Network has made it easy for you! If none are available, look for products containing the safer active ingredients mentioned above.\nAvoid sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and quaternary ammonium compounds, if possible; these ingredients can cause asthma. Let disinfectants stay glistening wet on the surface or air dry for the right dwell or contact time on the product’s label instructions. Otherwise, resistant germs will remain and grow, which can lead to “superbugs.”\n- Provide Employees With Information and Training\nRemember, employers must ensure workers are trained on the hazards of the cleaning chemicals used in the workplace in accordance with OSHA’s Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). People need to know the right way to use the products and know the symptoms of possible harm. Protective equipment — including gloves — needs to be appropriate for the product. If information isn’t on the safety data sheet, call the manufacturer for specific glove materials, or ask an occupational health specialist.\nUse accepted best practices and technology for cleaning. For example, perform restroom cleaning from high to low, toward the doorway, and ensure dry cleaning tasks performed prior to wet cleaning tasks.\nEvaluate the plan. Get feedback from people using the products and from those in the spaces where they are used.\nThe CDC also recommends developing and implementing policies and procedures for workforce “contact tracing,” which involves identifying who may have been exposed to employees with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 during the infectious period.\nAs a result, other employees and third parties (customers, vendors, contractors and others) may need to be notified that they have potentially been exposed to the virus.\n- University of Washington Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences Continuing Education Programs.

{"question":"What are the selection criteria for replacement heifers, and what environmental benefits do they offer when grass-fed?","answer":"For selecting replacement heifers, key criteria include targeting desired parentage, having an ideal phenotype vision, keeping older heifers, culling female twins to male calves, evaluating growth performance, studying EPDs and genomics, checking reproductive tract scores, and selecting for early pregnancy. When these heifers are grass-fed, they offer environmental benefits including a lighter carbon footprint due to reduced fertilizer and pesticide use, better soil carbon sequestration, improved soil health through manure trampling, and enhanced biodiversity. While grass-fed cattle produce more methane, the carbon sequestration by grasslands more than compensates for this.","context":["According to the North Dakota State University (NDSU) Cow Herd Appraisal of Performance Software (CHAPS), the average replacement rate for participating herds is 15.7%. Once a rancher has targeted the number of additional heifers to retain from the calf crop or purchase elsewhere, there are several considerations to determine which heifer stays and which heifer goes.\nCarl Dahlen, NDSU Extension beef cattle specialist, offers eight strategies for selecting replacement heifers based on specific criteria. While each rancher might implement his own strategies, based on his operational goals for the beef herd, these eight tips encompass many of the basic considerations:\n1. Target parentage based on desired criteria\nDahlen says, “A thorough evaluation of mature females in a herd may identify cows from which we simply don’t want to keep calves. Cows or cow families that are overly aggressive, have a history of heavy calves or calving difficulty, or are too large, too small or otherwise do not match our vision of a structurally sound female, may be good candidates to remove.”\n2. Have a vision of your “ideal” phenotype\nEvery rancher has the image of his “ideal” cow in his mind. Of course, these ideals can vary based on who you ask; however, phenotype characteristics are moderately heritable, says Dahlen. “Keeping heifers of an ideal phenotype through time will result in future generations having a greater likelihood of similar phenotype. This criteria can be limiting quickly if the ‘ideal’ phenotype desired is not present in the cow herd.”\n3. Keep older heifers\n“Early-born heifers are older and often heavier at weaning, compared with their later-born contemporaries,” says Dahlen. “Early-born heifers also have a greater chance of becoming pregnant earlier than later-born herd mates.”\n4. Cull female twins to male calves\nDon’t forget that freemartin heifers (females born twin to a male calf) are infertile and should automatically be culled from the replacement group.\n5. Evaluate growth performance/heifer size\n“Some producers use the growth rate from birth to weaning, or from weaning to a yearling age, as a selection criteria,” says Dahlen. “The same selection pressure likely is used, indirectly, if the biggest heifers are selected at any given time point. You must use caution with this selection criteria to stay away from selecting extremes that have potential to move mature weights away from your ideal (mature females that are too small or too large).”\n6. Study the EPDs & genomics\nFor purebred cattle, EPDs can be used as a selection tool, and producers can prioritize EPD traits when selecting females. For more information about using EPDs to make breeding decisions, click here.\nGenomic panels are also available to assist with selecting replacement heifers. Dahlen says, “Heifers may look alike and meet all other selection criteria; genomic results can be used to narrow the replacement pool to a target number. If using genomic panels, consider using traits that are of high value to cow herd profitability.”\n7. Look at the reproductive tract scores/pelvic measurements\nAbout 45 days before the breeding season, a veterinarian can evaluate the reproductive tract and pelvic measurements of the heifers, assigning a score of 1 to 5. This test can help identify heifers with narrow pelvic areas that might go on to have calving difficulty. It can also identify the freemartins in the group.\n8. Select to achieve early pregnancy\nDahlen writes, “Selecting only heifers that become pregnant early (to the first artificial insemination or during the first 21 days of a natural-service bull exposure) can have major impacts on herd reproductive rate and productivity. Heifers becoming pregnant early have greater longevity and wean more and heavier calves, compared with heifers becoming pregnant later in the breeding season.”\nOf course, this means retaining a larger number of heifers, which can be limiting based on the forage and feed resources available; however, this strategy can pay off greatly when heifers calve in a tighter window resulting in a more uniform calf crop. It also identifies those that will be able to breed back sooner in the upcoming breeding season.\nWhat are your strategies for selecting replacement heifers? Are you retaining just enough to maintain numbers, or are you in expansion mode this year?

Quality and environmental impact vary greatly from the variety of agricultural practices employed, and how food is processed. I have spoken often about the health and nutrition benefits of organic, grass-fed animal-based foods. This blog, however, is about sustainability and environmental stewardship.\nThe multitude of methods used for meat and dairy production include organic, free range, intensive livestock, and subsistence farming. Beyond organic are sustainable practices like no-till and biodynamic farming. Some organic operations are far superior to others, while some conventional farms are quite a bit cleaner than others, or on the path to becoming organic. So, some of these distinctions are not clear cut. Yet, it’s always good to know from where your food comes. That’s one of the clear advantages to buying local.\nWhen it comes to raising animals for food, there’s much to consider: Water consumption, methane gas emissions, the real cost of raising grain for feed, air and water quality, etc. Regardless, beef and milk production require tons of water, to the tune of 2000 gallons to produce just one pound of beef, or a gallon of milk. Much of that is used to grow grains for cow feed. That’s at least three times as much water as it takes to grow the same quantity of soy milk, and twice that needed for almond milk.\nIndeed, most of our water use goes to what we eat. Eighty percent of the water used in California is consumed by agriculture, according to the Pacific Institute. Irrigation projects in the former Soviet Union to grow cotton dramatically emptied the Aral Sea, destroyed fisheries, depopulated large areas and caused disease epidemics. Generally speaking, agriculture uses approximately 70% of the world’s freshwater supply. Looming climate change is likely to alter both water availability and agricultural water demands, so it behooves us to conserve as much as possible, and to improve on the goods and services it produces.\nThere is potentially an enormous difference between conventional and alternative farming practices in the amount of water and land consumption, fossil fuel use, and pollution. Organic farming uses 30% less energy and less water than conventional farming to produce the same corn and soybean yields, while yielding healthier, pesticide-free produce and far less groundwater pollution. Organic farming does not contaminate soil, rivers and drinking water like industrial farming does (Gonzalez, 2008). Conventional farming and livestock production are major stressors on the planet. They are major sources of greenhouse gases and loss of biodiversity, and major water polluters [Steinfeld et al., 2006].\nIndustrial agriculture relies on pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers and other toxic chemicals that increase the use of machinery, which contributes to a larger carbon footprint and global warming. Conventional systems emit nearly 40% more greenhouse gases per unit of crop than organic systems, while organic farming systems use 45% less energy (Middleton & Smith, 2011).\nOrganic farming may be especially competitive during droughts. Berkeley researchers concluded that organic farming creates biodiversity in the soil and environment not seen with synthetic chemicals. Organic plots can even outperform conventional ones, regarding yield, when the going gets tough. Organic plots are especially resilient to droughts, and extremes of frost and flooding, according to the Rodale Institute. Microbes and other organisms in organic soil create intricate relationships with plants and affect soil architecture. Organic soil absorbs and stores water better, and needs less water than conventional soil (Ferris, 2014). Organic farming is a more sustainable way of doing agriculture, hands down.\nThe Environmental Working Group has concluded that grass fed beef is better for the environment. Benefits from well managed grass fed operations are multifaceted, whereas large-scale confined feedlots have tremendous negative impacts on air and water quality. In “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” Michael Pollan points to the lighter carbon footprint in grass-fed operations, due to the fertilizer, pesticide and fossil fuel required for grain used in feed lots. More methane is produced by grass-fed cattle because it’s harder to digest grass than grain, but grasslands sequester enough carbon to more than make up the difference. A healthier soil and richer humus result from cows trampling their manure into the soil. The increased diversity maintains a healthy soil that keeps CO2 out of the atmosphere. Grazing cattle help stabilize soil, control weeds, and reduce the risk of wildfire (Profita, 2013).\nThe animals our ancestors ate roamed free and ate grass, whereas cattle and dairy cows today are force-fed grains. What we feed them has a major effect on the nutrient composition of the milk and beef. Numerous studies conclude that these nutrients vary significantly, depending on what the cows eat. For example, grass-fed, whole milk contains a third of the omega-3 fatty acids we need for brain, heart, skin and joint health, while conventional milk is virtually devoid of omega-3s. Grass-fed, full-fat dairy also contains 3-5 times as many antioxidants like beta-carotene, lutein and vitamin E (Chang, 2016). Grass-fed beef and milk also contains about twice as much conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) as grain-fed beef products. CLA is associated with reduced body fat and other benefits (Whigham et al., 2007). Plus, organic milk and meat do not contain the antibiotics, hormones and pesticides found in conventional animal-based foods. These drugs and chemicals contribute significantly to antibiotic resistance and the chronic diseases of modernity.\nSome folks opt to cut their environmental impact by not eating meat, or cutting back on their purchases. Yet meat and dairy provide nutrients that are hard to find in other foods. If done right, these foods are not only more nutritious, but also much less harmful to the earth. We should pay attention to how our ancestors thrived, and abide by nature’s wisdom.\nChang K. 2016.

{"question":"What are the main factors that contribute to social pressure in schools, and how does this relate to body image disorders in adolescents?","answer":"Social pressure in schools manifests through various factors, starting as early as first grade when children begin forming social groups based on personality, ability, and appeal. Students may intentionally underperform academically to avoid being considered too smart, and they might engage in spreading rumors or telling lies to gain peer recognition. The pressure to fit in can lead to defying parents, teachers, and counselors. These social pressures intersect with body image concerns, as research shows that BDD commonly emerges during teenage years when dramatic physical changes occur. The condition affects approximately 2% of the general population but may be more common in teens. Risk factors for developing BDD include experiencing childhood bullying and having a perfectionistic personality, which can be exacerbated by the social environment in schools. Both social pressure and body image issues can lead to social anxiety and avoidance of situations that trigger anxious feelings about one's appearance.","context":["The teen years are tough. Help your teen deal with the inevitability of peer pressure by learning what it’s like … again.\nThe desire to fit in can be overwhelming for kids who look to model the examples of popularity they see on TV and in magazines. They can easily equate being part of a specific group with social status, personal accomplishments and good fortune. Fitting in – or feeling as though you don’t fit in – can affect a child’s self-esteem, grades and communication and leadership skills.\nWhile the pressures of popularity greatly increase with teens in high school, children begin forming social groups and standards as early as the first grade. They gravitate towards classmates for a variety of reasons such as personality, ability and appeal.\nAttending school, sports practice or extra-curricular classes may seem brutally unpleasant to a child who feels he doesn’t “belong.” The added stress of the physical changes that puberty brings often sends teens and ‘tweens in search of a social group to feel safe in. Some try to blend into the melting pot of styles, ideals and opinions represented in the school halls in the hopes of not being viewed as different or original. Others opt for a contrasting strategy of intentionally trying to stand out hoping somehow to fit into a crowd of “originals” or “social misfits.”\nWhat’s Learned in School\nLiz Maurin, a high school foreign language teacher, has seen how overpowering the quest for popularity can be. Unfortunately, she has seen the situation turn ugly. “Kids resort to behaviors that border on dangerous just to get the attention of a member of the opposite sex or to break into a clique,” says Maurin. “They’ve learned how to manipulate situations and words just to be popular.”\nIt can be difficult for adults to navigate through the various pressure situations kids face. Spreading rumors, telling lies or being intentionally hurtful are just a few of the dilemmas our children face daily to gain recognition among their peers.\nMaurin has seen some of her students teeter on the verge of a breakdown from the pressure to get into the “in” crowd. “Kids will intentionally ruin their grade point averages because they don’t want to be considered too smart,” she says. “They’ll defy parents, teachers and counselors just to go along with what their group is doing.”\nIn a study at the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, researchers supported what Maurin sees in the halls of her school. They learned that young people connect risky behavior with popularity.\nThe study also found that nearly 75 percent of teens believe their peers who are perceived as popular are more likely to engage in drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes or pot or gambling than their “unpopular” ones. “Young people know that cigarettes, marijuana and alcohol are easily accessible, and many believe that the popular kids drink and smoke cigarettes or marijuana,” says Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Center. “Since popular kids shape the norms that influence the attitudes and behaviors of those their age, this combination of popularity and accessibility is a dangerous mix.”\nCountering the Pressure\nWhether it’s experimenting with teen drinking, sexual activity or contemplating an embarrassing round of truth or dare, you can help your child develop a strong mental and emotional constitution to weather the storm of popularity pressure.\n“Providing a stable support network is the first step in overcoming peer pressure” says child advocate specialist Diana Derby. “Kids need to know they have options to the pressured choices they face among their peers.”\nMaintaining open lines of communication with your child will help him to make clear and safe choices. Talking about the circumstances and decisions you faced as a teen are helpful, but listening objectively to his scenarios will give you valuable insight into his life.\nUnderstanding what he views as important will provide a starting point. Whether making the football team or cheerleading squad or being invited to a party or dance is the priority, it’s important to understand what your child is attempting to accomplish socially.\nIf your daughter’s looking to replace her junior high look with one that’s more mature and suited to high school, you’re a more stable adviser to help her apply make-up than a friend in the bathroom between classes. And when it comes to harmful substances, Derby recommends talking to your child about the tastes, effects and consequences of them in order to satisfy curiosities he might otherwise explore as a result of pressure from friends. “Be honest about the consequences of decisions he might make out of pressure to fit in” Derby adds.\nIt’s Good to Have Options\nChildren battling the pressure to be popular need a positive support structure. Cheryl Browne-Ojei, Ph.D., works to provide at-risk children a safe haven to express themselves while feeling they belong to a group of their peers. She helps kids build self-esteem through positive situations and examples.\nGiving a child who feels he doesn’t fit in the chance to positively impact a situation helps his confidence soar. He’ll be more likely to stand up for himself at school or sports practice. Teachers like Liz Maurin have seen that children who exude high self-esteem and confidence in their decision to not give into pressure often become “founding fathers” of their own social group.\nThe opportunity to gain support from extended family members and friends also boosts esteem and resilience to pressure. Having the option to shoot hoops with an older brother and his friends from college gives your teen an appealing “out” to participating in a drinking contest all in the name of fitting in.\nEncourage your kids to pursue hobbies, sports interests or creative outlets to meet peers with similar interests. Sometimes the chance to spend time talking with a buddy about the round of weekend football games or attending dance class with a friend helps teens navigate through pressures to fit in.\nIf you take a mental trip back in time to your days in junior high and high school, you’ll remember how vital it felt to belong to a group – whichever group that happened to be. Recognizing those insecurities and social anxieties are what teens and ‘tweens still experience today and will help you help your child cope with the pressure he faces to be popular.\nGina Roberts-Grey is a licensed clinical social worker and freelance writer.\nWhen in doubt, check a book out. There are plenty of books available to help you and your teen through the popularity pressures.\nWhy Doesn’t Anybody Like Me?: A Guide to\nRaising Socially Confident Kids\nBy Hara Marano\nThe Complete Idiot’s Guide to\nSurviving Peer Pressure for Teens\nBy Hilary Cherniss and Sara Jane Sluke\nHow to be Popular\nBy Jennifer McKnight-Trontz\nQueen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends and Other\nRealities of Adolescence\n(Three Rivers Press)\nBy Rosalind Wiseman","When does a fixation on your appearance become body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)? Learn more about statistics and symptoms related to BDD.\nMany people wish to change aspects of their appearance, whether it be a desire to be thinner, taller, or have a differently shaped nose. However, when a focus on perceived flaws becomes obsessive or stressful, these may be signs of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD).\nBDD statistics show that symptoms of the condition can include spending hours grooming, checking mirrors or avoiding social situations that can trigger anxious feelings about one’s appearance. While seemingly minor or non-existent to outsiders, these perceived flaws can be intensely distressing and debilitating to someone with BDD. BDD facts and statistics reveal the widespread prevalence of this condition, as well as the groups it most commonly affects.\nPrevalence of Body Dysmorphia\nThe prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder, also known as body dysmorphia, is estimated to affect approximately 2.0% of the general population, but the condition may be more common in some groups, such as teens, women or people with a pre-existing psychiatric condition. A survey of American adults found that BDD prevalence may vary by gender, where women reported slightly higher rates of BDD than men. Several factors can also increase the risk of BDD, including experiencing childhood bullying, having a perfectionistic personality, or living with another mental health condition, such as anxiety or depression.\nBDD in Teens\nThe teenage years are marked by dramatic changes in physical appearance, which is likely why this developmental stage is when BDD symptoms tend to first emerge. BDD in teens appears to impact both boys and girls equally and often becomes more prevalent in the later years of adolescence.\nBody dysmorphic disorder in adolescence can be particularly distressing, given that the teenage years are a vulnerable time of many changes. However, in many cases, BDD symptoms in adolescence are temporary and subside as the person gets older. It is vital to monitor and provide adequate psychological support to teens with BDD, as untreated cases may persist into adulthood.\nBody Dysphoria in Men & Women\nBDD is experienced in both men and women, although women tend to have the condition at slightly higher rates. This slight discrepancy may be due to additional societal pressure placed on the importance of female appearance. However, the gender gap may be closing as men also feel increased pressure to maintain an attractive appearance. Interestingly, the presentation of BDD may be different in men and women. For example, women may be more likely to become preoccupied with their skin, stomach, weight or body hair, while men tend to fixate on body build, thinning hair or genitals.\nMen, particularly those who participate in an elite sport or appearance-driven competitions such as body-building, may be more susceptible to a subtype of BDD called muscle dysphoria. Muscle dysphoria relates to specific obsessions and concerns surrounding body size, shape or muscle mass. Muscle dysphoria can co-occur with social anxiety disorder or eating disorders.\nBDD and Co-Occurring Disorders\nWhile BDD can be diagnosed and treated on its own, it shares many features and symptoms with mood disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and eating disorders. People with BDD demonstrate obsessive, neurotic, anxious and controlling characteristics, which are common in other mental disorders. People with BDD often also experience social anxiety related to how others will perceive their appearance, and may develop anorexia or bulimia in trying to alter their appearance. In rare cases, altered visual perception in BDD may be a symptom of schizophrenia, though these are typically considered separate disorders.\nExperiencing BDD in combination with a mood, obsessive or eating disorder could be additionally distressing and requires a different treatment strategy than those used when BDD is experienced in isolation.\nBody Dysmorphia and Suicidal Ideation\nThe intense distress and obsession that underlies body dysmorphic disorder can lead to suicidal ideation, as people with BDD may feel helpless in their ability to control their appearance. People with BDD are at increased risk of suicide. Fortunately, early intervention and treatment help reduce this risk.\nBody Dysmorphic Disorder and Cosmetic Surgery\nThe desire to alter or conceal one’s appearance is standard in cases of BDD. Perhaps unsurprisingly, BDD rates are reported to be much higher in those who have received plastic surgery or cosmetic dental work. Although people with BDD may feel initial relief following cosmetic surgery, appearance-related obsessions and anxieties often return if the underlying, psychological causes of BDD are left untreated.\nStatistics on Body Dysmorphic Disorder Treatment\nThe obsessions and distress experienced by those with BDD can be debilitating. With the support of medical professionals and loved ones, the prognosis of BDD can include a return to a fulfilling and obsession-free life. BDD treatment often includes:\n- Cognitive behavioral therapy to break existing thought patterns\n- Learning new habits and ways of thinking\n- Monitoring and avoiding triggering experiences\nWhile unlearning thought patterns and behaviors related to BDD can be challenging, these measures can significantly improve a person’s quality of life. This personal work is particularly important if a person lives with co-occurring BDD and addiction.

{"question":"For children age 10-11 interested in water activities, what are the specific requirements and precautions for both diving certification and watch selection for swimming (excluding casual water contact)?","answer":"For diving certification, 10-11 year olds must have their parent/guardian watch 'Youth Diving: Responsibilities & Risks' before training, get PADI release forms signed by a parent/guardian, and can only dive to maximum 40 feet. For swimming watches, they should choose models specifically rated for swimming (not just water contact) - like the Speedo watches that are water resistant to 164 feet or the Timex Iron Kid's design rated to 165 feet. Both watches feature secure straps (polyurethane with pinless buckle for Speedo, nylon band for Timex) and necessary functions like timers and stopwatches for swimming activities.","context":["Kids Waterproof Watches\nAbout Kids Waterproof Watches\nWhether a child is just learning to tell time or has become more independent, a watch can give them the tools they need. However, we all know that kids can be tough on delicate belongings, which is why kids waterproof watches can be necessary. Whether your kid just forgets to remove their watch before washing up, finds themselves exploring puddles or streams, or they enjoy watersports, these watches can be perfect.\nWe'll introduce you to some features to consider and show you some of the more popular models on this page.\nPhoto by Jonf728\nChoosing Your Kids Waterproof Watch\nHere are just a few things to consider when choosing a kids waterproof watch:Water resistance\nSome watches are good for standing up to rain, others can take a dive in the pool or a snorkeling trip just fine. Manufacturers will indicate at what depth of water the watch can still function.Durability\nA plastic watch with velcro strap can handle most situations and are quite affordable. The Timex Stretch Band watches are an example of this. Watches with a polyurethane or resin body will tolerate rougher handling. A velcro strap is easiest but tends to be a bit less durable if worn for many years. Buckle clasps are more secure but are more difficult to handle. However, a pinless buckle clasp can be a good compromise.Features\nFor many kids, having the date and time is all that's necessary. For other kids, especially those who swim, a timer and stopwatch function is valuable. Certainly, backlighting can make the watch face easier to view, especially at night.\nPopular Kids Waterproof Watches\nBelow you'll find some of the kids waterproof watches that are most popular with customers.\nSpeedo offers theirs in a variety dual toned designs: aqua/gray, pink/gray, red/gray, neon green/gray, blue/black, and black. These watches feature quartz movement and a polyurethane strap with pinless buckle for easy and secure fastening. They are water resistant to 164 feet. The backlit digital display provides the time, day, date, and month. Functions also include an interval timer, stopwatch, and alarm.\nTimex has several digital waterproof watches for kids as well as some analog options. Their affordable stretch band watches offer quartz movement with an elastic fabric strap and velcro clasp. They feature a stopwatch, alarm, and timer function. The large buttons make them easy to operate for kids ages 6 and under. They display both date and time in digital format and provide an Indiglo night light.\nThey're water resistant to depths of 99 feet and with their kid focused warranty, you can even replace any watch lost within a year for only $10.\nTimex also offers their Iron Kid's designs which have a nylon band and sturdy resin body that's shock resistant as well as water resistant to 165 feet. You'll also find Timex's stainless steel \"My First Outdoor\" watch that offers and analog display and canvas band with velcro clasp that is water resistant to 99 feet.\nBuy a Kids Waterproof Watch\nThis is a good watch for outdoors, incidental water contact won't harm it, but it's not designed for wear in the pool.\nThis watch isn't designed to handle swimming, just incidental water contact.\nThis one is said to be water resistant to 165 feet; suitable for swimming.\nThis one is best for incidental water contact rather than immersion.\nThis watch has luminescent hands, a second hand, a durable nylon strap, and is water resistant to 330 feet.\nA Few Words of Caution about Waterproof Watches\nAs mentioned above, it's important to know if a watch is water resistant or if it is waterproof, or capable of withstanding immersion. Before purchasing a watch, even one for a kid, it's good to know a few more facts about how effective this waterproofing might be. You can find some good basic information here.\nA waterproof watch should have special seals that keep water out. Over time these seals will fail to do their job and have to be replaced. Most people don't want to consider doing this with an inexpensive kids waterproof watch. Luckily, when you have growing kids, this often is not an issue, they will outgrow the watch somewhat quickly.\nUsers also have to remember that if they open the watch to change the battery, it will break the seal, and likely spell the end to effective waterproofing unless there is an O ring you can replace. Most of these inexpensive watches for kids aren't that sophisticated. They are great for kids in the short term, but probably shouldn't be considered something that will last for years to come.","PADI Open Water Diver\nExperience another world\nThe PADI Open Water Dive Certification is the most recognized dive certification in the industry. Valid in over 200 countries, no other certification gives you the flexibility and freedom to dive safely with accredited shops worldwide.\nPADI Junior Open Water Diver Course\n- Minimum age 10 years old\n- Maximum depth for 10 to 14 year olds is 40 feet\n- All elements of the Open Water Diver course must be completed to certify\n10 & 11-year olds and parent or guardian must watch “Youth Diving: Responsibilities & Risks” before starting training\n- Children under 18 must have PADI release forms signed by a parent or guardian before starting training.\nCosta Rica Open Water Diver\nThe intensive and fun educational process and the skills you’ll learn will serve you for the rest of your life and is one of the most important steps towards greater freedom you can make in life, as we really only get to see a third of the world without being able to go beneath the waves. The PADI OWD Certification allows you to dive anywhere in the world to a depth of 60 feet or 18 meters, independent of professional supervision.\nThe PADI Open Water Diver Certification is composed of three distinct parts, each designed to build your knowledge and skill base until you are comfortable and confident diving on your own.\n- Knowledge Development – There are several ways to complete the Knowledge Development portion of the course work, which consists of 5 classroom sessions. Students may also opt to study online or independently on their tablet or laptop using PADI’s e-learning application. Learning the basics of scuba before you hit the water is essential and the subjects covered will enable you to build your confidence before you enter the water as well as dispel many common myths and preconceptions about scuba. Once you have finished your coursework, you will be tested on the principles of scuba. When you can demonstrate that you have retained enough to score a 75 percent or higher on an administered scuba test, you can move on to the second portion of the course.\n- Confined Water Dives – Now that you have a background in the basics of scuba and have demonstrated competency of what you have learned, the next step is to get in the water in a confined area such as a pool. The Confined Water portion of the course consists of 5 dives where the student is able to put into practice the skills and knowledge they gained during the study sessions. Under the supervision of your instructor, you will familiarize yourself with many common situations likely to encounter during your dives, such as resetting your mask or breathing off another diver’s tank. These common skills are essential to becoming a safe and confident scuba diver and will form the foundation of your skill base moving forward to the final portion of the course.\n- Open Water Dives – The final step in receiving your certification as a PADI Open Water Diver is to complete 4 Open Water dives in the majestic Pacific Ocean. Now that you have demonstrated your proficiency in the classroom and practiced and honed your skills in a limited environment, it’s time to put all that knowledge and skills to good use to explore the marine world that has been off limits previously. There is little that compares to the 360 degrees of freedom of movement that you have while scuba diving, and the marine wildlife that you will encounter will take your breath away. Once you have completed your open water dives and receive your certification, you will be free to dive anywhere in the world and experience the true variety and diversity of our amazing planet, both above and below the waves."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:78becaef-60a3-4427-8f2a-47b561bbf102>","<urn:uuid:59c227bb-a0f7-42de-8c18-a4df55703b22>"],"error":null}
