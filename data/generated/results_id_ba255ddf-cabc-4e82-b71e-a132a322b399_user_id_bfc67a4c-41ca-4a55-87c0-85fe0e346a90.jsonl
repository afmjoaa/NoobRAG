{"question":"How does a bank appraisal protect the lender's interests in a home purchase transaction?","answer":"A bank appraisal protects the lender's interests because the bank essentially becomes a co-investor in the home. The lender includes conditional ownership in the mortgage contract, allowing them to foreclose and take possession of the property if the borrower fails to repay the debt. The appraisal, conducted after a purchase contract is in place, ensures the home is worth the purchase price and the money the lender provides. These appraisals typically align with the agreed-upon purchase price since the true market value is determined by what the buyer is willing to pay, unless the buyer has drastically overpaid.","context":["A Realtor appraisal and a professional, licensed appraisal arranged by your mortgage lender have different purposes in the housing market. In each case, an appraiser prepares an estimate of the value of the home for sale. The results can impact both the list price and the buyer's mortgage.\nRealtor is a professional title for a real estate agent who is a paid member of the National Association of Realtors. When you hire a listing agent and brokerage to sell your home, the agent does a basic appraisal to help you figure out the best listing price. She typically compares your property to sale prices of other comparable homes in the area, making allowances for any extras, like a deck or pool, and taking away for any features not available in your home.\nThe real estate agent's appraisal is part of her service to you as the seller. The goal is to set a reasonable price that gives you the best chance to sell your home for a fair value. With a listing price too high, your home will not appeal as much to buyers in that price range. A price too low may get you a quick sale, but you could leave money on the table.\nWhen you go to a bank or mortgage lender to get financing for your home purchase, your lender typically arranges a professional home appraisal as part of the loan approval process. A state-certified professional home appraiser conducts the appraisal, which includes an inspection of the general condition of the home and documentation of room sizes and features. The appraiser uses a variety of research tools, including the local Multiple Listing Service, court records and prior appraisal data to compare your home to similar ones in the market. He prepares a long form report, detailing all aspects of the appraisal and a short summary that explains the appraised value and reasoning behind it.\nA bank appraisal is usually conducted after a purchase contract is in place and the buyer is getting financing to complete the purchase. As a buyer, your bank or mortgage lender basically becomes your co-investor in a home. Because of the risks, the lender includes conditional ownership in your mortgage contract. This means the bank can foreclose, or take possession of the property if you fail to repay your debt. The purpose of the appraisal is to ensure the home is worth the price you paid and the money the lender gives you. Often, these appraisals come in at or near the agreed upon purchase price, unless you drastically overpay, since the true market value is what you as the buyer will pay.\n- Jupiterimages/Comstock/Getty Images\n- Can You Still Negotiate After an Appraisal?\n- What if You Disagree With a Bank Appraisal?\n- How to Find the Fair Market Value of Home\n- What Is a Seller-Financed Mortgage?\n- Should the Home Appraisal Be a Factor When Placing an Offer?\n- Who Holds the Deed to the Property When a Satisfaction of Mortgage Is Filed?\n- What Happens at a Home Appraisal?\n- Can a Buyer Break a Home Contract After a Positive Home Inspection?"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:daaec0e9-449d-4f05-a479-8bc5fff00d73>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the biggest structural restoration challenges for historic churches, and how much funding is typically needed for comprehensive repairs? üèóÔ∏è","answer":"Historic churches face significant structural restoration challenges, particularly with roofs and steeples. For instance, at St. Andrew's Church, the Bell Tower was found to be unstable beyond the halfway point, requiring dismantling to a stable level and rebuilding with a concrete block interior. Similarly, Saint George's Arts and Heritage Centre faces major restoration challenges with its roof, which hasn't been refurbished since 1884 and regularly loses slates. The steeple, stairs, and wooden features have been damaged by wet and dry rot.

Foundations were solid, but previous repair attempts and some original design characteristics of the tower had resulted in accelerated deterioration of the structure, and had left several areas of both the buttresses and walls in need of extensive repair. Quinn Dressel Associates designed a concrete bond beam and interior concrete block wall system, as well as new wood floors and specialized details for masonry anchorage.\nThe tower was dismantled to a stable level, and the exterior masonry was rebuilt against, and tied into, a new concrete block interior. All stones were numbered in order to maintain the original exterior fa√ßade of the tower. Preventative measures were taken, including the redesign and replacement of the original buttress capstones to better shed water, in order to prevent the reoccurrence of several factors which had aided in the formerly declining state of the tower.\nQuinn Dressel Associates also provided for the replacement of the main Church roof with a new standing-seam metal roof, and delivered recommendations with regard to heat loss and insulation, and asbestos concerns.\n- St. Michael‚Äôs Cathedral, Toronto\nBuilt in 1848, the Cathedral structure consists of load-bearing masonry supporting a wooden ground floor and wood truss roofs over the nave and side aisles. The spire was added in 1868. The floor of the nave and side aisles were modified by the introduction of steel beams, which a 1995 report by Larkin implies was carried out circa 1938, and some additional masonry supports were also added at that time. We provided the structure of the new elevator and the new replacement of the balcony choir loft. We also designed and upgraded many structural elements within the building.\nFor the St. Michael‚Äôs Cathedral project, we identified distressed masonry elements such as pinnacles, and provided designs for their stabilization. We designed the underpinning of the foundations for the creation of increased headroom within the crypt. The jacking and underpinning of the interior columns of the church were carried out without deformation or deflection of the existing building elements.

It takes more than faith to lift a 17,000 ton 128 year old church off its foundations, and excavate 15m of earth from under it, and to continue services as usual. The church was within a new multi-level shopping centre taking place around and under the old Christ Church Cathedral in Montreal. Plans included two new retail levels and one parking level to be constructed right under the Cathedral.\nThe Gothic church was originally built in 1860 and was one of the few churches in Canada built completely by stone. The spire became a problem over the years, because the structure was built on subsoil, and it began settling even before completion. By 1927, the steeple was leaning two feet from the vertical and causing cracks in the rest of the church. The top half of the stone steeples was removed and rebuilt with metal and cast aluminium panels that look like stone. The cathedral is 200 ft. long and 109 ft. at its widest point, with the steeple rising 17 storeys above ground level. The structure weighs 6000 tons and the steeple 1500 tons.\nEngineering ingenuity allowed the final phase of the Maison des Cooperants project in mid-town Montreal to get underway, although it looked as if divine intervention was at work when Christ Church Cathedral was suspended to permit construction of the underground shopping/parking levels for the development. The ‚Äúcathedral-on-stilts‚Äù caught the attention of all passers-by in Montreal. Suspending the church was an engineering feat never before attempted.\nThe citation in winning the Association of Consulting Engineers of Canada‚Äôs Award of Merit read: ‚ÄúThe challenge faced by Quinn Dressel Associates was putting the church on new foundations without interrupting services during the construction period. The delicate and possibly strained condition of the building required an approach that would not allow any appreciable movement during or after the implementation stage‚Ä¶(it was executed) successfully with movements never exceeding 3/16 inch‚Ä¶‚Äù\nKey to the success of the underground shopping mall which was part of ‚ÄúCathedral Place‚Äù high-rise office development in the heart of downtown Montreal was the feasibility of building a two storey shopping mall and one level of parking under Christ Church Cathedral.\nThe church foundations, which had a history of settlement, were masonry spread footings supported on a layer of clay with glacial till and bedrock about 45 feet to 50 feet below grade. Completing the support of a 128 years old Cathedral to allow for a five basement deep retail and parking development below without interrupting services during the construction period was a considerable challenge.\nThe technical challenge was to minimize building movements during or after the implementation stage. The solution was a post-tensioned system which balanced the church loading and prevented any vertical movements of the already strained building. The wooden floor was left in place and all work was confined to the basement area, thus ensuring continuation of religious services throughout construction.\nCaissons, socketed into bedrock at a depth of 18m, were installed outside the church. Concrete beams, 1.8m deep, designed to carry the building in section ‚Äì were threaded through the existing foundations. A secondary system of 1.2m deep girders was designed to enclose all masonry foundation elements and transfer the load to the main concrete beams.

The main structure consisted of tied wooden roof trusses at 12' 3\" spacing, spanning approximately 40', supported by 5\" by 6\" raking wood posts, supporting a king post truss. The posts appeared to have been tied together with 2/2\" by 10\" wood beams, at ground floor extending the full width of the building. The overall structure was clad with non-load bearing brick. The roof consisted of wood purlins supporting wood planking and felt tiles.\nA Physical Risk Assessment carried out by Quinn Dressel Associates revealed the roof trusses had failed and were deflecting to such an extent that the overall structure was in a state of unstable equilibrium and required immediate remedial attention.","A new lease of life for a 220-year-old\nSaint George‚Äôs Arts and Heritage Centre\nA new lease of life\nSaint George‚Äôs Arts and Heritage Centre is located in the former Church of Ireland parish church in Mitchelstown, Ireland. It's a three-minute drive from Junction 13 on the M8 - 40 minutes from Cork - 30 minutes from the Rock of Cashel - 15 minutes from Fermoy - 30 minutes from Mallow. Saint George's was deconsecrated in August 2017. Saint George's is owned by a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee. It purchased the building from the Church of Ireland in Apeil 2019.\nThe company is conserving the building and convert it into a dynamic venue for a wide range of arts, cultural, heritage, tourism and civic-based activities including a digital information centre and a dedicated archive and library. To achieve this goal, we are raising ‚Ç¨1 million. Approximately half of this funding is likely to be sourced through grants from various local, national and European agencies. We have already received considerable financial and technical support from Cork County Council and Ballyhoura Development. The remainder of the fund is being raised through donations, sponsorship, fundraising events and other activities.\nPlease hit the donate and/or volunteer button and join us on the adventure.\nBe part of something that is already making a difference to the cutural landscape of the North Cork, Ballyhoura and Galtee regions.\n‚Ç¨1 million Restoration Project\nSaint George‚Äôs is available to anyone interested in the arts, culture and heritage. It is also available for other activities including civil marriages, conferences and meetings. The former church is owned by a not-for-profit company, which is actively developing the centre as Mitchelstown's cultural and historic venue.\nThe first phase of the project has included cleaning external facades, intrnal restoration of the steeple, interior re-decoration and various repairs and improvements to facilities. The roof has not undergone any significant refurbishment since 1884 and loses slates regularly, so this is a priority for future funding. Meanwhile, slates have been repaired and most water ingress has been stopped (most of the time). However, almost every heavy downpour brings water dripping through the roof. The current estimate for a new roof is ‚Ç¨200,000. The steeple, stairs and schoolroom are damaged by wet and dry rot, which has destroyed some other wooden features of this part of the building. The steeple hasn‚Äôt been repaired in over a century. The bell and bell-ringer's room hae undergone a complete restoration during August, September and October 2019, resulting in the bell being run properly for the first time in decades. Between April 2019 and September 2019 a tremendous amount of work was carried out inside and outside the building which has transofrmed its appearance and made it more inviting to the public.\nAll external stonework needs re-pointing. Internal walls need re-plastering, decorating and painting. We intend to restore the organ which is reputed to be the oldest in County Cork and one of the oldest in Ireland. Other works will include restoration of the clear-glass windows, leaded windows, stained-glass windows and doors. We must refurbish all existing wooden and tiled floors in the nave, where sections of the decorative wall panelling has been attacked by dry rot and woodworm. In our first three months of ownership, we restored and modernised the Vestry into a meeting room and it is planned to convert the schoolroom into an office and reception area. An upstairs room will be converted into a quiet space for reading and listening to music. We hope to heat and power the centre with the help of green technologies. We plan to retain most of the existing pews but hope to raise funds to provide them with comfortable cushions thereby adding to the comfort of our patrons. To do all of what we hope to achieve will require ‚Ç¨1 million and thousands of volunteer hours to do as much work as we can at minimal expense.\nAs part of the project, the main body (nave) of Saint George‚Äôs is being used as an exhibition space for creative arts, photography, sculpture and other arts-related activities. We hope to attract a very wide range of exhibitions by local, national and international craftspeople.\nIf you are interested in running arts or similar creative activities in please contact us.\nThe centre is a focal point for historical, genealogical, cultural and heritage events. An interactive interpretive area will tell the story of the region over the centuries.

{"question":"how are Ethiopian forests being affected by coffee farming vs deforestation? gimme the key facts","answer":"Ethiopian forests face two major threats. Due to general deforestation mainly from agricultural practices and rising population pressures, Ethiopia could lose its remaining afro-montane forests in the foreseeable future, with only small remnant fragments remaining. Regarding coffee farming specifically, while about 35% of coffee production occurs in semi-forest systems, these practices are significantly altering forest structure - about 30% of canopy trees and most undergrowth are removed, forest species decline, and tree ferns are becoming rare. Additionally, as coffee prices rise, forest coffee is increasingly being converted to more intensively managed semi-forest coffee, further impacting forest integrity and biodiversity. Currently, only about 2000 sq km of high-quality forest with wild arabica coffee remains in Ethiopia.","context":["Dr. Neville Winchester, Department of Geography, University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada V8W 3N5\nAlameyuhu Wassie Eshete, Forestry Department, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia\nMeg Lowman, PAMS, North Carolina State University, USA\nEthiopia is experiencing continual deforestation, and could lose its remaining afro-montane forests within the foreseeable future. In the northern highlands of Ethiopia, remnants of old-aged afro-montane forests can be found associated with Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Churches (Alemayehu 2010). Rising population pressures and deforestation mainly due to agricultural practices are the primary stressors impacting the rich fauna and flora of the region. Loss of these forests is the greatest threat to the biological diversity of the region and small remnant fragments (e.g., 1-100 ha) of these afro-montane forests exist but will likely lose much of their biodiversity as the surrounding habitat matrix continues to be eroded. We know that in general, species loss is accelerated in small (e.g. <100ha) and isolated fragments (Turner and Corlett 1996). Local extinction related to habitat fragmentation has been well documented (see Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, Manaus, Brazil) and compelling evidence suggests that many species of vertebrates cannot persist within small fragments but it is, as yet not clear what proportion of the original arthropod fauna is viable in small and often isolated fragments. Several factors influence arthropods that are likely to survive in a forest fragment. Size and connectivity are important, but frequency and intensity of human disturbance in the surrounding habitat matrix and encroachment are central drivers affecting biodiversity patterns and processes in these Church Forests.\nHere, I report on a current biodiversity initiative and highlight preliminary results from a microarthropod program conducted in 2 Church forests. This research program, organized by Dr. Meg Lowman, was predicated on the partnership that she formed in 2009 with the Christian Orthodox clergy‚Ä¶ the caretakers of these forests‚Ä¶ and Dr. Alemayehu Wassie, a well known Ethiopian ecologist and point contact for this expedition. Information on other components of this pilot project and participants/research from the 2010 expedition can be found here.\nArthropod communities associated with suspended soils/epiphytes and ground debris in Ethiopian Church Forests were the target groups of interest. In August, 2010, I sampled 2 forest fragments, Debresena and Zhara. Debresna (11o, 51‚ÄôN;37o,59‚ÄôE) is a 11.5 hectare fragment containing 34 tree species at an elevation of 2690 metres. Zahar (11o 48‚ÄôN;37o34‚ÄôE) is lower (1950 m) in elevation and has less tree species (29). Although both fragments are small, they differ markedly in the degree of human impact within and outside of the forest fragment, Debresna represents a fragment that is significantly more intact with reduced human impacts when compared to Zahara (Figure 1). Additional details pertaining to Church Forests can be found in Alemayehu (2010).\nI used single rope techniques to access the canopy and samples were collected with a soil corer, 3cm diameter x 5 cm deep (Figure 2). Contents of each sample core were extracted in the field. Microarthropods were extracted into 75% EtOH using Berlese funnels which were run for 48 hours. Since power was unavailable, samples were extracted using moth balls, a variation on the standard extraction technique but one that is proving to be valuable for areas where a power source is unavailable.\nThis study incorporates a stratified random sampling design where at each site the forest was divided into 3 strata based on distance to the edge. In each strata 3 trees were randomly chosen and single samples were taken from the ground and from the canopy (approximately 10 m from the ground). In total 18 samples were collected from each site and an additional 2 samples were collected from Zahar.\nExtracted microarthropods were sorted into the following taxonomic groups: mites (Acari), springtails (Collembola), beetles (Coleoptera), flies (Diptera), bees, wasps and ants (Hymenoptera), pseudoscorpions (Pseudoscorpiones, millipedes and centipedes (Myriopoda), spiders (Araneae) and snails (Gastropoda) (Figure 4). The Acari were further identified to suborder and adult oribatid mites were identified to species by Dr. Valerie Behan-Pelletier. All specimens are deposited in the Canadian National Collection, Ottawa, Canada.\nIndependent sample t-tests were used to test for differences in oribatid richness and abundance between sites (canopy and ground samples were pooled). Using F-tests I compared the effect of distance on oribatid species richness at each site. Theoretical total species richness for each site was calculated using first- and second-order Jackknife, ACE, ICE and Chao 1 and 2 estimators. All estimates were performed using EstimateS (Colwell 2005).\nFrom 6472 microarthropods collected from Berlese extractions a total of 51 species representing 30 families were identified from 1043 adult oribatid mites (741 from Debresna, 302 from Zahara). Observed and theoretical species richness using first- and second-order Jackknife, ACE, ICE and Chao 1 and 2 estimates were consistently higher in Debresena compared to Zahar (Table 1).\nTwenty-two species of oribatid mites were observed from Zahar, of which 12 species were unique to this site and not found in Debresna. Thirty-six species of oribatid mites were observed from Debresna, of which 19 species were not found in Zahar, and the remaining 20 species of oribatid mites were shared in common between study sites. No significance difference was found between mean species richness (t17, 0.05 = 1.25 P = 0.229) and mean species abundance (t17, 0.05 = 1.62, P = 0.62) between sites. I detected a significant effect of distance from the edge for species richness at both sites (Zahar, F3,9,0.05 = 9.12; P = 0.004; Debresna, F3,8,0.05 = 5.74; P = 0.022) and a Tukey multiple comparison test indicated that the difference in both cases was between the samples from the forest fragment and the samples collected outside of the forest fragment. Distance from edge within the forest fragment showed little association with species composition.\nTrends found in oribatid mite communities recorded in this study likely act as a surrogate for all microarthropods that require decomposing litter as a habitat template to complete their life histories. I detected no difference in species richness with distance from the edge within each forest site which likely is related to fragment size‚Ä¶ these fragments were just too small to observe an effect of distance on diversity. However, distinct differences in species richness were found when samples from each fragment strata were compared to samples taken outside of the forest fragment. In soil systems, increasing mite diversity with increasing soil microhabitat complexity is well known (Anderson 1977). The substrate outside of the forest fragment is completed degraded and consists of compact clay with minimal interstitial spaces and little debris accumulation. Heavy impacts from grazing and general human use are evident and particularly pronounced in Zahar. Habitat heterogeneity and complexity is one explanation for the observations that we recorded in this pilot study, a feature that has conclusively been shown to shape oribatid mite communities (Lindo and Winchester 2006). The ability of forests to provide microhabitats which have a positive association with increased oribatid mite diversity and in general microarthropod diversity has been documented (Lindo and Winchester 2007).\nSpecies richness estimators support the observation that our sampling program, although conservative in nature was sufficient to account for oribatid mite diversity contained in these forest fragments. However, I treat this result with caution and coax it in the context of spatial (fragment size) and temporal (seasonal) constraints. Interestingly, each site had a large number of rare species and species that were site specific. This supports the assertion that forest fragments act as repositories for arthropod biodiversity which is likely linked, among other things, to plant diversity. In addition, I suspect that this trend becomes more pronounced with increasing fragment size. The number of unique forest fragment species suggests that the oribatid mite community associated with these forests is distinctly different from the surrounding disturbed habitat and varies across fragments. I suspect that comparisons of oribatid mite richness between the canopy and ground would be significant but would require an extensive canopy sampling program that includes sampling at heights greater than 10 metres (e.g., 20-45m)‚Ä¶ graduate student possibilities!!\nIn conclusion, well-developed soils still exist in the Church forests of Ethiopia and support a rich, diverse microarthropod community as exemplified by the oribatid mites documented in this study. Forest fragments likely vary in their species composition, further supporting the role that Ethiopia‚Äôs forests have in maintaining local biodiversity. Conservation initiatives encompassing all forest fragments are needed to maintain the unique and spectacular diversity that is intimately associated with Ethiopian afro-montane forests.\nAlemayehu, W.E., Sterck, F.J. and Bongers, F. 2010.

Coffea arabica originates in and still grows wild in Ethiopia in areas which are included in the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity hotspot. This hotspot ‚Äî which also covers areas in the coffee-growing regions of Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi ‚Äî has been reduced to 10% of its original extent. In Ethiopia, only about 2000 sq km of high-quality forest with wild arabica coffee remains.\nAs coffee consumers, we often hear about this ‚Äúwild‚Äù coffee, or the generally rustic way in which coffee is typically grown in Ethiopia, and so we generally feel good about enjoying Ethiopian coffee from an ecological point of view. Technically, coffee is wild if it grows and reproduces or regenerates on its own within natural habitats.\nHow much Ethiopian coffee is grown in forests? Is it really coming from a pristine environment? Is this method of coffee production really preserving biodiversity?\nA number of publications over the past few years help shed some light on this topic, and the results are a bit surprising. The diagram at right is one I constructed using data from several sources (list at end of post). It indicates the different methods of coffee cultivation in Ethiopia, with rough approximations of the frequency of occurrence of each. Below are the characteristics of each method. This is all necessarily simplified, but most sources are in general agreement.\nPlantation coffee (10%). This is the most intense method of coffee cultivation, where land is cleared and planted with coffee and managed for yield, which ranges from 450 to 1200 kg per ha annually (around 750 seems ‚Äúaverage‚Äù). This includes larger estates, but may also involve small holders.\nGarden coffee (or ‚Äúsemi-forest plantation‚Äù) (50%). Here coffee plants are transplanted to gardens around farmers‚Äô homes. These plants might come from nearby forest, or farmers may exchange seedlings best adapted to an area or microhabitat; some may originate from a different region. Coffee is typically interplanted with other crops and fruit trees. Garden coffee is found most frequently in southern Ethiopia, including Sidamo, and well as Harerge/Harrar. Yields range from 200 to 700 kg/ha/yr.\nForest coffee (5%). I think this is what most people probably envision when they hear about ‚Äúwild‚Äù coffee. Here, coffee is harvested from trees growing in the forest, with virtually no management of the surrounding forest or vegetation, except perhaps some removal of undergrowth to facilitate access to the coffee trees. However, it should be noted that several authors have stated that coffee is managed in some way virtually wherever it occurs. Even among locals, ‚Äúforest coffee‚Äù is broadly and variously defined. It may mean old overgrown plantations, or a single coffee tree in a pasture that was once forest. In any event, yields are well below 200 kg per ha, often between a mere 7 to 30 kg.\nSemi-forest coffee (35%). Most ‚Äúforest coffee‚Äù is probably really in this category, termed semi-forest coffee. Here, the forest is altered and managed, often quite substantially. The canopy is thinned once to several times a year to allow more light to reach the coffee and increase yields (which vary greatly depending on the extent of management, but are under 400 kg per ha per year). Trees with open, wide-spreading canopies are favored since fewer trees are needed to provide the preferred amount of shade. Undergrowth, competing shrubs, and emerging seedlings of other plants are removed to make harvesting easier and to make room for more coffee. The coffee grows wild, but is also supplemented by shrubs transplanted from elsewhere. Usually this means from a nearby forest, but occasionally even government-supplied cultivars are utilized.\nWhile semi-forest coffee is better than a coffee monoculture with no canopy cover, several studies have shown that the managing of these forests does have serious consequences. Schmitt et al. (2010) found that in the Bonga region, 30% of canopy trees and most undergrowth was removed in these systems, severely disturbing forest structure. Although the overall number of plant species increased by 26% in comparison with intact forest, it was due to secondary and pioneer species, mostly herbaceous species and vines. Forest species declined. Of special concern is the reduction in the number of tree ferns, an ancient family of plants which require shady, moist conditions that are becoming rare in some locations. In Jimma, Aerts et al. (2011) found a near-absence of a true upper canopy >15 m tall, and many climax forest species have nearly disappeared, as they are removed and seedlings are not allowed to regenerate.\nIncreasingly, forest coffee is being managed as semi-forest coffee, and semi-forest coffee is being managed and harvested with increasing intensity as coffee prices rise. The increasing management intensity has profound impacts on the forest and biodiversity. This diversity includes the genetic resources of wild races of Coffea arabica, as the practice of swapping and transplanting coffee, and any interbreeding, erodes the integrity of wild genotypes.\nVolkmann (2008) did an analysis of the areas used by two dozen cooperatives that are part of the Kafa Forest Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union, and concluded that the designation ‚Äúforest coffee‚Äù was probably inappropriate for the output of almost half of them, as they are highly degraded forests, or mostly garden coffee. However, in 2010, this area was designated as UNESCO biosphere reserve. Like other biosphere reserves, the goal is to have a core area that is protected, and buffer zones in which sustainable practices are allowed. Planned projects include reforestation.\nCoffee is a main source of income in for people who live in regions where it grows wild. The solution isn‚Äôt prohibition, but probably some sort of incentive or compensation to manage the coffee in such a way that forest integrity and species are conserved. One idea being explored is some sort of certification that includes a production ceiling (so that managing for higher yields is not encouraged). The International Standards for Sustainable Wild Collection of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants might be a starting point.\nThere is much more on the coffee forests of Ethiopia at the web site of the Conservation and use of wild populations of Coffee arabica in the montane rainforests of Ethiopia project web site.\nPapers cited and additional resources:\nAerts, R., Hundera, K., Berecha, G., Gijbels, P., Baeten, M., Van Mechelen, M., Hermy, M., Muys, B., and Honnay, O. 2011, in press.

Although Pluronic is a polyether and not biodegradable, amphiphilic block copolymers of PEG and aliphatic polyesters or polypeptides are also known to exhibit temperature-responsive sol‚Äìgel transition . They are composed of biodegradable aliphatic polyesters or polypeptides and relatively low-molecular-weight PEG. As the hydrophobic segments can be degraded in the body and the degradation products and low-molecular-weight PEG can be excreted from the body, they are suitable for biomedical use.\nEach solution of l- or d-isomer of the triblock copolymer did not show such temperature-responsive sol‚Äìgel transition behavior. These results suggest that an increase in temperature triggered perturbation of the polymer micelle through dehydration of PEG, which formed the shell layer of the micelle, and led to intermicellar aggregation by SC formation of PLLA and PDLA segments. The SC copolymer gels exhibited higher mechanical strength (modulus = 900 Pa at 37¬∞C, 10 wt%) compared with that of simple triblock systems of PEG and aliphatic polyesters.\nIt can be rationally done if we use a two-dimensional medium where in-plane directions possess macroscopically visible dimensions and their thicknesses are maintained in the nanometer region .

He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 ‚Äúfor his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect‚Äù and he made some essential contributions to the early development of quantum theory. He was named \"Person of the Century\" by Time magazine in 1999, the fourth most admired person of the 20th Century according to a 1999 Gallup poll, and ‚Äúthe greatest scientist of the twentieth century and one of the supreme intellects of all time‚Äù according to ‚ÄúThe 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History‚Äù in 1978.\nAlbert Einstein was born into a non-practising Jewish family in Ulm in the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, Germany on 14 March 1879. He was always a little different from other children: his head was slightly larger than normal, and he hardly spoke as a young boy, leading one housekeeper to consider him \"retarded\". At an early age, his family moved to Munich where Einstein attended a Catholic school and showed an early aptitude for mathematics, particularly geometry and calculus (although he disliked the school's policy of strict memorization, which he thought unhelpful). Outside of school, he explored his own path of learning in mathematics and philosophy with a medical student and friend of the family, Max Talmud.\nAt 15, after his father‚Äôs electrical equipment business failed, he followed his family to Pavia, Italy (not wishing to stay and finish his schooling in Germany), and then on to Aarau, Switzerland, where he finally finished high school. At the age of just 16, he had already made his first conceptual breakthrough while looking at a mirror and wondering what he would see if he were travelling at the speed of light (a thought experiment sometimes referred to as \"Einstein's Mirror\"). In 1896, he renounced his German citizenship in order to avoid military service, and went to study mathematics and physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Z√ºrich, graduating in 1900. He gained Swiss citizenship in 1901 and never revoked it.\nUnable to find a teaching post after graduation, Einstein eventually obtained a job evaluating patent applications for electromagnetic devices at the Swiss patent office in Bern. He married a Serb woman named Mileva Maric in 1903, and the couple were to bear two sons, Hans Albert (1904) and Eduard (1910), (and possibly another child, Lieserl, before their marriage, who either died in childhood or was put up for adoption), before divorcing in 1919.\nIn 1905, sometimes referred to as his ‚Äúannus mirabilis‚Äù (wonderful year), and while he was still working in the patent office, the young 26 year old Einstein completed his PhD (with a thesis on \"A new determination of molecular dimensions\") and had no less than four important papers published in the ‚ÄúAnnalen der Physik‚Äù, the leading German physics journal:\nMuch of this work was highly controversial (or just ignored) within the scientific community of the time, and he continued his work at the patent office until 1908. But he had earned his PhD from the University of Z√ºrich in 1905, and he was eventually able to obtain a privatdozent position at the University of Bern in 1908, followed by brief teaching posts at the University of Z√ºrich and the University of Prague in 1911.\nDuring this time he continued to publish papers, but it was only on moving back to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Z√ºrich in 1912 that he began working in earnest on a generalization of his theory of relativity. He benefitted from the mathematical assistance of his old friend Marcel Grossman, who was one of the only people in Zurich with whom Einstein could discuss his new ideas. He moved on to Berlin in 1914 (at the personal request of Max Planck), where he became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, a director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics and a professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin, as well as maintaining an ongoing relationship with Leiden University in the Netherlands (through his contacts there with the physicists Hendrik Lorentz and Willem de Sitter). He became actively involved in anti-war demonstrations during World War I, publicly advocating civil disobedience and the refusal of conscription.\nEinstein gave a series of lectures in 1915 about his new theory, which was to become known as the General Theory of Relativity, including a new equation to replace Newton's law of gravity, now known as Einstein's field equation. The complete theory was finally published in 1916, although physicists and mathematicians like Karl Schwarzschild and Ludwig Flamm were starting to publish solutions to his field equations even before its publication. General relativity is based on the notion that gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable (the principle of equivalence) and describes gravity as a property of the geometry (or, more specifically, the warpage) of space-time, leading to the prediction of phenomena like the bending of light, black holes and wormholes.\nA year later, Einstein published a paper introducing a new notion into his General Theory of Relativity, a sort of anti-gravity force which he called the ‚Äúcosmological constant‚Äù that kept the universe from collapsing in on itself, in an attempt to model the behaviour of the entire universe, while retaining his firm belief in a Newtonian infinite, static model of the universe. He later called this idea his ‚Äúgreatest blunder‚Äù although, in the light of recent discoveries about the accelerating universe and dark energy, it is beginning to look remarkably prescient.\nHe divorced Mileva Maric in 1919, having lived apart for the last five years, and within months of the divorce, married his cousin Elsa L√∂wenthal (who had nursed him through an illness) and together they raised Margot and Ilse, Elsa's daughters from her first marriage.\nDespite the attempts by many scientists to disprove the General Theory of Relativity, the British astronomer Arthur Eddington claimed in 1919 to have confirmed Einstein's prediction of the gravitational deflection of starlight by the Sun, leading, almost overnight, to global renown and international media attention for Einstein. His fellow scientists began to speak of general relativity in terms such as \"probably the greatest scientific discovery ever made\" and \"the greatest feat of human thinking about nature\". He was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics, ‚Äúfor his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect‚Äù (i.e. not for his theory of relativity).\nEinstein spent the next few years travelling extensively, giving lectures around the world. Throughout the 1920s, he engaged in an extended public debate with Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg over the inherently probabilistic ‚ÄúCopenhagen interpretation‚Äù of quantum mechanics, with which he was never quite happy from a philosophical stand-point, claiming in 1926 that ‚ÄúI, at any rate, am convinced that He [God] does not throw dice\". He tried to develop thought experiments whereby Heisenberg's uncertainty principle might be violated but, each time, Bohr found loopholes in Einstein's reasoning.\nDuring the First World War, Einstein had campaigned vigorously against the war, supporting various anti-War and pacifist organizations. He remained a staunch pacifist even after the end of the War, and was highly critical of nationalism and committed to the idea of a single world government free of a military. Throughout the 1920s, he continued to participate in numerous peace campaigns and wrote articles on international peace and disarmament. He was also was drawn to the Zionist cause during the 1920s, despite its nationalistic character.\nHis physics research after general relativity consisted primarily of a long series of (largely unsuccessful) attempts to generalize his theory of gravitation still further in order to unify and simplify the fundamental laws of physics, particularly gravitation and electromagnetism. He was desparate to come up with a unified field theory, a \"theory of everything\" that would refute the claims of quantum theory, which he never came to terms with. He went so far as to publish a paper in 1929, which purported to be just such a theory, and which attracted huge media attention, but he was forced to admit to errors and back-tracked rapidly, losing credibility and accepting public humiliation in the process.\nHe became increasingly isolated in his research, pursuing his own lonely track while largely ignoring other developments in physics and particularly in quantum theory. He did pursue a few collaborations, most notably with the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, the Austrian Erwin Schr√∂dinger and his Hungarian former student Le√≥ Szil√°rd, and later in the 1930s with the Russian physicist Boris Podolsky and the Israeli physicist Nathan Rosen. But his his distrust of quantum theory and his inconclusive search for the elusive \"theory of everything\" was to consume him until the day he died.\nIn the early 1930s, Einstein took to spending his winters at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, and was also a guest lecturer at the newly founded Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. When, in 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany and promptly passed the \"Law of the Restoration of the Civil Service\" removing Jews and politically suspect government employees (including university professors) from their jobs, the Einsteins prudently moved to the U.S.A., buying a house in Princeton. The Nazis froze his German bank account and seized his home, and Einstein remained in the United States for the rest of his life, becoming a citizen in 1940 (although he also retained his Swiss citizenship). Over time, he became so well known in his adopted America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain \"that theory\".\nHis wife Elsa died in 1936, and his personal secretary, Helen Dukas, cared for him thereafter, as his health became increasingly precarious. During the 1930s and into World War II, Einstein wrote a huge number of affidavits recommending U.S. visas for European Jews who were trying to flee persecution. The ‚ÄúDeutsche Physik‚Äù movement in Nazi Germany published pamphlets and even textbooks denigrating Einstein, and blacklisting any instructors who taught his theories (including Nobel laureates Max Planck and Werner Heisenberg).\nWith the Nazi rise to power in Germany, Einstein decided to rethink his rigid pacifist stance. Many scientists in the U.S.A., especially refugees from European anti-Semitism, recognized the danger of German scientists developing an atomic bomb during World War II, based on the newly discovered phenomenon of nuclear fission, to which Einstein‚Äôs own theoretical work had contributed to some extent. In 1939, Einstein signed a letter to U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, penned by the Hungarian √©migr√© and physicist Le√≥ Szil√°rd, urging American development of such a weapon, and this letter is considered instrumental in Roosevelt‚Äôs subsequent authorization of secret research into the harnessing of nuclear fission for military purposes (which developed into the Manhattan Project and ultimately resulted in the nuclear weapons used on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki).\nAlthough Einstein himself did not play a direct role in the development of the atomic bomb, he later expressed regret about signing the letter to Roosevelt, and urged that all nuclear weapons be transferred into the control of the United Nations. In the later Cold War years, Einstein lobbied, along with Albert Schweitzer and Bertrand Russell, to stop all nuclear testing and future bombs.\nIn politics, he was a socialist Zionist who supported the creation of a Jewish national homeland in the British mandate of Palestine, and he raised money for Zionist organizations and was in part responsible for the 1933 formation of the International Rescue Committee. In 1952, he was even invited to be Israel's second president, but he declined, claiming that he had ‚Äúneither the natural ability nor the experience to deal with human beings‚Äù. In a 1949 article entitled \"Why Socialism?\", Einstein described a chaotic capitalist society as the \"predatory phase of human development‚Äù and as a source of evil to be overcome. He was a member of several civil rights groups, and was sympathetic to the notion of vegetarianism, adopting a strict vegetarian diet later in life.\nAlthough many religious groups have claimed that Einstein worshipped a Judeo-Christian God, he himself was quite clear on the matter, repeatedly professing himself to be a humanist and an agnostic (although not an atheist), with no belief in a personal God, which he called a ‚Äúchildlike‚Äù faith. The family practised no formal religion in their home and Einstein did not want his children to receive any form of religious instruction. He did, however, admit to professing a belief in ‚ÄúSpinoza's God, who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God who concerns Himself with the fate and the doings of mankind‚Äù, and he often expressed a continuing awe at the harmony and order of nature and the universe.\nEinstein began to suffer from ill health in 1950, and eventually died of an aortic aneurysm on 18 April 1955 in Princeton Hospital in New Jersey at the age of 76, having continued to work, both on physics and on his civil rights and political concerns, until the day he died, his search for a \"theory of everything\" still unrealized.\nBack to Top of Page\nIntroduction | Main Topics | Important Dates and Discoveries | Important Scientists | Cosmological Theories | The Universe By Numbers | Glossary of Terms | A Few Random Facts\nIf you quote this material please be courteous and provide a link.\nCitations | Sources | Questions?
