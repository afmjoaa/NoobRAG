{"question":"Did both George Caleb Bingham and Frederic Leighton serve in military roles during their lives?","answer":"Yes, both artists served in military roles. George Caleb Bingham became captain of a volunteer company during the American Civil War and helped keep Missouri from joining the Confederacy. Frederic Leighton served as a volunteer soldier in the 38th Middlesex (Artists') Rifle Volunteer Corps, where he quickly rose through ranks from Captain to command A Company, then to major in 1869, and finally to lieutenant colonel in 1875.","context":["- Title: A View of a Lake in the Mountains\n- Artist: George Caleb Bingham\n- Medium: Oil on canvas\n- Date: between circa 1856 and circa 1859\n- Dimensions: Height: 53.9 cm (21.2 ″); Width: 76.5 cm (30.1 ″)\n- Current Location: Los Angeles County Museum of Art\nWhat I love about this picture:\nThis scene depicts an hour of utter serenity in the turbulent life of the artist. The late afternoon sunlight falls gently on the rocky path above the calm waters. Shadows fall in all the right places but don’t darken the moment. There is a dreamlike quality to the day, as if the artist painted his deepest wish. This is a pleasant, restful painting.\nAbout the Artist, via Wikipedia:\nGeorge Caleb Bingham (March 20, 1811 – July 7, 1879) was an American artist, soldier and politician known in his lifetime as “the Missouri Artist”. Initially a Whig, he was elected as a delegate to the Missouri legislature before the American Civil War where he fought the extension of slavery westward. During that war, although born in Virginia, Bingham was dedicated to the Union cause and became captain of a volunteer company which helped keep the state from joining the Confederacy, and then served four years as Missouri’s Treasurer. During his final years, Bingham held several offices in Kansas City, as well as became Missouri’s as Adjutant General. His paintings of American frontier life along the Missouri River exemplify the Luminist style.\nBingham ran for election as a Whig to the Missouri House of Representatives the following year. He appeared to have won in 1846 by 3 votes but lost in a recount. In a reprise of the election in 1848, Bingham won the seat by a decisive margin, becoming one of the few artists to serve in elected political office. He actively opposed the pro-slavery “Jackson resolutions” in 1849, although their proponent was also a resident of Saline County. He would also represent Missouri’s eighth district at the Whig National Convention in June 1852. Bingham’s political interests would be reflected in his vivid paintings of frontier political life.\nAbout the Luminist style, via Wikipedia:\nLuminism is an American landscape painting style of the 1850s to 1870s, characterized by effects of light in landscape, through the use of aerial perspective and the concealment of visible brushstrokes. Luminist landscapes emphasize tranquility, and often depict calm, reflective water and a soft, hazy sky.\nAs defined by art historian Barbara Novak, luminist artworks tend to stress the horizontal, and demonstrate the artist’s close control of structure, tone, and light. The light is generally cool, hard, and non-diffuse; “soft, atmospheric, painterly light is not luminist light”. Brushstrokes are concealed in such a way that the painter’s personality is minimized. Luminist paintings tend not to be large so as to maintain a sense of timeless intimacy. The picture surface or plane is emphasized in a manner sometimes seen in primitivism. These qualities are present in different amounts depending on the artist, and within a work.\nLuminism has also been considered to represent a contemplative perception of nature.\nThe artists who painted in this style did not refer to their own work as “luminism”, nor did they articulate any common aesthetic philosophy outside of the guiding principles of the Hudson River School.\nCredits and Attributions:\nA View of a Lake in the Mountains by George Caleb Bingham, via Wikimedia Commons.

His works depicted historical, biblical, and classical subject matter. Leighton was bearer of the shortest-lived peerage in history; after only one day his hereditary peerage became extinct upon his death.\nThe Lord Leighton\nFrederic Leighton, \"Self-portrait\", 1880\n3 December 1830\n|Died||25 January 1896 (aged 65)|\n|Education||Eduard von Steinle and Giovanni Costa|\n|Known for||Painting and sculpture|\n|Movement||Academicism, Neoclassicism and British Aestheticism|\n|Awards||Prix de Rome, Légion d'honneur|\nLeighton was born in Scarborough to Augusta Susan and Dr. Frederic Septimus Leighton. He had two sisters including Alexandra who was Robert Browning's biographer. He was educated at University College School, London. He then received his artistic training on the European continent, first from Eduard von Steinle and then from Giovanni Costa. At age 17, in the summer of 1847, he met the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer in Frankfurt and painted his portrait, in graphite and gouache on paper—the only known full-length study of Schopenhauer done from life. When he was 24 he was in Florence; he studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti, and painted the procession of the Cimabue Madonna through the Borgo Allegri. From 1855 to 1859 he lived in Paris, where he met Ingres, Delacroix, Corot and Millet.\nIn 1860, he moved to London, where he associated with the Pre-Raphaelites. He designed Elizabeth Barrett Browning's tomb for Robert Browning in the English Cemetery, Florence in 1861. In 1864 he became an associate of the Royal Academy and in 1878 he became its President (1878–96). His 1877 sculpture, Athlete Wrestling with a Python, was considered at its time to inaugurate a renaissance in contemporary British sculpture, referred to as the New Sculpture. American art critic Earl Shinn claimed at the time that \"Except Leighton, there is scarce any one capable of putting up a correct frescoed figure in the archway of the Kensington Museum.\" His paintings represented Britain at the great 1900 Paris Exhibition.\nLeighton was knighted at Windsor in 1878, and was created a baronet, of Holland Park Road in the Parish of St Mary Abbots, Kensington, in the County of Middlesex, eight years later. He was the first painter to be given a peerage, in the 1896 New Year Honours. The patent creating him Baron Leighton, of Stretton in the County of Shropshire, was issued on 24 January 1896; Leighton died the next day of angina pectoris.\nLeighton remained a bachelor, rumors of him having an illegitimate child with one of his models, in addition to the supposition that Leighton may have been a homosexual, continue to be debated. He certainly enjoyed an intense and romantically tinged relationship with the poet Henry William Greville whom he met in Florence in 1856. The older man showered Leighton in letters, but the romantic affection seems not to have been reciprocated. Enquiry is furthermore hindered by the fact that Leighton left no diaries and his letters are telling in their lack of reference to his personal circumstances. No definite primary evidence has yet come to light that effectively dispels the secrecy that Leighton built up around himself, although it is clear that he did court a circle of younger men around his artistic studio.\nAfter his death his barony was extinguished after existing for only a day; this is a record in the Peerage. His house in Holland Park, London has been turned into a museum, the Leighton House Museum. It contains many of his drawings and paintings, as well as some of his former art collection including works by Old Masters and his contemporaries such as a painting dedicated to Leighton by Sir John Everett Millais. The house also features many of Leighton's inspirations, including his collection of Iznik tiles. Its centrepiece is the magnificent Arab Hall. The Hall is featured in issue ten of Cornucopia. A blue plaque commemorates Leighton at Leighton House Museum.\nLeighton was an enthusiastic volunteer soldier, enrolling with the first group to join the 38th Middlesex (Artists') Rifle Volunteer Corps (later to be known as the Artists Rifles) on 5 October 1860.\nHis qualities of leadership were immediately identified, and he was promoted to command A Company within a few months. On 6 January 1869 Captain Leighton was elected to command the Artists Rifles by a general meeting of the corps. In the same year he was promoted to major and in 1875 to lieutenant colonel. Leighton resigned as commanding officer in 1883. The painter James Whistler famously described the then, Sir Frederic Leighton, the commanding officer of the Artists Rifles, as the: “Colonel of the Royal Academy and the President of the Artists Rifles – aye, and he paints a little!\" At his funeral, on 3 February 1896, his coffin was carried into St Paul's Cathedral, past a guard of honour formed by the Artists Rifles.\n- 1864 – Associate of the Royal Academy\n- 1868 – Royal Academy Academician\n- 1878 – President of the Royal Academy\n- 1878 – Légion d'honneur Officer\n- 1878 – Knight Bachelor\n- 1886 – Created a baronet in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom\n- 1889 – Associate member of the Institute of France\n- 1896 – Created a baron in the Peerage of the United Kingdom\n- Death of Brunelleschi (1852), oil on canvas\n- The Fisherman and the Siren, c. 1856–58 (66.3 x 48.7 cm)\n- Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna is carried in Procession through the Streets of Florence (1853–55), oil on canvas.\n- The Discovery of Juliet Apparently Lifeless (c.1858)\n- The Villa Malta, Rome (1860s), oil on canvas\n- The Painter's Honeymoon, c. 1864 (83.8 x 77.5 cm)\n- Mother and Child, c. 1865, (48.2 x 82 cm)\n- Actaea, the Nymph of the Shore (1868), oil on canvas, (57.2 x 102.2 cm) National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa.\n- Daedalus and Icarus, c. 1869, (138.2 x 106.5 cm)\n- Hercules Wrestling with Death for the Body of Alcestis (1869–71) (132.4 x 265.4 cm)\n- After Vespers 1871, (111.5 x 71.5 cm), Princeton University Art Museum\n- Greek Girls Picking up Pebbles by the Sea, 1871 (84 x 129.5 cm)\n- Teresina (circa 1874) Christchurch Art Gallery Te Puna o Waiwhetu, Christchurch, New Zealand\n- Music Lesson, c. 1877, (92.8 x 118.1 cm)\n- An Athlete Wrestling with a Python (1877), bronze sculpture\n- Nausicaa, c. 1878 (145 x 67 cm)\n- Winding the Skein, c. 1878, (100.3 x 161.3 cm)\n- Light of the Harem, c. 1880, (152.4 x 83.8 cm)\n- Idyll, c. 1880–81\n- Wedded, (c. 1881–1882) (145.4 x 81 cm)\n- Cymon and Iphigenia (1884) Art Gallery of New South Wales\n- Captive Andromache, c. 1888 (197 x 406.5 cm)\n- The Bath of Psyche, (c. 1889–90) (189.2 x 62.2 cm) Tate Gallery\n- The Garden of the Hesperides, c. 1892, (169 x 169 cm)\n- Flaming June (1895), oil on canvas, Museo de Arte de Ponce, Puerto Rico (120.6 x 120.6 cm)\n- The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins (Fresco)\n- The armlet\n- Phoebe (55.88 x 60.96 cm)\n- A Bather\n- The Leighton Frescoes, The Arts of Industry as Applied to War and The Arts of Industry as Applied to Peace\n- Phoenicians Trading with the Early Britons on the Coast of Cornwall, 1895.

{"question":"What makes an innovation more likely to be adopted?","answer":"Innovations are more likely to be adopted when they have lower social or economic costs, fit well with existing values and practices, and are less complex. Additionally, innovations that are flexible enough to be modified (reinvented) to better match prevailing practices and cultures are more appealing. It also helps if potential users can observe and try the innovation without significant sacrifice or commitment.","context":["Diffusion of innovations, model that attempts to describe how novel products, practices, or ideas are adopted by members of a social system. The theory of diffusion of innovations originated in the first half of the 20th century and was later popularized by American sociologist Everett M. Rogers in his book Diffusion of Innovations, first published in 1962.\nKey elements of the theory include the innovation, the communication processes and channels of communication, the passage of time, the potential adopters, and the social system, all of which influence whether or not an innovation with be taken up by a given group. The innovation (the product, practice, or idea) need not be a new invention but must be perceived as new by individuals or other units of adoption. Its characteristics, such as relative advantage, compatibility, malleability, and complexity, influence the likelihood that it will be adopted. Communication is essential for the diffusion and subsequent acceptance or rejection of an innovation, which can alter the structure and function of a social system. Change is measured by the numbers of people, groups, or institutions adopting the innovation over time. Consequently, the key variables of interest are time (earliness of knowing about innovation), rate (adoption of different innovations in a social system or within and among different social groups), and innovativeness (the degree to which groups or organizations adopt new ideas). Analyses can establish the flow of influence, offer charts of the diffusion curve, develop mathematical models of the diffusion process, and test out contributions of key elements and characteristics.\nDevelopment of the theory\nThe diffusion model developed through an interest in social transformation and explorations of the consequences of the development, spread, and adoption or rejection of new products, activities, and ideas. For example, anthropologists studied the introduction of the horse within and among indigenous populations of North America, the spread and modification of dance ceremonies among Native American groups, and the spread of corn (maize) cultivation from America to Europe. Early sociological studies included the examination of social and legal trends, such as the influence of a city on surrounding areas, the diffusion of governing practices, and the use and consequences of technology. Rural sociologists focused on the spread of new ideas among farmers and subsequent changes in agricultural practices.\nLessons learned from diffusion studies in anthropology, sociology, education, folklore, communication, marketing, economics, and public health have helped contemporary scholars and practitioners transform the diffusion of innovation model from a descriptive model into a proscriptive one. Today, diffusion theory commonly is used as an analytic framework for understanding and measuring social change and, in practical application, to guide the design and evaluation of products, programs, and communication strategies.\nCharacteristics of innovations\nInnovations that are perceived to be of lower social or economic costs, that provide a good fit with values and current practices, and that are of low complexity are more likely to be adopted than those carrying high costs, representing a variance with common values, and appearing to be difficult to understand, to communicate, or to use. Those innovations flexible enough to withstand some change to provide a better fit with prevailing practices and cultures hold more appeal. This flexibility, sometimes labeled a reinvention, involves change in some of the characteristics of the innovation to increase compatibility of the innovation with the existing social system. It is also of importance whether or not potential users can observe as well as try the innovation without undue sacrifice or commitment.\nThe role of communication and time\nCommunication channels and the agents of change affect the diffusion process as well. Communication channels include face-to-face communication and mass communication, while agents of change are those individuals who bring innovations to members of a social system. Agents of change may be members of the community or individuals outside the social structure of the community. Diffusion analysis must consider who talks to whom, who is considered influential and trustworthy, and who has easy access to or is barred from various communication channels. Characteristics of the potential adopters are of critical concern. Overall, factors such as socioeconomic status, culture, gender, race, age, cultural norms, religion, education, social support, and family ties all influence access to and perceptions of the innovation.\nA vital aspect of the diffusion model, and one closely linked to an analysis of adopters, is the consideration of time. The population is often divided into groups based on the time it takes for people to adopt the innovation. The groups are innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and late adopters. Innovators, for example, are often viewed as creative but marginal individuals. Early adopters, close to sources of communication, are often highly integrated into the social system. They often carry a high degree of opinion leadership, are respected by their peers, and serve as role models for others. It is only when these respected members of a community consider, discuss, and adopt the innovation that wide diffusion takes place. Those in the early majority generally interact frequently with peers and are exposed to various sources of information. Those in the late majority are people who are further removed from key communication channels or who remain skeptical and adopt only after pressure from their peers or out of economic necessity.\nIn older articulations of the model, those who are introduced to the innovation late and who adopt late were called laggards. Often, people who fall into this category are distant, disadvantaged, or marginalized. These members of the population are often further removed from key channels of communication than are those who are able to learn about and adopt the innovation early. They are also more likely to lack resources, including time and money, to take chances. Often, they are socially isolated.\nSocial systems and consequences of adoption\nDiffusion occurs within a social system. The analysis of the diffusion process considers the members or units of a social system, including individuals, groups, organizations, or subsystems. The social system includes structural, political, economic, as well as geographic characteristics. The structure may be considered the patterned arrangements of the various units, such as the formal hierarchical structure of a bureaucratic organization with formal laws and rules. Norms may be just as powerful in other, less formal groups. Social factors also consider how decisions are made and whether or not people have an array of options or, at minimum, the freedom to adopt or reject the proposed innovation. Decisions may be individually based, be communal (arrived at through consensus), or be mandated (made through the imposition of authority). Those designing public health safety programs, for example, see initial strong adoption of practices such as seat belt use with the passage of laws (an authority-based decision) but diminished use when consensus is not considered and if enforcement is lacking. In general, the structure of a social system can facilitate or impede diffusion of innovations and thereby influence the rate of adoption of the innovation over time.\nIn the last stage of diffusion studies, consequences of innovations are documented and analyzed. Three classifications of consequences are often considered: direct or indirect consequences, anticipated versus unanticipated consequences, and desirable or undesirable consequences."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f613ea5f-9590-4de2-959b-a671f4d5da92>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the distinctive artistic influences that shaped Gordon Coulthart's work, and what educational strategies are recommended for aspiring artists according to the documents?","answer":"Gordon Coulthart's artistic work was significantly influenced by Norman Rockwell, Mad Magazine, and National Lampoon Magazine, as well as his upbringing on a dairy farm. He combines cartooning and painting in his work, approaching landscapes like puzzles of light and color while maintaining a cartoonish perspective. For aspiring artists, the documents recommend joining art groups or classes, as learning through others and healthy competition can push artistic development. Additionally, educational approaches emphasize the importance of analyzing artwork, creating schematic layouts, understanding color theory, and participating in group critiques to develop artistic skills.","context":["KT: First, we need to hear some of your backstory. Can you tell us a bit about yourself?\nGordon Coulthart: I grew up on a dairy farm near Morewood Ontario in a family of nine kids. You can see from my art that growing up on the farm had an impact on my art and humour. I was always creative, and I watched my sisters and brothers paint. I went to Algonquin College in the 70s to study Commercial Art. I was always a big fan of Norman Rockwell and advertising art.\nIn the late 70s, I heard about a cartoon studio here in Ottawa and I met Lee Atkinson, whose father Vic owned the studio. I started as a cel painter on a Christmas special called “The Little Brown Burro.” My world changed forever. I was working side by side with great animators and artists. I was most interested in background painting, and slowly worked my way up to become a background painter on many many TV series and a few movies: The Raccoons, For Better or Worse, Dennis the Menace, and Heavy Metal to name a few. I have always made Ottawa my home, but worked in LA and Vancouver for periods of time on shows like The Chipmunks, Where’s Waldo, and Sonic the Hedgehog. In 1992, I became partners with Funbag Animation, a studio that did service work for Toronto and LA. It is there I created King, an animated series of 56 episodes that ran on Family Channel for five years. While my career in animation was moving along, I was also co-creator in the syndicated cartoon called Farcus, which ran in The Ottawa Citizen and The Ottawa Sun as well as 250 other papers worldwide. I have worked on over a thousand titles in my 35 years in the animation world.\nYour work is really unique, and ranges from snowy landscapes with a Group of Seven vibe to cartoony robot fish and penguins. Where does your inspiration come from? Tell us about your process.\nI combine my two loves: cartooning and painting. I used to marvel at Mad Magazine and National Lampoon Magazine as a kid. I see everything as a cartoon or with a funny angle. Sometimes my paintings are just doodles, but taken to another level. I never discount an idea that pops in my head. I write it down or draw it out. I have books filled with crazy things. I paint a lot, and fast, so I can take chances and am not afraid to make mistakes with a crazy idea. And there are lots of crazy ideas! When I paint landscapes it is like putting a puzzle together using light and colour. I am constantly trying to fit all the pieces together. It’s like a training exercise. I switch back and forth all the time. Lots of times I will work on three of four cartoon and landscapes at a time. I just flick a switch in my brain.\nWhat do you do when you’re not painting?\nI love to do carpentry and handyman work. I am currently the manager of the seasonal department at Rona, and that gives me the freedom to paint.\nOne of your biggest works this year is at Dovercourt right now, at the bottom of the wading pool. Have you ever done anything like this before? How did it come about?\nThe Dovercourt pool was a lot of fun. I sold a painting to my friends Trish and David, and Trish [Stolte] works at Dovercourt. She suggested doing an art show there and it went very well this past spring. John Rapp, the Executive Director, loved my work and set up the pool job. It’s a big hit with the kids and their parents. I did a 16”x16” painting first, got the go ahead from John, and painted it in one afternoon.\nWhat’s the reaction to this piece been like so far?\nSuper positive. I have seen the kids playing games with it, trying not to get eaten by the giant metal fish.\nWhere else can we see your work right now?\nI have landscapes at the Wellington Eatery at 1012 Wellington St. I also have work hanging in Blueprint Home at 1301 Wellington as well as the Carleton Tavern. I will be showing new work in September at Living Colour Art Gallery at 412 Dalhousie St.\nYou seem to make good use of social media. You’re on Tumblr and Twitter and Facebook. Does it help or hinder your work? How does it affect your process, if at all. Or does it just provide the means to procrastinate?\nI use Facebook, Twitter, tumblr, and Crated for exposure. It’s like having a wall to hang my work on. It gets it out of my studio and in front of people, which gives me immediate access.\nDo you have any advice for artists who might just be starting out?\nGet into an art group or class, you will learn the most through others, and competition is good. It pushes you.\nFollow Gordon at gordoncoulthart.tumblr.com and crated.com/GordonCoulthart.

During this time he created The Gossips which became the most popular Saturday Evening Post cover in 33 years. Norman Rockwell used his neighbors as models, but did not want to insult them so he put himself and his wife into the cover design to avoid any suspicions his friends might have. The very first version began with just two gossips, then ten and finally developed into the multiple frames you see today.\nAmerican Chronicles: The Art of Norman Rockwell\nNorman Rockwell Museum\n- American Chronicles: The Art of Norman Rockwell by Linds Szekely Pero\n- Large easel with paper pad and pen\n- Worksheet: Think Sheet: Story Sequence (5-8)\n- Colored pencils, fine tipped pens\n- Final Draft Paper\n- Biography DVD: Norman Rockwell, by A&E Television Networks, 2008\nAdditional Teaching Resources:\nThe Norman Rockwell Museum at Stockbridge by The Norman Rockwell Museum\nMy Adventures as an Illustrator by Norman Rockwell\nNorman Rockwell: Behind the Camera by Ron Schick\nNorman Rockwell’s America by Christopher Finch\nNorman Rockwell’s Four Freedoms: Images that Inspire a Nation by Stuart Murray, and James McCabe\nNorman Rockwell’s Counting Book by Gloria Tabor\nNorman Rockwell: Storyteller with a Brush, by Beverly Sherman\nA Rockwell Portrait: An Intimate Biography by Donald Walton\nThe students will be seated in a comfortable way so they are able to see one another and can participate in a class conversation led by the instructor. The teacher will have a marker/chalk/crayon and a board or easel to write on.\n- Ask the students to listen attentively to one another as they share personal responses throughout the lesson. Ask a student to define the words inspire and inspiration. A definition will be written on the board to refer to later on in the lesson.\n- An index card and a pencil will be given to each student. The students will be asked to respond to one or both of the following questions (on the index card), “What inspires you?” or “Who inspires you?” Give the students a couple of minutes to write down their ideas. Ask one or two students to share one of their ideas with the class..\n- Show an image of The Gossips by Norman Rockwell and ask the students if anyone has seen this illustration before. The children will be asked to point out only what they see, not what they perceive at first. The class will collectively take a visual inventory. As each student contributes, restate their observation. You might be able to elaborate on what they have said to add more visual detail or you might ask them for clarification. You might encourage them to look more closely and carefully. By doing this, the students will analyze the work and find clues and symbols to help read the visual image, revealing American culture.\n- Read an excerpt from American Chronicles: The Art of Norman Rockwell by Linda Szekely Pero explaining the what inspired Norman Rockwell and how his family and surroundings helped grant him creative ideas for his artwork (page 99-100.) Upon completion, ask the children to recall some of Rockwell’s points of inspiration and record the list on a large paper easel or board. Student participation is critical to this discussion.\n- Show two other images by Rockwell and allow for time for the children to look at closely: Day in the Life of a Little Girl, Day in the Life of a Little Boy. Ask the students to explain the sequence of the images looking closely and using the clues that Rockwell provides.\nClasses 2 -3\n- Briefly review the list created last class about what inspired Norman Rockwell. Distribute a copy of the worksheet Think Sheet- My America Sequence 5-8 to all of the students. Read over the worksheet and explain that this is meant to help them brainstorm their ideas and create a plan for their illustration ideas. Ask the students to create a schematic layout on the back of the worksheet (first draft) based off of the following considerations: 6-8 frames must be used, color will be used to represent mood or emotion at least in one frame, clues will be given to help the viewer understand the character best. Walk around the room for informal checks of understanding and to help students. Throughout the first week working on the project, the students will be able to talk with the instructor regarding their ideas, drawings, questions and frustrations asking for help or feedback. You may ask the students to share their idea with the group, if time allows.\n- During class 4, the students will pause on their individual projects to talk about idioms and color theory regarding the American culture as well as other cultures. Ask the students what they have heard being said in the American culture relating to color to a mood. Record a list of what the students offer. Ask each student to reflect on their own work and apply color to their illustration in at least one area to emphasize a mood or emotion (for example: seeing red, feeling blue.)\n- Allow for three more classes for the students to complete their narrative illustrations. When most of the students have finished the project, ask the group to come together to conclude the project by presenting their illustrations to one another during a group critique to gain further feedback from their peers about their personal piece. Ask the students to present their project and explain their thoughts, particularly pointing out the one area where color has been intentionally used to emphasize a mood. Ask each student to point out what clues they have used so another may understand the setting and action. Once the artist has spoken, allow a couple of comments from classmates to be given. The comments must be given in a respectful manner, demonstrate critical thoughts and be relevant to the project. For example, a student might say, “I like the way you tinted the thumb green to emphasize she is good with gardening .”\nClass 8 (Optional)\n- If time permits, allow for one final class period for any adjustments to be made on the final illustration. Students that have completed the project will hang their illustration on a bulletin board in the school hallway. The instructor will play the biography DVD titled, Norman Rockwell by A&E Television Networks. All students, finished or still working will be enriched by watching and listening to the information presented in the DVD.\nStudents will be evaluated on their participation in the class discussion and in the group critique (informal checks of understanding through questions.)\n- Students will be evaluated on the completion of the worksheet, including thumbnail sketches for the final, individual project regarding their own interpretation of American life as they know it. Students will be expected to revise their work before completion of their final illustration.\n- Students will be evaluated with a teacher designed rubric that evaluates student understanding of assignment.\n- Apply formal and conceptual vocabularies of art and design to view surroundings in new ways through art-making.\n- Generate a collection of ideas reflecting current interests and

{"question":"I'm fascinated by ancient architecture! What's the historical significance of Petra's founding, and what geological features make its monuments so unique?","answer":"While the exact founding date of Petra remains undetermined, evidence suggests the city was established relatively late, although a sanctuary may have existed there since ancient times. The area was traditionally home to cave-dwellers called Horites, who were predecessors of the Edomites. The earliest confirmed Nabataean settlement dates back to around the 6th century BC. As for geological features, Petra's monuments are carved from sedimentary rocks, specifically sandstone formations from the Ordovician Disi formation and the Cambrian Umm Ishrin formation. The sandstone has a distinctive rosy color, leading to Petra being called 'a rose-red city.' The Umm Ishrin Sandstone is about 300m thick, while the Disi formation is around 100m thick with a whitish-beige color.","context":["The Treasury – Petra.\nIn order to get to this hidden place you have to walk down the beautiful canyon of Sik. You loose a breath when you get to the end of this narrow passage, between two high colorful sand rock walls, and you see this amazing temple.\nPetra is one of the world heritage sites.\nSome history of Petra (from Wikipedia):\nSo far, no method has been found to determine when the history of Petra began. Evidence suggests that the city was founded relatively late, though a sanctuary may have existed there since very ancient times. This part of the country was traditionally assigned to the Horites, probably cave-dwellers, the predecessors of the Edomites. The habits of the original natives may have influenced the Nabataean custom of burying the dead and offering worship in half-excavated caves. However, the fact that Petra is mentioned by name in the Old Testament cannot be verified. Although Petra is usually identified with Sela which also means a rock, the Biblical references are not clear. 2 Kings xiv. 7 seems to be more specific. In the parallel passage, however, Sela is understood to mean simply \"the rock\" (2 Chr. xxv. 12, see LXX). As a result, many authorities doubt whether any town named Sela is mentioned in the Old Testament.\nIt is unclear exactly what Semitic inhabitants called their city. Apparently on the authority of Josephus, Eusebius and Jerome, assert that Rekem was the native name and Rekem appears in the Dead Sea scrolls as a prominent Edom site most closely describing Petra. But in the Aramaic versions Rekem is the name of Kadesh, implying that Josephus may have confused the two places. Sometimes the Aramaic versions give the form Rekem-Geya which recalls the name of the village El-ji, southeast of Petra. The capital, however, would hardly be defined by the name of a neighboring village. The Semitic name of the city, if not Sela, remains unknown. The passage in Diodorus Siculus (xix. 94–97) which describes the expeditions which Antigonus sent against the Nabataeans in 312 BC is understood to throw some light upon the history of Petra, but the \"petra\" referred to as a natural fortress and place of refuge cannot be a proper name and the description implies that the town was not yet in existence. Brünnow thinks that \"the rock\" in question was the sacred mountain en-Nejr (above). But Buhl suggests a conspicuous height about 16 miles north of Petra, Shobak, the Mont-royal of the Crusaders.\nMore satisfactory evidence of the date of the earliest Nabataean settlement may be obtained from an examination of the tombs. Two types may be distinguished—the Nabataean and the Greco-Roman. The Nabataean type starts from the simple pylon-tomb with a door set in a tower crowned by a parapet ornament, in imitation of the front of a dwelling-house. Then, after passing through various stages, the full Nabataean type is reached, retaining all the native features and at the same time exhibiting characteristics which are partly Egyptian and partly Greek. Of this type there exist close parallels in the tomb-towers in north Arabia, which bear long Nabataean inscriptions and supply a date for the corresponding monuments at Petra. Then comes a series of tombfronts which terminate in a semicircular arch, a feature derived from north Syria. Finally come the elaborate façades copied from the front of a Roman temple. However, all traces of native style have vanished. The exact dates of the stages in this development cannot be fixed. Strangely, few inscriptions of any length have been found at Petra, perhaps because they have perished with the stucco or cement which was used upon many of the buildings. The simple pylon-tombs which belong to the pre-Hellenic age serve as evidence for the earliest period. It is not known how far back in this stage the Nabataean settlement goes, but it does not go back farther than the 6th century BC.\nA period follows in which the dominant civilization combines Greek, Egyptian and Syrian elements, clearly pointing to the age of the Ptolemies. Towards the close of the 2nd century BC, when the Ptolemaic and Seleucid kingdoms were equally depressed, the Nabataean kingdom came to the front. Under Aretas III Philhellene, (c.85–60 BC), the royal coins begin. The theatre was probably excavated at that time, and Petra must have assumed the aspect of a Hellenistic city. In the reign of Aretas IV Philopatris, (9 BC–AD 40), the fine tombs of the el-I~ejr [?] type may be dated, and perhaps also the great High-place.\nCritiques | Translate\nkhalij_khazar (182) 2008-02-13 15:12\nI've seen countless photos of this place and it never gets old.\nthe framing is outstanding, and i'm assuming you didn't have a tripod. otherwise it probably would have been nice to up the F to increase the sharpness. the facade also seems to be a little over exposed, perhaps playing with the curves might have helped\nmeme (273) 2008-02-13 17:54\nAlthough there were many pictures of that place it impresses me !Well done\njmcl (14535) 2008-02-13 18:41\nReally unique image of this unique place ..

These monuments are located in the Shera alps of Jordan, situated east of the Wadi Araba Valley.\nApproximately 2200 years ago, Nabateans (ancient Arab people who inhabited northern Arabia) had carved more than 900 monuments using sedimentary rocks as they were well-aware of the aesthetical features of sedimentary rock.\nIn 1986, the United Nations of Education, Science, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) emblazoned Petra on the directory of the world heritage site as a work of genius, bearing inimitable testimony to the advancement of civilization that has vanished. Rock-cut monuments of Petra are the epitome of exceptional architecture and represent an important phase of human history.\nIn 2007, the rock-cut monuments of Petra were selected as one of the seven wonders of the world. Petra region is also considered as a famous historical site in Jordan because it has impacted the tourism economy of the country. More than 700,000 tourists visit the rock-cut monuments of Petra in a year.\nThe sedimentary rocks of the Petra region are of lower paleozoic age. Mostly, the sandstone formations of the sedimentary rock are the pertinent stratigraphical units used for carving the monuments. These sandstone formations are the part of the Ordovician disi formation and the Cambrian umm ishrin formation.\nMost of the rock-cut monuments of Petra are undergoing weathering due to external agents such as water, humidity, and salt that have contributed to the damage. Also, anthropogenic activities, natural hazards like floods, and earthquakes have worsened the situation.\nThus, by looking at the development of damage, the world monuments fund added the rock-cut monuments of Petra to the list of top 100 endangered monuments of the world in 1998, 2000, and 2002. Therefore, the rock-cut monuments of Petra have become a global concern for preservation.\nIn this article, we will discuss the rock types, weathering agents, which are contributing to the degradation process, and preventive measures to reduce the degradation of the rock-cut monuments.\n1. Geology of the Petra Site\nThe ruined city of Petra includes many monuments, tombs, quarries, stairways, and theaters all constructed directly from sandstone rock, especially Cambrian and Ordovician sandstones. More details about the sandstone rock, which is mostly affected by the weathering, are described below:\n- Most of the sandstone rocks are underlain by igneous rocks, such as granite, gneisses, and schists.\n- Plinth level of igneous rock displays a well-defined characterized contact plane whereupon the sandstone strata is situated.\n- The shade of Petra sandstone is rosy, that is why the city is called “a rose-red city”.\n- Umm Ishrin Sandstone stratum is of middle to upper Cambrian age, and the thickness of the strata is around 300 m.\n- The upper-level blanketing formation is comprised of Disi sandstone, and the thickness of this formation is 100 m. This stratum displays a whitish-beige color and is seen throughout the valley.\n- Sandstones of the Disi formation are critically influenced by the weathering agents. Such strata erode into characteristic domed features that can be recognized from miles away.\n- Umm Ishrin sandstone formation shows extensive moment jointing and faulting. In contrast, Disi formation sandstone shows less frequent jointing.\n- Weathering induced sandstone surface recession ranges from 12-50 mm on a horizontal surface and 6-20 mm on vertical surfaces.\n2. Climatic Conditions at Petra Site\nThe climatic conditions at the Petra region are generally arid with moderate to mild blustery winters and sweltering, dry summers. Regional rainfall occurs due to change in barometric pressure conditions as the peripheral precipitation passes through northern Israel and Jordan. However, when low-pressure fronts get across northern Africa or up through the red sea, heavy rainfall occurs in the Petra region. Such conditions occasionally bring flooding in the region due to a combination of orographic lifting and cyclonic flow.\nMostly, the precipitation occurs between November and March, and the mean yearly precipitation at the Petra region is around 110-130 mm. Hints of snowfall are also reflected. However, a large portion of the precipitation is observed as rainfall.\nThe temperature in the Petra region may dip below 0 degrees during January. However, freezing temperature conditions are not common, and the temperature rises rapidly during the daytime. The maximum and minimum temperature is observed in the months of August and January and the range of temperature is around 18-390C and 6-120C, respectively.\n3. Weathering Factors and Degradation of the Monuments\nHigh-temperature loads are induced on many rock-monuments in Petra. Mostly, the monuments located in the south and west are exposed directly to the sun, for example, the Silk Tomb. Variation due to direct isolation and high-temperature loading affects the monuments and promotes the attack of weathering agents.\nResearchers have hypothesized temperature as a mild to moderate weathering agent for degrading the quality of Petra’s rock-cut monuments. As indicated by the outcomes gathered from various investigations, the correlation of high-temperature loading and weathering damage is not very severe. However, mild to moderate damages occur on the monuments exposed to temperature loading compared to the monuments insignificantly affected by temperature loading. Thus, high-temperature loading has turned out not to be the principal reason for the degradation of the monuments due to weathering.\nOn the other side, a strong correlation exists between water impact and weathering damage. During rainy reason, runoff water flows over the facades of the rock-cut monuments, and flooding conditions were also observed occasionally. Thus, the potential of damage to the monuments due to water impact is high. For example, the effect of water on the Unaishu Tomb during heavy rainfall is illustrated in Figure-2. The portion of monuments protected from the rainfall appears in a lighter color, whereas, the portion of monuments exposed to rain appears in a darker color in the photographs.\nResearchers have observed the changes in exposure characteristics of the monument during periods of rainfall. Such observations helped in mapping the exposed part of the monument, which is vulnerable to damage due to water impact. An example is presented in Figure-3. It was discovered that the south to west exposed monuments are more influenced by water impact due to precipitation compared to the north to east exposed monuments.\nThe architectural elements, such as moldings and pediments, provide protection from rain for some of the locally exposed monuments from south to west. Overflowing water affects sites, especially when water channels above the site are filled or eroded with debris. Water flowing from architectural elements is an attribute of many Petra monuments because precipitation often exceeds the water absorption capacity of the rock sediments. The lower sections of many monuments are also influenced by increased humidity.\nThe predominant weathering factors causing the degradation of the rock-cut monuments are water, salt, and humidity. Water runoff and floods affecting the monuments are characterized by high mechanical water impact potential. Several types and extents of humidity and the impact of salt relate to the weathering patterns formed on the monuments. Mostly, the monuments are categorized into damage index of two degrees. The low damage index represents the monuments sheltered from the rainfall. Thus salt penetration is negligible. The high damage index represents the monuments directly exposed to the rainfall, therefore higher salt penetration is possible.\nSalt weathering has been found to be the main and most detrimental water or moisture-induced weathering activity. The results of mineralization and geotechnical studies have exhibited that all major types of rock separation, such as contour deposits, flaking and granular decomposition, are associated with the presence of salts.\nMostly, halite (NaCl) was found to be the primary salt mineral deposited on the external walls of the monuments. Also, the presence of niter (KNO₃), Gypsum (CaSO₄.2H₂O), and sylvite (KCl) were observed. The type, amount, spatial distribution, and crystallization cycle of salt control the type and strength of stone exfoliation. Chemical analysis of rainwater shows that a significant proportion of the salt component comes from rain, especially with respect to the formation of halite. Nitrate load on the walls of the monument (especially at the bottom) is probably due to the effects of livestock over the decades.\nThe wind is observed to be another weathering agent influencing the degradation of the rock-cut monuments. However, the wind is not causing the collapse of stones. Still, it contributes considerably to the erosion of loose stones, and the evaporation of salt fluids and their movement through rocks.\n4. Preventive Measures\nThe following types of preventive measures should be taken into consideration to protect the rock-cut monuments of the Petra region:\n- Stone blocks should be prevented from breaking out. Preservatives should be used to reduce salt weathering.\n- Loose stone materials should be reinforced again to preserve the originality of the monuments.\n- For highly damaged monuments, structural stabilization or reinforcement should be provided to keep them structurally sound.\n- Repair should be done for the damaged stone parts and missing parts should be replaced.\n- Joints and fissures should be sealed properly to avoid the percolation of water and thus to prevent the disintegration of stone material.\n- A system should be provided to construct and maintain the control of runoff water. Thus, the capillary rise can be prevented and further the disintegration of stones can be reduced.\n- The rise in humidity should be controlled by planting more trees at the affected locations.\n- Desalination of runoff water must be provided because salt weathering is mostly affecting the rock-cut monuments.\n- The regular cleaning process must be carried out to reduce the deposition of harmful agents on the surface of stones.\n- External stone wall surfaces, which are exposed to weathering agents, should be protected. Protection can be provided by applying preservative solutions on external surfaces.\nPetra is a world heritage site and recognized by UNESCO as a work of genius, bearing inimitable testimony to the advancement of civilization that has vanished. Rock-cut monuments of Petra are the epitome of exceptional architecture and represent an important phase of human history.\nRock-cut monuments of Petra are located in the Shera alps of Jordan, situated in east of the Wadi Araba Valley.\nMost of the rock-cut monuments of Petra are suffering from weathering.

Mostly, the sandstone formations of the sedimentary rock are the pertinent stratigraphical units used for carving the monuments.

{"question":"Ancient fireworks vs Mesoamerican ballgame history - which came first?","answer":"The Mesoamerican ballgame came first, with archaeological evidence dating it back to 1650 BC in the Paso de la Amada region of Chiapas, Mexico. The earliest documentation of fireworks, on the other hand, dates back only to the 7th century China, making the Mesoamerican ballgame approximately 2,000 years older than fireworks.","context":["10. Entertainment and Sports\nThe Mesoamerican ballgame was a sport with ritual associations played since 1,400 B.C. by the pre-Columbian peoples of Ancient Mexico and Central America. The sport had different versions in different places during the millennia, and a modern version of the game, ulama, is still played in a few places by the local indigenous population.\nThe rules of the ballgame are not known, but judging from its descendant, ulama, they were probably similar to racquetball, where the aim is to keep the ball in play. The stone ballcourt goals are a late addition to the game.\nIn the most widespread version of the game, the players struck the ball with their hips, although some versions allowed the use of forearms, rackets, bats, or handstones. The ball was made of solid rubber and weighed as much as 4 kg (9 lbs), and sizes differed greatly over time or according to the version played.\nThe game had important ritual aspects, and major formal ballgames were held as ritual events, often featuring human sacrifice. The sport was also played casually for recreation by children and perhaps even women.\nPre-Columbian ballcourts have been found throughout Mesoamerica, as far south as Nicaragua, and possibly as far north as what is now the Central Mexico. These ballcourts vary considerably in size, but all have long narrow alleys with side-walls against which the balls could bounce.\nAncient Egypt was known to play an early form of soccer with a somewhat circular shaped object.\nThe first official balls were manufactured by Charles Goodyear in 1836. Other than that read this. “Through out history, humans have enjoyed kicking a ball or something like a ball. South American Indians were known to use a light elasticized ball. However; rubber was not to be practically manufactured until a few thousand years later.\nAccording to historical references and legend, early balls ranged from human heads, stitched up cloth, animal and human skulls to pig or cow bladders.\nDuring the Ts’in and Han Dynasties (255 BC-220 AD), the Chinese played ‘tsu chu’, in which animal-skin balls were dribbled through gaps in a net stretched between two poles.\nCertain ancient Egyptian rites are said by historians to have similarities with football, and both the ancient Greeks and Romans also played a game that entailed carrying and kicking a ball.\nAccording to pre-medieval legend, an entire village would kick a skull along a path to a nearby village square. The opposing village would in turn attempt to kick the skull to the first village’s square. Wow, that probably caused more riots than in modern soccer games.\nA Medieval custom was to take pig bladders used from live stock killed in preparation for winter sustenance and inflate them. They would play a game using their feet and hands to keep the “ball” in the air. Sounds like hacky sack to me. The animal bladder balls were eventually covered with leather for better shape retention.”\nFireworks are a class of explosive pyrotechnic devices used for aesthetic and entertainment, and religious purposes. The most common use of a firework is as part of a fireworks display.\nThe earliest documentation of fireworks dates back to 7th century China, where they were invented. The fireworks were used to accompany many festivities. It is a part of the culture of China and had its origin there; eventually it spread to other cultures and societies. Important events and festivities such as the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) and the Mid-Autumn Festival were and still are times when fireworks are guaranteed sights. China is the largest manufacturer and exporter of fireworks in the world.\nFireworks date back to the 10th century and originated in China. The Chinese developed many different kinds of fireworks with a variety of effects and color. The art and science of firework making developed into an independent profession. In China, pyrotechnicians were respected for their knowledge of complex techniques in mounting firework displays.\nDuring the Song Dynasty (960–1279), many of the common people could purchase various kinds of fireworks from market vendors, and grand displays of fireworks were also known to be held. In 1110, a large fireworks display in a martial demonstration was held to entertain Emperor Huizong of Song (r. 1100–1125) and his court. A record from 1264 states that a rocket-propelled firework went off near the Empress Dowager Gong Sheng and startled her during a feast held in her honor by her son Emperor Lizong of Song (r. 1224–1264). Rocket propulsion was common in warfare, as evidenced by the Huolongjing compiled by Liu Ji (1311–1375) and Jiao Yu (fl. c. 1350–1412). In 1240 the Arabs acquired knowledge of gunpowder and its uses from China. A Syrian named Hasan al-Rammah wrote of rockets, fireworks, and other incendiaries, using terms that suggested he derived his knowledge from Chinese sources, such as his references to fireworks as “Chinese flowers”.\nWith the development of chinoiserie in Europe, Chinese fireworks began to gain popularity around the mid-17th century. Lev Izmailov, ambassador of Peter the Great, once reported from China: “They make such fireworks that no one in Europe has ever seen.” In 1758, the Jesuit missionary Pierre Nicolas le Chéron d’Incarville, living in Beijing, wrote about the methods and composition on how to make many types of Chinese fireworks to the Paris Academy of Sciences, which revealed and published the account five years later. His writings would be translated in 1765, resulting in the popularization of fireworks and further attempts to uncover the secrets of Chinese fireworks.\nAmédée-François Frézier published his revised work Traité des feux d’artice pour le spectacle (Treatise on Fireworks) in 1747 (originally 1706), covering the recreational and ceremonial uses of fireworks, rather than their military uses.\nLinks and Resources\n– – – – – – –\nThe list of ancient inventions is endless. This post is intended as nearly random, eclectic sampling of inventions which reflect human intelligence and ingenuity.\nIf you are interested in this subject, one of worthwhile resources is this book: Ancient Inventions\nHistorian Peter James and archaeologist Nick Thorpe define the ancient period as the time before A.D. 1492, analyzing the evolution of inventions from brain surgery to playing cards, and putting into perspective the accomplishments of many diverse cultures while laying to rest some “distorted Western views of history.” — Denise Perry Donavin\nYou leave your seventh-floor apartment, curse the congested traffic that delays you, and stop at a fast-food restaurant on your way to have cataract surgery. You live in Rome in A.D. 25. Ancient Inventions entertainingly demonstrates that there is indeed little new under the sun. The book is divided by the authors (Centuries of Darkness, LJ 3/15/93) into convenient, browsable sections such as “Sex Life,” “Military Technology,” and “Communications,” each one presenting fascinating evidence of the extent to which human knowledge can be extinguished. Cute rather than hilarious in its humor, Ancient Inventions is thoroughly researched and profusely illustrated; it is doubtful that anyone could examine it without coming away enlightened in one of its broadly ranging areas. This work will be used as much for its historical information and accounts of ancient daily life as it will be for recreational reading. Historical First Patents is an overview of over 80 granted U.S. patent applications, with emphasis on the familiar: Howe, Whitney, Bell, and others whose names are closely associated with a specific device. Each entry consists of the historical developments leading to the invention, a biographical description of the inventor, and the story of the creation of the invention itself. A patent drawing accompanies most entries, although some contain a reproduction of the first page of the published patent in print so small as to be useless. The writing is rather stilted (Lincoln’s entry mentions three times in the first three paragraphs that he was the only president to receive a patent), and some obvious errors have not been caught. Some of the patents included here are for items discussed in Ancient Inventions and known thousands of years earlier, such as artificial limbs, cylinder locks, and anesthesia. Of the two books, Ancient Inventions contains information more difficult to locate elsewhere and will serve the broadest audience. Both books are appropriate for school, academic, and public libraries. — James Moffet, Baldwin P.L., Birmingham, Mich.

There, archaeologists found the remains of what would be the first space built for their practice, the oldest court so far.\nAnother important discovery about the age of the game is the one made in 1988 in the Manatí region, in the state of Veracruz. There, along with some offerings, rubber balls were found with which the game is carried out, as well as other elements related to it. All this material was dated to 1100 BC, during the preclassic period of Mesoamerica.\nThe courts in which it was practiced had different shapes, since some have the shape of an \"I\", others the shape of a joined double \"T\"; on some occasions they were closed at all four ends while on others one or two of their edges were open. However, the most common pattern in them is the presence of a deck in the lower part, a slope with a variable inclination and height in the middle and another deck in the upper part.\nIt was during the Mayan apogee in the classical period that different figures began to appear on the upper part of the slopes, such as bird heads, which serve as markers and which will continue to be appreciated until the epiclassic period in courts such as that of Xochicalco in the state of Morelos. These markers later gave way to the rings, sculptures that were placed in the middle of the slopes and in their highest part. Many of them were decorated with zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures, various symbols and calendar dates, and a few were simply plain.\nThe largest court that is registered today is the one located in Chichen Itzá, in the state of Yucatán. Its measurements are 120 by 30 meters. In contrast, the smallest field is located in Cantona, in the state of Puebla and measures 14 by 6 meters.\nThis game is recorded as something more than a simple sport, but as a very important ritual since in the various cultures that inhabited the Mesoamerican region (made up of Mexico and part of Central America) it is part of their mythology.\nAn example of this is found in the Mayan culture, who developed in the south of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and Honduras, because according to the Popol Vuh, the main book that tells their myths of origin, the sun and the moon are two brothers Hun Hunahpú and Ixbalanqué, who earned their place in the sky after defeating the gods of the Mayan underworld one by one in various ball game encounters.\nThe Aztecs, correctly called Mexica, used it in different ways, either as part of a divinatory ritual dedicated to specific gods or ceremonies, in some occasions for recreational purposes and in some cases, as an alternative to avoid war (in those cases, the governor became one more player, making a greater effort because the game was inclined in favor of his cause), and it is precisely of this culture that we have more records, since the Spanish conquerors kept in their chronicles the record of all the activities they saw when they arrived in the new world, including the ball game.\nIt is from these writings that a few rules that applied to the game are known, such as the one that mentions that the game ends if any player managed to pass the hoop with the ball.\nAccording to oral tradition, it is also from this culture that its current name comes from, since the Mexica called the game Tlachtli or Ulamaliztli; however, and over the years, this last name was gradually deformed and shortened to give way to the name by which it is known today: Ulama\nFor the Spanish, the ball game was such a spectacular event that Hernán Cortés took a couple of players from the state of Tlaxcala in 1528 to demonstrate in front of King Charles V and Pope Clement VII. This moment was recorded by the artist Christoph Weiditz, who made an illustration of that presentation annexing his interpretation: “In this way the Indians play with the inflated ball, with their backside, without touching it with their hands, on the ground; they also have a hard leather on the butt, so that it receives the blow of the ball, they also wear a leather glove\"\nUnfortunately, its spectacularity was not enough to save it from the judgment of the Holy Inquisition, as it was consider a blasphemous exercise that only heretics practiced.\nIt was thus that after several years of tolerating its practice, it was banned by Fray Fray Juan de Torquemada a few years after the conquest in order to facilitate the work of evangelization of the natives, being destroyed the vast majority of the fields used to play it.\nHowever, and in an effort to preserve it, the game continued to be played secretly from the friars and the Spaniards; its rules changed as well as the places where it was practiced. The large courts were exchanged for areas of land hidden among the planting bushes and it was no longer practiced in the big cities to be played in small towns far away from the conquerors. All this while in New Spain (as Mexico was called during the colonial era) the new religion, customs and traditions made the people forget, step by step, the practices of the past.\nThere is little information about the game in those centuries, and it was after the independence being consummated on 1821 when some news talked about that in the north of Mexico, more specifically in the region of Sinaloa, a game of pre-Hispanic reminiscences was played and was called Ulama.\nIt is well into the twentieth century when news of it are heard again, since in the mid-1930s the Mexican government again tried to ban it, this time considering it absorbing and dangerous, this being a low blow that would cause the game to be losing players until in the mid-80s it was close to disappearance due to lack of practitioners, to which the local government created programs that motivated its return to practice among the descendants of those players of yesteryear.\nThat is why in 2010, the document that declares Ulama as Cultural Patrimony of the State of Sinaloa was created, serving this to promote its practice again, this time in more regions.\nCurrently Ulama is already played in more than half of the states of Mexico and also in some regions of Guatemala, Honduras and Belize. The number of practitioners increases every day and for most of them, this is a great opportunity to connect with their roots, learn about their history and be part of social groups within their communities and live with other people outside their environment, all this without neglecting that this game It is also an excellent physical activity that encourages sports and healthy coexistence among its practitioners since, being in the process of growth, it also allows new players to have enough time to familiarize themselves with the rules and techniques and obtain a good competitive level.\nAt the end, and all of them seek a common goal, not only that the game does not disappear, but also to return the greatness and importance that it had more than 500 years ago.\nMc Kenzie Satterfield A., The assimilation of the marvelous other: Reading Christoph Weiditz’sTrachtenbuch (1529) as an ethnographic document, Department of Art and Art History, College of Visual and Performing Arts, University of South Florida, 2007\nDe la Garza Mercedes, El juego de pelota según las fuentes escritas, Arqueología Mexicana 44, pp. 50-53, 2000\nWhittington E.

{"question":"As a business consultant, I need to understand how strategic risks in projects connect with marketing plan execution - what's the relationship between these two aspects? Please explain!","answer":"Strategic risks in projects and marketing plan execution are interconnected through their impact on organizational goals. Marketing plans serve as comprehensive guides that align marketing efforts with company objectives, requiring constant review and updates based on changing market dynamics. Similarly, strategic project risks, particularly long-term ones, affect the broader organizational goals and project success, though they're often overlooked in favor of operational risks. The key connection is that both aspects require attention to long-term business impacts - marketing plans must adapt to changing business goals and market conditions, while strategic project risks can affect how projects contribute to these broader business objectives, including marketing outcomes. However, while marketing plans explicitly incorporate both strategic and tactical elements, project risk management tends to focus primarily on operational aspects, potentially missing important strategic considerations.","context":["Producing top-quality products and services is one thing but getting people to know about your products and become your customers is another struggle. Marketing sits right at the heart of the existence of a business. If done perfectly with a plan, marketing can provide adequate brand identity, credibility, inspiration, and many other business sales drivers.\nFrom proper budgeting to a strategic organization, a lot goes into building an ideal marketing plan to keep your company on track to realize your mission. First, you have to ask yourself what works and what doesn’t for your company goals. Next, the marketing plan you come up with must be timely and feature metrics for measuring success. As your business continues to evolve with time, your marketing plan, just like your business plan, should change with it.\nWhile it may seem like developing an effective marketing plan is a complex undertaking, we have put together this simplified guide to help you throughout the process.\nA Marketing Plan is a company-specific, comprehensive guide that governs and helps you streamline your marketing efforts.\nAn effective marketing plan combines timeliness, organization, and success tracking to help all marketing stakeholders work harmoniously towards achieving the company’s goals. A complete marketing plan should list your long-term and short-term marketing objectives, a full account of your target audience (buyer persona), and your high-profile marketing strategies alongside their corresponding tactics.\nBut, Why is it Necessary?\nA marketing plan provides a fundamental base for noting your plan and actionable strategies in a concise, systematized, and coordinated technique. By so doing, your marketing team can track the success of its actions so that it keeps doing what is necessary. In addition, your marketing plan goes a long way towards helping you deliberate on various perspectives, including a budget, deliverables, buyer personas, and the mission of each marketing campaign. By consolidating all these pieces of information, tracking, and evaluating the success of your campaign plan becomes more manageable.\nNote that making a marketing plan and neglecting it does not cut it. You will need to constantly reflect on it to determine where your marketing actions are headed.\nDue to its importance in realizing goals, experts advise that you come up with a separate market plan instead of making it part of the company’s business plan. This way, you will be in a better position to build a comprehensive plan to steer your company forward effectively.\nTypes of a Marketing Plan\nMarketing plans come in many types. What you choose for your company should depend on various factors, such as your area of operation, goals, and competitor profiles.\nHere are a few common types:\nQuarterly/ annual marketing plan\nThe annual plan is a set of well-defined marketing initiatives that run for a year but can be broken into more controllable quarterly bits that run for three months. Quarterly plans change based on the performance of previous quarters.\nPaid marketing plan\nDo you intend to implement actions like paid advertising and paid promotions? This plan records such strategies.\nSocial media marketing plan\nIf you desire to take advantage of social media, this plan outlines your preferred channels, methodologies, and tactics you want to use.\nContent marketing plan\nFor content-based marketing, this type covers all the plans and strategies and defines how to develop content to create awareness.\nNew product launch marketing plan\nThis type of plan comes into play when you outline your plan for advertising your newly found product or service.\nBenefits of a Marketing Plan\nComing up with a healthy marketing plan can put a new business on the map or help an existing company expand its business reach. It does this by serving as a real growth driver, among other benefits.\nAn excellent marketing plan champions the following benefits:\nIt keeps everyone on the same page: The successful execution of a marketing campaign requires the contribution of multiple departments such as marketing, logistics, and IT. All these stakeholders need to remain on the same rail to produce the required results. By acting as a guideline that offers direction, a marketing plan keeps everyone in line and committed to the specific business goals.\nA marketing plan provides a focus and direction: By constantly reminding you of what is required of you, a marketing plan helps to keep distractions at bay. Only then you are able to potentially optimize the marketing capability of your business.\nA marketing plan helps to understand your business: Creating a marketing plan involves deep-rooted research on many aspects of your business. Such research could bring to light the strengths and weaknesses and the position of the business for competitors. Also, the process could uncover new opportunities that you may contemplate venturing in.\nIt clarifies your target market: The research associated with making a marketing plan helps identify the specific target market depending on various factors, like the nature of products and services. Then, once there is enough light on the business’s potential customers, the marketing team can easily tailor the strategies to find and impress this population.\nA marketing plan helps to compose result-oriented marketing messages: The way that you approach and communicate with your target market matters in a marketing campaign. In this context, the deliberations involved in making the plan help discover the best way to communicate to the target market. In addition, the plan ensures that you come up with messages tailored to the benefits that the products and services are set to offer clients.\nA marketing plan aligns marketing and business goals: Marketing, as a solid business endeavor, is part of the larger business goals. Staying on track regarding these goals becomes easier when you form a complex marketing plan around the business goals. As a result, you can manage to live up to your mission and vision.\nIt helps to come up with better decisions: Business is filled with multiple uncertainties that can sometimes be catastrophic. Equipping yourself with a well-researched marketing plan will ensure that you can handle difficult situations with more courage and assurance. In addition, you can ensure continuity of business by coming up with better decisions because you took your time to plan ahead of time.\nGroud Work for Marketing Plan\nIt would be best to put a lot of thought into creating a marketing plan as it will determine the performance of your business.\nWith that in mind, here are things to think about before you prepare the actual plan:\nBusiness’ current situation\nDefine your products and services and establish the challenges that you are experiencing in reaching your customers. Also, anticipate any challenges that could potentially affect your business shortly.\nEstablish your target market\nEvery successful business out there took time to determine the exact population they wanted to serve. Determining your market starts with establishing the benefit of what you want to put out there and going ahead to analyze the people who need that intervention with the help of target market analysis tools. By defining your market, you will be in a better position to craft compelling content and messages.\nThe next thing you will do is to develop quantifiable goals. The reason for this is so that you can diagnose the progress and effectiveness of your strategies concerning the goals.\nYour tactics should revolve around the best way to reach your customers. If, for example, you are in the real estate field, you might want to consider opening social media pages so that your potential clients can see photos of your properties.\nDetermine the budget\nThe budget that you create needs to be exhaustive. It should capture all project expenses such as logistics, and consultations. However, it is advisable not to hold back on necessary things because creating a marketing plan is critical for success.\nSpell out how you will execute your marketing plan\nRemember that if you have no solid plan to execute your marketing plan, it will not help you achieve the goals you set. Your detailed execution plan should be acceptable to detail. For instance, if you want to publish content on YouTube, spell out information such as recording the videos and the publishing interval. If you want to outsource, capture the fine details of the same. The takeaway here is that your tactics should smoothly integrate into your everyday business activities.\nCreating a Marketing Plan\nA winning marketing plan should be packed with vital information such as the SWOT analysis and an analysis of the main competitors for your business. While what you include in your plan largely depends on your industry and company-specific dynamics, here are the various steps that form a rich marketing plan:\nA good marketing plan kicks off by outlining the company’s mission, vision, and value statements. This is because a good marketing plan must work in line with the essence of the company’s existence. Therefore, this section is critical as it adds a scope, an essence, and a perspective, setting the path for all other sections. Besides, the section gives readers the plan and an idea of the bigger picture to digest the plan more accurately.\nDefine target audience\nWhen you think of a target audience, think of buyer personas. These are research-based, projected representations of who you perceive as your ideal clientele. The main reason for coming up with buyer personas is to help tailor business activities, such as product development, to suit target customers’ needs.\nIf you already have buyer personas when preparing your marketing plan, you may go ahead to use them or update them depending on your research. Some of the information that your buyer personas should capture is demographic details like age and income levels. Your description may list the existing need among the audience, the same gap that your product or service will fill.\nDefine market competition\nNow that you know your market, it is time to bring competitors into the picture. In this segment, you should feature the profiles of the companies that you feel are the most prominent players in your industry. Note that competitors do not come from one direction.\nFor example, one may be competing for a particular keyword on their website while the other may be a well-performing outlet operating in the same locality as your business. When you have a clear view of who you are up against, you can start to develop robust and unique selling points that will give you a good shot at sidelining the other companies.\nDetails about competitors include their leadership and marketing heads, financial outlines, growth rate, best-performing products and services, and their marketing strategies in terms of video, content, and social media postings.\nAssess the current business situation\nDetermining where you stand should entail deep research in several areas. These can be covered by strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, otherwise known as the SWOT analysis. The visualization of this information and sharing it with the building team will help them understand areas to concentrate on. It gives an actionable course of steps based on a realistic approach. The team can understand both the existing and the futuristic environments for business, thereby working around them to optimize business. For instance, you can tell what connections you should seek to improve a fragile area.\nCome up with SMART goals\nThe next step is to define the specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound goals. For example, instead of just noting that you want to increase followers on Twitter, you can note that you want to achieve a minimum of 5,000 followers in 12 months. Only then can you figure out what to do to achieve this. SMART goals set the path for directional methodologies and keep you on a quantifiable path that can measure success.\nPresent your marketing strategy\nThis step requires you to describe the marketing strategies that will help you achieve what you want to achieve. Your marketing plan building team should converge ideas based on data and results regarding what to do, how to do it, and the avenues to utilize.\nThe presentation should include complete visual aids with deadlines, charts, and a tactical roadmap. You may also use a comprehensive yet easy-to-digest infographic or even a mind map. A mind map visually breaks down all the delicate components that come together to form a full-on strategy. Remember to use all the findings from the steps above to develop a realistic, actionable, and detailed strategy to the core.\nAnalyze your tactics\nYou should continue to develop an action-based tactical outline that describes what you need to do to make your strategy work. If your strategy is to raise twitter followers to 5,000 in 12 months, ask yourself what to do to make this projection a reality. For example, how many posts will you be making per day? Will you combine the usage of both videos and images? How many words will be your text-based tweets? Such are the things you should think about when designing this step.\nAllocate a budget\nBudgeting is a crucial part of a marketing plan which needs to be taken with utmost precision. There is no point in setting a paid advertisements tactic if you do not include the exact costs in the budget. Therefore, your team should develop a budget estimate for each little detail concerning the strategies and corresponding tactics. This includes things that will need to be purchased, both from online resources and physical assets.\nMarketing Plan Templates\nCreating a marketing plan is no walk in the park. It involves a lot of visuals, charts, and other forms of presentations that would be hard to create from scratch. That is where we come in. We bring you the best templates that will guide you and simplify your work by a considerable margin.\nThese templates are fully customizable to fit all the needs of your marketing plan design team. With these templates, we will ensure you create an aesthetically appealing, rich, professional marketing plan. Get a freely downloadable marketing plan to revamp your marketing efforts today.\nMarketing plan vs Marketing strategy\nIn simple terms, a marketing strategy is part of a marketing plan. How so?\nA marketing strategy holds information about your company’s methodology of achieving an outlined goal. This type of information can range from the actual campaign, social media channel, software, and success tracking metrics to actualize the strategy. A good example is when your team deliberates on the content to publish on Instagram to achieve a particular number of followers.\nOn the other hand, a marketing plan is a skeleton on which all strategies are built. It holds together all individual marketing strategies in line with the business goals.\nIf, for example, you want people to buy your new products through your website, you can create a marketing plan that encompasses a few strategies. These could be publishing short videos on YouTube or Facebook, utilizing paid ads on other websites, and joining affiliate programs that roll back to the site.\nMany businesses have made losses or fallen due to operating without a well-researched marketing plan. To ensure your business does not become part of that statistic, you need to prioritize building an excellent marketing plan. It provides the path for successfully reaching out to potential customers, impressing them, and making sales. By following the above steps and using free downloadable templates, you will be in an excellent position to create an outstanding marketing plan.\nKeep in mind that you should constantly keep reviewing your initial marketing plan to determine if it is working or not. This means keeping it up to date with changing goals and shifting market dynamics. Such dynamics include the emergence of modern marketing tools, changes in technology, the emergence of a new and vibrant social media platform, changes in pricing due to external or internal factors, and change in supply and demand. An effective way to drive this constant update is by using data analytical tools, sales information, and preset success measuring metrics to discover insights into the plan’s effectiveness, being sure to change approaches that are not working.","Operational and strategic risks on projects\nRisk management is an important component of all project management frameworks and methodologies, so most project managers are well aware of the need to manage risks on their projects. However, most books and training courses offer little or no guidance about the relative importance of different categories of risks. One useful way to look at risks is by whether they pose operational or strategic threats. The former category includes risks that impact project execution and the latter those that affect project goals. A recent paper entitled, Categorising Risks in Seven Large Projects – Which Risks do the Projects Focus On?, looks at how strategic and operational risks are treated in typical, real-life projects. This post is a summary and review of the paper.\nOperational and strategic risks\nFor the purpose of their study, the authors of the paper categorise risks as follows:\n- Operational risk: A risk that affects a project deliverable.\n- Short term strategic risk: A risk that impacts an expected outcome of the project. That is, the results expected directly from a deliverable. For example, an order processing system (deliverable) might be expected to reduce processing time by 50% on average (outcome).\n- Long term strategic risk: A risk that affects the strategic goal that the project is intended to address. For example, an expected strategic outcome of a new order processing system might be to boost sales by 25% over the next 2 years.\nIt is also necessary to define unambiguous criteria by which risks can be assigned to one of the above categories. The authors use the following criteria to classify risks:\n- A risk is an operational risk if it can impact a deliverable that is set out in the project definition (scope document, charter etc.) or delivery contract.\n- A risk is a short-term strategic if it can have an effect on functionality that is not clearly mentioned in the project documentation, but is required in order to achieve the project objectives.\n- A risk is considered to be a long-term strategic if it affects the long-term goals of the project and does not fall into the prior two categories.\nThe authors use the third category as a catch-all bucket for risks that do not fall into the first two categories.\nThe authors collected data from the risk registers of seven large projects. Prior to data collection, the conducted interviews with relevant project personnel to get an understanding of the goals and context of the project. Further interviews were conducted, as needed, mainly to clarify points that came up in the analysis.\nA point to note is that the projects studied were all in progress, but in different phases ranging from initiation to closure.\nResults and discussion\nThe authors’ findings can be summed up in a line: the overwhelming majority of risks were operational. The fraction of risks that were classified as long-term strategic was less than 0.5 % of the total (with over 1300 risks were classified in all).\nWhy is the number of strategic risks so low? The authors offer the following reasons:\n- Strategic risks do not occur while a project is in progress: The authors argue that this is plausible because strategic risks are (or should be) handled prior to a project being given the go-ahead. This makes sense, so in a well-vetted project strategic risks will occur only if there are substantial changes in the hosting organisation and/or its environment.\n- Long term strategic risks are not the project’s responsibility: This is a view taken by most project management methodologies: a project exists only to achieve its stated objectives; its long-term impact is irrelevant. Put another way, the focus is on efficiency, not (organisational) effectiveness (I’ll say more about this in a future post). The authors recommend that project risk managers need to be aware of strategic issues, even though these are traditionally out of the purview of the project. Why? Well, because such issues can have a major impact on how the project is perceived by the organisation.\n- Strategic risks are mainly the asset owner’s (or sponsor’s) responsibility: According to conventional management wisdom strategic risks are the responsibility of management, not the project team. In contrast, the authors suggest that the project team is perhaps better placed to identify some strategic risks long before they come to management’s attention. From personal experience I can vouch that this is true, but would add that it can be difficult to raise awareness of these risks in a politically acceptable way.\nThe main point that the article makes is that strategic risks, though often ignored, can have a huge effect on projects and how they are viewed by the larger organisation. It is therefore in important that these risks are identified and escalated to sponsors and other decision makers in a timely manner. This is a message that organisations would do well to heed, particularly those that have a “shoot the messenger” culture which discourages honest and open communication about such risks."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1bf70a39-25d5-4c4a-8042-bb896ef9a5fc>","<urn:uuid:97a299af-2193-45c7-94f9-8222a34c0c38>"],"error":null}
{"question":"我想了解最常见的几种失智症类型，能简单说明一下吗？","answer":"There are four main types of dementia that account for about 95% of all cases. The most common is Alzheimer's disease (50-60% of cases), followed by vascular dementia, which is caused by blood vessel problems in the brain. The third most common is Lewy body dementia, which resembles Parkinson's disease but begins with dementia symptoms rather than movement issues. Fourth is frontotemporal dementia, which affects behavior and language and is particularly common in people under 65. The remaining 5% consists of hundreds of other rare conditions.","context":["Skip to 0 minutes and 5 secondsDementia is an umbrella term. And it means that it's something that's progressive, so it gets worse over time. And it's neurodegenerative, which is a medical way of saying your brain cells die. So dementia is any disease where your brain cells die more and more over time. There's lots of different types of dementia. And on one level, they're defined by which bit of the brain is being affected. So different bits of our brain do different things. So if the memory bit of your brain is affected by a disease, your memory will get progressively worse but your other skills will stay OK for some time.\nSkip to 0 minutes and 42 secondsIf the back of your brain is affected, that's where we think about vision and where things are in space, then those skills will be affected, but your memory and other skills will stay pretty good. If the front of your brain is affected, your behaviour and your social skills will decline, but your memory might actually be really, really good for some time. So there's lots of different kinds of dementia. They've all got different names. Dementia is just this overarching term that means your brain is declining progressively. By far the most common cause is Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease one specific form of dementia. And it tends to be a problem that starts with memory.\nSkip to 1 minute and 22 secondsAnd over time, one tends to get other things involved, so not just memory, but other bits of thinking. And over time, it becomes more the whole brain, so global cognitive impairment. Probably about 50% or 60% of people have Alzheimer's disease in terms of the whole group of people with dementia. And if you think about the other causes, the next in line, people who develop problems with thinning of their blood vessels, what's called vascular dementia or vascular cognitive impairment. After that is a condition called Lewy body dementia. So that's a condition that looks a bit like Parkinson's disease, but tends to start with dementia rather than starting with changes in movement, slowing of movement that you see in Parkinson's disease.\nSkip to 2 minutes and 9 secondsAnd then fourth in line is frontotemporal dementia, so a condition that is less common as you get older. But it is a condition that affects your behaviour and your language and in a younger age group, so under 65, tends to be almost as common as Alzheimer's disease, so one of the more common types. Those four things together probably account for somewhere around 95% of all causes of dementia. And then that 5% is lots of other things, so probably hundreds of other things which are all relatively rare, but can cause this acquired progressive problem in your thinking and behaviour.\nWhat is dementia?\nWatch Dr Susie Henley and Dr Jon Rohrer describe what dementia is, how it relates to Alzheimer’s disease, and how these conditions affect the brain.\n- Dementia is an umbrella term for a number of different diseases that affect the brain in different ways.\n- Dementia is defined as a disease that is progressive (it gets worse over time), affects more than one aspect of thinking (for example, memory, language, behaviour, visual processing) and is severe enough to affect everyday life.\n- It’s estimated that there are over 850,000 people with dementia in the UK.\n- Dementia doesn’t just affect the person with dementia, it affects the people around them; their family and friends.\n- In this course we cover 4 less common forms of dementia and explore how they help us understand more common forms.\n- Dementia is becoming increasingly recognised as a priority for health and social care, and for research.\nNext we move on to look at familial Alzheimer’s disease, but before that please complete the short survey on the next step to help us understand who’s taking the course.\n© UCL 2016 - CC BY 4.0"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ac1af4b3-57d6-4f9b-b103-34ad3341b219>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What were Elvin Jones' contributions to the John Coltrane Quartet, and how did these manifest in the album A Love Supreme?","answer":"Elvin Jones was a crucial member of the John Coltrane Quartet from 1960 to 1966, serving as the drummer alongside Jimmy Garrison on bass and McCoy Tyner on piano. His innovative drumming style was particularly evident in A Love Supreme, recorded in December 1964 at Van Gelder Studio. Jones helped redefine the concept of 'swing' in jazz during this period, and he and Coltrane would often perform extended duet passages. His distinctive drumming can be heard from the very beginning of the album, where he opens with cymbal washes following the initial gong strike in the 'Acknowledgement' movement. His polyrhythmic style and free-flowing approach brought the drumset to the foreground, earning him recognition from Life Magazine as 'the world's greatest rhythmic drummer.'","context":["Elvin Ray Jones (September 9, 1927 – May 18, 2004) was an American jazz drummer of the post-bop era. He showed an interest in drums at a young age, watching the circus bands march by his family's home in Pontiac, Michigan.\nJones in 1976\n|Birth name||Elvin Ray Jones|\nSeptember 9, 1927|\nPontiac, Michigan, U.S.\n|Died||May 18, 2004\nEnglewood, New Jersey\nHe served in the United States Army from 1946 to 1949 and subsequently played in a Detroit house band led by Billy Mitchell. He moved to New York City in 1955 and worked as a sideman for Charles Mingus, Teddy Charles, Bud Powell and Miles Davis.\nFrom 1960 to 1966 he was a member of the John Coltrane quartet (along with Jimmy Garrison on bass and McCoy Tyner on piano), a celebrated recording phase, appearing on such albums as A Love Supreme. Following his work with Coltrane, Jones led several small groups, some under the name The Elvin Jones Jazz Machine. His brothers Hank Jones and Thad Jones were also jazz musicians with whom he recorded. He was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1995.\nElvin Jones was born in Pontiac, Michigan to parents Henry and Olivia Jones, who had moved to Michigan from Vicksburg, Mississippi. His brothers, Hank Jones and Thad Jones, both became important jazz musicians. By age two, he said he knew he held a fascination for drums. He would watch the circus marching band parades go by his home as a boy, particularly fascinated by the drummers. Following his early passion, Elvin joined his high school's black marching band, where he developed his foundation in rudiments. Jones began service in the United States Army in 1946. He was discharged in 1949, and returned home penniless. Jones said he borrowed $35 from his sister when he got back to buy his first drumset (US$352 in 2016 dollars).\nJones began his professional career in 1949 with a short-lived gig in Detroit's Grand River Street club. Eventually he went on to play with artists such as Miles Davis and Wardell Gray. In 1955, after a failed audition for the Benny Goodman band, he found work in New York City, joining Charles Mingus's band, and releasing a record called '\"Blue Moods\" on Debut records .\n1960–1966: John Coltrane and beyondEdit\nIn 1960, he joined the classic John Coltrane Quartet, which also included bassist Jimmy Garrison and pianist McCoy Tyner. Jones and Coltrane often played extended duet passages. This band is widely considered to have redefined \"swing\" (the rhythmic feel of jazz) in much the same way that Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, and others did during earlier stages of jazz's development. He stayed with Coltrane until 1966. By that time, Jones was not entirely comfortable with Coltrane's new direction and his polyrhythmic style clashed with the \"multidirectional\" approach of the group's second drummer, Rashied Ali.\nJones remained active after leaving the Coltrane group, and led several bands in the late sixties and seventies that are considered highly influential groups. Notable among them was a trio formed with saxophonist and multi-instrumentalist Joe Farrell and (ex-Coltrane) bassist Jimmy Garrison, with whom he recorded the Blue Note album Puttin' It Together. Jones recorded extensively for Blue Note under his own name in the late sixties and early seventies, with groups that featured prominent as well as up and coming greats. The two-volume Live at the Lighthouse showcases a 21- and 26-year-old Steve Grossman and Dave Liebman, respectively. Jones played on many significant albums of the modal jazz era, such as The Real McCoy with McCoy Tyner and saxophonist Wayne Shorter's Speak No Evil. Other musicians of note who made significant contributions to Jones's music during this period were baritone saxophonist Pepper Adams, tenor saxophonists George Coleman and Frank Foster, trumpeter Lee Morgan, bassist Gene Perla, keyboardist Jan Hammer and jazz–world music group Oregon.\nElvin Jones' sense of timing, polyrhythms, dynamics, timbre, and legato phrasing brought the drumset to the foreground. Jones was touted by Life Magazine as \"the world's greatest rhythmic drummer\", and his free-flowing style was a major influence on many leading drummers, including Christian Vander, Mitch Mitchell (whom Jimi Hendrix called \"my Elvin Jones\"), Ginger Baker and Janet Weiss.\nIn 1999, Jones worked with Our Lady Peace on their album Happiness...Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch. He was featured playing drums on the song \"Stealing Babies\", which was also featured on their 2009 compilation album The Very Best of Our Lady Peace.\nJones performed and recorded with his own group, the Elvin Jones Jazz Machine, whose line up changed through the years. Sonny Fortune and Ravi Coltrane, John Coltrane's son, both played saxophone with the Jazz Machine in the early 1990s, appearing together with Jones on In Europe on Enja Records in 1991. Jones, who taught regularly, often took part in clinics, played in schools, and gave free concerts in prisons. His lessons emphasized music history as well as drumming technique.\nElvin Jones died of heart failure in Englewood, New Jersey on May 18, 2004. He was survived by his first wife Shirley and his second, albeit common-law, wife Keiko (Elvin married Keiko before divorcing Shirley, meaning that legally he and Keiko were not married), in addition to his son Elvin Nathan Jones of California and daughter Rose-Marie Rosie Jones of Sweden.\n- Yanow, Scott. \"Elvin Jones\".

Records in February 1965. It is generally considered to be among Coltrane's greatest works, as it melded the hard bop sensibilities of his early career with the modal jazz and free jazz styles he adopted later.\nThe quartet recorded the album in one session on December 9, 1964, at the Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. Coltrane's home in Dix Hills, Long Island, has been suggested as the site of inspiration for A Love Supreme.\nThe album is a four-part suite, broken up into tracks: \"Acknowledgement\" (which contains the mantra that gave the suite its name), \"Resolution\", \"Pursuance\", and \"Psalm.\" It is intended to be a spiritual album, broadly representative of a personal struggle for purity, and expresses the artist's deep gratitude as he admits to his talent and instrument as being owned not by him but by a spiritual higher power.\nThe album begins with the bang of a gong (tam-tam), followed by cymbal washes. Jimmy Garrison follows on bass with the four-note motif which structures the entire movement. Coltrane's solo follows. Besides soloing upon variations of the motif, at one point Coltrane repeats the four notes over and over in different modulations. After many repetitions, the motif becomes the vocal chant \"A Love Supreme\", sung by Coltrane (accompanying himself via overdubs).\nIn the final movement, Coltrane performs what he calls a \"musical narration\" (Lewis Porter describes it as a \"wordless 'recitation'\") of a devotional poem he included in the liner notes. That is, Coltrane \"plays\" the words of the poem on saxophone, but does not actually speak them. Some scholars have suggested that this performance is a homage to the sermons of African-American preachers. The poem (and, in his own way, Coltrane's solo) ends with the cry \"Elation. Elegance. Exaltation. All from God. Thank you God. Amen.\"\nReception and influence\n|All About Jazz||favorable|\n|The Sydney Morning Herald||favorable|\n|The Village Voice||favorable|\nA Love Supreme is often listed amongst the greatest jazz albums of all time. It was also quite popular for a jazz album, selling about 500,000 copies by 1970, a number far exceeding Coltrane's typical Impulse! sales of around 30,000. As further testimony to the recording's historic significance, the manuscript for the album is one of the National Museum of American History's \"Treasures of American History,\" part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.\nIn 1994, A Love Supreme was ranked number three in Colin Larkin's Top 100 Jazz Albums. Larkin described it as \"one of the most profoundly moving records in all of jazz\". In 2003, the album was ranked number 47 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The publication called it a \"legendary album-long hymn of praise\" and stated: \"the indelible four-note theme of the first movement, 'Acknowledgement,' is the humble foundation of the suite. But Coltrane's majestic, often violent blowing (famously described as 'sheets of sound') is never self-aggrandizing. Aloft with his classic quartet..., Coltrane soars with nothing but gratitude and joy. You can't help but go with him.\"\nThe Penguin Guide to Jazz selected this album as part of its suggested \"Core Collection\" and awarded it a \"crown\" stating that \"it is without precedent and parallel, and though it must also be one of the best loved jazz records of all time it somehow remains remote from critical pigeonholing\" calling it \"immensely concentrated and rich.\"\nThe album's influence has been extensive and diverse. Musicians ranging from tenor Joshua Redman to the rock star Bono of U2, who mentions the album in their song \"Angel of Harlem\", have singled out the influence of the album on their own work. Guitarists John McLaughlin and Carlos Santana have each credited the album as one of their greatest early influences. \"Every so often this ceases to be a jazz record and is more avant-garde contemporary classical,\" remarked Neil Hannon, frontman of The Divine Comedy. \"I love the combination of abstract piano that's all sort of 'clang', and weird chords with wailing saxophone over the top.\"\nAn alternative version of \"Acknowledgement\" was recorded the next day on December 10. This version, which included tenor saxophonist Archie Shepp and bassist Art Davis, did not feature Coltrane chanting \"a love supreme,\" one reason he chose to issue the quartet version.\nThe only live performance of the \"Love Supreme\" suite, from a July 26, 1965, performance at the Festival Mondial du Jazz Antibes, Juan-les-Pins, France, was also remastered and released in a 2002 two-CD set by Impulse! Records with the original album and additional studio outtakes.\nDoug and Jean Carn recorded \"Acknowledgement\" with female vocals for their 1972 album Infant Eyes. John McLaughlin and Carlos Santana recorded a guitar version of \"Acknowledgement,\" which they titled \"A Love Supreme\" on their 1973 collaboration Love Devotion Surrender. At the time, both were devotees of guru Sri Chinmoy.\nWill Downing released an R&B cover version of the main theme, with the co-operation of John's widow Alice Coltrane, which reached number fourteen in the UK singles chart in 1988. Gumball recorded a rock/alternative/jazz version[clarification needed] of A Love Supreme as a bonus track on the 1994 Japanese release of Revolution On Ice. The suite also forms four tracks on the 2002 Branford Marsalis Quartet album titled Footsteps of our Fathers, and another Marsalis version is on a DVD \"A Love Supreme Live in Amsterdam.\" Branford's brother Wynton recorded the suite in 2003 with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra.\nSections of the suite have been performed by the David Murray Octet, the Ballistic Brothers, and the Bob Mintzer Big Band. Turtle Island String Quartet released their album A Love Supreme in 2007, and the album features a cover version of the suite, along with other covers of various Coltrane charts.\nIn 2007 José James recorded \"Equinox\" and \"Resolution\"' as a double A-Side limited-edition 10\" for Brownswood Records. James, previously a rapper, added vocals to the tracks in a style reminiscent to some[according to whom?] of Gil Scott Heron.\nAll tracks composed by John Coltrane and published by Jowcol Music (BMI)\n- Side one\n|1.||December 9, 1964||90243||Part 1: \"Acknowledgement\"||7:47|\n|2.||December 9, 1964||90244‒7||Part 2: \"Resolution\"||7:22|\n- Side two\n|3.||December 9, 1964||90245‒1||Part 3: \"Pursuance\"/Part 4: \"Psalm\"||17:53|\n- Disc one\n|1.||December 9, 1964||90243||Part 1: \"Acknowledgement\"||7:43|\n|2.||December 9, 1964||90244‒7||Part 2: \"Resolution\"||7:20|\n|3.||December 9, 1964||90245‒1||Part 3: \"Pursuance\"||10:42|\n|4.||December 9, 1964||90245‒1||Part 4: \"Psalm\"||7:05|\n- Disc two\n|1.||July 26, 1965||n/a||Introduction by Andre Francis||1:13|\n|2.||July 26, 1965||n/a||\"Acknowledgement\" (Live)||6:11|\n|3.||July 26, 1965||n/a||\"Resolution\" (Live)||11:36|\n|4.||July 26, 1965||n/a||\"Pursuance\" (Live)||21:30|\n|5.||July 26, 1965||n/a||\"Psalm\" (Live)||8:49|\n|6.||December 9, 1964||90244‒4||\"Resolution\" (Alternate take)||7:25|\n|7.||December 9, 1964||90244‒6||\"Resolution\" (Breakdown)||2:13|\n|8.||December 10, 1964||90246‒1||\"Acknowledgement\" (Alternate take)||9:09|\n|9.||December 10, 1964||90246‒2||\"Acknowledgement\" (Alternate take)||9:22|\n- The John Coltrane Quartet\n- John Coltrane – bandleader, liner notes, vocals, soprano and tenor saxophone\n- Jimmy Garrison – double bass\n- Elvin Jones – drums\n- McCoy Tyner – piano\n- Additional musicians\n- Art Davis – double bass on alternate takes of \"Acknowledgement\"\n- Archie Shepp – tenor saxophone on alternate takes of \"Acknowledgement\"\n- George Gray/Viceroy – cover design\n- Victor Kalin – illustration\n- Joe Lebow – liner design\n- Bob Thiele – production and cover photo\n- Rudy Van Gelder – engineering and mastering\n- Compact Disc reissue\n- Joe Alper – photography\n- Jason Claiborne – graphics\n- Hollis King – art direction\n- Erick Labson – digital remastering\n- Lee Tanner – photography\n- Deluxe edition\n- Michael Cuscuna – liner notes, production, and remastering\n- Ken Druker – production\n- Esmond Edwards – photography\n- Ashley Kahn – liner notes and production\n- Peter Keepnews – notes editing\n- Hollis King – art direction\n- Bryan Koniarz – production\n- Edward O'Dowd – design\n- Mark Smith – production assistance\n- Sherniece Smith – art coordination and production\n- Chuck Stewart – photography\n- Bill Levenson – reissue supervisor\n- Cameron Mizell – production coordination\n- Kevin Reeves – mastering\n- Ron Warwell – design\n- Isabelle Wong – package design\n- A Love Supreme from Verve Music Group\n- Kahn 2002\n- Porter, 231–249.

{"question":"I'm studying contemporary art exhibitions - how do the Joshua Liner Gallery and Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis differ in their mission to engage audiences?","answer":"The Joshua Liner Gallery aims to expose audiences to a specific segment of contemporary art practice rooted in classical traditions, showcasing artists who maintain traditional techniques while reinterpreting them through modern social and visual culture. The Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis, on the other hand, takes a broader approach by actively engaging diverse audiences to challenge their perceptions through contemporary visual culture, offering dynamic exhibitions and educational initiatives that contribute to the global cultural landscape.","context":["Joshua Liner Gallery is pleased to present Resolve, an exhibition of twenty-five emerging and established artists whose work is rooted in classical art traditions and training. In rendering the figure, still life, or landscape subject, this illustrious group (including twenty-two painters, two sculptors, and one photographer) expresses a collective interest in classical art forms with a variety of distinct and decidedly contemporary voices. As the first in a series of annual artist-curated exhibitions at Joshua Liner Gallery, Resolve is organized by gallery artist Tony Curanaj and includes works by the following artists:\nAnthony Waichulis, Brad Kunkle, Christopher Gallego, Dan Thompson, David Kassan, Edward Minoff, Graydon Parrish, Jacob Collins, Jacob A. Pfeiffer, Jefferson Hayman, Jeremy Mann, Kate Lehman, Kim Cogan Kris Kuksi, Kris Lewis, Lee Misenheimer, Michael Grimaldi, Rob Leecock, Scott Waddell, Shawn Smith, Shawn Barber, Steven Assael, Tony Curanaj, Travis Schlaht, Will Wilson\nThough considered divergent from the postwar developments of Pop, Conceptual, and Minimalist art (among others), the curriculum of classical art training—with its emphasis on skill and the realistic depiction of the figure, still life, and landscape—has nevertheless continued to evolve through the interests and talents of contemporary artists. Creating on the fringes of graduate-school art programs and modern art theory, these intrepid practitioners of traditional art forms and techniques have kept them alive and vibrant, while reinterpreting them through the social and visual culture of their time.\nSuch influences as Van Eyck, Caravaggio, and Rembrandt, as well as Klimt, Degas, and the pre- Raphaelites, to name but a few, can be discerned in many of the figure and portrait paintings and drawings collected here. The gestures, settings, and mood, however, are entirely of the moment, emphasizing the evergreen nature of classical training and its capacity to adapt to whatever arises, from tattoo culture to contemporary graphic design. Vestiges of Turner, Eakins, and other masters are also apparent in the landscape and figurative works included, but elsewhere one can see the boundary-pushing daring of more recent and contemporary figures such as Andrew Wyeth, Antonio López García, and Odd Nerdrum.\nAmong the painters featured, all work in traditional media, most employing oils or egg tempera on canvas, linen, or panel. The sculptors choose from more unorthodox materials, such as toy figurines and dyed blocks of wood, while continuing a dialogue with their time through the tools and history of realism. The founders, teachers, or graduates of such influential institutions as the Water Street Atelier, Grand Central Academy of Art, New York Academy of Art, Ani Art Academy, and Janus Collaborative School of Art are included in the exhibition. In their masterful hands, the tendency toward realism serves a fresh, new generation of artists in capturing their disparate worlds, lives, and vision.\nAccording to curator-artist Tony Curanaj: “This exhibition of colleagues and influences reflects a relatively narrow but varied slice of the art world, and presents it to an audience that may not be exposed to this segment of contemporary art practice. The title Resolve speaks of their determination and progression, qualities that imbue each of these works with beauty and technical virtuosity. From concept to execution, these contemporary masters of their craft are completely engaged in the artist’s process and an artistic direction that is unwavering, regardless of fashion or trend.”","Green Air, Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis CAM, Missouri Gallery, Exhibition USA\nGreen Air, Contemporary Art Museum of Saint Louis\nKinetic Living Sculpture in Missouri, USA – design by Nomad Studio\n22 Aug 2016\nGreen Air installation at Contemporary Art Museum of Saint Louis\nDesign: Nomad Studio, landscape architecture\nContemporary Art Museum of Saint Louis. Summer 2016\nGreen Air, a kinetic living sculpture\nDesigned by landscape architecture firm Nomad Studio, Green Air is the second installation of a play in two acts at the Contemporary Art Museum of Saint Louis. Green Air is a sculptural aerial garden that creates a dialogue in form, material, time, and space with the previous intervention, Green Varnish.\nConceived as a living, kinetic sculpture nested within the courtyard of the Contemporary Art Museum of Saint Louis, Green Air proposes an immersive space, a hanging garden that floats above a tapestry of ever changing shadows.\nGreen Air is the second act of a broad exploration that started in 2015 with Green Varnish, a monumental green fabric composed of thousands of succulent plants that symbolically covered all the inconvenient facts of our lifestyle. The installation was carefully deconstructed last fall and its components were reutilized to build Green Air, creating a continuity and dialogue between the two pieces and the people who experience them.\nFor the second act, the space was modeled as the inverse of Green Varnish, both in form and intention. What was a solid piece anchored to the ground plane, is now a dispersed fluid volume suspended from an elevated plane. What was hidden is now exposed, hovering overhead, inviting us for an urgent reflection upon the contrast between the dynamic and static in natural and man-made systems.\nGreen Air is a space in and of itself, a systematic yet delicate arrangement of Tillandsias, hanging from thousands of slices of repurposed wood, suspended from the courtyard’s steel canopy, moving as a supraorganism. The installation has a powerful transformational impact on the courtyard at the heart of the Museum, as the sculpture hangs above the heads of visitors, swaying organically in the breeze, and sketching linear shadows on the courtyard’s ground plane.\nAbout Nomad Studio\nNomad Studio, founded in 2009 by William E.

{"question":"What are the benefits of planting organic flowers for pollinators, and what health risks do pesticides pose to these beneficial insects?","answer":"Planting organic flowers benefits pollinators by providing safe forage, as organic plants are free from toxic pesticide treatments that can poison pollen. Even plants marked 'bee friendly' may have been treated with pesticides, so buying organic seeds and plants is the only guaranteed way to provide safe food for pollinators. Regarding health risks, pesticides can kill bees directly when they eat or land on treated plants, and foraging bees can carry pesticides back to their hives, threatening entire colonies. Some researchers believe pesticide use may be linked to honey bee colony collapse disorder. Additionally, most insecticides are toxic to beneficial insects, bees and other pollinators, with residues potentially remaining in soil and water for weeks to over a year.","context":["If you drive through California’s central valley in the next month, you will see and smell the incredible expanses of almond blooms. Carson & Bees is pollinating orchards in Williams, which helps the business and also helps the hives bulk up for the coming spring and summer honey-making season.\nHere’s a funny and timely article about the different pronunciations of California’s favorite nut: http://kvpr.org/post/i-say-almond-you-say-am-end-whos-right\nWe get a lot of questions about the quality of honey sold in grocery stores, and also people wondering why we charge so much more than what you can buy in a store. Here’s an interesting article on honey adulteration to answer some of those common questions:\nIt’s also worth noting that California honey tends to be more expensive than other regions of the country since we get so little rain in late spring and summer. Rain = flower nectar = honey production.\nCascadian Farms is the organic branch of General Mills, which represents 3% of the company’s total sales. Although as a major food producer General Mills uses a lot of pesticide – which has been directly linked to declining pollinator populations – a new campaign started by the Cascadian Farm branch called “Bee Friendlier” is an encouraging step in the right direction.\nAlthough the #1 thing you can do to help pollinators is plant flowers, they have to be organic! These days most everything is treated – often at the seed level – with pesticide. The pollen the bees gather is poisoned by the pesticide the plant’s seed was rolled in (or sprayed in the large warehouse nursery where it was born). The only surefire way to help and not further hinder pollinators is to plant seeds whose packaging clearly states that zero treatment has been applied.\nIt’s easy to demonize companies like General Mills for being huge food conglomerates that use pesticides, pay low wages, and destroy the land. But GM and companies like it are products of society, and they directly reflect consumer’s demands: Americans want abundant and cheap food, so the current food system is built accordingly. Now, however, we’re taking a collective pause to reexamine the implications of valuing cost over everything else, and there’s a slow but steady sea change happening.\nThis “bee friendlier” campaign is a part of that sea change. And so are we! Each of us decides what the system looks like based on where we spend our money. In Ukiah we’re blessed with a year-round farmers’ market, a socially conscious co-op, and a Friedman’s that carries organic seeds. If you could spend 10% of your food budget on local producers, plus a few dollars a year to plant organic flower seeds, you’ll make a bigger impact than you realize on the food system AND the health of your friendly backyard pollinators.\nIt’s no secret that bees are in trouble. All around the world, people are mobilizing to try to do something about it: hundreds of studies and thousands of people are focusing on how to help alleviate the stresses that are causing native and commercial bees alike to die off in alarming numbers. Europe has taken an important step in banning neonicotinoid pesticides, but here in the U.S. we aren’t doing as well. To wit:\nPesticide giant Syngenta just asked the EPA to raise the “acceptable” level for neonic residues by 40,000%. Say what??\nSyngenta is arguing that they need the increase so they can spray it rather than coat the seed in it, which might actually be good for bees – seed treatments affect the entire plant, whereas sprays “should” stick to the leaf. The big caveat here is that, for this to actually work for bees, it couldn’t be administered when the crop was flowering, nor while any other plant was flowering nearby. I personally have zero confidence in that scenario playing out – what does a Big Ag farmer care about some weeds flowering in his ditches? (Not to mention these crops are often sprayed while flowering anyway, despite very clear labels prohibiting it.)\nSo, what can we do? Three things.\n1) Submit a public comment to the EPA. Go here: http://www.regulations.gov, and in the search field enter the docket number EPA–HQ–OPP–2014–0008. Several seemingly identical search results are returned; click “comment now” on the uppermost one. The comment period closes on October 6.\n3) Buy organic seeds and plants. These days, even plants marked “bee friendly” are likely to have been treated with a pesticide, which creates toxic pollen. The only surefire way to provide SAFE forage is to buy organic.\nThanks for everything you do to help our pollinators!\nDid you know that June 16-22 is National Pollinator Week? It began seven years ago by a proclamation from the U.S. Congress, and is organized by the Pollinator Partnership. It is used as a time to bring awareness to bees, birds, butterflies, and bats.\nHere’s a fun fact: there are over 25,000 species of bees in the world. Most of them are solitary and live in the ground, making the honey bee’s “superorganism” style of living collectively rather rare. Here’s a sad fact: pretty much all of them are threatened.\nIn honor of pollinator week, we invite you to find a moment this weekend to stop and watch a bee at work. Find a flowery area and look closely at all the activity; you might be surprised by how many different types of bees you’ll see on the same bush.\nAlso, Carson & Bees will be giving out free sunflower seed packets – pollinated by our bees last year! – at the Redwood Valley Farmers Market this Sunday, June 22, from 9:30-12:30 at Lion’s Park. Come say hello.\nOn this gorgeous mother’s day, we here at Carson & Bees are moved by the flowers in bloom. With spring in full force there’s no time like the present to think about what bees and other pollinators eat, and that it’s all of our jobs to feed them.\nThere’s a wonderful blog called Honey Bee Suite. Blogmaster/beekeeper Rusty frequently posts about attracting pollinators to your yard, and I’m reposting one of those here. She disseminates her impressive knowledge in easy-to-digest and often humorous posts, so if you enjoy reading about bees I highly recommend you mosey on over to her side of the web.\nHere are fifteen easy ways to assure you will have a plentiful supply of pollinators all season long.\nPlant clover in your lawn. White Dutch clover planted in your lawn will attract dozens of pollinators. In addition, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen into a form the grass can use, resulting in a beautiful green lawn without the use of chemical fertilizers.\nPlant at least some native species. Native plants attract native pollinators. Check with your local extension office if you are unsure of what is native.\nPlant herbs. Herbs, especially those in the mint family, are very attractive to pollinators. This family includes thyme, oregano, sage, basil, peppermint, lavender, catnip and rosemary. As an added bonus, you get to use the herbs yourself.\nSelect plants with a wide range of bloom times. Native bees need food from spring until fall so plan to have something in bloom all season long.\nPlant larval host plants. Some plants are not considered especially attractive in the garden but are necessary to certain species of pollinators. Milkweed, for instance, is vital to the larval stages of Monarch butterflies. Plant them in an inconspicuous place if you prefer, but have them available for the pollinators.\nAvoid hybrid varieties. Many flowers that have been bread for beauty have lost the nectar or pollen that made them valuable to pollinators. Plants with double or triple rings of petals, or plants with unusual colors or variegated patterns are probably over-hybridized.\nLeave open patches of mud. Many ground-nesting bees need open patches of mud for their homes or for building materials.\nProvide a water source. It doesn’t need to be large or fancy. Just a wet spot under the end of a hose can help the insects.\nAvoid excessive mulch. Too much mulch blocks entry to the ground. Ground-burrowing insects often cannot penetrate a heavy layer of mulch.\nAdd sea salt or wood ash to a bare patch of earth. Pollinators are often seen collecting minerals from salty or ashy areas. Your patch needn’t be large and it shouldn’t be overworked. If the insects need it, they will find it.\nProvide nesting sites. Collections of reeds or holes drilled in blocks of wood provide great nesting sites. Tubes or blocks should be replaced periodically to limit disease build-up.\nLeave dead trees and reeds standing. If a dead tree can safely be allowed to stand, it should be left as habit for bees, birds, and small rodents. Dead and standing reeds are a favorite of wild bees.\nLeave an unmowed patch of grass and weeds in a protected spot. Tall grass provides protection, shade, and hunting grounds for many species of pollinators. Some pollinators—such as hover flies—feed on insects as well as nectar, so they do best in a place that provides an alternate food source.\nPut a flower pot on every porch . . . and encourage your friends to do the same. The more plants that are available, the healthier our pollinators will be.\nUse no pesticides. Until we reduce dependence on pesticides, items 1-14 are all for naught.","The Grow Smart, Grow Safe® consumer guide to lawn and garden products is a project of Thurston County Environmental Health in Olympia, Washington. The information below comes directly from the Grow Smart, Grow Safe website.\nHow can we reduce the danger of pesticides?\nIncreasing the demand for safer products will encourage manufacturers to make products that are safer and more environmentally sound. You can have an attractive landscape without using hazardous pesticides. Use effective non-chemical methods and less-hazardous products instead.\nLearn about pesticide ratings, how to choose safer products, and ways to care for your lawn and garden naturally at growsmartgrowsafe.org.\nPesticides, human health and the environment\nPesticides include some of the most hazardous chemicals commonly used in and around the home. Products that kill insects, weeds, bacteria and fungi may be hazardous to children, pets, birds, fish, other wildlife, and also to beneficial insects like bees and lady bugs. Pesticides used in the yard or at the workplace can be carried inside on shoes and work clothes and mix with house dust. Young children, who crawl on the ground and put objects in their mouths, can then ingest the chemicals. Rain and irrigation wash pesticides off of yards and carry them to streams, sometimes in amounts that can harm salmon or the aquatic organisms that are their food.\nPesticides and children\nIn 2009, United States poison centers had over 90,000 incidents related to acute exposures to pesticides - about 45% involved children under the age of six. Children are vulnerable to repeated, very small, unintended exposure to pesticides. Per pound of body weight, pesticides have a greater effect on children’s growing bodies and developing nervous and hormonal systems and organs.\nDanger to pets\nMany pesticide products are toxic to dogs, cats and other pets. The risks can be similar to the human health risks. Pets with access to treated landscapes may pick up pesticide residues on their paws and fur, licking it or tracking it into the house. Slug bait containing metaldehyde poses a special risk because dogs are attracted to it and may eat enough to be seriously injured or even die.\nToxicity to birds and bees\nMost insecticides are toxic to beneficial insects, bees and other pollinators, and some insecticides are toxic to birds. Insecticides can kill bees directly when they eat or even just land on treated plants. Foraging bees can carry pesticides back to their hives, threatening the entire colony. Some researchers believe that pesticide use may be implicated in honey bee colony collapse disorder.\nMany insecticides and herbicides are toxic to fish, amphibians and other aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms come into contact with pesticides and fertilizers through irrigation or stormwater runoff from yards and other landscapes. Pesticide ingredients that don’t bind well to soil and are persistent in the environment pose the greatest risk to water pollution. Monitoring studies in the Puget Sound region have found common pesticides and fertilizer nutrients in many of our waterways.\nThe longer a pesticide remains in the environment, the more likely it is to do damage.

Many modern pesticides breakdown faster, however most pesticides are not gone after a month or two, and may not be harmless just because the treated area has dried.

{"question":"How does Kanban help organize business tasks, and what security measures are used to protect access to sensitive information in genetic databases?","answer":"Kanban helps organize business tasks through a system of cards and boards where each card represents a single task and boards represent stages of work (like 'To Do, Doing, Done'). It can be used at both Portfolio and Team levels - Portfolio Kanban for strategic priorities and Team Kanban for departmental tasks. For genetic databases, security is maintained through password protection, access control systems that compare third party requests with pre-specified access rights, and the patient's ability to define specific conditions under which third parties can access their genetic information. The system ensures that tests can only be performed when properly authorized by comparing the type of test desired with the access rights entered by the patient.","context":["With Northern Ireland aiming to lead the way as a European center for business, it behooves leaders from startups to the largest corporations to improve their level of organization. Being able to think through ideas to formulate effective strategies that will take their businesses forward powerfully is important to decisively drive growth. That’s the strength of Kanban.\nIt Starts at the Top\nDeveloping goals and executing strategies for the business often begins with the CEO and then moves down through the organizational structure. One of the biggest problems for companies is effectively communicating the mission and goals of the organization.\nMany times, a mission statement is written and then largely ignored. However, for companies that are focused on staying maximally organized to push through significant growth rates via efficient operations to increase their ROI, strategy matters. Without it, companies roll along rudderless which ultimately means they’re likely to run aground.\nKanban is an organizational system that uses cards for tasks and boards to organize stages of work. Typically, a single card is used for one task. One or more people may be assigned to that card which indicates who is responsible for the task’s completion. Due dates and other notations may be included with the task too.\nWhen you learn Kanban, you’ll discover through kanban articles that software packages provide a way to add images, video clips and other attachments to a card to help group together resources about the individual task.\nEach Kanban board usually represents a stage of work. A simple layout may be: To Do, Doing, and Done. Each card will sit on one of these three boards representing all the individual tasks. Some will be awaiting work, a few will be a work in progress, and others, already completed.\nLevel of Customization with Kanban Boards\nKanbanize offer software to make it easier to manage multiple boards wherever you are. A collection of kanban boards doesn’t need to just be ‘To Do, Doing and Done’ either. There can be more boards which can be labeled however you see fit. Their ‘drag and drop’ feature seamlessly lets users move cards from one board to another.\nIn most cases, the boards are used to track progress across a group of tasks. However, anyone is free to use the Kanban system in a way that helps them stay optimally organized without judgement. Typically, a board is set up for a team on a group project, or for a manager or a CEO. Handling the collective responsibilities and assigning them using solid task management principals becomes easier with this system.\nYou can learn Kanban with these resources if you want to create a custom Kanban board setup to suit your organizational requirements.\nThinking Big Picture\nFor CEOs, they usually fail when they have great ideas but don’t manage to implement them successfully throughout the organization. They must decide on the broad mandate for what needs to get done, decide on a course of action, and break this down into individual responsibilities for each manager.\nDepending on the type of business and level of experience of each manager, the CEO may or may not provide guidance for how each aspect of the broader strategy is to be handled. For instance, a planned streamlining of the product range from 250 SKUs to 150 SKUs will require buy-in from multiple departments. While the CEO may offer guidance about how to go about whittling down the number of products to a more manageable amount, he or she is unlikely to specify which products to remove.\nPortfolio Kanban vs Team Kanban\nCEOs can use both Portfolio Kanban and Team Kanban within their organization. Think of Portfolio Kanban as a hierarchical structure with Team Kanban being for departments or teams to work on individual tasks.\nFor instance, the CEO is going to have a Portfolio Kanban set up where they include strategic priorities for the business. These, in turn, will fall to individual department managers (sometimes several per priority) who each have a Portfolio Kanban of their own. The individual managers will also have a Team Kanban board that covers what tasks their team is responsible for.\nThe reason for the separation between Portfolio Kanban and Team Kanban is simple enough. At the Portfolio level, the CEO and other managers need to see the big picture position about different parts of the business or responsibilities under their management.\nThe CEO doesn’t need or wish to view the individual tasks being completed by an ordering clerk in the purchasing department. What they’re looking to do is push through initiatives to make purchasing more efficient and reduce wasted time; not get involved with the minutia of the ordering process with tasks related to it.\nWhen businesses are well organized, CEOs can keep centered on their strategic initiatives, what action is required, the managers who have been assigned responsibility for initiatives, and the milestones to achieve. The tasks are completed at the Team Kanban level, but managed at the Portfolio Kanban level. This keeps the organization moving forward in the right direction based on the CEO’s strategic objectives.","US 7844469 B2\nA genetic banking system allows the ability to securely store genetic profile data while allowing access to individuals authorized to access the profile for authorized purposes.\n1.

No. 10/691,205 filed Oct. 21, 2003, now abandoned, entitled “GENETIC PROFILING AND BANKING SYSTEM AND METHOD,” which was a continuation of U.S. Pat. No. 6,640,211 filed Oct. 22, 1999, entitled “GENETIC PROFILING AND BANKING SYSTEM AND METHOD,” the contents of each application is hereby incorporated by reference.\nThis invention relates to a system for profiling and banking genetic information about individuals.\nGenetic information derived from a sample can be used to determine medical and other information about an individual. Obtaining genetic samples and testing those samples raises concerns about privacy, access, and the use of the resulting information. Such information could, however, be useful for individuals and medical practitioners.\nCurrently there are companies that provide banking services for storing physical samples of genetic material from biological tissue, such as blood or cheek cells. That material can be retrieved from storage and tested as desired. Removing the sample and having it tested is time consuming and may be repetitive if multiple tests are needed over time.\nThe present invention includes systems and methods for storing and accessing genetic information. The systems and methods preferably provide protection against unauthorized access and use, but provide convenience in 20 accessing and using genetic information if such use is properly authorized.\nIn a method according to the present invention, a patient enrolls in a genetic banking system and provides a source of genetic material, such as a blood sample. The sample is processed using a combination of experimental and/or in silico techniques to produce a genetic profile for the patients. The processed data is 25 stored in a database to create a genetic profile for that patient. A remaining portion of the physical sample may also be stored for further use if needed.\nThe patient, either at the time of enrollment or after a sample is processed, can dictate access rights, including the ability of third parties (other than the individual or the genetic bank itself), such as medical practitioners, to access this profile, and the specific purposes for which the profile can be accessed and used. Thus, the patient can specify both the people who will have access, and the uses for which they have access.\nThe system provides user interfaces for the user to enter identification 5 information and access rights. The bank can prepare standard protocols that describe allowed and proscribed data sharing.\nA medical practitioner authorized to have access by the patient and confirmed by the access control system can access the profile that is stored and can run tests based on the profile as stored in the database; for example, such a test can 10 be run to determine the presence or absence of certain markers.\nIn another aspect, a system according to the present invention includes a database for storing genetic data on individuals and an access control system that controls access to the database and manages the tests that are to be done. The control system interacts with (or includes) a testing system to cause the testing system to process the profile data to conduct the desired test. The control system authorizes the test and provides the results.\nThe system allows users to store a comprehensive digitized DNA profile based on a sample, in addition to storage of physical samples. The patient has control to voluntarily allow access to particular people and for particular purposes, thus protecting the privacy of that information. Because the samples have been processed and digitized, additional tests can be performed without requiring repetitive use of actual physical samples. Other features and advantages will become apparent from the following description of preferred embodiments, drawings, and claims.\nA genetic banking system 10 has a database 18 for storing genetic profiles, and a processing system 12 for controlling interactions between a patient 14 and database 18, and between a medical practitioner 16 and database 18. System 10 may also include data integration and analysis functionalities and a testing system 20 that is linked to database 18, and may also include physical storage 22 for storing physical samples of genetic material. Processing system 12 maintains access rights that allow a patient to specify and control the access to the profile by others such as medical practitioners, enforces the access rights that are voluntarily provided from the patient, causes testing system 20 to perform a desired test, and provides results to the medical practitioner.\nDatabase 18 may be a relational database with a relational database management system (RDBMS), or it may use technology such as that in ACEDB, a genome database system that has a custom database kernel, a data model designed specifically for handling scientific data flexibly, and a graphical user interface with many specific displays and tools for genomic data. ACEDB software and supporting tools are publicly available via the Internet by download.\nProcessing system 12 and the testing system 20 may each include a special purpose computer, a workstation, a server, or some combination of linked computers, workstations, and/or servers for interfacing with users, processing, information and performing tests. The connections employed are preferably high speed, TCP/IP connections, such as T1 lines. The testing system may be independent and remote from processing system 12 that interacts with users and medical practitioners, or the testing system and processing system may be part of one larger processing system.\nReferring to the flow chart of\nTo confirm selections regarding access and use made by the patients, the system preferably employs a process of querying and confirming through the user interface, and preferably also includes information for the patient about the system and about the tests. Redundancies and checks can be provided in the interaction between the patient and the user interface during the enrollment process so that the patient understands the possible uses of the profile and the consequences of selecting who gets access and the uses for that access.\nTo enroll, the patient preferably either obtains from the processing system a password at the time of enrollment, or the patient may have previously been provided with a password for confidentiality. The system preferably provides a high level of security and may include mechanisms such as digital certificates in addition to the password protection. The enrollment can take place-on a private or other closed or dedicated network, such as a LAN or Intranet, or with appropriate security measures, over the Internet, and can be performed without additional human intervention (i.e., additional to the user). For Internet interaction, the processing system can include a web server for providing pages or forms and for receiving information entered onto those forms.\nWhen the patient is enrolled, the patient has a physical source of genetic material shipped to the genetic banking system or some other desired location for processing (102).\nAt a later time, the patient can use the password or a new password to change selections for who can get access and the uses for which access can be made. In addition, the selections can “time out” such that the user must re-confirm selections after some period of time or else the access rights are terminated.\nThe physical sample is processed by the testing system and the results of the processing are stored in the database. The processing that is performed on the sample can vary depending on the genetic banking and testing services that are provided, but can include genotyping and bioinformatic profiling of general and/or specific genetic marker panels. Such information can be used to determine risks of many diseases including, without limitation, cancer, Huntington's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, and hypertension. The tests can be done through a number of different methods, such as fluorescence, optical density, mass spectroscopy, DNA sequencing, microarray-based assays, or other current methods or methods to be developed. The data that is provided from these tests is digitally stored in the database as a genetic profile of the patient for subsequent analysis and tests.\nAfter the tests are done, the actual physical sample (or at least any remaining portion) may be stored if desired in case it is needed for confirmation or other future purposes (106). This physical storage can be done using known cryogenic techniques.\nIf the access is allowed, the practitioner can seek to have a test performed, such as a search of the profile for markers for Huntington's Disease (114). The system determines whether the test is authorized by comparing the type of test that is desired with the access rights entered by the patient (116) (a practitioner may have access for some purposes but not others). If the test is authorized, the processing system forwards the request to the testing system to perform the test. The results of the test can be analyzed in the processing system if needed and provided to the practitioner, preferably in an encrypted form (118). The connections that are provided, particularly between database 18 and testing system 20, should have high bandwidth to allow a significant amount of data to be quickly provided to the testing system for the results. Testing system 20 should be sufficiently computationally intensive in order to perform the requested tests.\nIf access by the practitioner is not allowed; or if the particular test is not authorized, the patient can log in to the system to provide the appropriate authorizations for access (120, 122).\nThe practitioner can seek access over a dedicated or closed network, or with appropriate security, over the Internet. The processes of seeking access, confirming access, performing the test, and reporting results can all be performed without additional human intervention (other than the medical practitioner himself/herself).\nThe patient mayor may not have access to have tests run individually and without the tests being performed for a medical practitioner. It may be desirable for the patient only to have access through a medical practitioner who can explain to the patient the actual meaning of the tests. However, it would also be possible to allow the patient to have tests performed and to have access to the results.\nSeveral non-limiting genes, and the diseases with which they are associated, which can be sequenced and/or from which a SNP map can be generated according to the methods of the invention are provided in Pulst S. M. (1999) Neurol. 56(6): 667-672; Ballantyne et al. (1997) J. Cardiovasc. Risk 4(5-6):353-356; Marian, A. J. (1997) J. Cardiovasc. Risk 4(5-6): 341-345; Marian, A. J. (1997) J. Cardiovasc. Risk 4(5-6): 333-339; Hallman, D. M. et al. (1997) J. Cardiovasc. Risk 4(5-6): 325-331; Ballantyne et al. (1997) J. Cardiovasc. Risk 4(5-6): 321-323. Additional genes the diseases with which they are associated are listed in Table 1.\nIn addition to specific genes associated with specific diseases, many diseases are characterized by their association with a set of at least one genetic marker which can be detected using the methods of the present invention. For example, a marker in the UCP-2/UCP-3 gene cluster has been linked to a genetic susceptibility to anorexia nervosa (Campbell et al. (1999) Mol. Psychiatry 4(1): 68-70). Likewise, genetic markers in addition to apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (Scacchi et al. (1999) Neurosci. Lett. 259(1): 33-36). Parkinson's disease is similarly associated with a certain combined alpha-synuclein/apolipoprotein E genotype (Kruger et al. (1999) Ann. Neural. 45(5): 611-617). The methods of the invention may also be employed to detect the presence of a multigeneic disease (or the predisposition to develop such a disease) that is associated with and/or caused by the allelic variants of more than one gene.\nFor the purposes of the invention, it matters not whether the disease is caused by and/or correlated with the associated genetic marker or whether the associated genetic marker is caused by and/or correlated with the disease. What is relevant is that certain genetic markers, such as allelic variants, are associated with certain disease phenotypes and/or predisposition to develop the disease.\nThe invention provides an accessible confidential database that creates and stores genetic information, such as an SNP map, from patient DNA. As mote patient samples are added to the database of the invention, and as researchers find more associations between genetic markers and particular disease phenotypes, use of the invention provides an on-going self-perpetuating advancement into the development of associations between genetic markers and certain diseases. Moreover, with appropriate security and privacy cautions, the database can be used in an anonymous manner to allow researchers to access a body of genetic information for research and analysis purposes.\nThe system of the present invention thus allows a patient to voluntarily bank genetic information that can be used quickly to determine genetic and medical information about that individual, particularly information that relates to whether the individual carries genetic information associated with known diseases. The system provides restrictions, however, that allow the user to retain privacy and limit. unauthorized access to his/her genetic information. The system is thus unlike a system, for example, in which DNA information, like fingerprint information, is stored for identification purposes to use DNA information to identify individuals involved in specific criminal activities; in such a case, the individual who provides the sample would generally not have voluntary control to establish the ability of others to access the information, and such systems would generally not have the ability to test for a number of different medical purposes for which the DNA information can be accessed by others.\nThe patents and scientific literature referred to herein establish the knowledge of those with skill in the art and are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety to the same extent as if each was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. Any conflict between any reference cited herein and the specific teachings of this specification shall be resolved in favor of the latter. Likewise, any conflict between an art-understood definition of a word or phrase and a definition of the word or phrase as specifically taught in this specification shall be resolved in favor of the latter.\nHaving described a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it should be apparent that modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. For example, the authorization is described as a two-step process of checking the user then the purpose, although the authorization could combine user and purpose into one combined access right. While components of the preferred embodiment may have certain benefits and advantages noted herein, other systems and components thereof may nonetheless be within the scope of the claims without necessarily having each and everyone of the noted benefits and advantages."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:85b18ecc-3c89-4547-8c47-ec95912c2adf>","<urn:uuid:09cb955a-ff8b-47c0-920f-3c8ec5d19c3e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a jazz history enthusiast, I'm curious - what's the difference between how Benny Goodman and Dave Rocha's trios approached small group performances? 🎺","answer":"Benny Goodman's small groups emerged spontaneously from a party and featured a playful, casual style with musicians 'swapping dirty jokes over a glass of beer.' The group included Teddy Wilson on piano, Gene Krupa on drums, and occasionally Lionel Hampton on vibes, with Goodman showing confident but restrained soloing. Dave Rocha's library trio took a more structured approach, systematically giving each tune its due with a clear format: setting down the melody, taking turns with improvised solos, trading four measures each, and finally returning to the basic tune in what they call 'goin' home.'","context":["Discover more from Sebastopol Times\nJazz for Juneteenth at the Guerneville Library\nBob Jones enjoyed a lively jazz band on Saturday but he was among the fortunate few.\nAt 2 pm last Saturday afternoon, a fine jazz trio played a set of old standards in, of all places, the Maggie Boynton Room of the Guerneville Library. Though the Giants were playing the Pittsburgh Pirates, and my favorite golfer, Colin Morikawa, was leading the U. S. Open Tournament, which was played on the historic course in Brookline, Massachusetts, my wife and I got ourselves to the library just as the band began to play. Owing to a dearth of publicity, we were the only ones in the audience for the first half of the hour-long set.\nThe Sonoma County Library sponsors these cultural enrichment programs from time to time, and there is really nothing more at the heart of American culture than jazz music. It’s born in a mixture of African rhythms and European harmonies and comes to us through the long hard history of slave songs, work songs, chain gang songs, dark city blues and the gospel songs of Black churches. For all that, it often has a happy, hopeful sound. With its variations and improvisations, it’s little wonder jazz has been called the “sound of surprise.” It has also been called the “sound of freedom.”\nWhatever you call it, jazz is recognized around the world as the unique American art form. It’s important music, especially last Saturday, the day before Juneteenth (June 19th), which is now a national holiday commemorating the anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation finally being acknowledged in Texas. President Lincoln had signed the Proclamation over two years and six months earlier, but it could not take effect until the end of the Civil War. If that’s not American culture, what is?\nLeading the group was Dave Rocha playing his trumpet and flugelhorn with precision and flare. His cheeks inflate like Dizzie Gillespie’s did, and he sounds to me like he may have listened to a lot of Gillespie in his time. Then there was Randy Vincent, one of the celebrated jazz guitarists in the Bay Area. He’s played with many jazz greats over the years, is on the jazz faculty at Sonoma State University, and is the guitarist of choice when the Santa Rosa Symphony plays Sinatra songs or other jazz-based programs. On stand-up bass was young Dylan Johan, who often plays at Main Street Station, Guerneville’s lively and long-standing live music venue. Dylan is also a luthier, one who builds, repairs, and refurbishes string instruments, and he gives lessons too.\nThese fellows know how to treat a jazz tune, giving each one its due, which takes about ten minutes per tune. So we had maybe seven tunes played in the hour or so of the concert, tunes like “Days of Wine and Roses,” Dave Brubeck’s classic “Take Five,” and Carlos Jobim’s haunting “Triste.” They set down the melody, then take turns improvising solos right in the tune’s groove, then they “trade fours,” each one taking four measures as they go through the song. Finally, they “go home” with the basic tune once again. Music, and jazz especially, builds up tensions and then resolves them. There’s something really satisfying about hearing a familiar musical phrase again after the little adventure into the tune’s possibilities. No wonder they call it “goin’ home.”\nBy the time the band was done, people who heard the music as they were passing by had come in to listen, making eight of us all together. Yep, we were the fortunate few in Guerneville last Saturday afternoon.\nYou can find upcoming events at Sonoma County Libraries here.\nIf you’d like to share an appreciation of a local event, contact us at firstname.lastname@example.org.\nBob Jones wrote “Keeping the Faith”, a column in local weeklies for fifty years. He was pastor of the Guerneville and Monte Rio Community Churches for twenty years, living in Guerneville since 1966. His column appeared in Sonoma West Times and News for its entire run.","Here are three more compilations from the “Bluebird’s Best” series.\nThe Legendary Small Groups\nThe Benny Goodman Small Groups were born at a party thrown for Mildred Bailey, where Goodman, Teddy Wilson, and Gene Krupa (on telephone book) improvised a few numbers for the benefit of the party goers. The format proved to be such a hit that it became a regular feature of Goodman’s program, and thus each night the smaller group broke out from the bandstand to perform a few numbers. Bluebird has already released a compilation of Goodman from the bandstand, so this set provides a look at another side of Goodman, one with whom many might not be familiar, and in a more affordable form than what was available previously.\nWith Wilson on piano, Krupa on drums and Lionel Hampton occasionally on vibes, Goodman zips through a number of tunes that were normally associated with the orchestra but have been recast as small group swing. All involved seem to enjoy the opportunity to cut loose and have a little fun and all the recordings have the spirit of a group of men swapping dirty jokes over a glass of beer. Krupa provides plenty of sizzle in the background, Wilson lets loose with some bouncy stride influenced piano, and Goodman solos confidently and expertly, albeit with a restrained sense of adventure. Nothing is particularly challenging here, and much of it isn’t particularly memorable on its own. Yet there’s no escaping the charm of these recordings, which exhibit a great deal of exuberant improvising. Those who dismiss the big band era as a bunch of schmaltz may find this collection to be a more palatable way to experience Goodman’s work. Goodman’s tenure on the bandstand will always remain his legacy, but his smaller groups deserve equal recognition.\nFrustrated by the music business and his waning popularity, Artie Shaw quit playing in the mid-fifties, weary of a pop music scene that hampered his artistic aspirations. Certainly a man who chose “Nightmare” as his theme song was after something different then Benny Goodman, yet Shaw was forced to curb his ambitions, playing pop fluff simply to earn a living. “Begin the Beguine” says it all; a tune that Shaw loathed, it nonetheless became a huge cash cow for him and forced the rest of his work in its shadow.\nLast year Bluebird released Self Portrait, a five disc set chosen by Shaw himself, that highlights a more daring and innovative side to Shaw that many may not have known. Those who are more eager to explore the breadth of Shaw’s work should investigate that excellent collection, for this compilation merely highlights the hits. Shaw’s charts of “Summertime” and “Begin the Beguine” were pioneering and never equaled, and Shaw’s woodsy tone gives little indication of the surly disposition that lurked underneath. “Concerto for Clarinet” is the longest and most daring selection included here; a lengthy tour-de-force recorded at a time when big band music was for dancing, not listening. Stardust is a satisfactory look at Shaw’s career, but one wishes that producer Andy Velez had been a little more daring in the selection process. The quintet recordings from the fifties, for instance, are marvelous and gave a hint of the direction Shaw might have pursued had anyone cared. Nevertheless, if you are looking for one Shaw disc to add to your collection, you can’t go wrong here.\nEllington is considered to be one of America’s greatest musicians, a man whose work spanned six decades and a composer who peeled off classic recordings like he was dealing out cards. Therefore, an Ellington compilation should be a no-brainer, since the Duke has such a vast wealth of classic compositions in his catalog. However, in order to separate this collection apart from other greatest hits albums, producer Loren Schoenberg chose tunes that combine both the classic (“Take the ‘A’ Train”, “Minnie the Mooche”) with the obscure (a feisty piano duet with Billy Strayhorn called “Tonk”). Even those who are well versed in Ellington’s vast body of work may find something here they haven’t heard, but this unfortunately points to the fault of this collection. As an introduction to Ellington, this compilation falls far short of the mark by including marginal recordings that no one would select as among Ellington’s finest. This would be understandable if Schoenberg was working from a skimpy Ellington collection to begin with, but Bluebird is home to the lion’s share of Ellington’s greatest recordings and the omission of “Cottontail”, “Flamingo”, “In A Mellotone” and countless other more worthy choices is a crime. Ironically, it seems the Ellington and the Shaw sets would both have improved had the producers switched roles; the Shaw needs more of the obscure material, whereas the Ellington set needs more of the classics. As always, here’s hoping that one of these days Bluebird finally reissues the Blanton-Webster Band set.\nBenny Goodman-Legendary Small Group Sessions\nTracks: 1. After You've Gone 2. Body And Soul 3.

{"question":"What's the historical evolution of Western understanding of acupuncture's mechanism - how does 18th century European theory compare to modern scientific explanations?","answer":"In 1755, Dutch physician Gerhard van Swieten made an early neurological interpretation of acupuncture, suggesting it was a neurological phenomenon. This was followed by Rougement's 1798 description of acupuncture as 'counter irritation therapy.' Modern scientific understanding, according to current research, suggests multiple mechanisms: the needling process affects both body and brain, with one theory proposing that stimulated nerve fibers send signals to the spinal cord and brain, activating the central nervous system. This activation leads to hormone release that reduces pain and improves overall health. Modern research has also shown that acupuncture increases pain threshold, may increase blood circulation and body temperature, affect white blood cell activity, reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and regulate blood sugar levels.","context":["- Catalog of Books\n- Internet Resources\n- CMN Blog\n- Members Area\nSubmitted by Robert Felt on January 10, 2007 - 4:48pm.\nThe Modern History of Chinese Medicine\nBy Robert L. Felt\nCo-author, Understanding Acupuncture\nThe modern history of Chinese medicine is a history of interchange, the sometimes conflicting, sometimes conjoining meeting of Eastern and Western ideas. News of acupuncture and Chinese traditional medical practices arrived in Europe early in the Qing dynasty (1644 to 1911). There were already references to, and descriptions of, pulse diagnosis, acupuncture, and moxibustion in Germany, Holland, and England by 1700. By 1718 it was already described as a remedy that had gone out of fashion. In 1755 the Dutch physician Gerhard van Swieten anticipated modern developments in acupuncture by nearly two centuries when he speculated that acupuncture and moxibustion were neurological phenomena. This idea was to appear again in 1798 when Rougement would label acumoxa treatment as \"counter irritation therapy,\" an idea that would resurface in Japan a century later.\nIn the West acupuncture was primarily used in the treatment of pain through methods that were void of traditional theories with the practice of traditional herbal medicine being essentially restricted to enclaves of native Chinese. The first and most common Western adaptation was needling pressure-sensitive points near a patient-reported pain. This method was first described in the 7th century by Sun Si-miao, who referred to these as a-shi (\"it's there\" or \"ouch\") points. Nineteenth century Western uses were neither fully traditional nor very broadly based. More importantly though, they clearly reflected the biases of the Western physicians who adopted acupuncture.\nIf Western physicians took too much for granted, Asians lost too much to circumstance. By 1912, acupuncture and moxibustion were in precipitous decline, barely able to counter the growth of biomedicine in Japan and China. In other East Asian countries, for example Vietnam, the same decline was also evident. In Europe and North America, acupuncture and moxibustion had gained a finger-hold, but were far from accepted. A few physicians had adopted a simplified form of acupuncture, but Soulie de Morant spent another decade in China before he returned with a vision of acupuncture that would take hold in Europe. Islands of traditional practice remained in Asia; but, as the world stood at the brink of the First World War, the traditional arts of acupuncture and moxibustion were close to cultural extinction.\nIn China the supports of traditional medicine had shattered. The failure of the traditional bureaucracy, the indifference of European powers, the abject poverty and misery of the population and the rapidly increasing influence of Western medicine, all contributed to its decimation. It met the 20th century as isolated and competing forms. In Japan, acupuncture was held hostage. With each successful modernization and industrialization, and with the growing therapeutic repertoire of biomedicine, it was restricted further. In Europe, acupuncture was also in decline. It had a few strong supporters, and would resurge significantly only after George Soulie de Morant had spent 20 years tirelessly working against indifference and hostility. In North America acupuncture began this era as a footnote. A simplified form of acupuncture was recommended for low-back pain in Osler's Principles and Practice of Medicine, but this endorsement apparently influenced few physicians. Fascinating stories have undoubtedly been lost by historical inattention to the lives of Chinese immigrants to the western USA. Among Americans of European descent, acupuncture was barely practiced at all until the 1970s.\nDespite these unimpressive beginnings, the modern story of Chinese medicine is characterized by three primary phases:\n- its resurrection from near extinction at the beginning of the 20th century;\n- its hiatus and persecution through the Second World War; and\n- its resurgence in East Asia and expansion throughout the West.\nFrom its loss of place, its loss of social or political influence, it gained its freedom. Unfettered by now-defunct traditional forms and prejudices, and thought to be of little economic value, Chinese traditional medicine was carried forward only by those whose attachment was either to the art itself or to one of its practical applications. Orphaned by the old establishment, it was adopted and put to work. Because it did well, today, at the turn of the 21st century, it enjoys what may be its greatest popularity to date. An estimated 1 - 1.5 million people practice acupuncture across on the planet, and as many as a quarter of the Earth's population has ready access to an acupuncturist.\nReturn to Background Papers","What is acupuncture?\nAcupuncture is a treatment based on Chinese medicine -- a system of healing that dates back thousands of years. At the core of Chinese medicine is the notion that a type of life force, or energy, known as qi (pronounced \"chee\") flows through energy pathways (meridians) in the body. Each meridian corresponds to one organ, or group of organs, that governs particular bodily functions. Achieving the proper flow of qi is thought to create health and wellness. Qi maintains the dynamic balance of yin and yang, which are complementary opposites. According to Chinese medicine, everything in nature has both yin and yang. An imbalance of qi (too much, too little, or blocked flow) causes disease. To restore balance to the qi, an acupuncturist inserts needles at points along the meridians. These acupuncture points are places where the energy pathway is close to the surface of the skin.\nWhat is the history of acupuncture?\nThe earliest recorded use of acupuncture dates from 200 BCE. Knowledge of acupuncture spread from China along Arab trade routes towards the West. However, up until the early 1970s, most Americans had never heard of acupuncture.\nAcupuncture gained attention in the United States when President Nixon visited China in 1972. Traveling with Nixon was New York Times reporter James Reston, who received acupuncture in China after undergoing an emergency appendectomy. Reston was so impressed with the post-operative pain relief he experienced from the procedure that he wrote about acupuncture upon returning to the United States.\nIn 1997, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) formally recognized acupuncture as a mainstream medicine healing option with a statement documenting the procedure’s safety and efficacy for treating a range of health conditions. While awareness of acupuncture is growing, many conventional physicians are still unfamiliar with both the theory and practice of acupuncture.\nThere are now hundreds of clinical studies on the benefits of acupuncture now. Many of these clinical studies are performed in China. Acupuncture has been used successfully in the treatment of conditions ranging from musculoskeletal problems (back pain, neck pain, and others), nausea, migraine headache, anxiety, and insomnia.\nHow does acupuncture work?\nThe effects of acupuncture are complex. How it works is not entirely clear. Research suggests that the needling process, and other techniques used in acupuncture, may produce a variety of effects in the body and the brain. One theory is that stimulated nerve fibers transmit signals to the spinal cord and brain, activating the body’s central nervous system. The spinal cord and brain then release hormones responsible for making us feel less pain while improving overall health. In fact, a study using images of the brain confirmed that acupuncture increases our pain threshold, which may explain why it produces long term pain relief. Acupuncture may also increase blood circulation and body temperature, affect white blood cell activity (responsible for our immune function), reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and regulate blood sugar levels.\nWhat does an acupuncturist do?\nIn addition to asking questions, the acupuncturist may want to take your pulse at several points along the wrist and look at the shape, color, and coating of your tongue. The acupuncturist may also look at the color and texture of your skin, your posture, and other physical characteristics that offer clues to your health. You will lie down on a padded examining table, and the acupuncturist will insert the needles, twirling or gently jiggling each as it goes in. You may not feel the needles at all, or you may feel a twitch or a quick twinge of pain that disappears when the needle is completely inserted. Once the needles are all in place, you rest for 15 - 60 minutes. During this time, you'll probably feel relaxed and sleepy and may even doze off. At the end of the session, the acupuncturist quickly and painlessly removes the needles.\nFor certain conditions, acupuncture is more effective when the needles are heated, using a technique known as \"moxibustion.\" The acupuncturist lights a small bunch of the dried herb moxa (mugwort) and holds it above the needles. The herb, which burns slowly and gives off a little smoke and a pleasant, incense like smell, never touches the body. Another variation is electrical acupuncture. This technique consists of hooking up electrical wires to the needles and running a weak current through them. In this procedure, you may feel a mild tingling, or nothing at all. Acupuncturists trained in Chinese herbal preparations may prescribe herbs along with acupuncture.\nAre there different styles of acupuncture?\nThere are several different approaches to acupuncture. Among the most common in the United States today are:\n- Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) based acupuncture -- the most commonly practiced in the United States, it bases a diagnosis on eight principles of complementary opposites (yin/yang, internal/external, excess/deficiency, hot/cold).\n- French energetic acupuncture -- mostly used by MD acupuncturists, it emphasizes meridian patterns, in particular the yin yang pairs of primary meridians.\n- Korean hand acupuncture -- based on the principle that the hands and feet have concentrations of qi, and that applying acupuncture needles to these areas is effective for the entire body.\n- Auricular acupuncture -- this technique is widely used in treating addiction disorders. It is based on the idea that the ear is a reflection of the body and that applying acupuncture needles to certain points on the ear affects corresponding organs.\n- Myofascially based acupuncture -- often practiced by physical therapists, it involves feeling the meridian lines in search of tender points, then applying needles. Tender points indicate areas of abnormal energy flow.\n- Japanese styles of acupuncture -- sometimes referred to as \"meridian therapy,\" it emphasizes needling technique and feeling meridians in diagnosis.\nHow many treatments do I need?\nThe number of acupuncture treatments you need depends on the complexity of your illness, whether it's a chronic or recent condition, and your general health. For example, you may need only one treatment for a recent wrist sprain, while a long-standing, chronic illness may require treatments for several months to achieve good results.\nWhat is acupuncture good for?\nAcupuncture is particularly effective for pain relief and for post surgery and chemotherapy associated nausea and vomiting. In addition, both the World Health Organization and the National Institutes of Health recognize that acupuncture can be a helpful part of a treatment plan for many illnesses. A partial list includes: addiction (such as alcoholism), asthma, bronchitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, constipation, diarrhea, facial tics, fibromyalgia, headaches, irregular menstrual cycles, polycystic ovarian syndrome, low back pain, menopausal symptoms, menstrual cramps, osteoarthritis, sinusitis, spastic colon (often called irritable bowel syndrome), stroke rehabilitation, tendonitis, tennis elbow, and urinary problems such as incontinence. You can safely combine acupuncture with prescription drugs and other conventional treatments, but it is important for your primary care physician to be aware of and monitor how your acupuncture treatment may be affecting your conventional therapies.\nThe American Academy of Medical Acupuncture also lists a wide range of conditions for which acupuncture is appropriate. In addition to those listed above, they recommend acupuncture for sports injuries, sprains, strains, whiplash, neck pain, sciatica, nerve pain due to compression, overuse syndromes similar to carpal tunnel syndrome, pain resulting from spinal cord injuries, allergies, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), sore throat (called pharyngitis), high blood pressure, gastroesophageal reflux (felt as heartburn or indigestion), ulcers, chronic and recurrent bladder and kidney infections, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), infertility, endometriosis, memory problems, insomnia, multiple sclerosis, sensory disturbances, depression, anxiety, and other psychological disorders.\nShould anyone avoid acupuncture?\nIn general, acupuncture is safe and well tolerated. One large study found only 43 minor adverse events associated with 34,407 acupuncture treatments. No serious adverse effects were reported. Some health care providers may avoid treatment during pregnancy. Others may be very competent in treating patients who are pregnant. There are certain points that are contraindicated during pregnancy, however other points are thought to benefit pregnancy. Make sure your acupuncture practitioner is competent in addressing the question of risks and benefits of acupuncture during pregnancy before receiving treatment. You should inform your acupuncturist about any treatments or medications you are taking and all medical conditions you have. According to some theories, acupuncture is not recommended during menstruation.\nShould I watch out for anything?\nBe sure your acupuncturist uses only disposable needles. If your acupuncturist prescribes herbs and would like you to take them as part of your treatment, talk to your doctor. Herbs are potent substances that can be harmful if you suffer from certain conditions. They can also interact with drugs you may be taking and cause side effects. It is best to avoid strenuous physical activity, heavy meals, alcohol intake, or sexual activity for up to 8 hours after a treatment.\nHow can I find a qualified practitioner?\nMost states require acupuncturists to be licensed and confer a title (LAc). The American Academy of Medical Acupuncture can provide a list of licensed physicians in your area who are also trained to perform acupuncture. The National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine certifies acupuncturists (Dipl Ac) and practitioners of Chinese herbal medicine (Dipl CH) upon passing a qualifying exam.Other medical practitioners may perform acupuncture as well. In particular many naturopathic physicians and Oriental Medical Doctors (OMDs) practice acupuncture along with medical doctors and nurse practitioners.\nDoes my medical insurance cover acupuncture treatments?\nAn increasing number of insurance providers cover all or part of the cost of acupuncture treatments, but these providers may have restrictions on the types of illnesses they cover. Check with your insurance company to see what your policy offers."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:51e4df89-f738-46e5-9d63-aaaf54abbf31>","<urn:uuid:9ebdeba6-01fe-48ce-84c4-ae44143eb8cc>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's happening to the natural forest coverage in Tanzania's Magamba Nature Reserve and what's causing it?","answer":"The natural vegetation in and around Magamba Nature Reserve has significantly decreased from 61.06% in 1995 to 26.02% in 2015. This decline is driven by multiple socio-economic factors including unemployment, limited landholding, population pressure, and expansion of built-up areas and agricultural land. The built-up areas increased by 6.69% and agricultural areas by 4.70% during this period, transforming the natural forest and associated vegetation.","context":["Implication of Socio-economic Factors on Land Use and Forest Cover Changes in and Around Magamba Nature Reserve in Tanzania\nPerception of Local Stakeholders\nRural settlements in mountainous regions are a typical process that occurs in many places around the world and have a number of implications on the landscape. Among them is a threat it possesses to the conservation and management of Afromontane ecosystems. This study assessed the socio-economic factors that drive the changes in land use and forest cover and the extent of land use and vegetation cover in and around Magamba Nature Reserve. Focus group discussion, direct field observation and household survey were used to acquire socio-economic information that impacts land use and forest cover. Through the use of Remote Sensing and GIS methods Landsat satellite images of 1995, 2008 and 2015 were employed to identify the extent of the changes in land use and forest cover. The perceived factors for the changes include education level, unemployment, landless/limited, landholding, population pressure, expansion of built-up areas and agricultural land at the expense of other land covers. This study revealed the transformation of natural forest and associated vegetation from one form to another. There was a decrease in natural vegetation from 61.06% in 1995 to 26.02% in 2015 and increase in built-up areas by 6.69% and agricultural areas by 4.70%. This study recommends conservation monitoring and strong law enforcement relating to natural resources so as to promote sustainable use of resources to rescue the diminishing ecosystem services.\nAchard, F., Eva, H.

Will the part:\n- Transmit energy?\n- Absorb energy?\n- Transmit a fluid?\n- Provide structural support?\n- Seal a fluid?\nIs there a cost target for a material that we should consider?\n- Material cost per part?\n- Material cost per pound?\nWill the part be located inside or outside?\n- UV exposure that may affect properties or color?\n- Time length of exposure?\n- Temperature during exposure?\nWhat, if any, are the temperature requirements?\n- Maximum service temperature?\n- Minimum service temperature?\n- Constant use temperature?\n- Length of exposure to different temperature extremes?\nIs there exposure to specific chemicals?\n- Time length of exposure?\nWill the part be exposed to an abrasive environment?\nAre there any physical property requirements?\n- Tensile strength?\n- Tensile elongation — need to stretch without breaking?\n- Tensile stress?\n- Compression set (at temperature) — resistance to set under extensive load?\n- Flexural modulus — resistance to deformation?\n- Tensile set (at temperature)?\n- Specific gravity target?\n- Viscosity or melt flow requirements?\nDoes the part need to absorb vibration?\nIs the part being used as a sound dampener or deadener?\nDoes the part need to meet any regulatory requirements?\n- Flame retardant to UL or other agency standard?\n- Comply with FDA or NSF food or water contact?\n- Meet a specific automotive specification?\n- Comply with USP class VI for a medical device?\nNot all of the properties requirements above may apply to your products applications. By engaging us in the proper dialogue, and based upon the answers to the above questions, we can recommend a material to suit the application and environment of the part.\nElastomer Hardness Selection\nThermoset rubber materials are available in durometers ranging from 20 Shore A to 90 Shore A, while even harder materials are available for thermoplastic elastomers on the Shore D scale. Commonly, materials hardness range in most general applications from 50 Shore A to 80 Shore A, with the majority of sealing products being made from materials with 70 Shore A hardness. Depending on your specific application, Timco Rubber will be able to recommend a proper hardness for your rubber material.\nIn dealing with very hard or very soft materials, some manufacturing limitations will apply. Parts that have a complex geometrical design or deep undercuts are more difficult to manufacture from very soft (less than 30 Shore A) or very hard (greater than 80 Shore A) materials.","EPDM synthetic rubber is the ideal material for creating outdoor flooring and industrial rubber parts due to its greater degree of weathering resistance compared to other elastomeric materials. Although, it is most commonly used in the production of industrial rubber parts, EPDM synthetic rubber is also used in other outdoor settings as well. As a case in point, this ozone resistant rubber is a popular material used in rubber flooring for residential, industrial, and commercial outdoor settings as it is able to provide long-lasting protection against weathering. In addition, EPDM membrane material is a common product used in roofing applications as it tends to have a longer life in abrasive environments. Furthermore, EPDM rubber parts, membrane, and flooring are all easy to install with the use of weatherproof adhesives.\nWhat is EPDM Flooring?\nEPDM flooring is a tire derived product, or TDP, that is made up of ground up tire crumbs that have been bonded together with an adhesive to create a solid sheet. Other times, speckles of 100% EPDM are added into the blend of rubber crumbs to enhance the material’s environmental resistance properties with some recycled rubber products having a 17% overall EPDM synthetic rubber content. According to CalRecycle, “Tire-derived products (TDP) can satisfy established technical testing standards for building construction, traffic control, paving and many other applications, while offering many unique performance benefits” (calrecycle.ca.gov). Recycled rubber is commonly used as outdoor flooring due to its EPDM synthetic rubber content, high tensile strength, and ability to resist degradation caused by damaging environmental factors. EPDM synthetic rubber is generally used for the production of industrial rubber parts, such as seals and gaskets; however, it is the superior ozone resistant rubber material with a high tensile strength allowing it to provide resilient and long-lasting flooring in outdoor settings. Commercial EPDM is best known for its superior environmental resistance properties as its “main properties are excellent heat, ozone, and weather resistance” (polyhedronlab.com). These properties of EPDM synthetic rubber allow it to provide long-lasting weatherproof properties that are ideal for outdoor settings. In addition, EPDM synthetic rubber is often regarded as a “crack-less rubber” due to its resistance to ozone-cracking and high tensile strength, which is the term used to describe the “maximum load that a material can support without fracture when being stretched, divided by the original cross-sectional area of the material” (Britannica.com). EPDM synthetic rubber is an extremely resilient material that is difficult to tear or break, even when it is put under extreme stress or pressure. This along with its superior resistance to UV rays, ozone, and oxygen, commercial EPDM will make for a long-lasting material used in the production of outdoor rubber flooring options.\nDoes EPDM have to be Glued Down?\nIt is sometimes required to glue down EPDM, such as in roofing and outdoor flooring applications; however, not all EPDM rubber parts, or flooring options have to be glued down. Because EPDM membrane is a thermoset membrane, they are “bonded together at the seams to form one continuous membrane” (Wikipedia.org). Then, the EPDM membrane is generally glued down to the roof using a latex or water-based adhesive (homesteady.com). EPDM roofing applications must be glued down due to the amount of weathering and abuse it will experience. Additionally, outdoor flooring containing EPDM, much like roofing applications, must be glued down due to the possibility of wet weather. On the other hand, industrial EPDM rubber parts, such as industrial seals and gaskets, do not need to be glued down. Industrial seals “are used to prevent leakage, hold pressure, and deflect contamination at…static and dynamic interfaces. Examples of static interfaces include the entry point of bolts and screws, and the interface between an engine block and cylinder head…Dynamic interfaces are typically linear, such as the seal between pistons and cylinders” (fastenerengineering.com). Instead of being glued down for installation, EPDM seals and gaskets are generally held in place by the pressure of the two joining surfaces. As a case in point, “Gasket depend on compression and their ability to conform to imperfections in the two surfaces to create a seal. Bolted connections are often used to provide this compression” (fastenerengineering.com). When used outdoors and in wet weather conditions, it is important to glue down EPDM derived outdoor flooring and roofing membranes to prevent the products from shifting or moving while in use.\nWhat is EPDM Coating?\nAn EPDM coating is an extra layer of protection that is often, but not always, used on roofing applications that need extra protection against damaging environmental factors. For a damaged EPDM membrane “an additional coating removes the white spots across the surface of the sheet EPDM roof. The liquid material seeps into the cracks. In turn, this makes the rubber material whole and reduces tension damage.” An elastomeric coating is used to seal damaged rubber membranes to ensure reliable insulation and prevent leaks. For instance, “Supplement coating products are used to reinforce damaged or leak-prone problem areas” (Wikipedia.org). This ozone resistant rubber coating is also highly resistant to UV rays and oxygen allowing it to provide optimal protection in roofing applications. A roof coating is generally the, “topmost layer of protection for membrane, receiving the impact of sunlight (both infrared and ultraviolet (UV)), rain, hair, and physical damage” (Wikipedia.org). EPDM synthetic rubber is the ideal material for outdoor coating because it is the best outdoor rubber material being able to resist degradation caused by UV rays, ozone, moisture, and oxygen. Elastomeric coatings made of EPDM synthetic rubber cannot withstand heavy foot traffic, meaning they cannot be used to coat areas like walkways or patios.\nCan EPDM be Installed Over Felt?\nEPDM can be installed over felt, but it has to be done so with a polyurethane adhesive or with a metal strip that clamps the two materials together. Both EPDM synthetic rubber and felt are commonly used roofing materials due to their excellent resistance to UV rays, ozone, and oxidation; however, the addition of an EPDM membrane will prove to enhance protection against leakages and damage. EPDM membrane can easily be installed over felt with the use of a polyurethane adhesive. A polyurethane-based adhesive is the ideal adhesive for roofing applications due to its “high resistance to weathering and environmental influences; high resistance to aging and high structural strength; and high impact and shear strength “which are all important factors to have in a resilient and long-lasting roofing product (resin-expert.com). Other times, EPDM synthetic rubber can be installed over felt using a “termination bar”. A termination bar is a metal bar, often made of extruded aluminum that is used for “sealing membrane wall flashings to various approved substrates” (gentite.com). A termination bar is used when adhesives are not bonding the materials together. For instance, “Roofing felt is bitumen based and it can be difficult to get any sort of good bond to bitumen with anything other than a like for like bitumen product… [A termination bar] is basically a long strip of metal with a series of holes pre-drilled that clamps the EPDM membrane onto the roofing felt with a dedicated water cut-off mastic sandwiched in-between” (fixmyroof.co.uk). Generally, EPDM can be installed over felt, but when it comes to choosing between the two materials, EPDM synthetic rubber will offer better insulation and resistance against damaging environmental factors.\nCan EPDM be Installed on Plywood?\nEPDM can be installed on plywood; in fact, plywood is one of the best materials for EPDM installation. EPDM synthetic rubber must be glued down to the existing surface to ensure a sturdy application in the face of outdoor environments. Plywood in an ideal material for adhesives to hold onto, especially for EPDM bonding. For example, “If you are fitting a one-piece EPDM roof then you will need to glue it down, unless it’s ballasted or mechanically fixed…The trouble with this is that the glues used in rubber roofs do not like the presence of contaminants such as bitumen or asphalt. For good adhesion your roof decking will need to be clean Plywood or OSB [Oriented Strand Board] sterling board…” (fixmyroof.co.uk). The plywood should not have any splinters because it may puncture the EPDM membrane. Therefore, EPDM synthetic rubber can be installed on plywood that is free of dust or debris.\nWhat Flooring Can be Used Outside?\nFlooring made of tire derived products, such as recycled rubber and reclaimed rubber, can be used outside due to their high content of EPDM synthetic rubber and superior resistance against damaging environmental factors. Rubber naturally has a high resistance to moisture thanks to its high coefficient of friction. In addition, because recycled and reclaimed rubber variations are made of post-consumer tire crumb, they will not be harmed by the harsh effects of UV rays, ozone cracking, or oxidation. These ozone resistant rubber materials will not absorb moisture, allowing it to be used and left outdoors for extended periods of time. Furthermore, its resistance to moisture helps prevent the growth of harmful organic byproducts, such as mold and mildew, to promote a healthy environment.\nTire Derived Products\nTire derived products, or TDP, are ideal outdoor flooring materials because they are made of resilient and weather resistant post-consumer materials. Outdoor rubber flooring products are often made of crumb rubber which derive from post-consumer tires that have been ground into fine crumble. Often times, “Crumb rubber is used in rubberized asphalt concrete, paving applications, and a variety of other tire-derived products including synthetic turf infill and molded rubber products” (calrecycle.ca.gov). The EPDM synthetic rubber content in the composition of vehicle tires helps give them enhanced resilience towards damaging environmental hazards as well as physical impacts and abrasions. Tires are often built with a mixture of natural rubber and a synthetic rubber, most often SBR or EPDM synthetic rubber; however, a tire consisting of EPDM and natural rubber will be highly advantageous. For instance, “A tyre sidewall built using a blend of NR with ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) would be protected against attack by ozone and, having no need for antiozonant, would maintain its initial ‘new’ appearance and would thus be advantageous” (link.springer.com). Other times, tires made of synthetic SBR are also available; however, without the use of this ozone resistant rubber, tire manufacturers will have to coat the finished product in an antiozonant to protect the rubber from cracking when exposed to the ozone. Therefore, tire derived products, including recycled and reclaimed flooring products, are ideal for outdoor use.\nHow Do You Install Outdoor Rubber Flooring?\nOutdoor rubber flooring should be installed using some sort of adhesive to ensure a sturdy and firm application in the face of abrasive environmental conditions. The best way to permanently install outdoor flooring is by using a polyurethane-based glue adhesive. A polyurethane-based glue is the ideal adhesive for outdoor usage because it is a highly weatherproof adhesive that will remain securely adhered to whatever surface even in the presence of moisture. For temporary outdoor installations, you may use double sided tape. This method of installing outdoor ozone resistant rubber flooring makes it easily removable which can be beneficial for easy replacements in case of any damage. The permanence of your intended application will determine which adhesive, or installation method, is best suited for your project.\nThis ozone resistant rubber is a popular choice of material chosen for the production of outdoor residential, commercial, and industrial applications due to its high degree of resistance against harsh UV rays, ozone, and oxygen. EPDM synthetic rubber is ideally and most commonly used to make EPDM rubber parts for industrial usage; however, it is not limited to those applications and is also popular choice in material for roofing and outdoor flooring applications. In addition, with its easy installation process, commercial EPDM can be securely fastened onto materials, such as felt and plywood. When it comes to outdoor applications, whether it be roofing, industrial rubber parts, or flooring, EPDM synthetic rubber is the best option for a reliable and long-lasting protection."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9533d2d7-5b86-4723-b7b5-830a9e91b370>","<urn:uuid:61fb06e0-ce4d-4a49-99d8-f26adc8a2978>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What problem can occur when storing game state variables in pixels for shader programs?","answer":"When storing game state variables in pixels, variables can only store floating point values between 0 and 1, and the floating point might not be a full 32-bit number but could be an 8-bit fixed point number on some platforms, which can lead to numerical problems when normalizing values.","context":["Shadertoy.com recently added multipass rendering, and one of the founders – iq – introduced the feature to us by (ab)using an off screen texture to store state from previous frames. This was interesting because up until that point, you had to render each frame using only the current time, and current input from the user – you had no knowledge whatsoever of the past. He ended up making a brick breaking game, which is pretty awesome. You can see it here: Shadertoy: Bricks Game.\nI decided to follow that path too and make a snake game in shadertoy. This is a high level overview of how the game works and various considerations that came up while creating the game.\nSimulation vs. Presentation\nWhen you start making a shadertoy shader, you have a single pixel shader program to work in. In the past this is where you did all your work to display the image to the user.\nNow with multipass rendering you have the option of creating an off screen buffer (up to four of them actually, but we only need one for this discussion), which you write a pixel shader program for as well. This program is able to write to the off screen buffer by emitting pixels (like usual), but interestingly, it can also read from the same off screen buffer. Since it can both read and write the image, this allows it to preserve state across frames.\nSince this pixel shader has state (unlike the main on screen pixel shader), this is where all your “simulation code” has to go. This is where you do all your game logic. Strangely, even though this buffer is a full screen buffer, you only need to process as many pixels as you need for storage of your game state. You can use the “discard” keyword for all other pixels, to get a quick “early out” in the pixel processing.\nThe on screen pixel shader is able to read this off screen buffer which stores game state, but it isn’t able to write to it. Because of this, the on screen pixel shader is essentially the visualization of the simulation.\nThe simulation had quite a few considerations. Some of these were a little mind bending at first, but made sense after thinking about it for a while.\nPerhaps the single strangest thing about the simulation pixel shader program is this: The pixel shader program can only write the value of the pixel that it represents. Let’s talk some details about what that means.\nReading and Writing Variables\nIn the snake game, there is a grid of 16×16 pixels, where each pixel stores the state of a game cell. Besides this, there are four other pixels that store various pieces of game state – like what direction the snake is moving in, whether the snake is dead or not, and the location of the apple.\nOne complication of this is that to spawn an apple, we have to set the apple’s location variable, but we also have to mark that an apple is in the specific grid cell where it should be. What we essentially have to do is pick a random location for the apple to go to, and then we essentially have to say “if the pixel that this shader program is running for, is the specific grid cell where the apple should spawn at, then emit a pixel color that represents the necessary data to represent an apple”.\nThat is kind of weird. Even weirder perhaps, you have to remember that this pixel shader program is being run for several pixels per frame (once per variable you have in your state!), and they all have to be in agreement about the random position of the apple so that only one apple gets written to the board, so your random numbers have to be deterministic, yet still seemingly random to the player.\nIt’s odd to think that the entire game simulation is running per variable in your simulation, but that is what is happening.\nThere’s a trap that’s easy to fall in here too, where you might be tempted to write code like this: “If the pixel that we are running the shader program for is the new location that the snake wants to move to, and that grid cell contains a snake body part, then set the game over game state variable flag to true”\nThe problem there is that our if statement guarantees that we are running the pixel shader program for a grid cell, not for the game over game state variable, so when we change the game over state variable, it doesn’t get written out, since this pixel shader program instance isn’t running for that variable.\nI actually wrote that exact code and it took me a little while to figure out why the game wouldn’t end when the snake crashed into itself, but it would end if it went out of bounds. The code looked very similar, and was very simple, and one worked, but the other didn’t.\nThe answer here is that instead of only running the logic for the grid cell that the snake head wants to enter, you have to make the logic run for all instances. So, unfortunately that means a texture read to read the grid cell that the snake head wants to enter into. That way, all instances have the information they need to run the same logic.\nTechnically, I guess it’s only the “game over” variable that needs to do the texture read, but it’s a lot easier and safer if you make all pixels run the same code deterministically. Also, having each pixel run the same code is likely a performance gain.\nYou might be able to squeeze some more performance out of being clever, but it’s real easy to bite you in the end too! In this case, the snake game runs well enough (60fps on my machine, even with the camera edge on which is the worst case) so I’m calling it good.\nOne gotcha to be wary of is that since you are storing game state variables in pixels, is that every variable is a vec4 of floats, and that they can only store floating point values between 0 and 1. So, if you are storing the position of a cell in a grid, you need to “normalize it” to be between 0 and 1.\nSadly, the floating point isn’t really guaranteed to be a full 32 bit floating point number either, and might be an 8 bit fixed point number or similar on some platforms. This makes it real easy to have numerical problems when you normalize your values into the 0 to 1 range.\nRandom Apple Spawning\nWhen an apple is eaten (or the game is starting) an apple needs to spawn in a random location that isn’t yet taken by the snake’s body. This would mean generating random numbers in a loop until we found an empty spot. This could possibly be a perf problem for the pixel shader, possibly doing a large number of iterations, and possibly not finding a valid location by the time it ran out of it’s fixed size for loop indices.\nI went with a different solution. When there is no apple spawned, the simulation generates a random position to put the apple at, and if it’s empty, it puts the apple there. If the position already was taken by a snake body part, it leaves the apple unspawned and tries again next frame. With a suitably high frame rate (it runs at 60fps for me!) it ought to be able to find an empty spot pretty quickly, even if you have a really large snake.\nFrame Rate Independent Gameplay\nWhen making games on any platform, it’s very easy to have problems with objects moving faster on machines that have higher FPS. The typical way to solve this is to keep track of how much time has elapsed between frames, keeping a total as the frames progress, and when the total gets above a certain point, you do a game update and reset the total back to zero (or the remainder after subtracting your “tick time” out of the total).\nThis was luckily very easy to do in shadertoy as well. There is a value you are provided called “iTimeDelta” which is how long the last frame took to render, in seconds. I divide this number by how many ticks i want per second so that the total will always be between 0 and 1, and then add it into a state variable (which is stored in a pixel). When doing the add, if the result is ever greater than 1, i do a tick, and reset it to 0.\nDoing the tick just means moving the snake and handling whether the snake ate an apple, died, etc.\nLow Latency Input\nAt first I had my input handling be handled inside of the tick. This was a problem because the tick happens 12 times a second, which means if you want the snake to change directions, you better have the key pressed down during one of those ticks. If you press it and then release it between ticks, the key press is lost and the snake doesn’t change direction and you die. This was extremely noticeable and made for really bad controls.\nTo solve this, I moved the key press handling to be OUTSIDE the tick, and had it be processed every frame. Instead of changing the snake’s direction right away though, I queued it up to be handled on the next tick. This way, you can quickly tap keys and they are registered as they should be on the next tick. The controls feel fine now and all is well.\nVisualization & Rendering\nThe rendering of the snake game had fewer considerations than the simulation, but there are a couple things worth mentioning.\nThere are just a few parts to the rendering:\n- If the ray hits the game board, make it look like the game board\n- If the ray enters the small box of “play area” above the game board, it raytraces the contents of the game board\n- If the ray misses everything, it does a lookup in a cube map texture to get the background\n- If the ray hits anything, it uses some variables (normal, diffuse color, shinyness) from the collision to do the shading. It also does a lookup in the cube map texture to do some environment mapping to give the impression that reflection is happening, even though it isn’t\nThe second bullet item is the most interesting. What the code does is find the grid cells that the ray enters and leaves the play area, and then it walks from the start to the end, checking each cell to see if it has anything in it, and if so, doing a raytrace test against it.\nAt first I used the Bresenham line algorithm to walk the grid cells, but when there were holes in some of my spheres in strange places, I realized my problem. Bresenham isn’t meant to draw to (visit) every grid cell that a line passes through – it is only meant to draw to the most important ones!\nSo, I replaced Bresenham with a grid traversal algorithm and all was well.\nThe game is rendered using real time raytracing, but it only does PRIMARY rays. It doesn’t do reflection, refraction or shadows. This is because doing any of those things means raytracing against the game board (grid cells) more than once. Since we have to do a texture lookup per grid cell we want to raytrace, this could equal a lot of texture lookups as you can imagine. There is a hard limit to the number you can do (I’m pretty sure, although I don’t know what it is, and it probably varies from machine to machine), so I wanted to try and not push things too hard, and just stayed with primary rays only.\nThat’s basically it. Multipass rendering is an awesome feature in shadertoy. On one hand it makes me a bit sad getting it, because people don’t have to work within such tight constraints when doing the amazing things they do in shadertoy. On the other hand though, I think multipass rendering really ought to empower people to do some much more amazing things than in previous days – including but not limited to games.\nI really look forward to learning from what other people are doing to learn more about how to leverage multipass rendering in interesting ways.\nI also look forward to contributing my own game and non game multipass shaders. I have some ideas for both, keep an eye out (:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9b6d3345-60b8-4fb9-af0c-be984a8965a9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the Australian Dietary Guidelines and Mediterranean Diet compare in their approach to red meat consumption?","answer":"The Australian Dietary Guidelines have different recommendations based on gender: they suggest young females need to eat more red meat while adult males need to eat less. The Mediterranean Diet takes a more universal approach, recommending less than two servings of lean, less processed red meat per week for everyone.","context":["The Australian Dietary Guidelines give advice on eating for health and wellbeing. They’re called dietary guidelines because it’s your usual diet that influences your health. Based on the latest scientific evidence, they describe the best approach to eating for a long and healthy life.\nWhat are the Australian Dietary Guidelines?\nThe Australian Dietary Guidelines have information about the types and amounts of foods, food groups and dietary patterns that aim to:\n- promote health and wellbeing;\n- reduce the risk of diet-related conditions, such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure and obesity; and\n- reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some types of cancers.\nThe Australian Dietary Guidelines are for use by health professionals, policy makers, educators, food manufacturers, food retailers and researchers, so they can find ways to help Australians eat healthy diets.\nThe Australian Dietary Guidelines apply to all healthy Australians, as well as those with common health conditions such as being overweight. They do not apply to people who need special dietary advice for a medical condition, or to the frail elderly.\nWhat is the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating?\nThe Australian Guide to Healthy Eating is a food selection guide which visually represents the proportion of the five food groups recommended for consumption each day.\nWhy do we need Dietary Guidelines?\nA healthy diet improves quality of life and wellbeing, and protects against chronic diseases. For infants and children, good nutrition is essential for normal growth.\nUnfortunately, diet-related chronic diseases are currently a major cause of death and disability among Australians.\nTo ensure that Australians can make healthy food choices, we need dietary advice that is based on the best scientific evidence on food and health. The Australian Dietary Guidelines and the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating have been developed using the latest evidence and expert opinion. These guidelines will therefore help in the prevention of diet-related chronic diseases, and will improve the health and wellbeing of the Australian community.\nHow do I make healthy food choices?\nThere are many things that affect food choices, for example, personal preferences, cultural backgrounds or philosophical choices such as vegetarian dietary patterns. NHMRC has taken this into consideration in developing practical and realistic advice. Keeping the Australian Dietary Guidelines in mind will help your choice of healthy foods.\nThere are many ways for you to have a diet that promotes health and the Australian Dietary Guidelines provide many options in their recommendations. The advice focuses on dietary patterns that promote health and wellbeing rather than recommending that you eat – or completely avoid – specific foods.\nMany of the health problems due to poor diet in Australia stem from excessive intake of foods that are high in energy, saturated fat, added sugars and/or added salt but relatively low in nutrients. These include fried and fatty take-away foods, baked products like pastries, cakes and biscuits, savoury snacks like chips, and sugar-sweetened drinks. If these foods are consumed regularly they can increase the risk of excessive weight gain and other diet-related conditions and diseases.\nMany diet-related health problems in Australia are also associated with inadequate intake of nutrient-dense foods, including vegetables, legumes/beans, fruit and wholegrain cereals. A wide variety of these nutritious foods should be consumed every day to promote health and wellbeing and help protect against chronic disease.\nDo the Australian Dietary Guidelines recommend that I only eat certain foods?\nNo. The Australian Dietary Guidelines, Australian Guide to Healthy Eating and consumer resources assist by helping you to choose foods for a healthy diet. They also provide advice on how many serves of these food groups you need to consume everyday depending upon your age, gender, body size and physical activity levels.\nEvidence suggests Australians need to eat more:\n- vegetables and legumes/beans\n- wholegrain cereals\n- reduced fat milk, yoghurt, cheese\n- fish, seafood, poultry, eggs, legumes/beans (including soy), and nuts and seeds.\n- red meat (young females only)\nEvidence suggests Australians need to eat less:\n- starchy vegetables (i.e. there is a need to include a wider variety of different types and colours of vegetables)\n- refined cereals\n- high and medium fat dairy foods\n- red meats (adult males only)\n- food and drinks high in saturated fat, added sugar, added salt, or alcohol (e.g. fried foods, most take-away foods from quick service restaurants, cakes and biscuits, chocolate and confectionery, sweetened drinks).\nHow have the Australian Dietary Guidelines changed since the last edition?\nKey messages in the Guidelines are similar to the 2003 version, but the revised Australian Dietary Guidelines have been updated with recent scientific evidence about health outcomes. To make the information easier to understand and use, the revised Guidelines are based on foods and food groups, rather than nutrients as in the 2003 edition.\nThe evidence base has strengthened for:\n- The association between the consumption of sugar sweetened drinks and the risk of excessive weight gain in both children and adults\n- The health benefits of breastfeeding\n- The association between the consumption of milk and decreased risk of heart disease and some cancers\n- The association between the consumption of fruit and decreased risk of heart disease\n- The association between the consumption of non-starchy vegetables and decreased risk of some cancers\n- The association between the consumption of wholegrain cereals and decreased risk of heart disease and excessive weight gain.","Eat this, don’t eat that.\nOne minute, the villain is fat, then it’s carbs, then sugar, and so on. Fad diets and food trends come and go, but the merits of a few diets have stood the test of time (and trends), and Mediterranean diet is one of those diets.\nThis eating plan hails from the area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, and provides a window into how the people of this region ate in the late 1950s and 1960s, a difficult economic time for the area. Because of financial restraints, the traditional diet didn’t include much meat and centered on vegetables, fruits, beans, legumes, nuts, whole grains, olive oil, herbs, and spices.\n“I’m a fan of the Mediterranean diet because it’s focused on whole foods — it doesn’t allow for a lot of processed foods – and it incorporates a lot of healthy fishes, which means you’re getting healthy fats, says Paige Benté M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D. and Beachbody nutrition manager. “It [the diet] promotes a lot of fruits and vegetables and then other healthy fats from things like nuts and avocado. And I’m a fan of diets that allow for small servings of wine and dark chocolate,” she adds.\nToday, a Mediterranean diet pyramid exists, and much like the old USDA pyramid (now MyPlate), it continues to evolve as the body of science around nutrition and food grows.\nUnlike the USDA MyPlate, the current Mediterranean pyramid places heavy importance on social and culture elements that are key characteristics of the Mediterranean way of life.\nHealth Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet\nThe Mediterranean diet is considered to be one of the healthiest in the world. A significant body of research shows it can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, and other research suggests that it can help you lose weight, maintain a healthy blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels.\nMediterranean Diet Pyramid Food List\nThe Mediterranean Diet Pyramid is organized by food and frequency: foods that you should eat at every meal, every day, weekly, and in moderation.\nFoods to Eat at Every Meal\nThese foods, found at the base of the pyramid, are encouraged to be enjoyed every meal, every day, while balancing overall energy intake.\nGrains: One to two servings per meal. Examples include bread, rice, pasta, millet, couscous, etc. Whole grains are recommended over refined grains.\nFruits: One or two servings at all three meals is recommended and fruit should be chosen as the dessert the majority of the time. Examples include grapes, watermelon, apples and oranges.\nVegetables: Vegetables at lunch and dinner, with a minimum of two servings per meal. The guidelines also stipulate that at least one of the servings should be raw, and to aim for a variety of textures and colors to provide a range of antioxidants and other nutrients.\nOlive Oil: This is what many people think of when they think of the Mediterranean Diet — and for good reason. Olive oil is at the center of the diet and is recommended as the main source of fat; it contains vitamins K and E, as well as healthy monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAS).\nFoods to Eat Every Day\nDairy: The Mediterranean Diet recommends two servings of low-fat dairy, typically in the form of low-fat yogurt and cheese.\nSpices, Herbs, Garlic, and Onion\nOlives, Nuts, Seeds: One to two servings per day. Walnuts, pistachios, chia seeds, and olives are all examples of this group.\nFoods to Eat Weekly\nFish, Seafood, White Meat: Two servings of white meat and a minimum of two servings of fish and seafood per week is recommended.\nEggs: Two to four servings per week.\nLegumes: It’s recommended that you enjoy more than two servings of legumes each week, preferably with grains so that you’re getting a complete protein source.\nRed Meat: Less processed, lean red meats. Less than two servings per week recommended.\nFoods to Eat Occasionally\nWine and Other Fermented Beverages: Suggested amounts — one glass of wine per day for women, and for men, two glass per day.\nTreats: Cake, cookies, candy, and other treats aren’t banned; just make sure to enjoy them very infrequently.\nMediterranean Lifestyle and Culture\nIn addition to healthy foods, lifestyle and cultural elements are also part of the pyramid, specifically: activity, rest, socialization, cooking, seasonality, and moderation. These form the foundation of the diet’s pyramid.\nActivity and Rest: The Mediterranean lifestyle stresses being active outside; at least 30 minutes a day of moderate physical activity to help support a healthy weight, as well as the necessary rest to recover.\nSocialization and Cooking: It’s believed that cooking with family and friends, and enjoying a friendly, lively meal with others adds social and cultural value by creating a sense of community.\nSeasonality: The foods list emphasizes fresh, seasonal, whole foods to support and preserve the local environment.\nModeration: Eating food in healthy portion sizes.\nSample Mediterranean Diet Plan on 21-Day Fix\n(Beachbody’s Paige Benté M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D. created this one-day, 1,500 – 1,799 calorie Mediterranean Diet Plan based on the Fix Program.)\nBreakfast: Scrambled Eggs and Raspberry Oatmeal\nRaspberries (1 Purple)\nScrambled eggs (1 Red)\nOatmeal, cooked (1 Yellow)\n2 Tsps olive oil\nSnack: apple (1 Purple) + 8 walnut halves (1 Blue)\nLunch: Greek Lentil Salad\nLeafy greens (1 Green)\nChopped tomato, cucumbers, and onions (1 Green)\nChicken breast, grilled (1 Red)\nLentils, cooked (1 Yellow)\nBalsamic dressing (1 Orange)\nSnack: Blueberries (1 Purple) + 2% plain Greek yogurt, unsweetened (1 Red)\nDinner: Salmon and Rice with Sautéed Vegetables\nSummer squash (1 Green)\nBroccoli (1 Green)\nSalmon, grilled (1 Red)\nBrown rice (1 Yellow)\n2 Tsps olive oil\nLosing Weight on the Mediterranean Diet\nIt may seem counter-intuitive to previous ways of thinking (remember villain-izing specific nutrients?) but this diet — which includes high-fat foods like olive oil, avocados, and sometimes cheese — has been shown to help with weight loss, when coupled with regular exercise.\nIn a prominent study looking into the benefits of the Mediterranean Diet, subjects were assigned to one of three diets: a Mediterranean Diet supplemented with olive oil; a Mediterranean Diet supplemented with nuts; or a control diet. The study found that subjects on the two versions of the Mediterranean Diet added the fewest inches to their waistlines, and the olive oil folks lost the most weight.\nThe Bottom Line\nOne of the keys to successfully losing weight — and keeping it off — is to find a pattern of eating that is satisfying and fits in with your lifestyle."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b2c96fb3-4591-4219-b845-047c7a49c088>","<urn:uuid:0b60d04a-aa92-4bf4-bb40-6d850fbf07e0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the role of faith and mercy in addressing both personal and social challenges, according to Catholic teachings?","answer":"According to Catholic teachings, faith in Jesus Christ is central to addressing both personal and social challenges. The Church emphasizes that faith must be integrated with daily life - there should be no separation between religious life and professional/social activity. While the Church uses 'medicine of mercy' rather than severity to address modern challenges, it maintains that Christ is the key to understanding human situations and provides solutions to world's problems. Faith guides Catholics to both proclaim the Gospel and engage in temporal affairs to transform society, directing them according to God's will, while mercy allows for understanding circumstances like economic hardship or health issues that may affect personal decisions like family planning.","context":["Following the article posted regarding how many children to have in marriage, I am interested to know if you could guide me to investigate what is a serious cause for not having children. I thank you for your service and God bless you.\nAmong the circumstances that justify recourse to natural methods to regulate births, I would point to the various marital or family situations that sometimes make it necessary, sometimes convenient, and in other cases at least justifiable to have recourse to periodic abstinence. Pope Paul VI wrote in Humanae Vitae: “If there are serious reasons for spacing births, whether arising from the physical or psychological conditions of the spouses or from external circumstances, the Church teaches that it is then licit to take into account the natural rhythms immanent in the generative functions in order to use conjugal intercourse only in infertile periods and thus regulate the birth rate without offending moral principles…”.\nPope John Paul II said: “Sometimes, even when they are clearly open to life, couples are obliged to space births, not for selfish reasons, but precisely out of a sense of objective responsibility. Situations of poverty, or serious health problems, can make the couple unprepared to receive the gift of new life. The fact that in some cases women are forced to work outside the home changes the conception of the role of women in society, and the time and attention they devote to family life. In particular, some family policies established by legislators do not facilitate the procreative and educational duties of parents. The Church, therefore, recognizes that there may be objective reasons for limiting or distancing births, but recalls, in harmony with Humanae Vitae, that couples must have ‘serious reasons’ why it is licit to renounce the use of sex during fertile periods and to make use of it during infertile periods to express their love and safeguard their reciprocal fidelity.”\nWe therefore speak of “objective” and “serious” motives. What are they? Pope Pius XII spoke of “medical, eugenic, economic and social indications”. There are, then, four fundamental reasons:\n– Medical: for example, poor health, chronic illnesses, difficult childbirths, pregnancies with serious difficulties. Some psychological indications could be added here, such as serious misunderstandings between the spouses, manifest psychological disturbances, etc.\n– Eugenic: the possibility or certainty of engendering children affected by defects (schizophrenia, hereditary blindness or deafness, etc.).\n– Economic: a very uncertain future, severe poverty.\n– Social: problems of work, housing, educational incapacity of the parents, vices affecting the responsibility for the children (alcoholism, drug addiction, etc.). One could also indicate here the desire to distance births prudently in order to better meet the educational needs of the children already born.\nWhat is the basis on which such circumstances of family or social life can justify the regulation of births? The reason is that the task of engendering new lives is a positive duty. In this regard, A. Peinador explains: “Positive duties, whether of divine or human origin, are not urgent when a notable difficulty makes them exceptionally hard; because God, who is Legislator and Father, and men who have received from Him the power to command, take into account, when promulgating their precepts, the inherent weakness of fallen nature, which in most men translates into the impossibility of facing extraordinary hardships for the attainment of a noble and honest ideal, as is the end of all just ordination. Just and most noble is the end of procreation, contained in the precept given to married people to grow and multiply. However, from the duty to put into practice the only good means to achieve it, serious reasons can be excused.” “In this case,” says Pope Pius XII, “the general principle can be applied that a positive performance can be omitted if grave reasons, independent of the good will of those who are obliged to it, show that such performance is inopportune or prove that it cannot be equitably claimed by the creditor of such performance (in this case the human race).”\nThis does not mean that the aforementioned circumstances “require” the spouses to regulate the birth rate. The “extraordinary” character of the aforementioned situations justifies the decision in conscience not to carry out the good of fertility as long as these situations persist; but this does not mean that they “oblige” the spouses to renounce it. The spouses remain free to act with generosity, trusting in Divine Providence, in the vocation of new children to life even at the cost of hardship and suffering. God does not allow Himself to be outdone in generosity.\nFr. Miguel A. Fuentes, IVE\nBibliography for further reading:\nPaul VI, Enc.

These reasons can include medical conditions, eugenic concerns, economic challenges, and social difficulties. Couples should only make this decision with “serious reasons” and are still free to act with generosity. The Catholic Church recognizes the positive duty of procreation, but acknowledges that couples may be excused from this duty in the face of exceptional difficulties. In these cases, the decision to regulate birth rate should be made in conscience and with trust in Divine Providence.”","- Prayer and Worship\n- Beliefs and Teachings\n- Issues and Action\n- Catholic Giving\n- About USCCB\nThe ministry of the Word is a fundamental element of evangelization through all its stages, because it involves the proclamation of Jesus Christ, the eternal Word of God.\n“The word of God nourishes both evangelizers and those who are being evangelized so that each one may continue to grow in his or her Christian life”\n(National Directory for Catechesis [NDC] [Washington, DC: United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, 2005], no. 17).\nby Alan Schreck, PhD\nProfessor of Theology\nFranciscan University of Steubenville\nIn his apostolic letter on the beginning of the new millennium, Blessed John Paul II pointed to the Second Vatican Council \"as the great grace bestowed on the Church in the twentieth century: there we find a sure compass by which to take our bearings in the century now beginning\" (Novo Millennio Ineunte [NMI], no. 57). Pope Benedict XVI, in his first papal homily in April 2005, referred to this statement and affirmed his own commitment as pope to implement faithfully the teachings of Vatican II.\nHowever, Pope Benedict XVI realizes that not everything done in the Church over the past fifty years in the name of Vatican II has been constructive. In an address given on December 22, 2005, the Holy Father distinguished between a proper interpretation of Vatican II—a \"hermeneutic of reform,\" a renewal in continuity with past tradition—and false interpretations—\"a hermeneutic of discontinuity and rupture.\" He also said \"the Council had to determine in a new way the relationship between the Church and the modern era\" (Address to the Roman Curia Offering Them His Christmas Greetings).\nOften in the past, popes felt compelled to condemn the errors of the \"modern world,\" giving the impression that the Church opposed all change and modern ideas. In calling the Second Vatican Council, Blessed John XXIII believed that a different approach was necessary. As he explained in his opening address to the Council on October 11, 1962:\nNowadays, however, the Spouse of Christ prefers to make use of the medicine of mercy rather than that of severity. She considers that she meets the needs of the present day by demonstrating the validity of her teaching rather than by condemnations. . . . To mankind, oppressed by so many difficulties, the Church says, as Peter said to the poor who begged alms from him: \"I have neither gold nor silver, but what I have I give to you; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise and walk\" (Acts 3:6). (Walter Abbott, SJ, ed., The Documents of Vatican II [New York: American Press, Inc., 1966], 716)\nWhat the Church Offers to the World Through Vatican II\nPope John XXIII's statements remind us that the greatest gift that the Church offers to all people is Jesus Christ, and faith in him. The Year of Faith calls us to focus on the great treasure Catholics receive and offer to the world: faith in Jesus Christ and the promise of eternal life through him. The documents of Vatican II affirm the centrality of this message in many ways.The central document of the Council opens with the words \"Christ is the light of humanity\" and continues \"it is, accordingly, the heart-felt desire of this sacred Council . . . that, by proclaiming his Gospel to every creature (cf. Mk 16:15), it may bring to all men that light of Christ which shines out visibly from the Church\" (see Second Vatican Council, Dogmatic Constitution on the Church [Lumen Gentium (LG)], no. 1,in Vatican Council II: Volume 1: The Conciliar and Post Conciliar Documents, ed. Austin Flannery [Northport, NY: Costello Publishing, 1996]). Likewise, the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (Gaudium et Spes [GS]) closes each chapter with an explanation of how Jesus Christ is the key to a proper understanding of each aspect of the human situation and how he provides the solution for the problems and challenges the world faces.\nThe Church believes that Christ, who died and was raised for the sake of all [see 2 Cor 5:15], can show man the way and strengthen him through the Spirit in order to be worthy of his destiny: nor is there any other name under heaven given among men by which they can be saved [see Acts 4:12]. The Church likewise believes that the key, the center and the purpose of the whole of man's history is to be found in its Lord and Master. She also maintains that beneath all that changes there is much that is unchanging, much that has its ultimate foundation in Christ, who is the same yesterday, and today, and forever [see Col 1:15]. (GS, no. 10, in Vatican Council II: Volume 1)\nIn reexamining the teaching of the Second Vatican Council today, any interpretation or implementation of the Council that takes Jesus Christ out of the center is distorted. It is true that Vatican II, in Gaudium et Spes and other documents, recognizes and affirms the goodness and positive values that are present in the modern world (such as scientific progress and the richness and diversity of human cultures) and urges Catholics to work together with all people of good will for constructive solutions to the world's problems (GS, nos. 3, 21, 42, 44). Yet it also states that the teachings of Christ and his Gospel can enrich, guide, purify, and elevate human endeavors and cultures (GS, nos. 37, 39, 58). It is for this reason, among others, that Catholics and other Christians can and must bring their faith into the affairs and discussions of the world and not pretend that they are guided just by secular (\"this-worldly\") considerations. That is why Jesus tells us that we are \"the salt of the earth\" (as long as we do not lose our \"saltiness\") and \"the light of the world\" (Mt 5:13-14).\nBesides bringing Jesus Christ and the wisdom of his teaching into the secular world, the Second Vatican Council clearly taught the primary mission of the Church to proclaim Jesus Christ to all people that all might come to believe in him as their Savior and Lord. The Decree on the Church's Missionary Activity (Ad Gentes Divinitus [AG]) declares, \"The Church, the salt of the earth and the light of the world (cf. Mt 5:13-14), is even more urgently called upon to save and renew every creature, so that all things might be restored in Christ, and so that in him men might form one family and one people of God. . . . The Church on earth is by its very nature missionary\" (AG, nos. 1-2, in Vatican Council II: Volume 1).\nConsiderable confusion exists regarding the Catholic Church's approach to non-Christians, but the Council's teaching is clear and consistent. The best summary may be found in the Declaration on the Relation of the Church to Non-Christian Religions (Nostra Aetate [NA]), which states, \"The Catholic Church rejects nothing of what is true and holy in these religions. . . . [which] often reflect a ray of that truth which enlightens all men. Yet she proclaims and is in duty bound to proclaim without fail, Christ who is the way, the truth, and the life (Jn 14:6)\" (NA, no. 2, in Vatican Council II: Volume 1). Lumen Gentium explains that non-Christians who do not yet believe in Christ through no fault of their own have the possibility of salvation, but, \"very often\" they fall prey to \"the Evil One\" or to \"ultimate despair,\" and the Church must proclaim the Gospel to them \"to procure the glory of God and the salvation of all these\" (LG, no. 16). Vatican II did strongly condemn anti-Semitism and any form of discrimination or harassment based on religion (NA, nos. 4, 5), but it would certainly be a \"hermeneutic of discontinuity\" to claim that Vatican II teaches that there is any person or group who should not hear the Gospel and be given the possibility of conversion to Jesus Christ, the only way to the Father (Jn 14:6). In response to confusion on this issue, the popes since Vatican II have applied a \"hermeneutic of reform\" with regard to the Church's mission to proclaim Jesus Christ.\" Pope Paul VI's 1975 apostolic letter On Evangelization in the Modern World (Evangelii Nuntiandi) and Pope John Paul II's 1990 encyclical letter On the Permanent Validity of the Church's Missionary Mandate (Redemptoris Missio) make the Council's teaching unmistakably clear. Vatican II certainly began a new quest for reconciliation with non-Christians and for the restoration of Christian unity (ecumenism), but this is not contrary to the major emphasis of the Council: to lead all people to unity in Jesus Christ.\nThe Anthropocentric Focus\nAs we reexamine Vatican II, the emphasis on the value and dignity of the human person stands out as particularly critical today. It is notable that the doctrine of the human person is presented most fully in the Council's only pastoral constitution, Gaudium et Spes, but proper pastoral practice is always founded on sound doctrine. GS declares, \"In reality it is only in the mystery of the Word made flesh that the mystery of man truly becomes clear. . . Christ the Lord, Christ the new Adam . . . fully reveals man to himself and brings to light his most high calling\" (GS, no. 22). Humans discover their dignity when they give themselves in love and service to others. \"Man can fully discover his true self only in a sincere giving of himself\" (GS, no. 24).\nUnderstanding each human person's unsurpassed dignity and worth, created in God's image and likeness, is the foundation of the Catholic Church's teaching on life issues, reproductive issues, and social teaching, since society ultimately exists to protect and promote the welfare of the individual (GS, nos. 25-26). Although the Church \"is not committed to any one culture or to any political, economic or social system\" (GS, no. 42), she favors systems that allow the greatest participation of its citizens and protects their rights (GS, no. 31). At the same time, each person must fulfill social obligations and take on social responsibilities as necessary for salvation, and cannot separate faith from daily life (GS, nos. 30, 43).\nOne of the gravest errors of our time is the dichotomy between the faith which many profess and the practice of their daily lives. . . . Let there, then, be no such pernicious opposition between professional and social activity on the one hand and religious life on the other. The Christian who shirks his temporal duties shirks his duties toward his neighbor, neglects God himself, and endangers his eternal salvation. Let Christians follow the example of Christ who worked as craftsman; let them be proud of the opportunity to carry out their earthly activity in such as way as to integrate human, domestic, professional, scientific and technical enterprises with religious values, under whose supreme direction all things are ordered to the glory of God. (GS, no. 43)\nThis balance between the mandate of the Council to evangelize and encourage holiness in others with serving in society in order to transform it according to Christian values as well as to meet human needs is portrayed in the three objectives of the lay apostolate described in the Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity (Apostolicam Actuositatem [AA]). Catholics have the general impression that the Council's call for a more active laity meant that lay people were to be more involved in liturgical or catechetical ministries. Although this involvement is good, Vatican II in Lumen Gentium stresses that the \"special vocation\" of the laity is \"to seek the kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and directing them according to God's will.\" Lay people are \"called by God\" to be in the world, in order to transform and sanctify it \"as from within like leaven\" by engaging \"in each and every work and business of the earth and in the ordinary circumstances of social and family life\" (LG, no. 31). There they carry out their threefold apostolate or mission:\nAmong the sixteen documents promulgated by Vatican II, the four constitutions have special importance; they have been called the \"pillars\" of the Council. While I have spoken of two of these constitutions, the other two constitutions show us both the power of and guidance for the Church, including the laity, to carry out her mission in the world and the final \"end\" or purpose of the Church's temporal work. The Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation (Dei Verbum) [DV]) explains how Catholics understand the Word of God (Dei Verbum). \"Sacred Tradition and sacred Scripture make up a single sacred deposit of the Word of God, which is entrusted to the Church\" (DV, no. 10). This Word of God is the source of guidance and power to carry out and fulfill the Church's mission on earth.\nSuch is the force and power of the Word of God that it can serve the Church as her support and vigor, and the children of the Church as strength for their faith, food for the soul, and a pure and lasting fount of spiritual life. Scripture verifies in the most perfect way the words: \"The Word of God is living and active\" (Heb 4:12), and \"is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified\" (Acts 20:32; cf. 1 Thes 2:13).(DV, nos. 21-22, in Vatican Council II: Volume 1)\nBesides being nourished by the Word of God, Catholics receive the spiritual nourishment and grace to carry out their mission in the world through the charisms—ministry gifts of the Holy Spirit (see LG, no. 12; AA, no. 3)—and through the sacraments, especially the Eucharist.The fourth constitution, the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (Sacrosanctum Concilium [SC]) speaks of the sacred liturgy as the \"source\" and \"summit\" of the Christian life: \"The liturgy is the summit toward which the activity of the Church is directed; it is also the fount from which all her power flows. For the goal of apostolic endeavor is that all who are made sons of God by faith and baptism should come together to praise God in the midst of his Church, to take part in the Sacrifice and to eat the Lord's Supper\" (SC, no. 10, in Vatican Council II: Volume 1).\nTo carry out her mission in the world, the Church needs the spiritual nourishment of her liturgy: \"the fount from which all her power flows.\"The goal of the Church's apostolic endeavors is the glory of God; our endeavors in the world are our spiritual sacrifice offered to the Father through Jesus, the Son, in the Holy Spirit. This is our Eucharist, our thanksgiving to God for his gifts and graces. In the liturgy, our daily efforts and sacrifices are united with the one perfect sacrifice of Jesus Christ (LG, no. 34). Hence, \"the liturgy is the summit toward which the activity of the Church is directed,\" since all we do is an offering for the glory of God.\nCopyright © 2013, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Washington, DC.

{"question":"How many employees did the Thomasville Furniture Industries factory in Appomattox have at its peak before closing?","answer":"The Thomasville Furniture Industries factory, which operated for 37 years before closing in 2011, employed 1,000 people at its peak in a county of 15,000 residents. The facility was enormous, spanning the equivalent of 14 football fields under roof.","context":["Let us say a prayer for Appomattox.\nNext year is the 150th anniversary of the end of the Civil War, and perhaps for a brief moment our attention will turn from the swirl of minutiae that consumes our lives and allow us to reflect on the lessons to be found in this small town tucked into the rolling hills of central Virginia.\nAppomattox. The name rolls off the tongue with surprising ease and no small amount of delight. It was in a farmhouse near here on April 9, 1865, Palm Sunday, that Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, effectively bringing a halt to four years of bloody conflict.\nA large and active group of people in the town of Appomattox and the county of the same name are preparing for the sesquicentennial. But the truth is, there is a far more important issue here than how many people show up in April to hear speeches at a restored village owned by the National Park Service.\nThis modest and welcoming community is gripped with an identity crisis. It is in part tied to the unraveling that haunts so much of rural America. The factory jobs have all but left. The new economy has yet to show up. Many residents say they would just as soon not depend on Civil War tourism or be a bedroom community to Lynchburg, about 22 miles west, but there may be no other choices.\nWhat’s at stake is more than just paychecks and longer commutes. Appomattox is like Selma or Yalta in that it is a small place where an event so important happened that the name has become a shorthand for something larger than itself. The notion of surrender, which is why Appomattox matters, makes us uncomfortable. We don’t like to quit, to give up, even when it’s done with honor and accepted with grace. But sometimes it’s necessary to stop what we’re doing, accept that the plan isn’t working, and do something else. That is what is slowly taking place in Appomattox, another surrender, different from the first but also filled with the uncertainty of what comes next.\nThe surrender here takes many forms, large and small. People want a steakhouse, preferably with the stamp of approval conferred by a national chain. They’re getting a Hardee’s. They had hoped a major hotel would be built in time for the events next year. That won’t happen by then, if ever. At Appomattox County High School, the staff spent the summer changing its block-letter “A” logo on everything from sticky notes to uniforms after the licensing agency representing the University of Arizona sent the school a cease-and-desist letter claiming potential confusion among consumers. “Our lawyer said we should change it rather than litigate it,” said Chris Dodge, the athletic director.\nPeople in Appomattox keep two lists of what their community lacks. The first carries a touch of envy. There is no Target here, no Starbucks, no cinema or bowling alley, no hospital. The new-car dealers pulled out a few years back. The second list, said with pride, includes a lack of traffic, crime and drama. There are no bars, pawnshops or even a jail.\nBut it’s not just a community defined by deficits. There’s a good bookstore and cafe and plenty of local hardware stores. People work hard, speak their minds and watch their tongues. It’s the sort of place where a clerk in the county’s revenue office can create a budget crisis by recording $638,000 in the wrong place, and her error is forgiven as a mistake anyone could have made. And the land here is beautiful, a well-worn quilt of meadows and forests and small crossroads. At dawn, with the fog lying low in the fields and the quiet of a new morning, it is easy to squint your way past the problems of today into a simpler time long past.\nVisitors to the town, population 1,733, are welcomed by a sign that shows portraits of Lee and Grant and proclaims the community as “where our nation reunited.” It’s a good slogan, but not quite true, more of a fudge than a lie. The surrender didn’t happen in Appomattox. It happened three miles away at McLean House in what is known as Appomattox Court House, the county seat in 1865. It was already a community in decline, bypassed by the railroad that swung to the south. When the courthouse there burned in 1892, the replacement was built in what is now the town of Appomattox, and the fading village of Appomattox Court House was all but abandoned.\nThe distance between the park and the town is a buffer that adds to the peace and serenity of the surrender grounds. But it’s also a barrier. Unlike in Gettysburg, where the national military park spills into the town, in Appomattox, the history is by default and design kept at arm’s length.\nThe largest reason for that detachment now sits vacant next to the Dairy Queen and across U.S. 460 from the Wal-Mart that may or may not have been built on a significant Civil War site. For 37 years, Thomasville Furniture Industries operated an enormous factory here, 14 football fields under roof, that at its peak employed 1,000 in a county of 15,000. After a series of layoffs, it closed in 2011, part of the bankruptcy of the parent company, Furniture Brands International. The machinery was auctioned off in April. Even today, nearly everybody has a connection to the factory, which anchored Appomattox’s sense of self-reliance and was a comforting constant until it wasn’t.\n“Appomattox put all its eggs in one basket with Thomasville,” said Paul Harvey, the mayor. He’s a dentist who grew up here, moved to Richmond, then returned in 1998 to a community that wasn’t much different from the one he left. “Now, we’re really trying to play catch-up.”\nBefore Thomasville’s closing, neither the town nor the county made much effort to recruit business or even figure out how to cash in on tourism. Mostly, the two elected boards fought, often over the town’s efforts to expand its boundaries and tax base through the addition of water and sewer service. The county pushed back, encouraged by residents who didn’t want to pay city taxes. It’s not exactly North vs. South, but Appomattox developed a reputation for petty fighting.\n“Companies aren’t interested in places that are feuding,” said Ronnie Spiggle, chairman of the county board. He has a unique vantage point of what has taken place and the efforts of late to repair the relationship, including the county allowing the town to annex the property where the Hardee’s is being built. Spiggle was mayor for 28 years, and his ex-wife is on the town council.\nSpiggle is also a funeral director, with the solicitude and bearing of a man who takes care of the living and the dead. I asked him what Appomattox wanted to become, and he said nobody really knew, but it was a constant source of friction, with one side wanting development, the other side wanting no part of that, and a hard road to the compromise necessary to take advantage of what was going to happen next April with or without a clear roadmap.\n“To have the war end here makes it a special place,” Spiggle said. “We sort of take it for granted. We have one chance next year to put our best foot forward and to show people a community that makes people want to come back.”\nThe pivot to an economy built around history and tourism, tying the future to the past, is tricky. It’s also compounded by the fact that for all the peace found at Appomattox Court House and the pleasure of hearing a reenactor in a soft accent tell stories of days gone by, attendance is a little shaky. That’s what worries the mayor, that the window to build a new Appomattox around history is already closing.\nAccording to the National Park Service, the golden days of visitation were in the mid-1990s after the release of the Ken Burns documentary “The Civil War.” More than 105,000 people came through the park’s visitor center in 1994. It dropped to the low 60,000s but has increased in recent years to just under 75,000, thanks in part to the opening of the Museum of the Confederacy’s satellite facility in 2012. Attendance is off this year, possibly because some visitors are delaying a trip until next year, when a full slate of events is scheduled, many coordinated with a local group called the Appomattox 1865 Foundation.\nRusty Small is on the foundation board. He is also lead pastor at Liberty Baptist Church, which sits at the corner of Church Street and Lee-Grant Avenue (not far from Booth Drive). His father came to Appomattox from North Carolina to open the Thomasville plant, and Small has watched the boom and bust from both a practical and theological perspective. It’s not that communities choose to die, he said, rather that “they choose not to live and take the steps to vibrancy.”\nSmall worries that the lack of infrastructure in place means his town won’t be able to fully capitalize on the opportunity at hand. “The park is going to be ready. The foundation is going to be ready. The community not so much,” he said. “I don’t even want to think about it. It hurts too much. I feel as though the 1865 story is our story, and it is our county’s identity. I can’t conceptualize what it means to live in a divided country. We think we live in a polarized nation, but there was a time when the U.S. was going to be a divided nation, and to think that last bit of that drama was played out here. It can’t be overstated.”\nA few months ago, the Appomattox Town Council pushed through a local excise tax on cigarettes, which could bring in $20,000. In 2013, it raised the meals tax to 8 percent, for an additional $240,000. Some proceeds are going to beautification. Another part is to keep property taxes low, and a third portion is to fund economic development, hopefully to build modest momentum to carry over after the big whoop-de-do.\nIn 1965, as many as 20,000 people were expected for the centennial, but only 5,000 showed up, and they listened in the soft rain to a handful of speeches by historians and watched a grandson of Grant and a great-grandson of Lee shake hands.\nAt the time, there was another surrender taking place across the South. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted. Public schools in neighboring Prince Edward County, which had closed to avoid integration, reopened under court order that September. Appomattox never closed its schools, and many black students from Prince Edward moved in with relatives here and continued their education at Carver-Price High School, which is now a small museum, next to an auto parts store along Confederate Boulevard. The museum has limited resources and an uneasy relationship with the Civil War tourism being pushed in many quarters with such vigor.\nI met Ora McCoy at the museum on a sweltering day in June, and she apologized for the air-conditioning being on the fritz. She graduated from the school in 1960, with the intention of becoming a beautician. But she then went to work at the post office, eventually retiring as postmaster of Appomattox. “We can’t get people to invest in our community,” she said. “It’s almost like we’re stuck in the Civil War.”\nAccording to the National Park Service, blacks account for less than one percent of visitors at Appomattox Court House, and many of the black residents of Appomattox with whom I spoke don’t care much for the national park that defines their community to the outside world. It wasn’t exactly their surrender, and the reunification that followed was often a cruel reminder of promises not kept. In addition, the focus on one event so far in the past can distract from the world as it is.\n“It’s important to keep in mind that the history didn’t stop there,” said Nicole Cabell, who graduated this year from Appomattox County High School and will attend Howard University this fall. “History is still being made here.”\nThe past can be an anchor and a millstone, and perhaps it’s unrealistic for the people of Appomattox to have a uniform opinion on the direction to move forward. But in the absence of consensus, a lot of lofty ideas get thrown around. They include developing a municipal water park, like the big one in Roanoke, and creating an outlet mall, like the shopping extravaganza near Colonial Williamsburg.\nPenny Searcy laughed at that second idea. She is president of Penelope Inc., which started here and has eight stores across Virginia that sell women’s jewelry and clothing. Its headquarters and distribution center are in Appomattox’s mostly vacant industrial park, but Searcy closed the store here four years ago. The inventory just moved quicker at other stores, where there is more traffic, particularly in the off-season for the park, she said.\n“We don’t matter to national retailers,” she said without a trace of anger or even resignation. That can be hard for people to accept, she said, but confronting the truth is an important part of community progress. She came to Appomattox nearly 30 years ago when her husband was transferred here with Thomasville, but her connection goes back to a great-grandfather, a Confederate soldier who surrendered at Appomattox Court House. “I’ve come full circle about living here,” she said. “I don’t see Appomattox as a dying town. We just keep on keeping on despite losing everything.”\nMany tourists initially confuse the old courthouse on Court Street in Appomattox for the one that it replaced more than 120 years ago, and a historical marker is out front to set them straight. It is a handsome brick building with white columns, formal yet approachable in the way we would like our justice to be. The interior looks much the same as it must have looked when court was held here, but the building is now the home of the Appomattox Courthouse Theatre.\nI stopped by one evening and took a seat on one of the benches in the back. The cast and crew were trickling in for a dress rehearsal of “The Hobbit,” which played to full houses over two weekends in June. Many of the young people were wolfing down dinner, clutching paper bags from Panera Bread and Sheetz and Cook-Out, totems of the world beyond Appomattox. There was a buzz of activity, fueled by caffeine, fries and a shared mission of something larger than any one person.\n“The Hobbit” is about a lot of things, but it starts with an essential act of courage, of going on a journey even when the final destination is uncertain. Valerie Daugherty, the director, said the themes — the safety of the shire, the sense of place and the need to confront our fears — are the threads that run through Appomattox. She loves the place and thinks it can thrive again if it embraces change. But she is also a realist. She moved back to Lynchburg two years ago, giving in, with some regret, to the convenience of a bigger city. “Of all the places I lived, I was the most proud to live here,” she said.\nKen Otterbourg lives in Winston-Salem, N.C., where he writes frequently about business and politics.\nE-mail us at firstname.lastname@example.org.\nFor more articles, as well as features such as Date Lab, Gene Weingarten and more, visit The Washington Post Magazine.\nFollow the Magazine on Twitter.\nLike us on Facebook."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2cbc44be-c050-41f4-af63-1cfdaadd5361>"],"error":null}

{"question":"Which measure of central tendency would be most appropriate for analyzing puzzle completion times in hot versus cold rooms, considering the scale of measurement?","answer":"For analyzing puzzle completion times across different room temperatures, the mean would be the most appropriate measure since time is measured on a ratio scale and assuming the distribution is approximately normal. The mean is the preferred measure of central tendency when the distribution is symmetrical and the scale of measurement is interval or ratio. Additionally, this type of data (time measurements) is commonly used in behavioral research where researchers tend to use the mean because they typically measure variables that have interval or ratio scores and form approximately normal distributions.","context":["The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers is commonly called the average of the numbers. Its method of calculation is well known. A synonym for 'average' is 'typical' which may be a helpful word to use given the computational baggage that is associated with average. Average also becomes a troublesome word when it brings to mind 'mediocre' as a synonym.\nThe median is another 'typical' value which may be used to represent a larger set of numbers. A simple definition of median is that it is the middle value in a set of numbers which have been ordered by magnitude. This definition causes a problem when there is no middle value because there are an even number of values, or when there are several numbers having the same value around the point where the middle should occur. A more general definition of median is that it is the 50th percentile of the frequency distribution formed by counting the number of times each value occurs.\nWhen the distribution of numbers is symmetrical, such as that of the so-called bell curve, the mean and median are equal. When the distribution is not symmetrical, debate arises concerning which is the more typical number. An example often used concerns average income where the arithmetic mean may be quite different than the income of the typical wage earner because of the skewed distribution of values. In this case, and often in the case of course/instructor rating scales, the median more closely approximates the income of the typical worker or the rating given by the typical student.\nCalculation of the median using the idea of a grouped frequency distribution allows one to recognize that, for example, a 5-point rating scale constrains responses to a small set of discrete values when the underlying attribute being measured is really a continuous scale. Evidence of this is observed in the collection of students' ratings of instruction when we observe that some students mark 2 consecutive values in an attempt to communicate that they're not sure if they want to award, for example, a 4 or a 5. We have also observed on a number of occasions that a respondent will make a mark, for example, between the 4 and the 5. Neither of these types of responses provide valid data but they do illustrate the presence of a continuous scale underlying the small set of discrete values. Calculation of the median in such situations proceeds as follows.\nIf the distribution of responses given by a class of 25 students is\n- 1 Strongly Disagree,\n- 1 Disagree,\n- 4 Neutral,\n- 8 Agree, and\n- 11 Strongly Agree\nand the values 1 through 5 are assigned as ratings corresponding to Strongly Disagree through Strongly Agree, the mean is 4.08. The median is computed as the value attributed to the 50th percentile point in the distribution of ratings given by the 25 respondents. Six responses are Neutral or lower while 14 indicate Agree or lower. The point 12.5, 50% of 25, is thus in the interval corresponding to Agree which ranges from 3.5 to 4.5 when the distribution is considered to be continuous rather than consisting of the discrete values 1 through 5. We need to travel (12.5 - 6) = 6.5 out of 8 units along the interval between 3.5 and 4.5. Therefore the median is computed as 3.5 + (6.5 / 8) = 4.31 which is a value that more closely reflects the consensus of the raters; almost .25 of a 'rating' higher than the mean.\nThe above can be summarized by the formula:\nN/2 - F\nL = lower limit of the interval containing the median (3.5 in the example above)\nI = width of the interval containing the median (1.0 in the example above)\nN = total number of respondents (25 in the example above)\nF = cumulative frequency corresponding to the lower limit (6 in the example above)\nf = number of cases in the interval containing the median (8 in the example above).","With respect to other scores in a distribution, measures of central tendency...\nare the points around which most of the scores are located\nIn order to decide which measure of central tendency is appropriate, you must first determine\nthe scale of measurement being used and the shape of the distribution\nWhich measure of central tendency should a researcher use to describe the sex of participants in a study?\nWhich measure of central tendency is appropriate if the shape of the distribution is severely skewed?\nWhy si the median unaffected by extreme scores occurring in only one tail of the distribution?\nBecause the median doesn't take into account the actual values of all scores\nWhich measure of central tendency shiould an academic counselor use to describe a student's rank in his/her classes?\nTo obtain the mean, we would\nadd all the scores (sigma X) and divide by the total number of scores (N)\nWhich measure of central tendency is appropriate if the shape of the distribution is symmetrical and the measurement scale is interval or ratio?\nThe mean is the preferred measure of central tendency when\nthe distribution is symmetical and the scale of measurement is interval or ratio\nAn experimenter investigated the ability to concentrate as a function of crowding.

{"question":"What's the difference between a Flight Instructor's workday and a Tower Controller's duties?","answer":"A Flight Instructor has irregular working hours that can include nights and weekends, with the main limitation being a maximum of 8 hours of flight training in 24 hours. Their duties involve preparing students for tests and developing lesson plans. Tower Controllers, on the other hand, work from control towers providing specific services including clearing aircraft for engine start-up, managing taxiway traffic, and clearing aircraft for takeoff and landing. They must maintain constant communication with pilots using specific aeronautical phraseology and are responsible for separating aircraft from both traffic and obstacles near the airport.","context":["Career in Aviation\nIf you are thinking about launching a career in aviation, the professions listed below will help you make a better choice. It is also possible that as you advance in aviation, you will be moving from one kind of flying to another. Sometimes, the nature of this career demands that you acquire flight hours in simpler kinds of flying before moving on to the more complex ones. Good luck!\nFlight Instructor. Responsibilities include preparing students for knowledge and practical tests for different certificates and ratings. It can also include development of lesson plans and training techniques. Work day is irregular. It can include nights and weekends. Except for being qualified in the aircraft and a maximum of 8 hours of flight training given in the preceding 24 hours established by the FAA, there are no other limitations.\nPart 135 Cargo Operations. Transportation of small to medium cargo within either one region for smaller operations or worldwide for major carriers. For smaller companies, work days are usually Monday-Friday sometimes including night shifts.\nPart 135 Charter Operations. Transportation of passengers on demand on small propeller airplanes or business-class jets.\nPart 121 Passenger Operations. All scheduled regional and major airlines fall into this category. This is the segment of aviation that we most frequently use as passengers while traveling. Hours of work and rest are strictly regulated by the FARs.\nPart 91 Corporate Operations. Many large corporations own business jets. Pilots are employees of the company in this case. Flights are always on demand. Work schedule can be something like this: 4 days of travel around the country with 3 days off and other combinations up to 7 days on, 7 days off.\nAgricultural Operations. Spraying fields with various chemicals. In many cases, the pilot is also the owner of the business.\nAerial Photography. Taking pictures of the earth’s surface for cartographical, real estate, or advertisement companies. As in the previous case, the pilot can also be a business owner.\nTraffic/News Reporting. Taking reporters to particular events or places on the ground. It might be done with the help of both helicopters and airplanes.\nLaw enforcement. Adrenalin elevating aerial chases, of course, are included in this kind of flying as are more “boring” things such as transportation of cargo and people upon request of various government agencies, enforcing speed limits on the roads, etc. Both helicopters and airplanes are used.\nWildlife Services. Airplanes are indispensable in remote places for studying migrations of wild animals, for controlling their count, and for collecting scientific data about flora and fauna.\nAerial Firefighting. Dispensing fire-suppressing agents from the air when conventional ground-based fire fighting methods are ineffective.\nBanner Towing. This is mostly a seasonal job in warmer months. It includes picking up and carrying a banner along a beach or a sports event for advertisement.\nSight-seeing Tour Operations. In some regions, these services are provided by flight schools, but in some others like Grand Canyon, there are companies doing nothing but aerial sight-seeing tours.\nBush Flying. Transportation of people and cargo in remote places. This kind of flying requires high degree of proficiency because it is conducted in challenging conditions.\nFactory Test Pilot. Testing new models of aircraft for manufacturers. Besides high pilot proficiency, it requires a bachelor’s degree or higher in engineering. The pilot tests aircraft in different flight modes and works closely with designers and engineers to improve the aircraft’s flying characteristics.\nAircraft Appraisal. Just like in real estate, buying and selling aircraft requires their appraisal considering year of manufacture, total time flown, installed equipment, and many other factors. Even though an aircraft appraiser is more a businessperson than a pilot, serving customers demands a lot of travel.\nAircraft Mechanic. This is not a flying job, but it's included here, because currently, there is a shortage of qualified aircraft mechanics in the USA. Sometimes mechanics can work as pilots in the same company.","What is the job of an Air Traffic Controller about?\nAn air traffic controller is the person in charge of separating planes and planes from other obstacles.\nThey provide three different Air Traffic Services:\n- En Route\n- Information Service\n- Alert Service\nThe TOWER (or AERODROME) CONTROL SERVICE is provided in the airports from the control towers. It consists of:\n– clearing the aircraft to start up their engines and follow precise instructions to join the different air routes, which depend on the final destination.\n– leading the departing traffic in an orderly manner, via the different taxiways, to the runway thresholds, separating them from other aircraft that may have landed and need to go to their parking position via those same taxiways.\n– Clearing the aircraft to depart or land, separating them both from other traffic and from obstacles that may be in the vicinity of the airdrome.\nThe RADAR CONTROL SERVICE is provided from the air control centres, which are facilities where the radar screens and the technical equipment is kept. Some control towers provide both approach and aerodrome services, depending on where they are located. The airspace of each country has countless airways and air routes, through which the planes fly. The radar controller provides separation among ALL the aircraft that fly within his or her airspace, and so we may distinguish between two different types of radar controllers:\nEN-ROUTE controllers separate aircraft flying at the same altitude and those whose routes cross or may cross at some point\nAPPROACH controllers sequence the aircraft that arrive at the airport from different points, separating them in their descent, and also from the traffic that is departing and climbing as they join their corresponding airways.\nAn aircraft is controlled at all moments, from the time the pilot asks for start-up approval in the parking position at the aerodrome of departure, until it turns the engines off once at the airport of destination. During all this time, air traffic controllers keep a constant and direct communication with the pilots, transmitting, on the different aeronautical frequencies, the clearances needed during the flight, using a specific language known as aeronautical phraseology.\nThe controller assumes the RESPONSIBILITY for the authorisations that he delivers in order to guarantee the separation of the aircraft. S.O.E. is the international motto in air traffic control: Safe, Orderly and Expeditious, in that order of priority.\nIn the airspace areas where there is no control service, aircraft are provided with the necessary information in order to have a safe and efficient flight:\n- Meteorological information\n- Information about aerodromes\n- Information about the functioning of air navigation aids\n- Information about other traffic, but without providing separation\nIn this case, the responsibility for separation falls on the pilots themselves, increasing a lot their workload. This is why international organisations, such as ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) advise against AFIS (Air Flight Information Service) or Apron Service implementation in airports with commercial flights or with a high number of movements, because these two services provide information and advice, but never CONTROL.\nThis service is provided when there is the suspicion that an aircraft may be lost, have suffered an accident or is in distress. It activates the protocol for Search and Rescue together with the Search and Rescue Coordination Centres."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e99527f3-9b1a-4d33-a868-2e85a79a7a12>","<urn:uuid:82a0758e-5ffc-4ee6-99b5-30745aee8d82>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which causes arrhythmia and bacterial pneumonia to develop more severely: excessive alcohol consumption or bacterial infections?","answer":"Both conditions can be severely impacted by these factors. Excessive alcohol consumption can trigger arrhythmia, particularly atrial fibrillation (known as 'holiday heart syndrome'), and chronic alcohol abuse can lead to less efficient heart beating and cardiomyopathy. For bacterial pneumonia, particularly staphylococcal pneumonia in newborns, the bacterial infection can cause severe complications including abscess formation in the lungs, pleurisy, and pneumoempyema. The bacterial infection is particularly concerning as pathogens often show resistance to many types of antibiotics, making initial treatment challenging.","context":["Heart arrhythmia treatment could control or remove abnormal heartbeats. Additionally, since difficult heart arrhythmias are frequently worsened — or are actually triggered — by a weak or broken heart, you might be in a position to lower your arrhythmia risk by using a heart-healthy lifestyle.\nHowever, some heart arrhythmias could cause annoying — sometimes even lethal — signs and symptoms. It generally does not suggest there’s a significant issue, even when an individual sees signs.\nWhat’re the signs and outward indications of arrhythmia? Some individuals might have no symptoms whatsoever. A health care provider may discover an indication of arrhythmia throughout a routine evaluation.\nSymptoms of tachycardia include: (Occasionally you will find no signs)\n- Syncope (fainting, or near-fainting)\n- Fluttering in the chest\n- Sudden weakness\nSymptoms of bradycardia include: (Occasionally you will find no signs)\n- Angina (chest pain)\n- Focus difficulties\n- Issues when training\n- Fatigue (tiredness)\n- Shortness of breath\n- Syncope (fainting or near-fainting)\nSigns for atrial fibrillation : (Occasionally you will find no signs)\n- Angina (chest pains)\n- Syncope (fainting, or near-fainting)\nCauses of Arrhythmia\nA lot of things can result in, or trigger, an arrhythmia, including:\n- A coronary attack that is happening at this time\n- Scarring of heart muscle from the previous heart attack\n- Blocked arteries in your heart (coronary artery disease)\n- High blood-pressure\n- Overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\n- Consuming an excessive amount of alcohol or caffeine\n- Health supplements and herbal remedies\n- Electric shock\n- Polluting of the environment\nWhat is an ordinary heartbeat?\nThe electrical signals that make it contract follow an exact path during your heart, whenever your heart beats. An arrhythmia can be caused by any interruption in these impulses.\nThroughout a pulse, the atria contract and complete the ventricles with blood.\nYour heart is divided in to four chambers. The chambers on each 1 / 2 of your heart type two adjacent pumps, by having an upper chamber (atrium) and a diminished chamber (ventricle).\nThe impulse then travels towards the middle of one’s heart, for the atrioventricular node that lies on the path between your ventricles and atria. From here, the intuition travels during your ventricles and leaves the atrioventricular node. Because their minds are so effective trained players at-rest generally possess a heartbeat significantly less than 60 beats one minute.\nKinds of arrhythmias\nPhysicians identify arrhythmias not just by where they begin (atria or ventricles) but additionally by the pace of heartbeat they cause:\nTachycardia – This describes a quick pulse — a resting heart-rate more than 100 beats one minute.\nBradycardia – This describes a slow pulse — a resting heart-rate significantly less than 60 beats one minute.\nNot totally all tachycardias or bradycardias suggest you’ve cardiovascular disease. For instance, during exercise it is normal to produce tachycardia whilst the heart increases to supply your cells with increased oxygen-rich blood.\nA heartbeat is clearly an additional beat, even though it usually feels as though a missed heartbeat. It rarely indicates you’ve a far more severe issue, despite the fact that you may experience an occasional rapid beat. Nevertheless, a rapid beat may induce an extended sustained arrhythmia — particularly in individuals with cardiovascular disease.\nCertain factors may raise your threat of developing an arrhythmia. These generally include:\n- Congenital cardiovascular disease. Being blessed with a heart problem might affect your heart’s beat.\n- Coronary artery disease, prior heart surgery and other heart problems. Previous heart surgery, heart attack, abnormal valves, concentrated heart arteries, cardiomyopathy and other heart injury are risk factors for every type of arrhythmia.\n- High blood-pressure. It might also cause the walls of one’s left ventricle to become heavy and rigid, which could alter how electrical signals travel during your heart.\n- Medicines and products. Over-the-counter cough and cold medications containing pseudoephedrine and certain prescription medications may subscribe to arrhythmia development.\n- Diabetes. Your threat of developing high blood-pressure and coronary artery disease significantly increases with uncontrolled diabetes.\n- Chemical imbalance. Materials in your body called chemicals — such as for instance sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium — support trigger and perform the electrical impulses in your heart. Chemical levels which are too large or too low can impact your heart’s electrical signals and subscribe to arrhythmia development.\n- Consuming an excessive amount of alcohol. Actually, development of atrial fibrillation after a bout of heavy-drinking may also be called “holiday heart syndrome.” Chronic alcohol abuse could cause your heart to beat less efficiently and can result in cardiomyopathy.\nComplications of Arrhythmia\nSpecific arrhythmias may raise your threat of developing problems such as for instance:\n- Heart failure. This could result if your heart is working ineffectively for an extended period because of bradycardia or tachycardia, including atrial fibrillation.\n- Sroke. Whenever your heart quivers, it is not able to pump blood efficiently, which could cause blood to pool. This could cause blood clots to create. If your clot breaks free, it may go and block a brain artery, causing a stroke. This might harm some of one’s mind or result in death.","Pneumonia in newborns - serious illness\nOften pneumonia Pneumonia - Symptoms and Causes in newborns is one of the manifestations of intrauterine infection, which began during pregnancy.But it meets and pneumonia caused by the organism of infection in the baby after birth.In any case, the disease is considered severe.\nWhy newborn baby can begin pneumonia\ncause of inflammation of the lungs (pneumonia) in infants in the first month of life, most often bacterial (eg staphylococcus) or viral (cytomegalovirus, influenza) infection, and impaired patencyrespiratory tract (atelektaznaya, asphyxial).\npredisposing factor for the development of pneumonia in infants are prematurity, prolonged hypoxia (insufficient oxygen supply to the tissues of the fetus) during pregnancy, birth injuries Birth injuries - than they threaten your child?

{"question":"What are the environmental benefits of stormwater monitoring, and what management practices can communities implement to control runoff?","answer":"Stormwater monitoring helps assess water quality and track pollutants like phosphorus, nitrogen, total suspended solids, and road salt, which affect ecosystem health. At sites like the Arboretum, where over 460 million gallons of stormwater flow annually, monitoring helps evaluate environmental impacts and plan control strategies. For management, communities can implement best management practices (BMPs) including rain gardens, swales, wetlands, green roofs, and stormwater planters. These BMPs naturally filter and capture water before it reaches watersheds, reducing flooding, stream bank erosion, and wildlife habitat destruction while minimizing the need for costly traditional grey infrastructure expansion.","context":["Ecological Monitoring at the Arboretum\nEcosystems are dynamic, with vegetation and animals changing seasonally and over long time periods. Monitoring is an important scientific practice of taking systematic, repeated measurements of various features (for example, water quality, plant and animal diversity, and phenology). The same methods are used over time in the same places so that long-term comparisons can be made.\nKeeping these kinds of records is extremely valuable for:\n- Assessing the status and changes of ecosystems\n- Determining necessary and effective land care actions to maintain ecosystem health\n- Researching fundamental ecological questions as well as the implications of climate change, urban environment, and other factors on ecosystems\nMonitoring is conducted by Arboretum staff, faculty, and students from UW–Madison and other area colleges, citizen scientists, and partner organizations such as the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Madison Audubon Society, and The Prairie Enthusiasts. These and other individuals and organizations provide expertise and support in a wide variety of areas including plant and animal monitoring, habitat monitoring and mapping, soil structure, invasive and rare species monitoring and mapping, native pollinator surveys, (esp. bees and bumble bees), stormwater and ground water quality, and daily weather attributes.\nSelected monitoring projects are described below. Monitoring projects that rely heavily on citizen involvement, such as studies of bumble bees, dragonflies, birds, bats, frogs and toads, phenology, water quality, and more, can be found on our Citizen Science page.\nCurtis Prairie Vegetation Monitoring and Mapping\nThe restoration begun in the 1930s, now called Curtis Prairie, is considered to be the world’s oldest restored prairie. To monitor the diversity of native plant species as well as the invasion of exotic species, the prairie has been sampled intermittently over the decades. Using a grid of sample points, researchers have recorded plant species since the 1950s. In 2002 Global Positioning System (GPS) was used to establish more precise sample point locations. Several research projects done in conjunction with monitoring in Curtis Prairie have provided insight into the effectiveness of restorations, plant species diversity and changes, and the effectiveness of fire and cutting in managing restored prairie.\nGreene Prairie Vegetation Monitoring and Mapping\nGreene Prairie was carefully hand-planted by Dr. Henry Greene, the late UW–Madison botanist and prairie expert, so that species distributions resembled remnant prairies he had studied in depth. Similar to Curtis Prairie, Greene Prairie vegetation diversity has been intermittingly sampled since the 1950s, with the most recent survey conducted during the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons. In the latest sample, a new grid, modeled after that used in Curtis Prairie, was adopted to more easily compare vegetation between the two sites.\nStormwater flows into the prairie have facilitated the establishment and spread of reed canary grass, a common invasive exotic species, over 10 acres. The boundary of this invasion is mapped annually using GPS. Monitoring data suggests that the size of the invasion has not increased in the past five years. Researchers and managers are developing plans to restore this area back to native vegetation.\nNoe Woods Tree Composition Long-term Monitoring\nNoe Woods historically was a black and white oak savanna. Changes in the density, occurrence, and size of trees have been assessed by classes in the UW–Madison Advanced Plant Ecology course since 1956. UW botany professor Dr. Tom Givnish now oversees the project. Long-term monitoring shows that oaks are not reproducing enough to sustain dominance and that weedy trees like box elder are gaining in abundance, likely due to the cessation of fire brought on by human settlement.\nFrancis Hole Experimental Plots\nIn 1956, soil science professor Dr. Francis Hole established field plots that continue to be used to monitor the role of plants in maintaining soil structure. These involve simple, manipulative treatments of ground litter in Wingra Woods, Noe Woods, and Curtis Prairie. Each plot is divided into four sections, and one of four treatments is applied: (1) plant biomass is cut and removed from the plot site, (2) plant biomass is cut and left in the section, (3) plant biomass is cut at the end of the year and added to (2), and (4) a control, with no manipulation. The plots in Curtis Prairie are excluded from prescribed burning, and each has a nearby plot that is included in burns and receives no other biomass treatment.\nArboretum staff maintain the treatments, and interested researchers sample the outcomes from time to time.\nInvasive Species Monitoring and Mapping\nMonitoring and mapping of established and new populations of invasive plants and animals is a continuous project at the Arboretum. Quantifying the location and spread over time helps staff assess impacts to plan and implement control strategies.\nStormwater Quality Monitoring\nMore than 460 million gallons of stormwater flow through the Arboretum every year. This water is high in nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen, total suspended solids (primarily sand), and road salt. In addition, flows from large storm events can cause significant soil erosion. These factors can facilitate the establishment and spread of aggressive, non-native species that may outcompete native plants.\nStormwater samples are collected throughout the growing season to track water quality. Thanks to a 2014 donation, the Arboretum has acquired four automated sampling units that will be deployed in 2015 and allow for more continuous and precise water quality sampling during storm events.\nThe Arboretum is a permanent weather monitoring site with National Weather Service (NWS). Daily temperature and precipitation amounts are recorded and archived on the NWS website for use by staff and researchers.","Stormwater best management practices (BMPs) refer to strategies that utilize vegetation, soils, and natural processes to manage water and reduce stormwater runoff.\nWhy is this important to your community?\nStormwater contamination is a concern for many communities within the CONNECT region. Stormwater carries runoff from parking lots and gas stations, yard debris and chemicals, silt from development sites, and pollutants from wildlife and domestic animals, among other pollutants. Such “non-point-source” runoff and debris that enters streams leads to increased demand at water treatment plants and negative environmental impacts, such as flooding, and can affect water quality and impair watershed health. Instead of undertaking costly, and often unnecessary, expansions to existing stormwater conveyance and treatment systems, communities throughout the region can employ stormwater best management practices (BMPs) to manage stormwater at its source and reduce runoff. By minimizing the negative effects of unmanaged stormwater in the CONNECT region, we can make progress in improving water quality, one of the region’s top priorities.\nWhere is it appropriate to use?\n- Parks and Open Space\nWhat priorities does it address?\nWhat other tools are related?\n- Alternative Fuels and Energy Efficient Vehicles\n- Green Infrastructure\n- Greenways and Trails Planning\nHow does it work?\nAccording to the U.S. EPA, stormwater is precipitation that runs off streets, lawns, and other sites. Stormwater that is absorbed in the ground or other pervious surfaces is filtered before flowing into watersheds. However, in developed areas, impervious surfaces (e.g., sidewalks, roofs, roads, and other pavement) prevent the natural filtration of stormwater, causing water to flow into storm drains, sewer systems, and ditches. Overuse of and reliance on traditional grey infrastructure (piped networks that transfer water off-site for treatment) can lead to negative environmental and financial outcomes, including low water tables, flooding, stream bank erosion, wildlife habitat destruction, sewer overflows, damage to existing infrastructure (e.g., water treatment plants), and contamination of key watersheds—not to mention the cost to local taxpayers for infrastructure construction and maintenance.\nBMPs aim to capture and treat stormwater naturally before it flows into watersheds or treatment facilities. BMPs can be designed to suit a variety of locations and stormwater loads – from an individual rain barrel at a residence to a green or blue roof on a public building, to swales and rain gardens throughout new neighborhoods. Regardless of the scale, each approach works to filter, transpire, capture, and reuse stormwater. BMPs (stormwater planters, tree trenches, rain gardens, green and blue roofs, swales, wetlands, rain barrels, and green gutters) typically capture water from a street, sidewalk, green inlet, or from rainfall (e.g., green and blue roofs) where plants, trees, or a stone media filter and transpire the water while enhancing the appearance of the environment. Water remaining after initial infiltration, seeps into the soil where stone or other storage media provides additional stormwater storage, or is transferred to storage for reuse (e.g., rain barrels, green and blue roofs).\nCounties or municipalities can encourage the use of BMPs by adopting zoning or other regulations requiring developers to manage a certain amount of stormwater produced on site (see sample Stormwater Management regulation). The EPA’s National Stormwater Calculator (SWC) estimates the annual amount of rainfall and frequency for sites throughout the country based on soil conditions, land cover, and recorded rainfall averages. The SWC is a tool that developers, landscape architects, site designers, planners, and homeowners can use to determine the appropriate size and type of stormwater best practice.\n- Stormwater Management – U.S. EPA\n- Stormwater Management – Philadelphia Water Department\n- EPA’s National Stormwater Calculator (SWC)\n- Connect Our Future – Regional Scan Document\n- Sample Local Law for Stormwater Management and Erosion & Sediment Control\n- Map of green infrastructure projects in North Carolina\n- North Carolina Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF)\n- South Carolina State Revolving Fund\n- Low Impact Development - A Guidebook for North Carolina (NC State University, 2009)\nReady to get started?\nUsing the Tool\n- Convene a working group of representatives from county or municipality departments (water department, streets department, development, zoning and planning), developers, architects and landscape architects, engineers, and local schools and institutional partners to discuss strategies for employing stormwater best management practices (BMPs) locally.\n- Review any existing plans or guides to employing BMPs (North Carolina Division of Water Quality – Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, 2007 and South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control – BMP Handbook)\n- Asses what regulations currently exist to address stormwater (e.g., zoning, Post-Construction Stormwater Ordinances, Long Term Control Plans, and state law). Consider revising existing zoning and regulations to require stormwater management for all new developments, or revising water rates to reflect the stormwater burden generated by properties.\n- See what SMPs and other green infrastructure projects have been employed in your area. This map, made by American Rivers, maps the nearly 2,000 examples found throughout North Carolina.\n- In rural areas, it may be appropriate to employ strategies to manage agricultural runoff, which may include harmful pesticides and other pollutants. Rain gardens, sediment ponds, or vegetation buffer strips can help manage water flow and reduce negative impacts on the local water supply. See NC State University’s Best Management Practices for Agricultural Nutrients for additional strategies and information.\n- In more developed areas, discuss the current stormwater infrastructure system. Determine if the system is currently overloaded, and if so, what areas present the greatest risk to water quality. Work with county or municipal departments to develop a strategy for employing BMPs. This could include a series of pilot projects, a BMP design manual for private homeowners and developers (e.g., Philadelphia Water Department’s Green Streets Design Manual).\n- Research federal, state, and local funding sources (e.g., Clean Water State Revolving Fund Programs, EPA’s Green Infrastructure Funding Program)\n- Explore the possibility of providing incentives for developers who manage more than the minimum amount of stormwater on site. For example, site design that manages more than the first inch of stormwater could receive a density bonus, reduced parking requirements, or expedited permitting.\n- Consider creating a public education campaign that details the importance of employing BMPs to manage stormwater and improve water quality. This could include public meetings, flyers or pamphlets, speaker series, or media campaigns. Storm sewer marking that shows where what goes into the storm sewer goes—untreated—is a very successful and inexpensive public education device.\n- Support legislation that works to improve water quality and reduce the cost of providing services. Legislation could include new zoning or regulations requiring developers to manage on-site stormwater or the approval of a municipal-wide project to install BMPs on certain streets to manage stormwater.\n- Businesses / Business Associations\n- Colleges and Universities\n- Community Development Organizations\n- Construction Companies\n- Departments of Education / School Districts\n- Farmers / Agricultural Extension Office\n- Housing Authorities\n- Landscape Architects, Planners, and Urban Designers\n- Municipal Departments\nWhere has it worked?Image Source: Eco Friendly Real Estate Blog.\nDavid Tuch, Equinox Environmental Consultation & Design, Inc.\nAbout the Program\nDrover’s Road Preserve, located in rural Buncombe County, North Carolina near Asheville, is a large-lot residential conservation development situated on a 186-acre mountainside site. The developers made a commitment to protect the site’s natural heritage, resources, and scenic views. Overall site design focused on preserving the quality of the existing land and protecting the site’s water resources. Instead of installing traditional grey infrastructure (e.g., stormwater drains and gutters), the planning team utilized roadside swales, bioretention areas, forested riparian buffers, a stormwater wetland, and an infiltration meadow to manage stormwater on site. In addition to BMPs, Drover’s Road Preserve’s site planners furthered conservation goals by planning new roads and infrastructure to reduce stream crossings, impervious surfaces, and forest clearing and set aside land for permanent conservation in a Conservation Easement program. Planning consultants worked with developers to create a set of design guidelines and rules to ensure that the site was developed in accordance with the overall plan while allowing individual homeowners to build houses on individually purchased lots.\nWhy it works\nAt the time of planning and construction, Buncombe County had no post-construction stormwater requirements or other stormwater or conservation zoning. However, the developers and their planning team, recognizing the site’s unique natural character, made a commitment to conservation throughout the site. With help from the planning team and North Carolina Extension, the development team sized a number of BMPs, including swales, wetlands, and bioretention areas, to capture the first 1.25 inches of stormwater. Post-construction, the developers transferred long-term maintenance of open spaces including the stormwater BMPs to the homeowners’ association, while the land in the conservation easement is maintained by the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy. This case illustrates a comprehensive approach to conservation development by successfully limiting site disturbance, preserving 59% of the site for open space and conservation, utilizing conservation easement tax credits, reducing impervious surfaces, and using BMPs to treat stormwater on site.\n- Businesses / Business Associations\n- Green Infrastructure"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6d3230f6-c347-45b2-997e-0e754c267387>","<urn:uuid:e3f8ec16-1bbd-4f84-bc9d-625b87596058>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How should smoke detector maintenance be performed, and what lighting considerations are important for senior safety?","answer":"Smoke detectors require monthly battery checks as part of regular maintenance to ensure proper operation, as many fatal fires occur in homes with missing or expired batteries. Regarding lighting for senior safety, homes should have night lights in all bathrooms, bright lighting in medication storage areas for easy label reading, proper wattage bulbs throughout the house, and adequate lighting in kitchen areas where sharp appliances are used. Good lighting helps prevent falls and ensures seniors can read medication labels correctly.","context":["“Smoke Detectors Save Lives”\nSmoke detectors are a homeowner’s first line of defense against a fire. Studies have clearly shown that smoke detectors do save lives by providing an early warning to evacuate your family and call for help. More than 50% of fatal residential fires take place at night, between 10:00 pm and 6:00 am and most of these occur between 2 and 4 when people are sleeping. If a fire starts while your family is asleep the smoke detectors will wake you up. They are clearly the difference between life and death in fire emergencies!\nThere are three main steps involved in protection your family and property by using smoke detectors:\n1. Purchasing the smoke detector\n2. Installing the detector in the proper place\n3. Maintaining and testing the detector\nPurchasing the Smoke Detector\nThere are numerous brands and styles of smoke detectors on the market today. Most brands are comparable in price and performance while some have special features like remote test capability, strobe/illumination lights and temporary shutoff buttons. The important thing to look for when purchasing a detector is that it has been tested by a nationally recognized laboratory. Such as a UL marking with mean it has been tested by Underwriters Laboratories, a nationally recognized agency.\nHow many smoke detectors you need to purchase is based on the size of your house and will be covered in the placement section next.\nInstalling the Smoke Detector\nPosition smoke detectors on the ceiling just outside each bedroom and in the escape routes of your home. If you have a multilevel home, install a detector on every floor. The average home should have a minimum of 4 detectors. Remember each detector dramatically increases your chance of surviving a fire.\nFor example we will use a common three story home with three bedrooms and a basement. For this home we will be installing 6 smoke detectors. Three of the detectors will be installed outside each of the three bedrooms, this of course would depend on how close the bedrooms are to each other in your home. One detector will go near the top of the cellar steps, do not install at the very top as this may be a dead air space in your home and the smoke might not reach that level before coming under the door and into the home. The fifth detector will go on the stairwell leading to the attic, we did not install this one on the attic ceiling for two reasons. Number one it would be difficult to hear and number two the extreme heat found in many attics would cause false indications. The final detector will go in the hallway at the top of the stairwell from the first floor.\nMaintaining/Testing the Smoke Detector\nPurchasing the detector is only half the battle, maintaining the detectors operation is the rest of the project.\nBatteries, batteries, batteries…most of the detectors in homes and on the market are battery operated. Numerous fatal fires occur where smoke detectors are later found in the home with missing or expired batteries. Everyone has weekly chores to do in life like taking the garbage out, checking the batteries in your smoke detectors should become part of that list on a monthly basis. It will take a matter of seconds to do and can save you a lifetime of heartache.","Where are the HIDDEN HAZARDS for at home seniors?\nThere could be hidden hazards to your aging loved one in their home. It is essential to recognize and remedy these hazards to keep your senior safe at home.\nHome is not always a sweet home. There could be hidden hazards to your aging loved one in their very own home. It is essential that these hazards are recognized and remedied to keep your senior safe and sound at home.\nStairs can pose a dangerous risk if they aren’t carefully evaluated.

Many of these sites are located around the harbour and Old Paphos, where you can also enjoy staying in one of the numerous villas in Paphos. In this article you will be able to read about ten of the top visitor attractions of Paphos, Cyprus.\n1. Petra tou Romiou, or the Rock of Digenis – As an area with great hikes, one of the first places you might want to visit is the rock from where it is believed Aphrodite was born. This rock is located not far from the famed Paphos Harbour, making a solitary figure just north of Fabrica Hill.\n2. Paphos Castle – In the harbour, it was originally built as a fort during the Byzantine Empire, but has been destroyed and rebuilt many times over by the various conquerors of the island. Today, you can walk along the quay for terrific views and enjoy fresh seafood at one of its many taverns or restaurants. You’ll need to cross a bridge to get to it, which is usually open from 9am – 5pm.\nThe photo above shows Paphos Castle.\nImage Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pafos_castle.jpg\n3. Roman Mosaics – These beautiful mosaics have been found in a number of structures and a ticket costing roughly three Euros will admit you to see them. The oldest mosaics, in the House of Dionysus and House of Theseus, date from the second century A.D. Just a couple hundred years younger are the Houses of Aion, Orpheus, and Four Seasons. All the mosaics depict different myths in intricate levels of detail.\n4. Tomb of the Kings – A necropolis with a network of tombs and caves that pre-date Jesus. This site is particularly interesting as an example of Egyptian influence in the area. The ticket price is around two Euros.\n5. Saint Solomoni Church – An underground church with 12th century frescoes and catacombs. It’s also believed hanging a personal offering from the tree just above it will cure diseases.\n6. Odeon Amphitheatre (Pano Odeon Paphos) – An ancient Roman outdoor theatre which is still used for musical and theatrical performances still today. There is another ancient theatre in Paphos, just diagonal from the harbour that was built into a hillside. Not as well preserved as the Odeon, it offers some interesting architectural insights into the evolution of ancient theatre design.\nThe photo above shows a view of the Odeon Amphitheatre in Paphos, Cyprus.\nImage Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PanoOdeonPaphos.jpg\n7. Basilica of Panagia Chrysopolitissa – This is the largest basilica excavated on the island and dates from the fourth century. While originally a seven aisle basilica, much of it was destroyed by Arab invaders in the seventh century. After that it has been rebuilt and fortified against further destruction.\n8. Paphos Archaeological Museum – Home too many antiquities, from the Neolithic Age to the 1700s, including a marble bust of Aphrodite. The museum is open Tuesday through Saturday and costs around two Euros.\n9. Byzantine Museum of Paphos – This museum focuses entirely on the Byzantine period. It contains many Byzantine icons from the twelfth to nineteenth centuries. The collection has a range of liturgical items, which are also detailed examples of Byzantine art. The museum is open Monday through Saturday and costs around two Euros.\n10. Kato Akourdaleia Folk Art Museum – Includes items from ancient and traditional lives in Paphos, from clothes to farming equipment to rug making, and even old photographs.

{"question":"Could you explain how rhetorical devices combine logic and emotion in persuasive writing, and what are the key differences between logos and pathos in their practical application?","answer":"Logos and pathos are distinct rhetorical devices that work differently in persuasive writing. Logos appeals to reason and logic, typically using well-researched arguments, data, and evidence to support claims. For example, when a scientist cites data to support their claims, they are using logos. Pathos, on the other hand, appeals to the audience's emotions, using techniques that evoke feelings like compassion and empathy. This can be seen in examples like commercials that use heartwarming music and imagery to sell products, or when politicians discuss families affected by natural disasters to generate emotional responses. While logos focuses on presenting factual evidence in a logical manner, pathos aims to trigger emotional responses that motivate people to take action. Both devices can be effective - logical arguments can be strengthened with emotional appeals, while purely emotional appeals without supporting evidence may appear manipulative.","context":["ad hominem argument\nFrom the Latin meaning \"to or against the man\".

{"question":"What are the energy efficiency benefits of spray foam insulation, and what installation safety precautions must be followed?","answer":"Spray foam insulation can reduce heating and cooling costs by up to 60% by addressing R-values, airflow, and moisture resistance better than other insulation types. It expands to fill air gaps and creates a seamless barrier that prevents 40-50% of heating/cooling loss through the building envelope. For installation safety, premises must be vacated for 24 hours after application to ensure proper off-gassing, the area must be clear of loose particles during installation, and the foam must be covered by an approved thermal barrier such as drywall.","context":["Spray Foam Saves Energy\nEvery homeowner wants a cozy, comfortable home. And every homeowner wants the ability to maintain that comfort at a reasonable cost. That’s why all building codes require minimum insulation R-values for specific climate zones. These days there are a handful of insulation applications that meet these R-values, but the frontrunner in energy efficiency is the use of spray polyurethane foam (SPF).\nIn fact, there’s a lot more to insulation than its R-value. The R-values refer to the “K-factor” of a material. The K factor is the thermal conductivity for a unit thickness of material. However, other factors also affect the thermal performance of roof and insulation systems. These other factors include thermal drift, thermal gaps created by mechanical fasteners, poorly installed decking, and the effects of air movement on energy usage and moisture retention in roofs. Because an insulation material’s R-value represents dry materials that are not affected by airflow or moisture, it doesn’t take into account the other aspects of energy performance. For example, fiberglass batt insulation may be rated with an adequate R-value, but as the material retains moisture it loses its insulating qualities. In a “real world” environment, you can expect as much as a 30-percent reduction of labeled R-value for thermal insulation materials that are permeable to moisture.\nThe physical properties of SPF insulation protects against this problem. Furthermore, the liquid application of the spray foam requires no fasteners, which means no thermal breaks at the fastener locations.\nThe bottom line is this: Spray foam insulation addresses R-values, airflow and moisture resistance better than other types of insulation. The result is a savings of up to 60 percent in heating and cooling costs.\nA Better Thermal Envelope\nSPF roofing systems have been around for more than 40 years, but there is still a significant lack of knowledge among consumers, as well as many roofing professionals on how to install or maintain these systems. For example, in the Birmingham metro area, hometown of Extreme How-To, only two companies offer SPF installation. We recently met with one such company, Thermetix, A licensed dealer of Foametix insulation, to check out a whole-house installation and get the first-hand scoop on the benefits of SPF.\n“While there is a higher upfront cost for the installation of the foam, SPF can really cut down on energy bills in the long run,” says Ron Brown, co-owner of Thermetix, the company that installs Foametix SPF systems throughout Alabama. Although the initial cost of installation could be 3 to 4 times the cost of installing standard fiberglass batts, in as few as five years the homeowner can recoup their investment and enjoy lowered utility bills throughout the life of the house. The rigid foam insulation, which is sprayed as a liquid and immediately hardens in place, does not settle or sag over time, losing its R-value like fiberglass or cellulose. SPF also has no food value to attract insects or rodents.\nSPF can expand to about 100 times its original volume to fill air gaps between the framing studs in the walls and attic. By conforming to cavity shapes and sealing around wall features, SPF reduces air infiltration much better than standard fiberglass batts or reflective barriers. That’s a big benefit, considering that government energy reports estimate 40 to 50 percent of a home’s heating and cooling loss results from air flowing through the building envelope. Spray foam insulation is also non-toxic and usually has a lifetime guarantee. And, as the house expands and contracts over time, so does the foam insulation. This eliminates cracks and spaces for warm air to escape.\n“Spray foam is also helpful for people who suffer from allergies,” says Brown, explaining that the seamless and monolithic layer of insulation provides superb air quality and pathogen growth. Unlike traditional roofing systems that require vents in the attic, SPF systems utilize unvented attics. This results in conditioned attic space because the air-impermeable insulation acts as a barrier to prevent moisture condensation on the underside of roof decks. Vented attics minimize condensation by allowing the escape of moisture to the exterior by air flow. But with this airflow come outdoor allergens and pollutants—a non-issue with an unvented attic in an SPF system.\nWhich Spray Foam is Right for You?\nThe two most commonly used spray foam products are low-density, open-cell SPF (nominally referred to as “1/2 pound”) and medium-density, closed-cell foam (“2 pound”). Foametix offers both types of SPF, dubbed Blue Max 050 Open-cell and Blue Max 200 Closed-cell.\nLow-density, open-cell SPF refers to a generic SPF that weighs between 0.4 to 0.6 pounds per cubic foot when fully cured. When sprayed to a substrate it expands about 100-150 times its original volume to form a semi-rigid/flexible, non-structural SPF insulation. The SPF has an R-value around 3.5 per inch.\nMedium-density, closed-cell refers to a generic SPF that weighs between 1.5 to 2 pounds per cubic foot when fully cured. When sprayed it expands about 35 to 50 times its original volume to form a rigid, structural SPF insulation with a compressive strength between 15 to 25 PSI. The SPF has an R-value of around 6.0 per inch (aged R-value).\nThe 1/2-pound insulation is widely used in interior walls and attic spaces for its acoustic properties. Foametix recommends closed-cell foam for exterior walls and crawlspaces, because of its ability to resist moisture and its superior insulating properties. Additionally, closed-cell foam doubles the rack loads on walls and adds structural integrity. Both products are excellent air barriers, provide great insulation, and can help control condensation within the building envelope. However, the closed-cell foam is simply a better insulation, period. In a whole house system, there is a need for both products.\nFor more information on sprayed foam insulation, visit www.sprayfoam.org or www.thermetix.com. And if you’re interested in becoming a licensed dealer of Foametix SPF products, visit www.foametix.com or call 1-800-FOAMETIX.\nIs SPF a good soundproofing material?\nBoth open- and closed-cell SPF effectively reduce noise from outside sources by sealing cracks and gaps that allow sound to travel through the walls, floors and ceiling into the building. They are less effective against noise caused by vibration.\nHow Long does a sprayed polyurethane foam roof last?\nThe oldest performing SPF roofs are more than 30 years old. Because the physical properties of the SPF change little with age, how long the SPF roof system lasts depends primarily on the original application and long-term maintenance.\nHow do you maintain SPF roof insulation?\nSPF roof systems should be inspected semi-annually and after events that could cause physical damage. Small (less than 3-inch diameter) dents, cracks, punctures from dropped tools, wind-driven debris can be repaired with an elastomeric sealant compatible with the SPF and coating system. More extensive damage can be repaired by reapplying SPF. Typically, SPF roof systems are re-coated every 10 to 15 years, dpending ont he typed and thickness of cotaing used and factors specific to the roof (such as wind erosion effects, hail, foot traffic, abuse, etc.). Recoating extends the service life of the SPF roof system.\n–Source: Spray Polyurethane Foam Alliance,","Spray Foam Insulation\nSpray Foam insulation has quickly become the answer to insulating difficult spaces that traditional methods often fail to address. These can include areas where access is limited such as joist end or the rim-joist; smaller surface areas; areas where multiple tie-ins are required such as frost walls. Attic vapor barrier issues are increasingly leading the renovation and new construction market to consider 2 pound closed cell insulation. A 2″ minimum layer of 2 pound spray foam on the attic floor can seal all penetrations and provide a superior vapor barrier to traditional poly.\nThere are two categories of Spray Foam insulation, each with their own benefits. Open Cell, or half-pound foam, is easier sprayed into tight spaces due to its expansion characteristics, has superior sound proofing attributes and is cost effective. Close Cell, or two-pound foam, has a higher R-value per depth inch and can provide a vapor barrier with a minimum 2” depth application.\nSpray Foam inspection To-Do List:\nIn order to effectively inspect your project you must have the following completed before our initial site visit:\n- Full access to area that requires spray foam insulation.

{"question":"What are the environmental impacts of deep-sea oil drilling, and how does this relate to the space efficiency challenges that vertical farming aims to address?","answer":"Deep-sea oil drilling creates notable environmental disturbances through cuttings piles that can reach up to 250m in radius, affecting an area of about 0.1km2. These piles can significantly impact marine life, with initial reductions of 85% in animal populations near drilling sites, though recovery begins within 3 years but isn't complete for at least 10 years. With thousands of wells worldwide, the cumulative effects are considerable. This environmental impact parallels the challenges of conventional agriculture, which currently occupies 1.5 billion hectares of the world's surface area. Vertical farming has emerged as a space-efficient alternative that expands production vertically rather than horizontally, requiring significantly less land area while allowing for precise environmental control and year-round crop production.","context":["This is Guest Post from Dr. Daniel Jones a deep-sea biologist with the National Oceanography Centre in the United Kingdom and Project Coordinator for SERPENT (described below). Dan research focuses on how organisms in the deep sea are impacted by both natural and human disturbances.\nDrilling for oil is far from rare, even in deep offshore areas. Some quick GIS wizardry with public data sets shows that for the UK there are over 9000 wells in water greater than 30m depth and 328 deeper than 200m, for Norway 1390 wells greater than 30m and 546 over 200m depth. NOAA says there are 3800 offshore wells in the Gulf of Mexico. Although these cover some of the major exploration areas, there are at least hundreds of other deep water wells around the world in pretty much every ocean reaching depths up to a maximum of over 3000m, e.g. off India. This is a huge amount of activity, but does it create a notable disturbance to life on the seafloor? What are the impacts of offshore drilling on deep-water communities and, even more importantly, how much time does it take the seafloor environment and its beasts to recover?\nOil drilling is a very complex business. A massive simplification of the deep-water drilling process is.\n- As they drill the first few hundred meters of the well (called, sensibly, the tophole) there is initial release at the seafloor of cuttings (ground up rock mixed with lubricating drilling mud), which make a volcano-shaped pile.\n- After that they put a BOP (blow-out preventer; the valve structure that tragically failed on the Deepwater Horizon) onto the well and then all the cuttings are then brought to the surface where they are (usually) processed and discharged.\n- In most open ocean environments these are then spread over a large area and are difficult to detect when they reach the seafloor. At shallower sites the surface-discharged cuttings add directly to the tophole cuttings pile.\nThe cutting piles are likely to have the biggest impact on deep-sea ocean animals.\nIf you take make a rapid perusal of the scientific literature associated with the impact of cuttings piles on the seafloor, you would be forgiven for thinking that drilling an oil well created a huge (up to 1km wide), deep (30m deep), oily pile of cuttings on the seafloor that, in a few cases, was so enriched in hydrocarbons that it attracted chemosynthetic organisms (e.g. the bivalve Thyasira sarsi).\nFortunately, since the pioneering days of offshore oil drilling in the late 1960’s, regulation has been built up and drilling practices have improved. The earlier papers on drilling impacts, written in the 80’s and early 90’s, focussed on the more highly polluting drilling sites that were then producing oil and were available for study. There were some epic papers produced (e.g. by John Gray’s group in Norway and staff of Heriot-Watt University in the UK), but these focus on outdated practices that (hopefully) don’t occur in the deep sea (at least in areas with developed regulatory regimes).\nSince 2002 we have been researching the impacts of oil drilling on the seafloor fauna around active drilling rigs, using ROVs that are routinely in place on the rigs to do the research. This project, known as SERPENT (www.serpentproject.com), has been pretty successful and we have done research on nearly 90 visits to date. We are entirely opportunistic, getting access to whatever rigs we can, which can make structured science programmes more difficult. We have recently achieved one of our primary aims and been able to repeatedly access sites to see how deep-water communities respond to and recover from drilling over time.\nSo, what happens? The largest cuttings pile we have measured (from visual observation) has had a radius of 250 m (Jones et al. 2006) immediately after drilling. This equates to a visually disturbed area of around 0.1km2 – the size of 7 soccer pitches or a small shopping mall. The thickest part of the thickest pile we have measured was 3m thick. We have, so far, looked at recovery in two areas 1) Morvin in the Norwegian Sea (380m deep; Gates and Jones 2012) and 2) Laggan in the Faroe-Shetland Channel, North of Scotland (600m deep; Jones et al. 2012). In both of these (fairly) deep water areas there were major reductions (85% in 10 years at Laggan) in the area of the cuttings piles over time. At both sites there were also clear reductions in the animals we could see in ROV video (megafauna) within 50 m of the drilling activity. The mobile animals can swim away, but the attached or slow-moving megafauna were buried in the cuttings. Beyond 50 m, where the cuttings deposition was low, the animals fared better and there were smaller reductions in density and diversity. After the initial smothering, mobile scavengers, like prawns, move back in to the disturbed area, probably taking advantage of a feast of dead and dying animals. After 3 years at both sites there were increases in the numbers and diversity of animals coming back into the area close to drilling. At Laggan we also went back to a site that had been drilled 10 years earlier, this showed more evidence of recovery. But, even then, there was still visible disturbance (probably mostly cement) and lower numbers of animals.\nWhat does all this mean? It looks from our data that recovery is happening even in 3 years, but is not complete (if that is even possible) until at least 10 years. This brings about loads of questions: do small animals with faster growth rates and reproduction recover more quickly, is there a particular sequence of colonization of animals, are any animals critical for recovery, what happens at the really deep sites etc. etc. It is surprising to me that these studies have not already been done, after all drilling for oil is not exactly a cheap process and if even a small percentage of revenue was invested in research (like they enforce in Brazil) on these processes the companies (and regulators) could actually practise evidence-based management. Although the individual footprint of each well appears to be fairly small, particularly after a few years, with many thousand wells in existence and many more being drilled the cumulative effects of drilling should not be ignored.","Agricultural systems around the world need to adapt to the rapidly changing environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic landscapes, and new alternative practices, such as vertical agriculture, may offer new opportunities to accelerate such adaptation.\nNext Gen Farming Without Soil and 90% Less Water | GRATEFUL\nWhat is vertical farming and why is it important\nModern agricultural systems encompass an estimated 1.5 billion hectares of the world’s surface area.

The past 50 years have seen an accelerating rate of increase in these requirements as modern food production aims to increase productivity in the hopes of addressing growing food insecurity.\nLooking into the future, yield production is forecasted to decrease due to widespread environmental and socioeconomic changes that will generate unpredictable consequences on food systems.\nIn response, many strategies have been developed as alternatives to conventional agricultural practices. These strategies have focused on key principles and their combination to be effective: require less space, less water, and increase yield per unit of area. Moreover, due to the negative effects of agrichemicals, modern practices have also aimed to use significantly less to avoid potentially adverse effects for humans and animals.\nOne such alternative is the development of vertical agriculture, also referred to as vertical farming. As the name implies, vertical agriculture relies on expanding production vertically and not horizontally. Vertical agriculture is a multilayer indoor plant production system that allows for precise control of growth factors, such as light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, water, and nutrients.\nThis allows for the growing and production of crops year-round, completely independent of solar light and other external conditions. Indeed, vertical agriculture makes use of key concepts within ecology and physiology to optimize growing and fertilization within controlled conditions. For instance, elements of photobiology, thermomorphogenesis, hydroponics, and genetic breeding, are all used commonly across systems of vertical agriculture.\nBenefits, challenges, and disadvantages moving from horizontal to vertical farming\nAs a result of tight control over crop breeding, growing, and harvesting, vertical farming provides several benefits relative to conventional methods of ‘horizontal’ food production. This was the topic of a literature review by Kalantari et al. published in 2016 in the Journal of Landscape Ecology.\nFrom a systems perspective, the enclosed design prevents pests and diseases from entering by the adoption of a high level of hygiene, continuous monitoring, and non-chemical disinfection, providing security from crops. Moreover, recent technology has also allowed for automated control over environmental conditions by using sensors and imaging techniques in combination with crop simulation models and artificial intelligence, limiting the need for physical labor.\nVertical farming also allows for flexible organization, with designs ranging from large vertical walls covered with crops to large hangars or re-used shipping containers that can be transported. Consequently, vertical agricultural systems, can comprise many varying sizes and be located within many different areas from the middle of highly urbanized cities to more suburban or rural areas.\nMoreover, the verticality element of this system also provides nutrient and water flow, helping to reuse costly resources. The reduction in space also means there is a significant increase in yield per area, holding extensive potential for a future world of urbanization.\nFrom an economic perspective, vertical farming also provides for more jobs in localized areas and is community-focused by addressing the needs of immediate areas, which in turn can provide food at a lower price. Finally, the optionality of location for vertical systems also allows producers to reduce transport costs, as consumers may access them within urban areas, or transport can be minimized to nearby areas.\nHowever, despite the design, environmental, and economic advantages, vertical farming also incorporates several issues that remain a challenge to its broader implementation as a system.\nVertical farming has a high energy requirement and needs extensive investment costs to implement and develop successfully. Moreover, indoor issues relating to excessive UV, heat, and ozone-induced plant damage may have unpredictable repercussions for plant growth.\nAdditionally, vertical systems are difficult to adapt to a larger scale. They are costly to build and maintain and have yet to demonstrate the ability to provide food for larger areas than community-scale populations. This would make it difficult to implement in areas at higher risk of food insecurity, such as developing agricultural nations.\nThe lack of empirical research on a broader scale has meant that vertical farming has yet to develop past the concept stage on community levels, as persistent issues make it difficult to break through to a larger scale.\nImage Credit: YEINISM/Shutterstock.com\nGrowing skywards - the implications of vertical farming in a rapidly populating and changing world\nAmong the development of alternative agricultural practices, vertical agriculture provides a promising solution for many of the challenges facing current agricultural policies. However, for vertical systems to be integrated on a larger scale requires further technological progress and economic investment.\nNevertheless, gradually implementing more verticality, or combining it with other practices aiming for more sustainable practices may be promising. For instance, the combination of verticality with other practices such as intercropping may be particularly beneficial for developing more sustainable food systems.\nIncorporating technological progress into vertical systems also holds promise, with automated sensors and machinery able to operate near-independently. Progress in gene editing and plant genome modifications will also allow for faster, bigger, and healthier crops, allowing vertical agriculture to produce more over time.\nThroughout agricultural history, farming systems have typically spread over large spans of land, yet the reduction in arable land, as well as the increase in demand to house growing populations, means that such strategies need to be reconsidered, and vertical agriculture may play a role looking into the future.\nContinue Reading: Benefits of Vertical Agriculture and Hydroponics\n- Beacham, A.

{"question":"I want to learn bonsai for meditation! Can you tell me about the artistic and spiritual aspects of bonsai trees, and what are the key care requirements to keep them healthy? 🌳✨","answer":"Bonsai trees combine artistic expression and spiritual significance with specific care needs. Artistically, they are living sculptures meticulously shaped to create visually appealing miniature trees that evoke beauty, harmony, and balance. In Japanese culture, bonsai represents harmony, patience, and the beauty of imperfection, deeply rooted in Zen philosophy. They foster contemplation and connection with nature. As for care requirements, proper watering is crucial - rather than following a schedule, you should check soil moisture about half an inch deep and water when dry. Watering is best done in mornings or nights to avoid extreme conditions. They also need regular fertilization since they can't hunt for nutrients in small pots. During growing season, they need monthly fertilizing with compounds containing nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash. The soil must have good drainage using components like Akadama, organic potting compost and fine gravel in proper ratios.","context":["Overall, bonsai trees are special because they combine artistic expression, horticultural skill, and a deep appreciation for nature into a miniature living sculpture. They evoke a sense of harmony, tranquility, and connection with the natural world.\nBonsai trees are special for several reasons:\n- Miniaturization: Bonsai trees are meticulously cultivated and trained to mimic the shape and proportions of full-sized trees in nature. They are intentionally kept small through pruning and root confinement techniques, creating a scaled-down representation of a mature tree.\n- Artistic Expression: Bonsai is considered a living art form. Each bonsai tree is carefully shaped and styled by the bonsai artist to evoke a sense of beauty, harmony, and balance. The tree’s form, branch placement, leaf size, and overall composition are meticulously designed to create a visually appealing and aesthetically pleasing miniature tree.\n- Connection to Nature: Bonsai trees capture the essence of nature in a compact form. They allow people to bring the beauty and tranquility of trees into indoor or confined spaces. Bonsai enthusiasts often develop a deep appreciation for nature and find joy and relaxation in the contemplation and care of these living artworks.\n- Patience and Longevity: Bonsai cultivation requires patience and dedication. It can take many years, even decades, to train and refine a bonsai tree. Bonsai artists carefully prune, wire, and shape the tree over time, coaxing it to grow in specific ways. This long-term commitment fosters a sense of connection and mindfulness, as the artist and tree form a lasting relationship.\n- Symbolism and Tradition: Bonsai trees have symbolic significance in various cultures. In Japanese culture, for example, bonsai represents harmony, patience, and the beauty of imperfection. Bonsai has a rich history and is deeply rooted in traditional Japanese arts and Zen philosophy. It is often associated with contemplation, simplicity, and a deep appreciation for the transient beauty of nature.\n- Horticultural Skill: Cultivating and maintaining a healthy bonsai tree requires horticultural knowledge and skills. Bonsai enthusiasts learn about pruning techniques, root management, watering, fertilization, and other aspects of plant care. This hands-on involvement with the tree’s growth and development allows enthusiasts to develop a deeper understanding of plants and their unique needs.\nWhat’s so special about bonsai trees? What is the difference between a bonsai tree and a regular tree? Can any tree become a bonsai? What makes something a bonsai tree? Bonsai trees characteristics The height of the plant should be around six times the widest part of the stem. The stem of the plant should become thinner as it rises and should be slightly inclined towards the viewer. The stem of the plant should be like an anchor holding a plant on the ground. The curves on the stem of the plant should be very rounded and towards the viewer, and should not move on top of itself. The roots of the plant should appear as if they are spreading at the base and should not be in a way that directly catches the eye of the beholder.\nCharacteristics of Bonsai Trees\nThe top of the plant should be slightly inclined towards the viewer. Vaccines made to the plant should be in harmony with the body of the plant or should be placed towards the roots as much as possible. The top of the plant should end in the direction starting from the root so that the stem flow should be provided. For the straight and curved styles of the plant, the top of the Bonsai must be above the root level. In the curved style, too many curves should not be in a way that will disturb the beholder.\nThe higher the bonsai tree, the closer the curves should be. A bonsai tree should have only one peak. In multi-trunk trees, the trunks should not be separated from the ground. The branches should not intersect with each other or with the trunk. There should not be a branch coming from the trunk towards the viewer, the first branch should be on the right or left, the second branch on the left or the right, and the third branch on the back. The first branch on the tree should be approximately 1/3 of the tree height from the surface, and the next branches should be 1/3 the height of the tree.\nThe branches on the tree should be separated from the outer face of the slopes on the trunk. The thickness and length of the branches on the tree should decrease according to the height above the trunk, and the diameters of the branches should be proportional to the trunk. There should be enough space between the branches on the tree and the branches should not appear parallel to each other. The first and second branches on the tree should be placed in front of the middle line, and the angle between the first, second and third branches should be approximately 120 degrees.\nThe branches on the trunk of the tree should not be at the same level. The branches on the branches should be placed according to the same rules, only the branches should not go up or down. In order to give the tree an aged appearance, the lower branches should be inclined downwards. Bonsai trees with twin trunks should not have branches between the trunks.\nWhat is Bonsai Tree and Information About Bonsai Tree\nBonsai is the name given to small trees as an art developed by the Japanese. Growing it in pots at home does not lose its characteristic of being a tree. These trees, which are an expression of respect for living trees, are considered as a work of art. By pruning the branches determined by a certain method, these trees take on a miniature appearance.\nLatin Name of Bonsai Tree\nThe Latin name of this tree is also Bonsai. It is a tree belonging to the Moraceae family. Its true homeland is claimed to be Egypt. It is a type of plant used indoors. Its small size attracts the attention of many people. Therefore, it is in great demand.\nFeatures of Bonsai Tree\nA bonsai differs from other plants in its tree-like shape and appearance. First of all, it has the common characteristics of its larger counterparts in nature. Bonsai are different from ordinary potted plants. Because they look like full-grown trees, albeit on a miniature scale.","Click the link below to go to that section, or just scroll and enjoy our Ultimate Guide to Bonsai Tree Care….\nBenefits of Great Bonsai Tree Care\nAt first glance, it seems like caring for a Bonsai tree is a complicated, time-consuming hobby. The reality is, Bonsai care is easy as long as you know a few of the key things going in. Bonsai trees span a wide range of species and styles, but they all follow the same basic guidelines. Bear in mind that each species has preferences for light, water and position, and looking up information about your particular species is a good idea.\nFor more information about Bonsai care, you can also pick up books like Bonsai Basics, The Bonsai Handbook or The Complete Book of Bonsai. It never hurts to have a reference on hand when you can’t access the Internet.\nWatering your Bonsai\nIf you ask me, there are two main risks to your Bonsai. The first is that you get a little too keen and prune back WAY too much, the second is that you are not watering your tree enough (or even too much). Happily, a bit of knowledge about these two things will help your Bonsai stay alive for a long, long time.\nThis is a VERY important part of Bonsai tree care, so let’s look at a few common questions about watering your Bonsai:\nHow often should I water my Bonsai Tree?\nThis can depend on many factors such are how big your Bonsai is, what season you are in, how thick your soil is. Because of all of these factors it is much better to learn to tell when your Bonsai needs to be watered as opposed to setting a schedule (in my opinion, you should never follow a schedule).\nSo how do you tell if your Bonsai needs to be watered? Get a small pick (or any digging tool will work, as long as you don’t disturb the soil too much) and dig down about a half inch (or just over a centimetre) and simply have a look at the soil, is it moist? If it is than no need to water, but if it looks dry then grab your watering can and water away! Here comes the catch though, you don’t want to keep digging up bit of soil every few days just to see if your Bonsai needs watering, you don’t want to disturb the soil too much. Eventually you will be able to tell when your Bonsai needs watering just from instinct, you will be able to see the surface of the soil getting dry, the foliage getting a slight hue to it and you will just know your Bonsai needs a drink.\nWhen is the best time of day to water my tree?\nThe simple answer to this is, either mornings or nights. You have to adjust to your environment, but remember that your Bonsai generally won’t like extreme conditions, during the summer I like to water at nightfall and during winter I like to water in the mornings. Doing this means that the water isn’t dried up too quickly during the hot summer days, and that it doesn’t freeze (or frost) during the winter nights.\nThe water seems to go straight through the soil, is this right?\nThis is a pretty good sign actually! This means that your soil has good drainage. When you are looking at a Bonsai soil you will notice it is sometimes a little grainy, or even seems to have little rocks in it; this is because the soil needs to be able to retain water, but not to the point where the roots start to rot in it (too moist). Ideally you want a few seconds between pouring the first of the water and then having it start to drain out of the bottom. You can also use a humidity tray for your Bonsai to catch the drained water, this will help keep your display clean while also giving the Bonsai a little bit of humidity around it to absorb through it leaves (it is also a good idea to mist the leaves every now-and-again when you are watering).\nQuick Tip: The green moss you see on some Bonsais looks great doesn’t it, but it also helps keep the moisture in the soil.\nWatering your Bonsai is a bit of an art in itself and one of the main pillars of caring for your Bonsai, and while it may seem a little more complicated than you though remember that as long as you keep an eye on your Bonsai tree, you will be able to tell when it needs a good watering and not run the risk of watering too much or too little.\nChoosing the Right Soil For Your Bonsai\nIt is entirely possible to buy pre-mixed Bonsai soil online or in stores that have supplies for Bonsai care. However, buying the base ingredients and mixing them yourself allows you to customise your soil mixture for different trees, seasons and uses.\nThe three main components you will need are Akadama, organic potting compost and fine gravel. Akadama is a special clay used primarily in bonsai pots. If you cannot locate any Akadama, you can substitute in other hard clay products or even cat litter.\nDifferent Bonsai trees will need different mixtures. Deciduous trees, for example, prefer a mixture of fifty percent Akadama and twenty-five percent each compost and grit. Coniferous trees prefer a higher sixty percent Akadama and thirty percent grit, with the remaining ten percent rounded out with compost.\nYou can also adapt your soil to your climate. Wet climates should use more Akadama and grit, to enhance drainage. Drier climates should use more compost to help retain moisture so your tree doesn’t dry out.\nWhen caring for bonsai trees, remember that every tree is different. Age, climate, species and season all play a role in determining which soil mixture to use.\nFertiliser for Bonsai Trees\nTrees that grow naturally in the wild use their root systems to hunt for nutrients in the soil, expanding when the nearby soil is used up. Bonsai trees do not have this advantage, because they are kept in small pots. This means that, as part of the process of Bonsai tree care, you need to restore the nutrients in the soil with fertiliser.\nFertilisers are categorised by the NPK (Nitrogen/Phosphorus/Potassium) ratio. You will need different ratios for different points in the growing season. In early spring, a mix with more Nitrogen is valuable for promoting growth. The summertime is best for a well-rounded mix of elements. For the autumn, a low Nitrogen mix helps prepare the tree for winter. Other mixtures are good for specific purposes. A high Potassium content is good for encouraging flowers to bloom, if you have that kind of tree.\nTo ensure you get the best mixtures for your trees, you can shop for specific bonsai fertilisers. These fertilisers will have specific instructions for fertilising your Bonsai tree. Different trees will need different amounts of fertiliser, so make sure you neither over nor under feed your trees.\nShould I use a fertiliser?\nYes! I like to use a natural fertiliser on the trees (I have a worm farm so have ready access to a source of good natural fertiliser) generally before spring to make sure there are plenty of nutrients in the soil, and then about one a month through the growing season. It is important not to over fertilise though, you are growing a plant in a way that it doesn’t grow in the wild and you don’t want to burn the roots with too much fertiliser.\nFor a new tree you should test a small amount and then increase little by little through the growing season and monitor your Bonsai tree. If it looks like the tree is reacting badly to the fertiliser, flush it through with water and cut back fertilising so the plant can re-adjust.\nWhen looking to get a fertiliser for your Bonsai, make sure it contains nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash. Here is a link to some great Bonsai specific fertilisers to take out the guesswork.\nA critical part of Bonsai care is regular re-potting Re-potting your Bonsai allows you to refresh the soil and keep your tree from starving. How often do you need to re-pot The answer, like most aspects of Bonsai care, depends on the tree. Fast-growing young trees may need re-potting once every couple of years. Older trees that have reached maturity will only need re-potting every five years or so.\nTo determine whether or not your Bonsai needs to be re-potted check in the spring. Carefully remove the tree from the pot. If the root system is wrapped around the soil at the edge of the pot, the tree is struggling to stretch outwards in search of fresh nutrients. This means you need a new pot. If there is no sign of struggling roots, you can simply replace the tree in the pot for another year.\nIf your tree does need to be re-potted the early spring is the best time to do it. The tree is still dormant from the winter and damage to the roots will be minimal and easily repaired.\nSelecting a Bonsai Pot\nLots of the appeal of Bonsai tree care and art comes from the pot. You have a whole tree, though a small one, contained in an incredibly tiny pot. It is a display of how adaptable nature is to living in all circumstances. Choosing a pot, therefore, is of primary importance. The pot is as much a display piece as the tree itself.\nPots are often imported from China or Japan. Chinese pots tend to be more brightly coloured and glazed, while Japanese pots are often more subdued and made of unglazed ceramic.\nYoung trees have not yet been trained to grow in small pots, so a larger Bonsai pot is ideal. Larger pots tend to be less decorative as display pieces, as you are training the tree for later in life. Older trees that are used to growing in a small space will thrive in a small pot. For these, the pot should suit the tree itself, which is a large decision all its own.\nAs for size, a general rule of thumb is that the depth of the pot should be around the same as the width of the trunk of the tree. The exceptions to this rule, of course, are younger trees that are not adapted to shallow pots yet. Knowing this is an important part of Bonsai care.\nPests and Diseases\nBonsai trees are living things, and just like any other living thing, there are diseases and pests to watch out for as part of general and basic Bonsai tree care. Some of them are merely unsightly, while others will damage or kill the tree entirely if left unchecked. Overfeeding, under-feeding and over-watering all encourage pests. Under-watering, of course, presents problems of its own.\nFungi and viruses can also infect bonsai trees. This is characterised by a sudden dieback of branches and leaves. Quarantine the plant away from your other plants and treat it with a fungicide for best effect.\nTree Positioning and Sunlight Levels\nAs with anything else regarding Bonsai care, each individual tree is unique. Season, tree species, local climate and humidity all play roles in determining where to position your tree.\nAs a general rule of Bonsai care, most trees should be kept out of strong winds. For freshly re-potted trees, this helps prevent them from dislodging from the soil. For other trees, you simply avoid wind damage and possible tipping. An outdoor Bonsai species should be placed in a bright, sheltered area where it can receive direct sunlight for about half of the day. Indoor trees should be placed in sunny spots, though some species prefer more sunlight than others.\nCaring for Bonsai Trees in Winter\nWinter is a special time for most trees and the time you should pay most attention to your Bonsai care methods. Subtropical and tropical trees should be brought inside to protect them from the cold. Other trees enter a state of dormancy. During this dormant state, new growth is hardened and deciduous trees drop their leaves to prevent excess moisture loss. This is an important time for your tree, and preventing this dormancy can cause issues later on.\nNormal outdoor trees have roots buried so deep underground that they do not freeze in winter. Bonsai trees do not have this luxury. It is best for a Bonsai to be kept in a cold frame or in a greenhouse during the winter.\nDormant trees do not need as much water as active trees, and so you should watch how much you water. You should also frequently check for insects and diseases. Later winter or early spring is the ideal time to re-pot your tree if it needs it, as well.\nBonsai tree care is a very rewarding experience. You are taming nature and training it to live in an incredibly enclosed space. Old, well-tended Bonsai trees are beautiful pieces of art as well as living things, and the state of the tree is a visible representation of the care the owner puts into it. Bonsai care may seem like a complicated endeavour but all it really comes down to is careful management of soil and water, well-timed pruning and re-potting and a little imagination. The result is a beautiful tree and an ongoing experience of caring for a living thing."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8b333456-9054-48e8-982d-9f86b158cdbe>","<urn:uuid:d4b128c3-d789-4c07-953c-d13e43008bed>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the difference between a rigid flat foot and Policeman's heel in terms of their symptoms?","answer":"Rigid flat foot and Policeman's heel (plantar fasciitis) have distinct symptoms. A rigid flat foot does not change shape when weight-bearing and generally doesn't cause many problems - it doesn't go through excessive pronation motion. In contrast, Policeman's heel causes pain at the bottom of the heel where it connects with the ground, with pain and stiffness especially noticeable in the morning, causing patients to 'hobble' for the first few minutes. The pain can be severe, particularly after standing for long periods. Plantar fasciitis occurs in the fascia, a strong band of tissue that supports the foot's arch and acts as a shock absorber.","context":["Over-pronation describes a characteristic gait wherein a lack of sufficient support from the arch of the foot causes it to roll inwards as weight is placed on it. The long arch of the foot is\nactually a very important structure in terms of our gait and how we walk, it is responsible for ensuring that as our weight rolls from the heel to the balls of our feet it does so in a straight line\nthat doesn?t place undue stress on the ankle or knees. Unfortunately when a person?s arch is not pronounced enough, or even simply not there (a condition called flat footedness), there isn?t enough\narch support to maintain a healthy, forward motion of the foot.\nFlat feet don't automatically mean you have a problem. The problem can be divided into a flexible flat foot or rigid flat foot. The rigid flat foot is one that does not change shape when the foot\nbecomes weight bearing. i.e. it does not go through the excessive motion of pronation. Generally speaking this foot does not provide too many problems. The flexible flat foot is the type that when it\nbecomes weight bearing the foot and ankle tends to roll in (pronates) too far.

When standing, one or both of your knee caps turn inward. Conditions such as a flat feet or bunions may occur. You develop knee pain when you are active or\ninvolved in athletics. The knee pain slowly goes away when you rest. You abnormally wear out the soles and heels of your shoes very quickly.\nTo easily get an idea of whether a person overpronates, look at the position and condition of certain structures in the feet and ankles when he/she stands still. When performing weight-bearing\nactivities like walking or running, muscles and other soft tissue structures work to control gravity's effect and ground reaction forces to the joints. If the muscles of the leg, pelvis, and feet are\nworking correctly, then the joints in these areas such as the knees, hips, and ankles will experience less stress. However, if the muscles and other soft tissues are not working efficiently, then\nstructural changes and clues in the feet are visible and indicate habitual overpronation.\nNon Surgical Treatment\nOver-Pronation can be treated conservatively (non-surgical treatments) with over-the-counter orthotics. These orthotics should be designed with appropriate arch support and medial rearfoot posting to\nprevent the over-pronation. Footwear should also be examined to ensure there is a proper fit. Footwear with a firm heel counter is often recommended for extra support and stability. Improper fitting\nfootwear can lead to additional problems of the foot. If the problem persists, call your doctor to schedule an appointment.\nPronation forces us to bear most of our weight on the inner border of our feet.

A small number of people will have pain in both areas of the heel.\nThe ‘grumbling’ Achilles – non-insertional Achilles tendinopathy\nThe ‘grumbling’ Achilles is known medically as non-insertional Achilles tendinopathy. Although a rupture of the Achilles is well known, it is actually more common to have what is known as a grumbling Achilles. The pain is felt at the back of the heel above where the Achilles tendon joins the bone. It feels stiff and swollen, particularly in the morning and can prevent the sufferer from taking part in sport. Sometimes the pain is lower down where the tendon joins the bone. This Insertional Achilles tendinopathy is less common.\nPoliceman’s heel – plantar fasciitis\nPoliceman’s heel is known medically as plantar fasciitis because it occurs in a tendon called the fascia. The fascia is a strong band of tissue stretching from your heel to your toe bones. It supports the arch of your foot and acts as a shock absorber in the foot. Pain is felt at the bottom of the heel where it connects with the ground in each step. Pain and stiffness often leaves patients “hobbling” for the first few minutes in the morning. The pain can be severe, especially after standing for a long time. Plantar fasciitis is very common indeed and one of the main reasons for seeing a foot specialist.\nCauses of Plantar Fasciitis – Heel Pain\nThe causes of both types of heel pain are not fully understood, but are linked to wear and tear of the tendons and an incomplete healing process. The wear and tear, whether as a result of sport or a gradual, cumulative effect, causes the tendon to thicken. It becomes painful and inflexible. The cause of wear and tear varies from one individual, but may be due to:\n- Doing too much, particularly sport which has a high impact on the heel, such as long distance running\n- Doing too little and becoming overweight due to sedentary lifestyle and therefore putting the heel under excess pressure\nHaving very tight calf muscles. This is a problem some people are simply born with. The effect of having very tight muscles is like walking permanently on tip toes, putting the Achilles tendon and the arch of the foot under increased strain.\nDiagnosis for Plantar Fasciitis – Heel Pain\nHow do we assess the best treatment for each patient?\n“The initial assessment must be very accurate to ensure the treatment selected will be effective. We listen carefully to the patient – if they describe their heel pain as feeling like hot coal and their calf is extremely tight, we cannot expect shockwave therapy or injections to work. It would be like a boy Scout throwing a small bucket of water on a large fire.”\nMatthew Solan, Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon, the London Foot and Ankle Centre\nOur consultant orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeons will carry out a full examination of your foot. This is combined with an ultrasound scan, undertaken and assessed on the same day as your initial visit to the clinic. If for example the examination shows the calf is extremely tight, we will recommend surgical calf stretching because injections or shockwave therapy will not work.\nWe use specialist ultrasound called a Doppler scan which provides a very detailed image of blood flow in the affected area. For some patients, the scan shows a process known medically as neovascularity. The surgeon can see there are too many small vessels feeding the tendon, perpetuating the swelling and pain. Small nerves follow the vessels. If this is the case, injections are helpful.\nPlantar Fasciitis – Heel Pain Treatment\nHow is heel pain treated?\nThe first line of treatment for heel pain should always be calf stretching exercises. You should be seen by a physiotherapist who will demonstrate exactly how to do calf stretching exercises correctly. Footwear modifications can also be very helpful – simple heel cushions relieve pressure from the painful part of your heel. We recommend that you try first line treatment for two to three months before moving on to further treatment. Eight to nine out of ten patients with heel pain find the pain eases with stretching exercises.\nAt the Heel Pain Clinic, we see many patients who are still in significant pain despite trying conservative treatment. For this group of patients we offer:\n- Extracorporeal shockwave therapy\n- A course of injections\n- Surgical calf stretching\nShockwave therapy for heel pain\nIf shockwave therapy is indicated as the best treatment for your heel pain, you will have your first session during your initial visit to the Heel Pain Clinic.\nEach session takes approximately 3–5 minutes. You will lie on your front while the shockwave is applied with a machine rather like a small pneumatic press.\nPatients experience some discomfort during the procedure and there may be a little redness on the skin after treatment. Exceptionally, the heel pain becomes slightly worse after treatment before getting better. A total of three sessions are needed, with no more than one to two weeks between each session.\nWe use the latest shockwave therapy machine, called the Swiss Dolar Clast. This is more effective than older machines which focused energy on a limited area, or ‘pin-head’. The new technology works by emitting the energy like the ripples from throwing a stone into water.\nHow does shockwave therapy for heel pain work?\nIt is understood that shockwave therapy works in two ways:\n- Shockwaves cause micro damage to tissue in the affected area and in so doing, stimulate healing. Nature gets a second chance.\n- The treatment has a directeffect on the nerve endings which make them less sensitive and therefore less likely to transmit pain.\nThe benefit of shockwave therapy for heel pain is often not felt until after the third session. The treatment works well for 80 per cent of patients. The effect of the treatment is usually permanent and there is no need to return for further sessions at a later date.\nNICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) recently evaluated shockwave therapy for heel pain in August 2009. The recommendation was that the treatment is effective and should be offered, providing centres audit their results and inform patients of possible side-effects. You can read the guidelines on the NICE website: www.nice.org.uk\nWhat evidence is there that shockwave therapy for heel pain works?\nLFAC Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon Mr Matthew Solan and Consultant Radiologist Dr Andrew Carne are among a small number of UK specialists to be trained by ATRAD. This is an international Association for Radial Pain Therapy, which is at the forefront of training, researching and developing technology in this field.\nMr Solan and Dr Carne adhere to NICE guidance and also are registered with ASSERT, a data collection study for Shockwave treatment. They have both published research on their work and results.\nSurgical calf stretching\n“If you imagine the lower leg like a rasher of bacon, the calf muscle has a rind. You can only stretch the bacon itself so far because the rind remains tight and limits flexibility. If we carefully cut the rind the rasher can be stretched further. In real life the gap in the “rind” fills with scar tissue – but the rind is then longer. Surgical calf stretching is a way of stretching the tight calf muscle in a very controlled way and allow release of strain from the affected heel area.”\nMatthew Solan, Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon, the London Foot and Ankle Centre\nSurgical calf stretching, known medically as Gastrocnemius Release is an established procedure, further developed by Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon Matthew Solan for the treatment of heel pain. It is carried out as a day procedure and is minimally invasive, using a very small incision behind the knee.\nInjections for heel pain\nInjections are particularly helpful for people with neovascularity, when the Doppler scan shows there is a large number of small veins feeding a swollen tendon and perpetuating the pain. A course of three injections is normally given, with several weeks between each injection. Injections are undertaken with ultrasound guidance to ensure the injection reaches the target area."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e2b64159-0bed-4a87-b305-aa3d2e93d94f>","<urn:uuid:c9b6c070-4b81-4af6-8e5b-6d0a37f94d69>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Which research focuses more on predicting attention problems: cocaine-related inhibitory control studies or brain connectivity patterns analysis? Please list key findings.","answer":"Brain connectivity patterns analysis shows stronger predictive capabilities for attention problems. The cocaine studies mainly demonstrated that cocaine images impair inhibitory control through behavioral tests, while brain connectivity research could actually predict attention performance and ADHD symptoms through MRI scans. Specifically, researchers could predict how well people would perform on attention tasks and even ADHD symptoms in children just by analyzing their resting brain connectivity patterns. In contrast, the cocaine studies primarily showed increased inhibitory failures in cocaine users when exposed to cocaine images, particularly at short stimulus durations, but did not develop predictive models.","context":["Year of Publication\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD)\nArts and Sciences\nDr. Craig R. Rush\nCocaine users display impaired inhibitory control. The influence of cocaine-related stimuli on inhibitory control has not been assessed. The Attentional Bias-Behavioral Activation (ABBA) task uses cocaine and neutral images as cues to determine if drug-related images impair inhibitory control in cocaine users. This dissertation was designed to assess the influence of cocaine images on inhibitory control in cocaine users through the conduct of studies designed to address four aims. The first aim was to demonstrate that cocaine users display impaired inhibitory control following cocaine images compared to neutral images on the ABBA task. This was accomplished through the conduct of two experiments. The first experiment piloted the ABBA task and cocaine users completed the cocaine go (n = 15) or neutral go condition (n = 15) of the task. The second experiment consisted of two studies designed to develop a within-subjects methodology for using the ABBA task. In the first study, cocaine users completed either the cocaine go (n = 20) or neutral go (n = 20) condition of the ABBA task and all participants also completed the Cued Go/No-Go task, with geometric shapes as cues. In the second study, cocaine users (n = 18) completed the cocaine go condition of the ABBA task and a modified version of the ABBA task with all neutral images as cues to further refine a possible within-subjects methodology. The second aim was to demonstrate that inhibitory failures occur most often when cues are presented for short compared to longer durations of time. Data collected during other protocols (n = 91) were combined to investigate the influence of stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA; i.e., the amount of time a cue is presented before a target indicated a response should be executed or withheld) on inhibitory control following cocaine-related and neutral cues on the ABBA task. The third aim was to demonstrate impaired inhibitory control following cocaine images on the ABBA task is specific to cocaine users. Cocaine users (data collected in the second experiment of the first aim) and non-using control participants (n = 16) completed the cocaine go and all neutral conditions of the ABBA task and the Cued Go/No-Go task. The fourth aim was to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of inhibitory control training to cocaine-related stimuli with cocaine users. A small pilot clinical trial was conducted and cocaine users were randomly assigned to complete inhibitory control training to cocaine images or geometric shapes. Cocaine images impaired inhibitory control on the ABBA task, as demonstrated by an increased proportion of inhibitory failures in the cocaine go condition compared to the neutral go condition in Experiments 1, 2, and 4. The proportion of inhibitory failures following cocaine images in Experiment 4 was increased at short (i.e., 100, 200) compared to long SOAs. Cocaine images also impaired inhibitory control compared to the Cued Go/No-Go Task in Experiment 2, however there were no differences in the proportion of inhibitory failures between the cocaine go and all neutral conditions of the ABBA task. There were no differences between cocaine users and controls in Experiment 3 for the proportion of inhibitory failures on the ABBA or Cued Go/No-Go tasks, but controls responded faster indicating a speed/accuracy trade off occurred in the control group. Inhibitory control training as an approach to improve treatment outcomes is feasible, as indicated by attendance and accuracy on the training task, and participants rated the overall procedure as satisfactory in Experiment 5. A better understanding of inhibitory control in the presence of cocaine related cues could be crucial to better understand how drug cues contribute to the risk for relapse and the continued use of drugs because both occur in the presence of drug cues.\nDigital Object Identifier (DOI)\nPike, Erika, \"THE INFLUENCE OF COCAINE-RELATED IMAGES ON INHIBITORY CONTROL IN COCAINE USERS\" (2017).

You’re zeroed in on a task when you’re interrupted by say a friend showing you a cute cat video, or your phone dinging with a text message. After the brief distraction, have you lost your train of thought or are you able to pick up exactly where you left off, unperturbed? Attention spans vary across the population. Some people have laser focus; others are easily distracted. Monica Rosenberg, a Postdoctoral Associate at Yale University, can figure out which group you fall into from a simple brain scan.\n“Attention is crucial for navigating everyday life,” says Monica. She researches attention, investigating how we pay attention, why we lose focus, and why are some people—like those with ADHD—have a harder time paying attention than others. Monica hopes that the insights from her research can be used to improve our ability to focus and suggest new treatment targets for people with ADHD and other attention disorders. Her research recently caught the attention (pardon the pun) of Forbes Magazine, who selected her from over 15,000 nominees for their 2017 “30 under 30: Science” list.\nWhat makes Monica stand out from thousands of other young scientists is that she has developed models to predict a person’s attention span based on patterns in their brain activity. Using the method Monica and her colleagues developed, it’s possible to estimate someone’s attention span while they’re not even focusing on a task. It turns out that a person’s unique pattern of brain connectivity—the regions of the brain that are active at the same time—predicts how well they will pay attention in different contexts. Everyone's pattern of brain connectivity is unique and can be measured from data gathered while doing a task or just resting in an MRI scanner.\nTo quantify attention span, Monica and her colleagues showed participants a series of images during an MRI scan and asked them to press a button when they saw cities, but not when they saw mountains. It’s an easy assignment, but it gets pretty boring after 30 minutes. As you might expect, the results of the experiment were varied: some people performed well and others made several mistakes.\nWhen the researchers analysed the data, they discovered a correlation between how accurately the participants identified the images and patterns in their brain connectivity during the test. Monica and her coworkers created connectivity profiles for each of the participants by looking at how connected the different regions of their brains were with other regions during the image identification task. The researchers realised that certain connections were stronger in people who performed the task more accurately, while others were stronger in people who performed less accurately. With a little statistical analysis, the researchers were able to predict how well each subject performed during the task based purely on their brain connectivity during the task. Using the same statistical analysis, they were even able to predict how each of the participants performed on the task based solely on profiles of their brain connectivity while they were just at rest in the scanner.\nAttention varies widely in the population and is sometimes impaired in clinical disorders such as ADHD. To test if their brain connectivity models for attention were specific to a healthy population, Monica and her colleagues applied the same brain connectivity analysis to a data set of over a hundred children and adolescents with varying degrees of ADHD symptoms in China. They built brain connectivity profiles of the children based on resting-state MRI scans and found that the same connection that predicted performance on the cities/mountains task also predicted the ADHD scores of the children. By looking solely at scans of the children’s resting brains, Monica and her coworkers were able to predict their ADHD symptoms. This kind of research has great clinical potential to improve the daily lives of people with attention disorders. A better understanding of how brain circuitry supports attention can suggest new treatment target areas for attention disorders.\nMonica finished her PhD in 2017 and is continuing both her attention research and her career in academia. “I’ve always been endlessly fascinated with how the brain gives rise to the mind,” she says. She’s now a Postdoctoral Associate at Yale building models to predict differences in attention and cognition. She hopes to one day lead her own lab as an independent investigator.\nHer research has taken her all over the world and given her the opportunity to work with some incredibly smart and creative people. She even gave a talk at the Young European Scientists Meeting in Porto, Portugal alongside two Nobel Laureates. “It was surreal,” she exclaimed. Monica’s dream is that her work will address big questions about attention and provide insights that can improve the daily lives of millions. It seems to us like she’s on the right track.Continue reading"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:21f87239-c9ad-4ece-874a-f2521f450c36>","<urn:uuid:1ec62379-1226-4719-92ac-c1bd1d45e820>"],"error":null}
{"question":"在找全球医疗援助组织，想知道Tzu Chi和CHOP在评估援助效果方面有啥不同？","answer":"These organizations have distinct approaches to evaluating their impact. Tzu Chi has developed a systematic procedure for investigating and measuring the effectiveness of their aid, requiring commissioners to collect evidence and make cases for support at monthly meetings. They focus on helping recipients return to normal life and provide long-term support when needed. CHOP measures their impact through multiple metrics: clinical outcomes (over 10,000 patients served), educational impact (1,500+ medical students trained), research output (over 100 academic papers published), and their influence on national and international health guidelines.","context":["At 7:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning in December, volunteers from the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Association are preparing breakfast for a group of impoverished people at a park in Sunnyvale, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley. Douglas Ling, who leads the volunteers, is an immigrant from Taiwan. He settled in the area more than two decades ago and has led the Sunday breakfast in Sunnyvale for the past five years. Before he started hosting the breakfast, he never would have believed that there were so many people in need in such a wealthy area.\nLing warmly greets everyone who comes. Nearby, Abram Aznive, an Iranian hair stylist who offers free haircuts to breakfast attendees, says she discovered Tzu Chi's activities by accident and was moved. The weekly breakfast is one of the numerous activities that Tzu Chi’s volunteers have undertaken in the San Francisco Bay Area and around the globe.\nTzu Chi is one of the most influential civil and religious organizations in the non-Western world. Established by Cheng Yen, a young Buddhist nun, and several women in Taiwan in 1966, the humanitarian organization has evolved from a small local charity into a global NGO that operates in more than 90 countries. Tzu Chi works in both the wealthiest nations in the world, like the United States, and in countries facing the brunt of the most serious natural and human-made disasters, such as Afghanistan. The group’s activities range from charity service to relief work after disasters such as the 1991 flood in eastern China, the 2005 tsunami in South Asia, and hurricanes Katrina and Sandy in the United States.\nIn 2009, Tzu Chi became the first overseas NGO the Chinese government officially approved as an independent private foundation, following its more than 20 years of disaster relief and education work in rural areas in China. And during the organization’s 50th anniversary in 2016, President Barack Obama sent David Myers, director of the Center for Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships in the US Department of Homeland Security, to Taiwan to express the US government’s gratitude for Tzu Chi’s long-term engagement in disaster relief work. Given the rare prominence of Asian civil society associations in the global and transnational philanthropic field, Tzu Chi’s achievements are remarkable.\nBeyond the Cultural View\nOne of the more popular ways to explain Tzu Chi’s success is “cultural perspective”: the idea that culture functions as a self-regulating system. In this view, when government provides certain social functions below the requisite level, society will supplement these functions. Tzu Chi thus has gained momentum by, in many ways, replacing certain social welfare functions of the governments of many countries where it operates and continuing Chinese religious traditions of welfare provision.\nThis cultural perspective offers a convenient explanation for Tzu Chi’s rise, but as several critics have pointed out, it has many weaknesses. Most significantly, it often regards new social organizations as a continuation of tradition, while ignoring their new elements. It assumes that cultural values and institutions are relatively stable, and that significant cultural changes are difficult for a society to absorb, thus making social innovation hard to achieve.\nFrom this perspective, the prevalence of traditional Chinese religious culture in Taiwan may seem like an obstacle to social innovation. And indeed, many scholars have viewed Tzu Chi’s emergence not as an innovation but rather as part of a resurgence of traditional values in reaction to the unrest brought about by the democratization of Taiwanese society from the late 1970s through early 1990s. However, this popular view leaves many things unexplained, because it overlooks the importance of organizational innovation in the rise of Tzu Chi.\nMost researchers agree that early organizational structures can play an important role in determining the way that social change progresses. For example, Stanford sociologist Woody Powell, in a series of groundbreaking studies, argues that highly flexible academic and industry networks were fundamental to the rise of biotech companies in the 1990s. Similarly, University of Chicago political scientist John Padgett shows how certain innovations of the modern financial system developed due to the structure of medieval Florentine families and their business networks. Padgett and Powell elaborate on this paradigm in their 2012 book The Emergence of Organization and Market. In contrast to the cultural perspective, the organizational innovation perspective they put forward provides the necessary tools to understand Tzu Chi.\nThe Organizational Innovation Behind Tzu Chi\nThe majority of traditional Chinese religious institutions, such as temples, rely on limited sources of funds. One of the most common is “incense oil money,” which believers donate after visiting the religious site. Religious organizations use some of this money to do charitable work. East Asian nonprofit organizations in China and beyond also frequently depend on government funding to support their daily operations, and government grants often become the most important source of revenue in their budgets. Although this public funding helps nonprofits solve the immediate problem of insufficient resources, it has the negative effect of discouraging them from developing their own fundraising capacity.\nOn the other hand, government funding has never been a major source of revenue for Tzu Chi. Instead, the organization has achieved financial autonomy through an organizational innovation that I call “the decentralized funding system.” This system differs from that of traditional religious charities in its approach to both fundraising and decision-making. People who join the organization have both the responsibility to fundraise and the right to participate in the decision-making process. They are called “commissioners,” a term with a meaning similar to “board member” in a private company.\nEarly Tzu Chi commissioners, who were primarily women, came from diverse sectors. Many of them had experience in business, while others worked in government. This diversity in backgrounds, and most commissioners’ relatively high social status, encouraged a democratic culture and fostered a sense of shared responsibility. Commissioners were decision-makers, fundraisers, and social workers all at once.\nThis volunteer model was new to Taiwanese society and attracted attention from outside the traditional religious realm. Its significance as a new organizational system is evident in the differences between the way Tzu Chi and traditional culturally Chinese religious organizations conducted charity work. These traditional religious organizations did not carefully evaluate the impact of the relief they offered. They were not held accountable to their donors, and the donors often had no right to question how the temples used their money or to influence its distribution. Poverty relief work was considered an aspect of religious practice and usually occurred on New Year’s Eve.\nIn contrast, Tzu Chi held itself accountable to its donor-members and thus focused on building an effective system of poverty relief that measured its own impact. To demonstrate that a cause was worthy of receiving aid, a commissioner who supported it had to collect evidence and make the case at a monthly commissioners’ meeting. Gradually, the organization developed a procedure that guided the investigation process and criteria to determine the amount of assistance it would provide. If the commissioners approved it, the organization gave aid to help recipients return to a normal life after a setback, and, in some cases, long-term financial support to those who were unable to provide for themselves.\nThis decentralized authority structure also helped the organization build a relatively egalitarian and pluralistic organizational culture in its formative period. The organization took on the slogan “competing for social good.” Beyond the requirement that its members follow basic moral principles, it allowed them to design their own fundraising procedures and encouraged them to develop innovative ways of solving social problems. For example, some members began to collect information about the poor in their neighborhoods to facilitate their charity work. Largely due to its inclusivity and flexibility, this small charity was able to quickly scale up its activities to become a regionally influential civil society organization in less than 10 years.\nThe Limits of the Organizational Innovation\nThese crucial innovations in the early Tzu Chi organization help explain why it has been able to achieve its current global status. However, from an organizational evolution perspective, it is difficult to sustain innovation while maintaining a continuous pattern of growth. As an organization develops, the growth of its bureaucratic system can serve as an iron cage, locking its members into a rigid structure that does not give them incentives to offer fresh ideas, try out new practices, or interact with people outside of organizational boundaries.\nMost successful large organizations find it difficult to avoid this decline in creativity. And as many have pointed out, it seems that even an organization as successful as Tzu Chi may not avoid this fate. Tzu Chi's organizational culture seems gradually to have become more rigid. It now requires people to clear more hurdles, such as completing an internship, before they can become full members. It is also now more dependent on a small number of wealthy donors. However, the same organizational features that helped Tzu Chi take off, such as its diverse membership, put the organization in a better position than most to cope with the tendency toward declining creativity.\nIn a recent healthy development, Tzu Chi helped create Taiwan’s first B Corp, DA.AI, a technological social enterprise that manufactures environmentally friendly products. Developments such as this show the continued engagement of this Asian philanthropic giant with new ideas and suggest a promising future for philanthropy in Asia.","Skip to content\nHOW CAN WE HELP YOU?

The distinctive aspect is the rotation of floors that organizes homes around a terrace-patio of significant dimensions, making it a central space of each unit. The terrace serves as both an expansion and an extra room, with the living room, dining room and kitchen naturally extending towards it. With two free sides and two sheltered sides, it ensures suitable climatic comfort for the city.","context":["PRO.CRE.AR Buenos Aires Station Sector 10\n2 towers of 13 floors and a building of 4 floors of social housing in Buenos Aires.\nTOWER TOWERS / ALTERNATING THE PAVEMENTS\nThis project arises from the desire to retake the idea of the Towers in La Boca, by the architects Justo Solsona, Josefa Santos, Gian Peani and Ernesto Katzenstein (with the structure of Eng. Gallo), from the year 1956. Winning project of a national competition for construction of 300 houses in La Boca, never realized. The main idea of these buildings, of metabolist design, was the stacking of boxes alternating floor to floor, which presented a housing typology with terraces in the corners, allowing a panoramic view of the port and the city.\nThe idea for these towers is to reinterpret, in the contemporary key, that project of 4 units per floor, 4 corners. Therefore, to do it, we had, in the first instance, to resign a unit of 2 dormitories per floor, which were displaced above Building K.\nIt is in this way that the central interest of the project of towers resides in the creation and rotation of its pavements, which allows to organize houses around a terrace-patio of dimensions and proportions that converts it into a central space of the unit.\nThe terrace is the expansion, but at the same time is considered an extra environment. The living room, dining room and kitchen are naturally expanded towards it which, with two free sides and two sheltered, ensures a climatic comfort suitable for this city. So, the unit is central to the project, because a non-boxed dwelling is proposed, as a transition between an apartment and an individual dwelling.\nOn the floors are distributed two units of 2 dormitories (base unit), one of 3 and one of 1 dormitory. The 3-bedroom unit uses one of the adjoining unit, which is connected to the living room, and can also function as separate office or dormitory for the teenage son. Even if they do not reach great height, the proposed towers will have, due to their formal and architectural characteristics, a strong impact on the urban landscape.\nBUILDING K / A GREEN BAR\nFor the K typology, originally a ground-floor kiosk, and in our project a ground floor building + 3 floors, we propose a green building with an accessible garden terrace and gardened facades. There are 3 floors of 8 units of a dormitory each, and the before mentioned kiosk / bar on the ground floor.\nThis idea arises for two reasons: on the one hand, by moving these 24 units of 1 bedroom to Building K, we asked ourselves if these apartments were not being discriminated, that is, who had not the benefits of the balcony typology.\nOn the other hand, addressing the theme of the green garden terraces required for the BA Station PROCREAR, we think that the Towers do not approach a large green surface, and this is a way to compensate the cement of the towers and naturalize the whole with this building as an improvement of the proposed park.\nTherefore, to unite the same design criteria as the Towers, it is proposed to ALTERNATE the floors so that the balconies are not stacked and have the MOVEMENT, floor to floor, that they have."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:780cb6cd-636e-473a-8cfe-ccfb879090ae>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What's the key length difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption to achieve equivalent security levels?","answer":"In symmetric encryption like AES, a 256-bit key length is considered sufficient for unbreakable security. However, for asymmetric encryption to provide equivalent security, much longer keys are needed - a 2048-bit key in asymmetric encryption provides roughly the same security level as a 128-bit symmetric key. This significant difference in key lengths is necessary because asymmetric encryption relies on mathematical relationships between public and private keys that could potentially be exploited by hackers.","context":["Highly Reliable Systems, Inc. provides this compliance statement as assurance that our High-Rely backup and disaster recovery solutions conform to Federal regulatory provisions within the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule.\nThe AES-256 encryption features on select High-Rely models were created specifically for HIPAA compliance. Use an encrypting NAS such as a High-Rely NetSwap or RAIDFrame toovercome software limitations (for example: if your backup software doesn’t do encryption). Encryption is a necessary part of your data protection strategy. Compliance laws like HIPAA dictate you strongly consider using it to protect yourself and your clients.\nWe feel that the key to this is using either backup software (such as Intelliback or Shadowprotect) or hardware (such as the netswap and RAIDFrames) that encrypts all data on removable drives. While we can’t control the final configuration or what data is stored on our devices, we can provide assurances that when data is encrypted, it provides a “safe harbor” level of protection for HIPAA and other sensitive data.\nEncryption is becoming a more important topic as more companies struggle to meet compliance requirements and keep their data secure. Encryption is used more than you might expect, including for various website security functions. Backups are another important area to consider using encryption on. To completely protect your data and your backup, you should consider encrypting both the data in motion and at rest. Here are 4 things you have to know about encryption for backup that will help you understand the landscape.\nThere are 2 types of Encryption: Symmetric and Asymmetric. Our High-Rely uses symmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption means the same mathematical “key” is used for both encrypting and decrypting. A common example of symmetric encryption is AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), which is used for data at rest such as on hard drives or to encrypt private networks. By contrast, in asymmetric encryption 2 different keys are used – a “public key” for encrypting and a “private key” for decrypting. This type asymmetric encryption is referred to as public key Infrastructure (PKI) or public-key cryptography and is often used for encryption of data in motion over the Internet. Asymmetric encryption key lengths must be longer than symmetric key lengths to provide similar protection. A key length of 2048 bits is considered a very secure standard when using asymmetric encryption. However, a key length of only 256 bits using AES is considered all but unbreakable when using symmetric encryption.\nCPUs used in Netswap and RAIDFrames have hardware encryption built in to retain performance If you will be doing encryption, you should consider using special hardware or making sure you’re doing it with a CPU that has additional hardware instructions to help your performance. intelcpu Both AMD and Intel offer encryption support in hardware. This feature is called AES-NI. Starting in 2010 Intel offered their Core processor family (codename Westmere) with seven special AES instructions. Beyond improving performance, the AES instructions provide important security benefits. By running in data-independent time and not using tables, they help in eliminating the major timing and cache-based attacks that threaten table-based software implementations of AES. As you might expect, your software must be capable of using the instructions too. Many Intel i5, i7, and Xeon processors have AES-NI. A few Atom processors also have it. The difference in performance when encryption is turned on using these features can be night and day, although if you have a fast CPU doing nothing else it can sometimes overcome even it if lacks the new instructions. Use a combination of hardware and software supporting AES with a 256 bit key to insure encryption doesn’t impact your backup or recovery time objectives.\nAs a best HIPAA practice, you should not auto mount encrypted backup volumes unless the backup appliance (Netswap or RAIDFrame) is in a locked server room. If the backup appliance is physically secure, only then should you consider allowing the NAS to decrypt drives at boot time automatically. The automatic mount will provide more reliability if there is a power outage or reset scenario because the encryption key will not have to be typed in manually by the IT staff. However, if this feature is used and the entire NAS is stolen with an automount decryption key stored it means the unit could be rebooted elsewhere to gain access to the data (the decryption key is stored securely on the device). If the drives are removed and stolen, the data is still fully secure because the decryption key is needed to access data and there is no way to recover that.","Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt data. The keys are simply large numbers that have been paired together but are not identical (asymmetric). One key in the pair can be shared with everyone; it is called the public key. The other key in the pair is kept secret; it is called the private key. Either of the keys can be used to encrypt a message; the opposite key from the one used to encrypt the message is used for decryption.\nMany protocols like SSH, OpenPGP, S/MIME, and SSL/TLS rely on asymmetric cryptography for encryption and digital signature functions. It is also used in software programs, such as browsers, which need to establish a secure connection over an insecure network like the Internet or need to validate a digital signature. Encryption strength is directly tied to key size and doubling the key length delivers an exponential increase in strength, although it does impair performance. As computing power increases and more efficient factoring algorithms are discovered, the ability to factor larger and larger numbers also increases.\nFor asymmetric encryption to deliver confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and non-repudiability, users and systems need to be certain that a public key is authentic, that it belongs to the person or entity claimed and that it has not been tampered with nor replaced by a malicious third party. There is no perfect solution to this public key authentication problem. A public key infrastructure (PKI) -- where trusted certificate authorities certify ownership of key pairs and certificates -- is the most common approach, but encryption products based on the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) model -- including OpenPGP -- rely on a decentralized authentication model called a web of trust, which relies on individual endorsements of the link between user and public key.\nHow asymmetric encryption works\nAsymmetric encryption algorithms use a mathematically-related key pair for encryption and decryption; one is the public key and the other is the private key. If the public key is used for encryption, the related private key is used for decryption and if the private key is used for encryption, the related public key is used for decryption.\nOnly the user or computer that generates the key pair has the private key. The public key can be distributed to anyone who wants to send encrypted data to the holder of the private key. It's impossible to determine the private key with the public one.\nThe two participants in the asymmetric encryption workflow are the sender and the receiver. First, the sender obtains the receiver's public key. Then the plaintext is encrypted with the asymmetric encryption algorithm using the recipient's public key, creating the ciphertext. The ciphertext is then sent to the receiver, who decrypts the ciphertext with his private key so he can access the sender's plaintext.\nBecause of the one-way nature of the encryption function, one sender is unable to read the messages of another sender, even though each has the public key of the receiver.\nExamples of asymmetric cryptography\nRSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) -- the most widely used asymmetric algorithm -- is embedded in the SSL/TSL protocols which is used to provide communications security over a computer network. RSA derives its security from the computational difficulty of factoring large integers that are the product of two large prime numbers.\nMultiplying two large primes is easy, but the difficulty of determining the original numbers from the product -- factoring -- forms the basis of public key cryptography security. The time it takes to factor the product of two sufficiently large primes is considered to be beyond the capabilities of most attackers, excluding nation-state actors who may have access to sufficient computing power. RSA keys are typically 1024- or 2048-bits long, but experts believe that 1024-bit keys could be broken in the near future, which is why government and industry are moving to a minimum key length of 2048-bits.\nElliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is gaining favor with many security experts as an alternative to RSA for implementing public key cryptography. ECC is a public key encryption technique based on elliptic curve theory that can create faster, smaller, and more efficient cryptographic keys. ECC generates keys through the properties of the elliptic curve equation.\nTo break ECC, one must compute an elliptic curve discrete logarithm, and it turns out that this is a significantly more difficult problem than factoring. As a result, ECC key sizes can be significantly smaller than those required by RSA yet deliver equivalent security with lower computing power and battery resource usage making it more suitable for mobile applications than RSA.\nUses of asymmetric cryptography\nThe typical application for asymmetric cryptography is authenticating data through the use of digital signatures. Based on asymmetric cryptography, digital signatures can provide assurances of evidence to the origin, identity and status of an electronic document, transaction or message, as well as acknowledging informed consent by the signer.\nTo create a digital signature, signing software -- such as an email program -- creates a one-way hash of the electronic data to be signed. The user's private key is then used to encrypt the hash, returning a value that is unique to the hashed data. The encrypted hash, along with other information such as the hashing algorithm, forms the digital signature. Any change in the data, even to a single bit, results in a different hash value.\nThis attribute enables others to validate the integrity of the data by using the signer's public key to decrypt the hash. If the decrypted hash matches a second computed hash of the same data, it proves that the data hasn't changed since it was signed. If the two hashes don't match, the data has either been tampered with in some way -- indicating a failure of integrity -- or the signature was created with a private key that doesn't correspond to the public key presented by the signer -- indicating a failure of authentication.\nA digital signature also makes it difficult for the signing party to deny having signed something -- the property of non-repudiation. If a signing party denies a valid digital signature, their private key has either been compromised or they are being untruthful. In many countries, including the United States, digital signatures have the same legal weight as more traditional forms of signatures.\nAsymmetric cryptography can be applied to systems in which many users may need to encrypt and decrypt messages, such as encrypted email, in which a public key can be used to encrypt a message, and a private key can be used to decrypt it.\nThe SSL/TSL cryptographic protocols for establishing encrypted links between websites and browsers also make use of asymmetric encryption.\nAdditionally, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rely on asymmetric cryptography as users have public keys that everyone can see and private keys that are kept secret. Bitcoin uses a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that only the legitimate owners can spend the funds.\nIn the case of the Bitcoin ledger, each unspent transaction output (UTXO) is typically associated with a public key. So if user X, who has an UTXO associated with his public key, wants to send the money to user Y, user X uses his private key to sign a transaction that spends the UTXO and creates a new UTXO that's associated with user Y's public key.\nAsymmetric vs. symmetric cryptography\nThe main difference between these two methods of encryption is that asymmetric encryption algorithms makes use of two different but related keys -- one key to encrypt the data and another key to decrypt it -- while symmetric encryption uses the same key to perform both the encryption and decryption functions.\nAnother difference between asymmetric and symmetric encryption is the length of the keys. In symmetric cryptography, the length of the keys -- which is randomly selected -- are typically set at 128-bits or 256-bits, depending on the level of security that's needed.\nHowever, in asymmetric encryption, there has to be a mathematical relationship between the public and private keys. Because hackers can potentially exploit this pattern to crack the encryption, asymmetric keys need to be much longer to offer the same level of security. The difference in the length of the keys is so pronounced that a 2048-bit asymmetric key and a 128-bit symmetric key provide just about an equivalent level of security.\nAdditionally, asymmetric encryption is slower than symmetric encryption, which has a faster execution speed.\nHistory of asymmetric cryptography\nWhitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, researchers at Stanford University, first publicly proposed asymmetric encryption in their 1977 paper, \"New Directions in Cryptography.\" The concept had been independently and covertly proposed by James Ellis several years earlier, while he was working for the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British intelligence and security organization. The asymmetric algorithm as outlined in the Diffie-Hellman paper uses numbers raised to specific powers to produce decryption keys. Diffie and Hellman had initially teamed up in 1974 to work on solving the problem of key distribution problem.\nThe RSA algorithm, which was based on the work of Diffie, was named after its three inventors -- Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman. They invented the RSA algorithm in 1977, and published it in Communications of the ACM in 1978.\nToday, RSA is the standard asymmetric encryption algorithm and it's used in many areas, including TLS/SSL, SSH, digital signatures and PGP.\nBenefits and disadvantages of asymmetric cryptography\nThe benefits of asymmetric cryptography include:\n- the key distribution problem is eliminated because there's no need for exchanging keys.\n- security is increased as the private keys don't ever have to be transmitted or revealed to anyone.\n- the use of digital signatures is enabled so that a recipient can verify that a message comes from a particular sender.\n- it allows for non-repudiation so the sender can't deny sending a message.\n- it's a slow process compared to symmetric crytography, so it's not appropriate for decrypting bulk messages.\n- if an individual loses his private key, he can't decrypt the messages he receives.\n- since the public keys aren't authenticated, no one really knows if a public key belongs to the person specified. Consequently, users have to verify that their public keys belong to them.\n- if a hacker identifies a person's private key, the attacker can read all of that individual's messages."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:acc3faaa-366e-47ca-b870-961513731e59>","<urn:uuid:d2b20f21-e9e6-4c7d-aeeb-b6a930f885e8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Need info about corporate sustainability initiatives - what's different between UPM and Unilever's approach to measuring environmental progress?","answer":"UPM uses a comprehensive measurement system combining qualitative SDG questionnaires at the beginning of product development with quantitative Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) for product launches. Their approach evaluates multiple stages including raw materials, production, distribution, use, and circularity, with particular focus on CO2 reduction goals and material efficiency. Unilever, on the other hand, measures progress through specific numerical targets across their entire value chain, tracking metrics like percentage reduction in waste (targeting 50% reduction), greenhouse gas emissions, and water usage, though they struggled to meet several of these defined targets by their 2020 deadline.","context":["Our Sustainable Product Design concept supports and steers our product development projects, promoting a sustainable product lifecycle approach and ensuring that every new product and service we design has a proven sustainability value proposition. Our system also guarantees that we support the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\nAccording to Heikki Ilvespää, Vice President, R&D, UPM, the Research and Development team has been heavily involved in this project, along with the Responsibility team who has been actively working to strengthen the connection of our products and solutions to the SDGs. “For many companies it has been difficult to clearly show the contribution they make towards these goals.”\nOur overriding ambition in all product development work is to identify the customer’s or consumer’s problem and solve it. Our further leading principle is that customer collaboration should be initiated early in the design phase to help us find the optimal solution to every sustainability challenge.\nThe sustainable product design concept was tested on the development of lignin products in 2020. During 2021, the work continued with packaging and biocomposites, for example. Particular attention was paid to the role of products in a circular economy. UPM will also continue to explore the concept to develop novel flexible packaging solutions and sustainable fibre-based materials that can be used in nonwovens and hygiene products, among other things.\nBiocomposites as a pilot\nSuvi Rasa, Sustainability Manager at UPM Raflatac, was part of the project, and a Senior Researcher in the R&D team until October 2021. “We have been incorporating design thinking methods to this concept and brought together a group of different UPM business representatives to develop these methods. Following that work, we piloted the renewed concept with our biocomposites business.”\nMikko Lassila, Director, Business Development, UPM Biocomposites, has been involved in the sustainable product design project since its conception. “The concept was built in a small core team led by the R&D. I was a member of that team, and that is why it was only natural to choose UPM Biocomposites as a pilot,” Mikko explains.\n“Biocomposites can be considered as a start-up within a large corporation. Out of biocomposites’ two businesses we chose UPM ProFi as a pilot in this project. UPM ProFi is taking waste generated within UPM Raflatac and their customer base in Europe and turning it into outdoor decking goods. This process is very much at the heart of the circular economy and thus also at the heart of this concept.”\nUPM sustainable product design concept and sustainable product lifecycle model\nTo describe the UPM Sustainable Product Design concept, in late 2021, the company applied the following new model.\n“When designing the new concept, we had a deep dive to different design thinking approaches. We found the British Design Council’s‘ double diamond’ model closely corresponding to our thinking. So, we adopted this framework as it provides a lens to look holistically at the whole lifecycle and a way of integrating design thinking as a vehicle in product development,” says Lassila.\n“The value is that with the help of the sustainable product design model, we can carry on the conversation with brand owners and converters on how we see their product journey could go with our material. This helps them to phrase their questions on sustainability, because there are many solutions around us on a material and technological level. So, while we speak of this green transition on a bigger scale, the challenge for brand owners and converters are multiple because there are many different angles towards sustainability.”\n“We have looked at many brand owners whose products end up in recycling. It has been notable that in the last two or three years, the Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) of products have become increasingly important for brand owners.” An LCA can be used as a cradle-to-cradle methodology to assess the environmental impact of product’s life in multiple stages. “They realised they had honed the logistic chain and the production,” says Lassila. “The potential is increasingly focusing on materials. They want to know how they could hit their CO2 reduction goals.”\n“In addition to the Sustainable Product Design concept, we have also renewed our ecodesign model which is seen more like a sustainable product lifecycle. It describes a product lifecycle starting from the design phase and includes variables like raw materials, production, distribution, use, circularity and design to consider elements that contribute to product sustainability by improving circularity, material efficiency or social aspects,” Rasa explains.\n“We wanted our businesses and product developers to consider all the steps from the beginning of the product development. This detailed and qualitative SDG questionnaire is a tool that helps see which phases during the lifecycle have a positive or negative impact and to which of the SDGs the products and services are contributing. This is all done at the beginning of the product development, so it is also like a training process for product development people. Later when you are actually launching the product and you want to say something more quantitative, you can use the LCA analysis.”\nUsing the toolbox\n“When the team presented this concept to our businesses, it was warmly welcomed, and everybody expressed an interest to do and learn more. At the moment, we are proceeding one business at a time based on the potential there is in each business,” adds Rasa.\n“The concept has to motivate and support the businesses,” says Ilvespää. “And if it doesn’t, then they will not use it. The challenge for many of our businesses has been the complexity of our model. The new concept introduces a simple process and a toolbox that helps us and our customers to crystallise the value proposition - in other words, how our product contributes positively to the customer’s product portfolio.\nSuvi Rasa is happy with progress. “The fact that some of our businesses took the chance to pilot this model has been the highlight of our work.”\n“From a broader sustainability perspective, we have been able to increase the share of recycled material in our UPM ProFi products,” adds Lassila. “We also learned that in order to fully utilise the sustainable product design concept, the process has to be put into practice together with a customer as they can bring new insights.”\nFor Heikki Ilvespää, the positive outcome of all this is that the efforts have begun to pay back. “The first steps we have taken with real products look very promising. It’s really about looking at the targets first, then putting out a value proposition and only as a third step to start designing a product. Customers are now critically looking at CO2 emission reductions or aiming towards net-zero. This very nicely promotes our purpose to create a future beyond fossils.”","Unilever's Sustainable Living Plan: Putting Sustainability at The Center of Business Strategy\n| Case Code: BSTR624\nCase Length: 16 Pages\nPeriod: 1929- 2021\nPub Date: 2021\nTeaching Note: Available\n| Price: Rs.400\nCountries: United States\nThemes: Socially-responsible Business Practices, Sustainability, Competitive Strategy\nAbstract Case Intro 1 Case Intro 2 Excerpts\nThe case describes how Unilever PLC (Unilever), a multinational corporation, integrated sustainability in its business strategy and aimed to make sustainable living commonplace for billions of people globally. Unilever, of Anglo-Dutch parentage, was formed in 1930. It owned many of the world's consumer product brands in foods, beverages, cleaning agents, and personal care products. Unilever's products extended to over 190 countries around the world. The company brought in Paul Polman (Polman), an outsider, as its CEO consequent to a fall in market share and financial performance and its first ever profit warning in 2004. In 2010, Unilever started a new initiative called the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) in response to a major global trends Unilever had identified –growth in emerging markets, increasing population, environmental stress, the digital revolution and changing (urbanization) demographics. Unilever also faced a backlash for environmental destruction. The Unilever SLP initiative covered not just Unilever’s greenhouse gas emissions, waste and water use – but the impact caused by its suppliers and consumers, from agricultural growers to its packaging and waste water produced by consumers of Unilever brands. In 2020, Unilever celebrated the final year of its 10-year USLP. The Unilever SLP strategy was not successful in all sectors. The company had planned to halve the waste associated with the disposal of its products by 2020, but it managed to reduce it by only 34%. The company also could not reach to its defined target regarding GHG emissions and water usage. In its endeavor to make the company sustainable and achieve all its SLP targets, the company faced many challenges. The question experts were asking was how Unilever would be able to make sustainable living commonplace for the world’s 8 billion people and continue to be the leader in sustainable business worldwide.\nThe case is structured to achieve the following teaching objectives:\n- Explore how Unilever grew its business over the years globally\n- Examine Unilever’s sustainable living plan initiative.\n- Discuss how Unilever was making sustainable living commonplace globally\n- Analyze how Unilever was tackling social inequality and the climate crisis globally.\n- Demonstrate the need for courageous leadership and commitment to a sustainable business in building a better society.\n- Create a strategy for Unilever to achieve its aim of making sustainable living commonplace for the world’s population and retain its leadership position in sustainable business.\nThe Birth of Unilever\nUnilever Brand and Global Expansion\nPath to Growth Strategy 2000-2010: Growth Through Acquisition\nUnilever’s Sustainable Living Strategy\nUnilever Sustainability Program\nUnilever SLP Program Impact\nUnilever, Sustainability, USLP, Business strategy, Sustainable Living, Responsible competitiveness, Sustainable Business, Paul Polman, Competitive Strategy, Environment ,Climate Change , Triple bottom line, Sustainable Livelihoods\nBuy this case study (Please select any one of the payment options)\n||Price: Rs.400||PayPal (9 USD)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:03c2f0e9-14b1-4972-b6d9-4611719c89e7>","<urn:uuid:70e5f724-ac49-4fb6-b40d-5ffba7e74468>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do beekeepers protect and maintain their hives, and what diseases are currently spreading between different bee species?","answer":"Beekeepers maintain their hives using specific equipment and protective measures. They use wooden boxes filled with frames containing wax foundation sheets, where bees build honeycomb. For protection, they wear hooded suits or hats with veils, though experienced beekeepers often skip gloves. They also use smokers to calm bees by triggering a feeding response and masking alarm pheromones. Regarding diseases, research shows that honeybees are spreading infections to wild bumblebees, particularly the deformed wing virus (DWV) and the fungal parasite Nosema Ceranae. The Varroa destructor mite is believed to be the main carrier of DWV, with 88% of domestic honeybees carrying the virus, while about one in five bumblebees suffer from DWV, which grounds and eventually kills the insects.","context":["The art of beekeeping and honey production has been around for many years, in fact it has been around for thousands of years as evidenced by rock paintings reckoned to be older than 10,000 BC. Ancient Egyptians were particularly adept at the art and were recorded as such in the writings of Virgil, Gaius Julius Hyginus, Varro and Columella.\nTraditionally beekeeping was carried out for honey production, but nowadays other aspects of natural bee services are utilised such as all important crop pollination. Other useful hive products are pollen, royal jelly and propolis, which are also used for nutritional and medicinal purposes, and wax which is used in candlemaking, cosmetics, wood polish and for modelling, bee venom is used by therapists as an effective treatment of rheumatic diseases.\nIn the wild our native honeybees (Apis mellifera mellifera ) live in natural cavities such as holes in old mature trees, and also in walls, roof spaces and anywhere else that provides a secure watertight home where they can reproduce and store honey for the winter months. Honeybees also live happily in hives (artificial homes) provided by beekeepers, whose role is now an important part of conserving populations of this important pollinator species.\nBeekeepers come in three different varieties:\n- The Hobbyist - Beekeeping for pleasure as just a hobby.\n- The Amateur - More than a hobbyist, looking for a bit extra money.\n- The Commercial - Beekeeping as a main source of income.\nModern beekeepers, whether hobbyist or commercial all tend to be members of local and national associations where news, events, techniques and best practice are exchanged.\nIs beekeeping an expensive hobby? No, in comparison to other hobbies it is relatively inexpensive. The equipment needed has a long lifespan and is often aquired second hand from retiring beekeepers. A complete new hive costs less than a reasonable bicycle. Here is a list of the basics.\nThe Hive - Beekeepers normally keep their colonies in a hive, which is a set of wooden boxes filled with frames that each hold a sheet of wax foundation. The bottom box, or brood chamber, contains the queen and most of the bees; the upper boxes, or supers, contain just honey. The bees produce wax and build honeycomb using the wax foundation sheets as a starting point, after which they may raise brood or deposit honey and pollen in the cells of the comb. These frames can be freely manipulated and honey supers with frames full of honey can be taken and extracted for their honey crop. There are various designs of this moveable frame hive in use today.\nProtective clothing - Beekeepers usually wear protective clothing such as gloves and a hooded suit or hat and veil. Experienced beekeepers rarely use gloves because they make movement clumsy and can transmit disease from one hive to another. The face and neck are the most important areas to protect, so most beekeepers will at least wear a veil.\nSmoker - A necessary line of defence; protective clothing provides remarkably little protection from agitated bees. Most beekeepers use a \"smoker\" - a device designed to generate smoke that can be directed into the beehive. The bees are calmed with a puff of smoke, triggering a feeding response in anticipation of possible hive abandonment due to fire and masking any alarm pheromones. The ensuing confusion creates an opportunity for the beekeeper to open the hive and work without triggering a large defensive reaction from the occupants. Also, the bee's abdomen distends from the honey consumed and it becomes difficult to make the necessary flexes to sting.\nBees under Threat (a very good reason to keep bees!)\nUnfortunately today our native 'black bees' (Apis mellifera mellifera) are under a lot of pressure from diseases and modern agri-technolgy practices. The main reason is of course man's activities, in particular the un-natural movement of bees around the world and the ever-increasing use of crop protection chemicals and agents in the food production industries. The affect has been introduction of disease and pests that our native bees can not cope with, and slow but very noticeable change in neuro - physiological behaviour. The result is devastating effects on the normal bee life cycles and behaviours, particularly their reproduction and fertility levels, and geographical location abilities, all so essential to their existence.\nWhile beekeepers can work with 'hived' bees and the various organisations to redress these issues, there is little we can do to aid the wild and native colonies of bees that are being affected besides ensuring that 'hived' colonies are healthy ones and that there are enough numbers to supplement wild losses. Research is going on to monitor feral (wild) bee populations to identify if a natural genetic resistance to the Varroa problem exists.","Bumblebee Mystery: What Is Killing the Bees?\nWhat is killing bees is a real bumblebee mystery. Something is killing off bees, both the wild bumblebee and its domesticated cousin the honeybee. Scientists believe they have found the reason why. Two diseases that are common in domestic honeybees are being found in the wild bumblebee population. These infections may explain why there has been a recent decline in the global bee population. One of the diseases is the deformed wing virus (DWV). The other disease is a fungal parasite, Nosema Ceranae, a microspore, which was less prevalent according to the researchers.\nA study conducted by Mark J.F. Brown of Royal Holloway University at London, found that the Varroa destructor mite that infects honeybees could be the main culprit of the virus. They looked at 26 different sites across England and found that one in five bees suffered from the DWV. The virus grounds the insect and eventually kills it.\nResearchers further found that 88 percent of the domestic honeybee population actively carries the virus and that the virus replicates. They believe that foraging from the same flowers is what caused the bumblebees to get infected; another way that the infection may be passed along is when the bumblebee raids the competitor’s hives. Brown stated that the bee population has been declining in North and South America, Europe, as well as Asia.\nOne reason that researchers are concerned about the decline in the bee population has to do with the fact that bees commercially pollinate about 90 percent of crops throughout the world. A service that is valued at $14 billion annually. While the honeybee population is important, Brown cautions that the bumblebee population is just as important. He stated that the wild bee population is responsible for a significant fraction of the pollination that takes place. The mystery of what is killing off the bumblebee has been around for the last few decades with major declines in the insect population leaving researchers baffled about what is happening to the bees.\nThe study suggested that at least a third of the honeybee population was infected with the virus, and a full 11 percent of bumblebees are also infected. Other studies suggest that it is not just the virus that the bees are spreading that is causing the widespread disappearance. A blight on the soy bean crop is also believed to have jumped from soy beans into bees in the form of a virus that is adding to the decline.\nAnother study last month suggested that pesticides which are widely used in the United States could be to blame for some of the reduction in the bee population. At least 35 pesticides are linked to compromised immune systems that are causing the bees to be more susceptible to certain types of diseases. In the United Kingdom destruction of the bees’ natural habitat is also playing a pivotal role in the decreasing number of bees. Researchers are anxious to solve the mystery behind what is killing the bees, not just for the bumblebee population, but also because of the long-term ecological effects of these insects becoming extinct.\nBy Rachel Woodruff"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5c230fdc-4a56-473a-9e35-0ffa5e097cf3>","<urn:uuid:87da8f6d-fb5c-43cc-bbd8-e64cc5affb9c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the immediate physical side effects of fertility drugs during treatment, and how do success rates vary for women over 40 using their own eggs?","answer":"During fertility treatment, patients commonly experience physical side effects like headaches and hot flashes during the down-regulation phase due to low estrogen levels. When moving to stimulation, these symptoms often subside but patients may experience mood changes, fatigue, and dull aching in the lower abdomen. Local injection site reactions are rare, with only occasional rashes that are usually self-limiting. Regarding success rates for women over 40 using their own eggs, they decline significantly with age - at age 40 the live birth rate is about 16%, dropping to 5% at age 43 and just 1% over age 44. This decline is primarily due to reduced egg quality and quantity, with about 60% of eggs being chromosomally abnormal at age 40, increasing to 90% by age 44.","context":["What side effects to fertility drugs have?\nSide effects are very important considerations of patients and as part of the consultation we spend a considerable amount of time taking patients through understanding what they may experience. Referring back to what side effects you may experience will again depend on what protocol you will be using and what drugs will be used in his part of the treatment.\nReferring back to what side effects you may experience will again depend on what protocol you will be using and what drugs will be used in his part of the treatment.\nAs far as broad principles, if you’re using a down-regulation or a long protocol, we will be using injections like Buserelin, or nasal spray such as Naferelin, where the side effect profile is very similar.\nThe purpose of what we’re trying to achieve here is we’re trying to shut down the ovaries for a short period of time which stops the natural follicle recruitment and then we can take over the control of the cycle when we come to the stimulation phase. The side effects that you would experience comes from low oestrogen levels because of these treatments.\nYou may experience headaches or hot flashes. These are the common ones but some patients may experience changes in mood but the majority of these symptoms are a more about quality of life. They are not serious or life-threatening and they can be managed easily by maintaining good fluid intake. You can take simple analgesics such as paracetamol during the down-regulation phase without affecting the outcome of the treatment.\nWhen we move on to the stimulation phase some of the side effects that you’re experiencing such as headaches and hot flashes will settle because now the oestrogen levels in the body increase rapidly, much more than what it actually is there. The majority of hot flashes and head aches should settle. However, what you might not see would be more mood changes and mood swings.\nSome patients may respond by having a low mood, some experience getting fatigued and tired easily, while some may not experience any side effects at all. As you come closer to the egg collection you can start experiencing some dull aching in the lower part of the belly. That’s nothing to do with the drugs, but more related to the ovaries responding to this stimulation drugs that stretches the lining of the belly and gives rise to the dull ache before the eggs are ready for collection.\nMoving further on into the treatment, after the egg collection when you start using the progesterone supplements either as a pessary suppository or as an injection, the progesterone in itself can give you certain side effects. Again, the majority of them is more related to low mood changes. That’s one of the most common ones.\nYou may be using lots of injections as part of the treatment but the good news is that there are very few local injection site reactions. At most, we might see a rash, and the rash is usually self-limiting. We generally do not change medications because of minor symptoms such as rash, but we will certainly keep an eye on it.\nThese are some of the side effects you may broadly experience. Obviously, this is not an exhaustive list. It depends again, on the medications and the individual interaction your body with each of the drugs that have been used.","For many, the possibility of getting pregnant after a certain age seems unattainable. However, pregnancy after 40 is possible for some women, whether naturally or assisted with a treatment like IVF. The IVF success rates over 40 with own eggs do drop pretty significantly, but success shouldn’t be ruled out entirely.\n- What factors affect IVF success rates over 40?\n- Donor Eggs vs Own Eggs & IVF Success Rates Over 40\n- How to Increase IVF Success Rates Over 40\n- IVF Success Rate Over 40 with Own Eggs by Clinic\nWhat factors affect IVF success rates over 40?\nWomen 40 and over encounter lower success rates in regards to all fertility treatments, including IVF. In short, IVF success rates over 40 with own eggs significantly different from success rates under 40. However, certain factors change the success rates.\nOver the age of 40, birth rates steadily and rapidly decline, on average. To put things in perspective, in 2014, the live birth rate for patients age 40 with own eggs was 16%. At age 43, the live birth rate dropped to 5%. Over 44, the live birth rate dropped further still, to 1%. At the same time, some clinics have much higher rates than these; they are specialty clinics with specific programs for this age group.\nWhat makes IVF success rates over 40 with own eggs lower than average?\nMany people ask questions related to why IVF success rates over 40 are lower than the success rates for younger women. To answer them, we have to consider what makes IVF successful in the first place.\nIVF success with own eggs depends on fairly good numbers of healthy, viable eggs. In other words, both egg quality and egg quantity matter. As women age, both of those factors get impacted. Fewer eggs develop, and of them, fewer eggs are of excellent quality.\nAccording to some experts, one of the primary ways age impacts egg quality relates to chromosomes. Eggs with an abnormal number of chromosomes lead to failed IVF transfer. As women age, the potential for an abnormality in chromosomes increases very steadily. “At age 30 about 30% of eggs are chromosomally abnormal. By age 40 about 60% are abnormal and by 44 years old 90% are abnormal.” (Advanced Fertility).\nThus, due to the likelihood of a lack of viable eggs, IVF success rates over 40 with own eggs drop and continue to decline the older a woman gets.\nDonor Eggs vs Own Eggs & IVF Success Rates Over 40\nWhile all of the above information is true regarding own eggs, it isn’t true when it comes to IVF success with donor eggs.\nWomen over 40 who use IVF to become pregnant stand a very good chance of success if they use donor eggs. The live birth rates for women using donor eggs vary only slightly between the ages of 30 and 47. This means that when women over 40 use donor eggs, their chances of success remain largely the same, barring other factors.\nA woman in her 30s using donor eggs has almost the same likelihood of IVF success as a woman in her 40s who uses donor eggs.\nThis information shows even more clearly that the cause of the decline in IVF success rates over 40 is almost solely to do with donor eggs. A woman’s ability to carry and deliver a baby over 40 isn’t much different than a younger woman’s ability. The difference has to do with egg quality and quantity. That’s why fertility specialists recommend IVF with donor eggs when a woman is age 40 or older.\nExperts believe that while the age of the eggs matter, the age of the uterus doesn’t. At least, it has very little to do with IVF success rates over 40 with donor eggs.\nWhen choosing a donor for eggs, women should choose a woman that is younger and with few health issues. IVF success depends so much on healthy, viable eggs, that whoever you choose to donate eggs for the procedure should be in optimal health and age.\nHow to Increase IVF Success Rates Over 40\nSome IVF clinics specialize in IVF after 40 and provide women with tips and information to increase the IVF success rate. They say that are a number of things women and their doctors can do to increase the chance of success.\nChoose Donor Eggs\nTo significantly increase IVF success rates over 40, consider using donor eggs. As previously described, donor eggs from healthy, younger women generally lead to better success. If you remain open to the possibility, your chances of success go up.\nDonor eggs increase the chances of success by upwards of 70 percent in some cases. The difficulty in choosing egg donation lies in the emotional attachment many people have to the dream of a biological child. Choosing donor eggs can be difficult for many people. For those who’ve struggled for many years to conceive, it is sometimes the only option.\nIf a woman is over 42, the likelihood of pregnancy with own eggs sharply declines. Also, note that many IVF clinics limit the age for treatment to 45, after which a patient must choose donor eggs. This is because the chance of success using a woman’s own eggs after 45 is 1% or less.\nConsider Mini IVF Procedures\nSome patients choose Mini-IVF, a procedure which requires a smaller amount of fertility medication and aims to produce one to three viable, healthy eggs. Some experts believe Mini-IVF improves IVF success rates over 40 because mini-IVF results in better-quality eggs and embryos. Regardless, the reduced cost of the treatment can be beneficial.\nSupplement with DHEA\nThough it is not talked about often, DHEA supplementation provides several potential benefits that increase chances of success over 40. Benefits include better and more eggs, higher rates of natural pregnancy, fewer miscarriages, more successful IVF cycles, and a smaller chance of chromosomal abnormality.\nSome IVF clinics suggest that DHEA supplementation could potentially eliminate the need to use donor eggs for some women.\nOpt for Earlier Egg Retrieval\nRetrieving eggs earlier in women over 40 improves the chances of positive outcomes and IVF success rate. Some IVF clinics state that, sometimes, eggs in women mature too quickly. As a result, by the time fertility specialists retrieve the eggs, they are not viable or healthy because they have matured too much. So, the clinic suggests that doctors working with women closely monitor the ovarian cycle in order to better control the timing.\nMake Lifestyle Changes\nSome fertility specialists suggest that making appropriate lifestyle choices improves IVF success over 40 with own eggs or donor eggs. Changes in diet, smoking habits, and weight loss can have an impact. Cutting smoking, for example, dramatically improves odds of success. Women who smoke require twice the number of IVF treatments. Additionally, smokers need to take more fertility drugs than non-smokers and experience more failed implantation cycles.\nSuggested lifestyle habit changes include:\n- Quit smoking at least 3 months before fertility treatment\n- Lose weight, if you are overweight (may increase chances of success)\n- Exercise regularly\n- If you’re underweight, seek help getting to a normal weight range\n- Take supplements\n- Cut excess sugar or unhealthy food out of your diet\nChoose a Specialty IVF Clinic for Over 40\nSuccessful IVF involves choosing a clinic that specializes in pregnancy. These best IVF clinics for over 40 typically have much higher success rates. In all likelihood, the clinic’s team does a good job of screening patients before making IVF attempts. The team probably spends a great deal of time determining which fertility diagnoses have the best possible IVF success rate.\nClinics with older pregnancy specialties are also likely more equipped, and knowledgeable about treatments specific to that age group.\nSome clinics have an IVF success rate of 60% or higher for older women. If a clinic’s success rate in the demographic is very low, keep searching for a clinic with better outcomes. Many reputable clinics publish this information online. If not, you can research it in the IVF success rates table.\nSome clinics specialize in IVF treatments in older women, because the procedures and practices require special attention. Fertility specialists may also recommend certain IVF treatments with higher chances of success in older patients.\nGet Help Sooner\nWomen over 40 who are experiencing fertility challenges need to seek help as soon as possible. Age does matter when it comes to pregnancy. Even if a couple is unsure about whether or not IVF is right for them, sooner is better than later in these cases.\nExperts suggest that after IVF three or four months with no successful pregnancy, you should get a consultation or consider fertility testing. This includes hormone testing for egg equality and potential early menopause.\nSet up a consultation with a high success rate IVF clinic in your area that specializes in pregnancy over 40.\nIVF Success Rate Over 40 with Own Eggs by Clinic\n*The following IVF success rate reports are base on the latest CDC data published in 2019 with 20 or more transfers.\nIVF Success Rates at 41-42 with own eggs (nondonor eggs)\nAverage live births rate at 41-42 with own eggs is 27.9% in total 4,389 IVF transfers.

{"question":"How do corn yields compare between well-drained summit positions and narrow ridge spacing of 45cm?","answer":"Corn performs differently in these conditions. In terms of landscape position, corn grain and stover yield was highest on well-drained summit positions. Regarding ridge spacing, narrowing the ridge spacing from 75cm to 45cm enhanced grain yield by 17-24%. The 45cm ridge spacing produced higher total dry matter - specifically 14% and 34% higher than 60cm and 75cm spaced ridge sown crops respectively.","context":["Creating a Multifunctional Agricultural System\nMADISON, WI — The emergence of biofuels into agricultural systems presents new opportunities for farmers to improve economic return while providing critical ecosystem services. Integrating perennial crops can help meet food, fuel and fiber needs, but will require an understanding of biomass productivity on specific landscape positions and environments. To diversify their farms, farmers will need to know where their crops will give them the best yield.\nLandscape processes, such as hill slope length and gradient, water retention and flow patterns, and soil properties have been shown to influence crop yield. In recent years, the process of describing and analyzing landscape terrain features has become more accurate and precise due to advances in Geographic Information Systems technology, allowing farmers and landowners to explore new cropping systems design strategies, such as directed placement of annual and perennial crops.\nScientists at the University of Minnesota led by Gregg Johnson investigated differences in woody and herbaceous crop productivity and biomass yield as a function of landscape position at the field scale. Results from this study were published in the 2010 March-April issue of the Agronomy Journal. The journal is published by the American Society of Agronomy. The study was supported by the Initiative for Renewable Energy and the Environment at the University of Minnesota.\nThe researchers sleeved seven varying landscape positions to represent a range of topographical features common to the region with varying soil moisture and erosion characteristics. Within each landscape position, a series of woody and herbaceous annual and perennial crops were planted. Crops included alfalfa, corn, willow, cottonwood, poplar, and switchgrass.\nThe results of this study demonstrate that hillslope processes influence biomass productivity. Corn grain and stover yield was lowest in flat and depositional areas that retain water for longer periods of time and highest on well drained summit positions. Corn grain yield was not significantly influenced by any of the soil or terrain attributes tested, but corn stover yield was positively influenced by nitrogen, soil darkness profile, and terrain slope.\nWillow productivity, on the other hand, was among the highest at the depositional position and lowest at the summit position. Alfalfa and poplar productivity was highest at a site characterized by a relatively steep slope with potentially erosive soils. Understanding landscape position preferences of crops could allow for more efficient use of field space that reduces the risks of traditional agriculture.\nThis research will help to develop a multifunctional approach to agricultural land management where environmental and ecological components are considered, based on a sound economic foundation. For example, a desire to improve water quality or wildlife habit while maintaining productivity and profitability may define decision making in this context.\nIncluding perennial crops as part of the overall cropping system is one option for improving profitability while meeting water quality and/or wildlife habitat goals. Overall, this study represents a novel approach to the design of cropping system strategies that lead to optimizing the landscape through a deeper understanding of site-specific crop growth in the context of economic, environmental, and social goals.\nOn the Net:","Ahmad, Manzoor (2010) Influence Of Ridge Spacing And Plant Density On Productivity Of Different Maize Hybirds. PhD thesis, University Of Agriculture, Peshawar.\nTwo sets of field experiments were conducted each during autumn 2006 and 2007 to investigate the influence of varying ridge spacing and planting density on growth characteristics, agronomic and yield traits, quality of grain, and nutrient up-take patterns of diverse maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids. Another objective was to optimize planting density for good harvests of maize grown on narrow (45 cm and 60 cm) as against conventional (75 cm apart) ridges In Experiment-I three diverse maize hybrids, DK-919 (early maturity), DK-5219 (medium maturity) and Pioneer-30Y 87 (late maturity) were planted at ridges spacing of 45, 60 and 75 cm each. In Experiment-II, maize hybrid DK- 919 was planted at three inter ridge spacing of 45, 60 and 75 cm as main plot and 15, 22.5 and 30 cm intra-ridge spacing imposed as sub plots. Both the experiments were quadruplicated and each sub plot consisted of 6 rows of 7.0 m length. Results revealed that DK-919 recorded total dry matter (17409 kg ha-1) that was 19% and 8% higher than DK-5219 and Pioneer-30Y87, respectively. Maize planted at 45 cm ridge spacing produced 14% and 34 % higher total dry matter than that 60 and 75 cm spaced ridge sown crop. Plant spacing of 15 cm produced 42 and 22% higher dry matter than that recorded for 30 cm and 22.5 cm plant spacing. Early maturing hybrid, DK-919, realized 17 and 6%, higher grain yield than mid and late maturity maize hybrids, respectively. Early and late maize hybrid performed best at 45 cm ridge spacing while mid season hybrid did best at 60 cm ridge spacing. Narrowing the ridge spacing from 75 to 60 cm increased grain yield by 11-18 % while further decrease in ridge spacing from 60 cm to 45 cm resulted in 6-8% increase in grain yield. Decreasing ridge spacing from 75 cm to 45 cm enhanced grain yield by 17-24 % in both the experiments. Reducing intra ridge spacing from 30 cm to 15 cm enhanced grain yield by 25%. Highest grain yield (7606-7027 kg ha-1) was obtained at plant spacing of 60 cm x 15 cm (11 plants m-2) and was followed by 10 plants m-2). DK-919 exhibited higher HI as compared with DK-5219 and Pioneer-30Y87. Harvest indices improved initially with narrowing the plant and ridge spacing but declined when planting densities were increased further. Yield components as number of grains per ear and 1000 grain weight were significantly varied among maize hybrids and with changing ridge and plant spacing during both the growing seasons. Grain yield was linearly related to number of grains per unit area during both the season and regression accounted for about 90-98% of variation in grain yield. Tall and late season hybrid Pioneer 30Y87 exhibited higher LAI values. Differences in LAI between maize hybrids and ridge spacing remained significant throughout growth period and reached the maximum value of 5.33, 5.83 and 6.19 at 45, 60 and 75 cm ridge spacing, respectively. Highest LAI values corresponded to the anthesis time of the crop. Seasonal accumulation of TDM was higher until 60 DAS. Then there was a steady decrease in accumulation of TDM in all the hybrids and at all ridge spacing. Highest seasonal accumulation of TDM was recorded at planting density of 45 cm x 15 cm. Short season hybrid DK-919 had higher NAR than mid or late season hybrid. Narrow rows (45 cm) had higher NAR values than wider ridge spacing.Early maturing maize hybrid DK-919 had higher CGR than that DK-5219 (mid) and Pioneer-30Y87 (late). TDM production was positively and linearly related with total seasonal LAD in both the seasons.Total seasonal LAD explained 98% of variation in TDM production. In general, decreasing ridge and plant spacing enhanced CGR.Pioneer-30Y87 had highest grain oil content when planted at 75 cm ridge spacing. DK-919 had highest grain protein content when planted at 75 cm spacd ridge. DK-5219 and DK-919 planted each at 45 and 60 cm ridge spacing had highest and similar grain starch % than Pioneer-30Y87. Grain oil contents were reduced at narrow ridge and plant spacing (higher planting densities). Highest grain oil content was recorded at wider ridge (75 cm) and plant spacing (30 cm). Grain protein and starch contents decreased with narrow ridge (45 cm) and plant (15 cm) spacing. Results on nutrient uptake patterns revealed that DK-919 recorded higher N, P and K uptake than DK-5219 and Pioneer- 30Y87 at all growth stages. Narrowing the ridge and plant spacing resulted in improved nutrient uptake that was highest at 45 cm ridge and 15 cm plant spacing. On the basis of two years result, it is concluded that maize hybrid DK-919 (early maturing) should preferably be grown at narrow ridges (45 cm) for obtaining high yields. Mid season hybrids like DK-5219 need to be planted at 60 cm ridge spacing while late season hybrid as Pioneer-30Y87 reflected an increasing trend in yield with narrowing ridge spacing in these studies. For higher yield goals, autumn planted hybrid maize can be sown at plant spacing of 60 cm x 15 cm (11 plants m-2).\n|Item Type:||Thesis (PhD)|\n|Uncontrolled Keywords:||Experiments, Field, Variation, Plant, Influence, Different, Nutrient, Seasonal, Hybirds, Maize, Productivity, Planted, Grain, Yield, Density, Spacing, Ridge|\n|Subjects:||Agriculture & Veterinary Sciences(a) > Agriculture(a1)|\n|Deposited By:||Mr. Javed Memon|\n|Deposited On:||19 Dec 2011 10:37|\n|Last Modified:||11 Mar 2015 15:37|\nRepository Staff Only: item control page"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f2eab8bc-f439-464b-b67f-33f926276933>","<urn:uuid:7b85637f-ea4c-4d22-9d1d-bad72476d489>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the durability difference between waterproof aluminum decking and slate roofing? Can you explain which one lasts longer?","answer":"Both waterproof aluminum decking and slate roofing are highly durable materials, but slate roofing generally has a longer lifespan. Aluminum decking is resistant against warping, rotting, and environmental damages, requiring minimal maintenance. However, slate roofs can last up to 100 years or more with proper care and maintenance, with an average lifespan of about 60 years in ideal conditions. Slate roofs are particularly durable, especially the hard slate variety which is strong and ideal for harsh weather conditions. While both materials are resistant to water damage, slate has the additional benefit of being fire resistant.","context":["Having a deck can be a nice addition to your home. It can serve as your cozy receiving area for your guests. The deck can also be a place where you can spend your alone time, sipping on hot coffee and a book on hand.\nHowever, your deck flooring can be prone to damage due to outside elements such as rain and moisture. That is why it is a good idea to consider waterproof decking options to protect the flooring and last for years.\nAll about waterproof decking\nFirst of all, waterproof decking is installed underneath an existing structure. It is usually combined with a gutter system that lets running water flow and avoid creating moisture that can damage the structure’s material. This decking option makes the space underneath the structure to be dry and usable all the time.\nWaterproof decking is ideal for balconies and elevated decks. It is usually made from a special aluminum material that offers durability and low maintenance needs. It also comes in different color options and provides a non-slip surface. In installing waterproof decking, it is better to hire professional installers to do the job.\nBenefits of using waterproof decking\nThere are many noted benefits of using waterproof decking. First of all, it is obviously its waterproof properties. Meaning, it would deter the existing structure from absorbing moisture that can damage or degrade the wood material. It can also prevent the formation of mold and mildew that can be hazardous to one’s health and safety.\nSince waterproof deckings are usually made from aluminum material, it can surely last for many years with minimal maintenance. Aluminum is also resistant against warping, rotting, and other kinds of environmental damages. Plus, it’s a lightweight yet durable material. No wonder aluminum is one of the most sought-after building materials ever since.\nIn addition, waterproof decking is generally easy to install. You can opt to install it by yourself as long as you have basic installation knowledge. On the other hand, you can hire professional installers to install the waterproof deck.\nTypes of decking materials\nAside from aluminum, there are other different types of decking materials you can choose from. Among popular ones include the following.\nThis is one of the most popular decking material used by many households. It can be made from different types of wood such as hardwoods, cedar, or pine. Make sure to add sealer on its surface to preserve its quality for longer.\nIt is usually made from a combination of wood fiber and plastic. It can also be stained for coloring options. Some also come with plastic encasements to deter the growth of mold and mildew.\nThis type of decking material is ideal for deterring harsh elements and avoid staining the material. It may be made from polyethylene or PVC and is also lightweight.\nThese are among the common types of decking material. Choose the best option for your need, one that will suit your budget, and will ensure to last for years.","Whether it’s time to replace your roof or you’re building a new home, the roof you choose is essential to the longevity and visual appeal of your home. There are many roofing materials to choose from, including asphalt, which is the cheapest and most common, to tile and slate, which are more expensive.\nIn this article, we look at the slate roof and why it’s a good value for the price, and why you should consider this option when choosing a new roof for your home.\nWhat is a Slate Roof?\nSlate tiles are constructed from rock which comes from volcanic ash and clay. Slate roofs are among the oldest used and date back centuries because of the availability of the material and the longevity of the tiles. There are slate roofs built hundreds of years ago that still hold up to this day.\nThere are two types of slate roofs available — hard and soft. The hard variety is strong and durable, making it ideal for areas that experience harsh weather. Hard slate tiles are also fire resistant and don’t absorb water, which makes them less prone to warping.\nThe soft slate tile isn’t as durable as the hard slate, but it does retain the fire and water resistance of hard slate. People may opt for the soft variety because it is somewhat less expensive while providing much of the same advantages.\nHow Long Do Slate Roofs Last?\nAs mentioned, slate roofs can last for a hundred years or more with proper care and maintenance, and many factors come into play when discussing the longevity of a slate roof. On average, a well-maintained slate roof in ideal conditions lasts about 60 years.\nWeather plays a significant factor in the longevity of slate roofing tiles, and you will have to replace the underlay about every 30-40 years to maintain the health of the roof and the integrity of the tiles. Also, the longevity is mostly dependent on the maintenance you do, taking care to fix small problems before they turn into large ones down the road.\nWhat is the Cost of a Slate Roof?\nOne reason many people steer clear of slate roofs is the cost, and to be fair, it is one of the more expensive roofing tiles you can buy. If your current home has a slate roof, the cost to upkeep it is minimal, and you likely won’t have any large expenditures during ownership.\nHowever, if you’re installing a brand new slate roof, you can expect to pay about $1,500 per square, and in roofing terms, a square is a 10×10 foot area. By way of comparison, asphalt shingles typically cost about $200 per square, so you can see why so many people opt for asphalt over slate.\nAnother thing to consider when talking about the cost is the installation. Asphalt shingles are ubiquitous, and almost every contractor is familiar with this material. Because it’s so widely available, and because of its familiarity, the labor cost to install an asphalt roof is relatively cheap compared to more exotic materials such as slate or concrete.\nAlso, since not every roofing contractor is skilled at installing slate, you need to hire one who has the experience, which means higher labor costs. You don’t want to cut corners on a slate roof installation because doing so will cost you more money in repairs due to a shoddy job down the road.\nCommon Issues with Slate Roofs\nWhile slate roofs sound like the perfect option, if you want a long-lasting roof that offers protection against fire and the elements, there are some disadvantages to installing these as well.\nThe major disadvantage, as mentioned above, is the cost of the tiles themselves and the cost of labor for installation. Depending on the type of slate you decide to install, the roof can cost anywhere from $1,000 to $6,000 a square installed. Also, as mentioned, not every roofing contractor has experience installing slate roofs, which makes it more difficult to find a qualified installer in some areas.\nThickness of Tiles Can Be Uneven\nAnother disadvantage to slate tiles it that they’re sometimes not gauged, which means the thickness varies from tile to tile.\nSlate Tiles are Heavy\nThe weight of the roof is also something to consider. Slate tiles are heavy, and the deck of the roof needs reinforcing to deal with the weight. Slate roofs can weigh up to 1,500 pounds, and you’ll need an inspection of your roof’s support system to make sure it can handle the weight before you go down that road.\nDifficult to Find Tile Replacements\nFinally, slate roofing tiles can become damaged if you have roofers who have to go up and work on the roof. If tiles get broken, it can be challenging to find a replacement that matches the exact color.\nDo you Need a Contractor to Fix your Slate Roof?\nThe best advice if you want to keep your slate roof in tip-top condition is to hire a professional when you need fixing or maintenance; however, because of the high cost, you can usually handle minor repairs and fixes yourself if you know what you’re doing. When you have your slate roof installed, ask the roofing contractor if they offer a maintenance package or maintenance services to keep the roof in shape.\nThe good news is because slate doesn’t warp, corrode, or attract mold, it doesn’t require as much maintenance like other roofing materials. Make sure you keep trees that overhang the roof trimmed to avoid any damage caused by falling branches and be aware of animals that may climb up on the roof and crack the tiles. Other than that, you should be fine.\nSlate is a gorgeous and durable roofing material that is sure to give your home value and curb appeal. If you’re willing to shell out the high up-front expense and take care of it, you will have a roof that will likely last your entire lifetime."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4fd9d60f-7479-4283-ace9-511ee1e9b6cb>","<urn:uuid:4a7f4ee5-bd06-4f31-80cc-073061e12bc2>"],"error":null}

They provide guidelines on managing erosion and sedimentation problems and practical techniques to integrate channel stabilisation engineering and ecological restoration.","context":["River Restoration Manual\nThis series of guidelines provides a guide to the nature, rehabilitation and long-term management of waterways in Western Australia. The chapters of the series collectively form the River Restoration Manual. The manual is based on the teachings of the successful river restoration courses, which have been run for river managers in the past (between 1996 and 2010).\nThese guidelines are intended to be used by river restoration group coordinators and other people who are actively involved with river restoration. For more general information on waterways management topics, the relevant Water notes are recommended.\nThe manual currently consists of 18 sections which can be downloaded individually (from links in right hand column) or the entire publication is available on disc from the Department of Water library.\nIntroduction - Provides an introduction to the contents of the Manual, how to use it and why. It also provides a brief account of the nature of the rivers of south-west WA, typical problems and the need for restoration.\nCatchment Processes - Stream and Catchment Hydrology - Describes and explains climate, the water cycle, how water Catchment Hydrology runs off a catchment and how we can measure this.\nStream Channel Processes\nFluvial Geomorphology - Discusses how the forces in flowing water shape a stream channel - how banks erode, how meanders form and the influences of the stream bed and its vegetation. Explains the basic physics and mathematics of water movement in a stream channel.\nRecognising Channel and Floodplain Forms - Describes local to sub-catchment scale channel and floodplain forms, identifies the factors that influence these forms, and comments on why forms change over time. It provides suggestions on how to recognise sedimentary forms in your river, any changes in form, and how to apply this knowledge to improve river health\nStream Channel and Floodplain Erosion - Discusses the connection between the power of flowing water, its natural tendency to follow a winding path, and some of the specific erosion features we see along our rivers. It covers bed, bank and floodplain erosion and explains the characteristics of bends in streams and how erosion plays a natural part in their development. Understanding erosion and sedimentation processes helps us manage rivers better.\nStream Channel Analysis\nStream Channel Analysis-- Discusses surveying, collection of data and assessment of river channels, calculation of flow velocity and discharge and stream power to understand the form of a stream channel and the force of the water that shapes it.\nStream Ecology - Provides an introduction to some of the important ecosystem processes that 'drive' the structure of stream communities and highlights some of the pressures that threaten stream ecosystems in WA.\nRevegetation of Riparian zones in south-west WA - Outlines the riparian zone and the process involved to revegetate it with native species. It gives a brief background of the general structure and importance of the riparian zone before moving onto site planning, weed control, species selection, plant establishment then finally monitoring and maintenance of the site.\nRevegetatoin case studies from south-west WA - The case studies outline the processes, management, cost and general success of previous revegetation projects.\nUsing rushland sedges in revegetation - Describes the common species of rushes, sedges, bulrushes and submergents of the south-west of WA, the aim of revegetation, revegetation techniques and weed control.\nStream Stabilisation - Outlines techniques to control the riverbed, stabilise channel alignment, protect stream banks and rebuild habitat. Provides guidelines on managing erosion and sedimentation problems and practical techniques to integrate channel stabilisation engineering and ecological restoration.\nPlanning and Management\nForeshore condition assessment in urban and semi-rural areas of south-west WA - Outlines a simple stream assessment method (modified from Pen and Scott 1995) for use in semi-rural and urban areas. It includes the assessment of instream habitat, foreshore vegetation, presence of dominant species (native plants and weed species), channel stability, areas suffering or prone to bank erosion and disturbance to the riparian zone as a result of the surrounding intensive landuse.\nForeshore condiiont assessment in farming areas of south-west WA - Outlines a simple stream assessment method (modified from Pen and Scott 1995) for use in farming areas of south-west Australia. The methodology looks at the overall foreshore health - and grades the foreshore at various stages from pristine with good vegetation to a ditch or drain with weed infestation or no vegetation.\nPlanning for waterways management: An overview - Provides an outline of the principles by which planning for waterways management should occur and is the background to more detailed documents.\nGuidelines for preparing a regional strategy for naturual resource management - Discusses regional planning, integrated catchment management, natural resource management, development of regional strategies, components of regional strategies and the incorporation of waterways management issues.\nGuidelines for preparing a Waterways Management Program/Catchment Plan - Recommends a planning process, content and structure for waterways planning documents that focus at the catchment scale.

They balance this with approachability by practicing social immediacies, rewarding appropriate behavior, explaining their teaching methods, and scheduling activities every 15-20 minutes to maintain engagement.","context":["- Bobby Chen\n- Rajath Subramanyam\n- Yang Xu\n- Fan Yang\n- Nicholas Bachmann\n- Alec Benzer\n- Sarah Dong\n- Cyrus Eduljee\n- Will Hennessy\n- Bhuwan Khattar\n- Hyun Bin Lee\n- Zitian Liu\n- Sammy Rabkin\n- Zhengqi Yang\n- Xiaocheng Yuan\nFor all technical and class related questions, go to Piazza.\nFor personal questions only, email firstname.lastname@example.org.\nThere is no required textbook for CS 241.\nSome useful textbooks include:\nA computer needs an operating system to manage its resources and provide support for common functions such as accessing peripherals. There are two categories of \"customers\" that an operating system must support. The first category is the community of users. We have all used computers and you may recognize operating systems' functions such as creating folders (directories) and moving files around. These are examples of operating system support for users. User support is not the objective of this course. This course addresses operating system support for the second category of customers; namely, the programmers. Those are people who write code to execute on the computer. When you write a program, it may have to interact with physical hardware (memory, flash storage, screen, network, etc.). For example, you may want to get input from a keyboard or mouse, you may want to read some configuration file stored on disk, you may want to output data to a screen or printer, or you may want to access a remote server across a network. The operating system presents common interfaces for programmers to perform these functions. The operating system also provides useful abstractions such as \"tasks\" (also called processes), \"threads\", and \"semaphores\". You can make the computer multitask by calling the operating system interface for creating new tasks or new threads. You can make these tasks coordinate and synchronize by using operating system semaphores. You can tell the computer the order in which you want tasks to be executed, which is called a scheduling policy. Finally, you can manage computer memory by calling the operating system function for memory management. System programming refers to writing code that tasks advantage of operating system support for programmers. This course is designed to introduce you to system programming.\nBy the end of this course, you should be proficient at writing programs that take full advantage of operating system support. To be concrete, we need to fix an operating system and we need to choose a programming language for writing programs. We chose the C language running on a Linux/UNIX operating system (which implements the POSIX standard interface between the programmer and the OS). This pairing of C and UNIX/Linux is used heavily by software that must provide high performance and low-level control of the program's execution. Hence, this course introduces you to systems programming via the specific case of C over UNIX. By the end of the course you should be proficient with this programming environment and should be able to write non-trivial pieces of software from web server code to your own multiplayer Internet games. More specifically, after taking this course you should be able to accomplish the following:\nAfter the grades are available, you have 1 week to request a regrade. If you believe you were not graded correctly, please help up by asking for regarding during that window. After 1 week, no more regrade requests will be honored.\nWe meet for lectures 11:00 - 11:50 am Monday, Wednesday and Friday in Room 1404 SC. Lectures cover important operating system concepts, and their implementation. It is the students' responsibility to read assigned materials. You are expected to attend lectures, and will be responsible for announcements made during lecture, as well as on the cs241 web page, and on Piazza.\nThere are multiple discussion sessions. You should sign up for one of the discussion sessions using Banner as soon as possible.\nWe will be using linux machines, running POSIX system programming interface, in labs in 1245 DCL, 1265 and 1275 DCL and in 0220/0222 SC (basement). You should make sure that you have accounts on the EWS machines to do your machine problem assignments. We recommend that you use a 64-bit EWS machine.\nWe run our autograders on linux.ews.illinois.edu, so even if you develop your code elsewhere, you should test your code on linux.ews.illinois.edu before submitting and at regular intervals while developing your code. While the desktop EWS machines run the same OS and same word size, slight differences have resulted in problems for buggy code in past semesters.\nTo access these machines from outside the university, please use CITES VPN client.\nIf you want to audit the course and don't have an account, please speak with the course staff. If you have other problems relating to the existence of your account, please email email@example.com.\nCheating is taken very seriously in CS 241. Be sure to understand the departmental honor code. Your work in this class must be your own. If students are found to have cheated (e.g., by copying or sharing answers during an examination or sharing code for the project), all involved will at receive grades of 0 for the first infraction and will be reported to the academic office, and may receive additional penalties such as a reduction of one letter grade in the final course grade. Further infractions will result in failure in the course and/or recommendation for dismissal from the university.\nYou are a respected individual in a community of collegiality and trust. We honor and believe your word. We trust what you say and will generally not ask for proof. However, with trust comes responsibility. Violation of trust will not be tolerated. In particular, acts not befitting this community such as cheating (e.g., collaboration on homeworks or exams that are not meant to be collaborative) fall in the category of violation of trust. Individuals who commit such acts will lose the privileges of trust and receive grade reductions as described above.\nYour machine problems must be a result of individual work. You are responsible for protecting your work. In the past, we had cases of copying solutions from other students without their knowledge. To avoid having your work copied without your knowledge, refrain from leaving source code prints lying around the lab, protect your files, don't give your passwords to anyone, and enter your passwords in a way that cannot be seen by others. Do not leave a login session active on an unattended workstation. Use xlock on the EWS workstations if you must leave briefly, or use some similar measure (or log out!) in other labs; remember that it's a violation of the CSIL policy (and probably the other lab policies) to leave your workstation unattended for any extended period of time. Report suspicious behavior to the lab sitters or the TAs.","Presentation on theme: \"Maintaining Student Discipline Linda B.

{"question":"What are the advantages of small modular nuclear reactors for clean energy production, and what regulatory challenges do they face?","answer":"Small modular reactors (SMRs) offer several advantages for clean energy production: they can be manufactured in factories to reduce costs and increase quality, they can be transported to meet off-grid emergency needs, and they can repurpose existing fossil fuel sites. The NuScale Power SMR specifically uses innovative buoyancy-driven natural circulation cooling and provides a cost-effective, safe solution for nuclear energy expansion. However, these reactors face significant regulatory challenges - the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) must adapt its regulations as existing rules are not suitable for advanced reactors with novel coolants and safety features. The NRC needs more resources to create efficient, flexible regulatory processes, and regulatory uncertainties can deter potential investors since there is often no past guidance for novel reactor designs.","context":["Date of Award\nMaster of Science in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics\nMechanical, Industrial and Systems Engineering\nNuclear energy is the largest source of carbon-free electricity in the United States, making up 20 percent of the electricity generated in the United States. The United States is the second-largest energy-consuming country globally, with fossil fuels being the largest electricity-producing source. With Climate Change at the head of the world’s most difficult circumstances, it is evident that nuclear power is a crucial and significant source of carbon-free energy to combat this crisis. The NuScale Power SMR can provide a cost-effective and safe solution to further the expansion of nuclear energy throughout the United States and the world. The nature of the buoyancy-driven natural circulation cooling design of the reactor primary systems and the modularity and scalability power plant system provide the innovations and technology needed to do so. There are few tools like RELAP5-3D that allow for the thermal-hydraulic transient analysis of nuclear reactors. Due to the minimum amount of open literature available on the transient analysis of the NuScale Power SMR, RELAP5-3D has been utilized to perform the steady-state and a steam generator tube-rupture transient calculation. The benchmark experiment for thermal-hydraulic calculation codes, called Edward’s pipe blowdown experiment, was first modeled to understand the basics of a transient two-phase flow model. This experiment was performed to acquire the essential modeling skills and techniques to build the model and perform the calculations of the NuScale Power SMR using RELAP5-3D.\nThe NuScale Power Small Modular Reactor (SMR) relies on buoyancy-driven natural circulation cooling to cool the reactor core and extract thermal energy for electricity generation. The natural convection phenomenon has been of research interest for many years. NuScale Power LLC has only developed the SMR in recent years, and this integral Pressurized Water Reactor (iPWR) is the first nuclear reactor to utilize this phenomenon. Therefore, there is an increased interest in performing the transient analysis of the thermal-hydraulics of this reactor to understand conditions in which the natural circulation cooling inside the reactor system may be disrupted. There have been minimal published resources on this topic to date, making this research necessary for the growth and future of SMRs and natural circulation cooling of nuclear reactors. The innovations and designs of the NuScale Power SMR have allowed for enhanced safety, cost, scalability, modularity, time of construction, ease of transportation, and standardized manufacturing process of SMRs and nuclear power plants. RELAP5-3D was utilized to develop the model of the NuScale Power SMR and perform steady-state and transient analysis calculations of the reactor. This model was developed using the publicly available design data and parameters released by the U.S. NRC for the NuScale Power Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). The steady-state conditions of the reactor were modeled to simulate the reactor operation conditions in preparation for the transient analysis calculation. A tube rupture of the secondary steam generator was simulated for the transient analysis calculation to understand if the natural circulation cooling would be disrupted and if the secondary coolant would rise to dangerous levels proposing system failures.\nThe steady-state model simulated the proper reactor operational conditions, exhibiting higher mass flow rates than the best estimate flow rate specified in NuScale FSAR. The core temperatures were on the higher end of the temperature range but were still within the operational conditions, with the pressure controlled at 1850 psia. The forward flow energy loss coefficients proposed a particular issue in manipulating the code to obtain the core's correct mass flow rates and temperatures. It was found that the loss coefficients could be changed in a manner that lowered the mass flow rates closer to the best estimate flow rate, but the temperatures would, in turn, increase. Because the mass flow rate specified in NuScale FSAR was the best estimate value, the author concluded that the steady-state model was sufficient for the tube rupture model. The tube rupture was modeled using a single junction that connected the primary and secondary steam generators. The model was created to simulate a single helical coil steam generator tube being ruptured. Depressurization was not seen on the primary because the pressurizer was modeled as a pressure boundary condition at 1850 psia. A mass flow rate of approximately 36 lbm/s was seen through the tube rupture to the secondary side of the system. The water level did not increase significantly, but the liquid void fraction increased slightly. The flow through the rupture was choked because of the flashing of the liquid at high temperature and pressure to vapor at the lower pressure. It was found that instabilities and oscillations occurred very quickly on the primary and secondary sides, but the natural circulation flow was not disrupted.\nJohnson, Kyle P., \"TRANSIENT ANALYSIS OF THE NUSCALE POWER HELICAL-COIL STEAM GENERATOR TUBE RUPTURE USING RELAP5-3D\" (2021). Open Access Master's Theses. Paper 1989.","WASHINGTON — New and advanced types of nuclear reactors could play an important role in helping the U.S. meet its long-term climate goals, but a range of technical, regulatory, economic, and societal challenges must first be overcome, says a new report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Development, testing, and widespread deployment of these reactors could take several decades. The report makes recommendations for the U.S. Department of Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, other federal and state agencies, and private industry to lay the groundwork required for advanced reactors to become a viable part of the U.S. energy system.\nCurrently, the U.S. electricity system includes large light water reactors (LWRs) that produce electricity for commercial use. LWRs use water to cool the reactor and moderate the speed of the nuclear chain reactions taking place. Many advanced reactor concepts use conventional fuels, materials, and manufacturing methods, but some also employ a wide array of new coolants, designs, fuels, materials, and technologies. Among these are modular LWRs that are smaller, simpler, and rely mainly on passive safety features. Other examples include reactors that use liquid metal, molten salt, or high-temperature gas as coolants.\nThe U.S. electricity system is already undergoing massive shifts, but economy-wide decarbonization efforts will span decades, and electricity demand is projected to continually grow over that period. Advanced nuclear technologies likely will not be able to markedly contribute to electricity generation until the 2030s at the earliest, the report says, but there are opportunities for them to compete with other energy technologies in the long term. Innovative ideas for reactors, if fulfilled, may provide on-demand power generation to complement variable sources of energy, such as solar and wind energy, and help decarbonize challenging industrial sectors by providing high-temperature heat for chemical processes, such as hydrogen production.\nSome advanced nuclear reactor concepts, due to their size or the way they are to be produced, offer new ways for nuclear power to be used, including:\n- Major portions or even the entirety of the reactor system could be produced in factories, potentially reducing project costs and uncertainties and increasing quality.\n- Existing power generation sites using fossil fuel (e.g., coal plants) could be repurposed for nuclear power generation.\n- Small reactors or microreactors could be transported to meet off-grid emergency needs.\n- Reactors could produce localized thermal energy for industrial applications that otherwise have hard-to-abate emissions because of high temperature requirements, such as cement, hydrogen, and steel production; for district heating (heat distributed through pipes to keep residences or businesses warm); or for desalination.\n“Our report shows new and advanced nuclear reactors could play an important role as the U.S. works to decarbonize the economy,” said Richard A. Meserve, Senior Of Counsel for Covington & Burling LLP, former chair of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and chair of the committee that wrote the report. “But there are significant hurdles that must be overcome to enable advanced nuclear reactors to succeed and reach commercial and globally competitive viability ― among them, economic challenges, technological challenges, regulatory changes, and societal acceptance. If we want the ability to pursue this option, the U.S. should address these barriers now.”\nMeeting the Technological Promise\nThere are many differences between nuclear reactors currently in use and proposed advanced nuclear reactors. For advanced reactors to be able to compete in a decarbonized economy, the report makes a range of recommendations, including:\n- DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy should initiate a research program that sets aggressive goals for improving performance of fuels and materials used to build or operate reactors.\n- The nuclear industry and DOE should fully develop a structured, ongoing program to ensure the best-performing technologies (as measured by technical, financial, regulatory, and social acceptance milestones) move rapidly through demonstration.\n- DOE should expand its efforts in advanced construction technology research and development and make advanced construction technologies broadly available to reduce costs.\n- Significant incentives, such as those that have nurtured solar and wind technologies, should be provided to enable the wide commercial deployment of advanced reactors.\n- Widespread deployment of advanced reactors will require more skilled workers. DOE should initiate a whole of government partnership, and work with labor organizations, industry, regulatory agencies, and other organizations to identify gaps in critical skills, and fund training and development solutions.\nPolicies and Regulations for Economic Competitiveness\nNuclear power reactors are tightly regulated by the NRC in all phases of their life cycle ― design, construction, operations, and decommissioning. The report says that the NRC must maintain its overarching commitment to safety, but regulations governing existing reactors are not suitable for advanced reactors, which could present novel regulatory issues, particularly reactors that use new coolants, have advanced safety capabilities, or are factory made or transportable. Congress should provide the NRC with more resources to enhance its capability to deal with these differences and create efficient, effective, and flexible regulatory processes.\nIn addition, differing regulatory requirements between countries can discourage international sales, which may be an essential part of making nuclear vendors’ business plans competitive. The report urges broader international regulatory harmonization, in the short term through bilateral arrangements ― such as the U.S. agreement with Canada ― and in the long term through engagement with the International Atomic Energy Agency and Nuclear Energy Agency.\nThere are considerable regulatory and economic risks that can deter potential investors in the advanced nuclear industry, including uncertainties around whether the NRC might reject a new approach, impose new design or operational requirements, or bring about added costs through delayed action. Some regulatory risks are particularly difficult for industry to evaluate because there is often no past guidance that would apply to novel reactor designs, so more regulatory certainty will help industry and its investors make informed plans.\nFederal and state governments should take actions that enable the industry to be cost-competitive with other low-carbon energy technologies, including through tailored financial incentives, the report says. The U.S. should also foster a healthy international market for advanced nuclear technologies, and better equip itself to swiftly negotiate nuclear cooperation arrangements. The report recommends steps for Congress and the federal government to help U.S. vendors compete with state-owned and state-financed vendors in the international energy market.\nAssurance of Safety, Security, and Safeguards\nNew deployment scenarios can introduce new physical and cyber risks, which should be dealt with through safety, security, and safeguards requirements as appropriate. NRC staff have proposed significant modifications to the physical security requirements for nuclear facilities to take into account novel designs and operations of advanced reactors. However, clear regulatory guidance is still needed, the report notes, and the NRC will need sufficient expert staff to provide this guidance.\nEarning Societal Acceptance\nWhile nuclear power must be safe and secure, it must also be accepted by society and by the communities in which new reactors are built. The advanced nuclear industry should adopt consent-based approaches for new facilities, adjusted for place, time, and culture, the report says. Consent-based processes ― still nascent in the industry, where plans for new reactors are typically only reviewed after design and siting are completed ― should include participatory site selection methods and incorporate more value-focused thinking. Industry should adopt research-backed approaches to community engagement, enduring through the life of a project, and these should be treated with the same seriousness as technological development. The report charts a path forward for better engagement, recommending a set of best practices for the industry.\nA 2022 National Academies report, written by a separate committee, discusses nuclear fuel cycle options for both existing and advanced reactors, nonproliferation and security considerations for these fuel cycles, as well as issues related to the waste associated with advanced nuclear reactors.\nThis study, undertaken by the Committee on Laying the Foundation for New and Advanced Nuclear Reactors in the United States, was supported by a gift donation by James J. Truchard, a National Academy of Engineering member, and by the U.S. Department of Energy.\nThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine are private, nonprofit institutions that provide independent, objective analysis and advice to the nation to solve complex problems and inform public policy decisions related to science, engineering, and medicine.

{"question":"As a history student interested in groundbreaking achievements, which was established first as a nationally recognized site - George Washington Carver's birthplace or Weeksville in Brooklyn?","answer":"George Washington Carver's birthplace in Diamond, Missouri was established first. It became the first site associated with the black experience in America to receive national recognition when it was dedicated as a National Monument in 1943. In contrast, Weeksville, a once-vibrant African American village in Brooklyn founded in the 1830s, wasn't preserved until much later. Community activist Joan Maynard began efforts to save Weeksville in the late 1960s, and its houses didn't open to the public until 2005 as the Weeksville Heritage Center.","context":["In 2004 my job as research assistant for the Kentucky Heritage Council was to inventory Rosenwald Schools in Kentucky. I traveled across the state to document what were the most advanced, architecturally designed school buildings constructed for African American students between 1917 and 1932. This innovative school construction program was developed by the founder of Tuskegee University, Booker T. Washington, and was partially funded by philanthropist Julius Rosenwald, president of Sears Roebuck & Company. During this survey process, I learned that my mother and father both attended Rosenwald Schools in rural Kentucky.\nI was always excited when I found a Rosenwald School standing. Many times, however, nothing was left. It was as if these places had never existed; only landscapes remained, rich with memories of students walking to school. In many cases entire communities had disappeared. People had left rural areas for the big city, leaving significant parts of the history of African Americans behind. I realized these stories would be all but erased from memory if we didn’t act to protect them.\nMy experience has shown me that the preservation of historic African American sites often happens on an informal basis. Each time someone gives to a church’s building fund, that person is helping rebuild historic fabric. Whenever volunteers mow the grass at a historic cemetery, they are conserving an important cultural landscape. When relatives gather at the family farm for a reunion or to celebrate Juneteenth (June 19, 1865, when emancipation was widely announced), they are honoring their past.\nTo be sure, some significant sites associated with African American history are formally recognized and serve as permanent reminders about our ancestors and their journey in America. For instance, the African Meeting House in Boston relates the story of the abolitionist movement in America. The Lorraine Motel in Memphis, where Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated, is a monument to the civil rights movement.\nBut relatively few places that are important to or representative of the African American experience enjoy this level of recognition.\nPreserving a historic building, neighborhood, or landscape takes more than just a connection to place or a love of history. It requires a basic understanding of preservation tools, nonprofit management, strategic planning, real estate, business practices, project management, and finance.\nWhy should we care about historic African American theaters, churches, schools, residences, gardens, neighborhoods, main streets, burial grounds, parks, hotels, juke joints, and recording studios?\nAfrican American scholar James Horton says that a single visit to a history site makes a life once lived real. (“On-Site Learning: The Power of Historic Places,” Cultural Resources Management 23, No. 8-2000, page 5.) For instance, visitors can walk up the narrow and crooked steps to the slave galleries inside St. Augustine’s Church in New York City and see where African Americans were forced to sit during religious services for much of the 19th century. At this place, visitors can experience tangible, authentic history.\nPreservation contributes much to a forgetful society. It empowers black youth by revealing historical themes besides slavery, including entrepreneurship, civil rights, entertainment, sports, education, and political activism. The site where hip-hop was founded in the Bronx brings life to the story of a revolution in music. Seeing firsthand the homes of civil rights activists and the Alabama churches that served as their gathering places reminds a younger generation how a nonviolent movement changed this nation.\nBy preserving historic sites that tell the story of African Americans in this country we draw attention to the contributions of both ordinary and extraordinary people. Such stories might otherwise be lost because urban renewal and the out-migration of blacks destroyed or led to the abandonment of many African American communities. By saving African American landmarks we can stimulate revitalization and foster interest in places that today seem to exist without history or meaning. Indeed these places can serve as anchors reviving our sense of community.\nEarly and Ongoing Efforts\nWe can take inspiration from earlier preservation champions and their accomplishments.\nThe first site associated with the black experience in America to receive recognition at the national level was the birthplace of agricultural scientist George Washington Carver in Diamond, Mo., dedicated as a National Monument in 1943. Other sites soon followed, such as the site where Booker T. Washington was born into slavery, a National Monument near Hardy, Va., protected in 1956; Tuskegee University, a National Historic Landmark designated in 1965; and Hampton University listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.\nIn the 1960s, grassroots activists new to preservation established the first wave of historic preservation activity in the black community. Without any formal training in historic preservation, these champions saved many African American historic places through an organic learning process, resilience, and unwavering commitment for their mission.\nFor instance, when community activist Joan Maynard learned in the late 1960s about Weeksville, a once-vibrant but later forgotten African American village in Brooklyn founded in the 1830s, she felt compelled to revive some of its buildings as tangible reminders of its people and their accomplishments. She was motivated by the desire to instill pride in current African American residents in the area, especially young people. Marshaling help from students, community groups, and preservationists, she accomplished her goal when three houses of Weeksville opened to the public in 2005. The Weeksville Heritage Center she once led continues to expand and thrive.\nSince then a new wave of African American preservationists has gotten involved in saving places all across America. These new advocates include retirees, architects, nonprofit consultants, historians, and recent graduates of historic preservation programs. They are advancing preservation by establishing networks that foster cross-mentoring and stronger professional relationships.\nSeveral organizations are working to identify African American sites in different regions of the country. The African American Heritage Preservation Foundation was established in 1994 as a resource group for organizations mostly in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. In at least seven states, all-volunteer commissions or committees work in partnership with state government agencies to identify black heritage sites within their state. Other nonprofit efforts devoted to the protection of African American historic places include the Florida African American Heritage Network as well as dedicated programs of several statewide and local nonprofit preservation organizations.\nIn fact, from Maine to California, individuals and nonprofit organizations are working to protect and restore African American landmarks and historical artifacts. They are revitalizing our historic neighborhoods, conserving landscapes rich in beauty or cultural meaning, showcasing valuable collections, researching and documenting places, interpreting our history in new and creative ways, and striving toward financial sustainability and their own organizational longevity.\nYet there is still much to be done.\nPreservation is rewarding, but challenging, work. Some challenges will especially come into play when dealing with African American sites; others are typical for all types of preservation projects.\nThere is a common perception among the general public that historic preservation is only about saving sites associated with rich white men’s history. Historically, there’s truth in that perception; preservation began as an attempt to memorialize the founding fathers. In the past few decades, however, more focus has been on sites that tell the story of all Americans—African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, Asian Pacific Islander Americans, women, and gays and lesbians.\nAfrican American heritage is often found in small, unadorned structures. For the most part these are not as grand or visually impressive as traditionally recognized places such as the homes of political leaders or wealthy industrialists. Many are in poor condition or have been extensively altered. In spite of this, they can offer a tangible and rich reminder of African American heritage.\nOften the individuals most interested in saving African American sites are new to preservation. They work to raise concern within a black community that is just learning the value of preservation and also cultivate broader support through conventional means.\nAnd, as is true with many preservation projects, there are the barriers of time and money. This type of work takes patience and persistence. It can take years, sometimes 10 or more, to bring a building back to life and see it maintained in productive use. It requires a financially sustainable organization with an effective board. Leaders, staff, and volunteers must remain committed to their preservation project and stay focused on the long-term goals.\nPreserving African American Historic Places\nTo help local advocates preserve African American historic sites, especially those individuals new to preservation, National Trust has published a basic primer, Preserving African American Historic Places. This 24-page publication introduces the world of historic preservation and explains some of the key players and procedures that make preservation happen. It presents an overview of traditional preservation networks and their roles, offers tips on how to get preservation underway in your community, and looks at the various legal and financial tools that help protect historic properties. There are a variety of approaches to preserving historic places and each one requires different levels of expertise, resources, and commitment. Because there is no one-size-fits-all method, this booklet includes six case studies to illustrate various strategies for preserving and honoring historic places associated with African American history.

They also testify to the role of our National Park Service and other land agencies in preserving important pieces of our nation's story and cultural heritage.\n1. Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park (Georgia)\nAt least four national park units and memorials are associated with the life of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., but the one that explores King's early life and the forces that shaped him is the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Georgia. The site preserves multiple places of interest that honor King's life and message. Among them are King's childhood home, the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church where both King and his father were pastors, the \"I Have a Dream\" world Peace Rose Garden and the final resting place of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Corretta Scott King.\n2. Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument (Alabama)\nPresident Obama designated Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument including several sites with a deep connection to the civil rights struggle of the mid-20th century. A.G. Gaston Motel, named one of the U.S.' \"most endangered\" historic places in 2015, served as a refuge for minorities when Birmingham was otherwise deeply segregated, and also became planning headquarters for Dr. Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders during the 1960s. Also included are the famed 16th Street Baptist Church, site of a 1963 church bombing that killed four young girls and proved a galvanizing moment for the civil rights movement; the adjacent Kelly Ingram Park, site of major civil rights demonstrations; and Bethel Baptist Church, headquarters of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights and a target of racist violence.\n3.

The memorial, a granite plaza highlighted by statuary and a wall of honored names, has been called one of the best Washington DC museums not on the National Mall, a fitting tribute to the nearly 210,00 African Americans who served.\nPhoto credit: Cynthia, flickr\n4. Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument (Maryland)\nThe Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument was designated by President Barack Obama in 2013. This place celebrates the great abolitionist and woman known as “Moses of her People.\" As the most well-known conductor on the Underground Railroad, Harriet Tubman lead almost 70 enslaved people to their freedom. Tubman’s spirit resonates here in the land, water and sky. At the monument, visitors will see lands that Tubman would have recognized and can learn about Underground Railroad history and Tubman's life.\nNeighboring Tubman’s monument on Maryland's Eastern Shore is Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. Now a bird sanctuary, this land was once worked by Harriet Tubman when she was a farm slave and timber laborer. It was here that she learned vital outdoor skills while navigating Blackwater’s Stewart's Canal, which was dug for commercial transportation between 1810 and 1832 by enslaved and free people.\n5. Freedom Riders National Monument (Alabama)\nThis monument in the town of Anniston honors the namesake activists—including now-congressman John Lewis—who braved violence in often hostile southern communities to test whether states were obeying a 1960 Supreme Court decision that declared segregated bus terminals illegal. The monument was established by President Obama on the site of a mob attack on two buses full of Freedom Riders on Mother's Day 1961, a crime that helped to stoke national opposition to Jim Crow injustices.\n6. African Burial Ground National Monument (New York)\nIn 1991, what began as construction in lower Manhattan became one of the most important recent archaeological finds: a graveyard containing the remains of about 15,000 free and enslaved Africans buried in the late 17th century. Today a wall of remembrance honors those who once used this place to maintain and celebrate their ancestral heritage.\nPhoto credit: All-Nite Images, flickr.\n7. Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers National Monument (Ohio)\nThe namesake of Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers National Monument was a pioneering figure: The third African American to graduate from West Point; the first African American to reach the rank of colonel and the highest ranking African American officer at the beginning of World War I. The monument preserves his one-time home, which had previously served as part of the Underground Railroad, and also honors the famed Buffalo Soldiers, African American regiments that fought in the Civil War and other conflicts in the late 19th century. His Ohio house, called Youngsholm, was once used as a stop on the Underground Railroad and hosted Paul Laurence Dunbar, W.E.B Du Bois and other African-American leaders.\n8. Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks (California)\nIn addition to a long list on military honors and achievements, Young was the first African American acting superintendent of a national park (Sequoia-Kings Canyon). He led about 500 Buffalo Soldiers to have a lasting impact on some of the most cherished lands in America. They completed the first usable road and the first trail to the top of Mt. Whitney in Sequoia, and built an arboretum in Yosemite. In addition to fighting forest fires, they also acted as police, monitoring wildlife poaching, illegal grazing, theft of natural resources and firearm regulations.\n9. Reconstruction Era National Monument (South Carolina)\nCredit: Timothy Brown, flickr.\nAt the very end of his presidential term, President Obama established the first national monument that recognizes the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, including the site of one of the first schools for freed slaves and the Brick Baptist Church, which was built by slaves and eventually adopted as their place of worship when the land was otherwise abandoned.\n10.

Legends like Stephen Bishop, Mat Bransford, Nick Bransford, Ed Bishop, Ed Hawkins, Will Garvin and Matt Bransford made noteworthy contributions to this unique place, but they were not considered important during their difficult lifetimes. Today these men are credited with playing a vital role in the development of cave exploration at Mammoth.\n11. Booker T. Washington National Monument, Virginia\nThis place marks Booker T. Washington’s birth as a slave, although the exact location remains unknown. Washington was the first principal of the historically black college known as Tuskegee Institute, and later became known as an important author and orator. His political leadership is evident; he was the first African American ever invited to the White House, as the guest of America’s “conservation president” Theodore Roosevelt.\n12. Biscayne National Park, Florida\nPreservation of this gorgeous marine park was possible due to the Jones family of Porgy Key, who once maintained a profitable lime-growing business on the land. The poetically named Sir Lancelot Garfield Jones, among the first African Americans born in Key Biscayne, resisted developers' attempts to buy the family's land for years before selling it to the National Park Service to be incorporated into the then-new Biscayne National Monument, established by President Lyndon Johnson in 1968.\n13. George Washington Carver National Monument, Missouri\nIn 1943, Congress dedicated George Washington Carver’s boyhood home near Diamond, Missouri as a national monument to celebrate his influence on agriculture in the early 19th century, seen today in the now–common practice of rotating crops to allow nutrients in the soil to recover. This innovation stemmed from a conservation ethic that was ahead of its time.This monument was not only the first to be dedicated to an African-American, but also the first dedicated to an American who never served as president."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2b623b31-a54e-432d-9a65-dae9abe5d6bd>","<urn:uuid:5988c31b-1151-4fe5-968f-f123b4d6e539>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the night vision capabilities of IMU motion capture devices compared to modern PTZ security cameras?","answer":"Modern PTZ security cameras have superior night vision capabilities compared to IMU motion capture devices. PTZ cameras can capture images in total darkness thanks to LEDs and special IR filters, with the LEDs emitting infrared light that, while invisible to humans, allows the camera to see well-lit areas through its IR filter. They typically maintain night vision capabilities up to 400 feet. In contrast, IMU motion capture devices, which use accelerometers and gyroscopes, do not have specific night vision capabilities as they track motion through inertial measurements rather than visual data. Their performance can actually be compromised in certain environmental conditions, particularly when electromagnetic interference is present.","context":["Motion Capture For Physical Therapy\nTo many physical therapists, motion capture (mocap) is an exotic concept. Yet, recent advances in imaging and computer vision have drastically changed the definition of mocap, and have finally made it practical for the clinic and athletic training. With these improvements, mocap could power up a new age in the field of physical therapy.\nWhat does mocap mean historically? What does it mean today for physical therapy? What are the pros and cons of different technologies on the market?\nWhat is the most practical solution for your clinic, and can mocap be practical to incorporate into your PT clinic? It depends. Let’s dig in!\nTraditional marker-based multiple camera motion capture\nEase of use 1/5\nTraditional marker-based mocap “rigs” are designed for high accuracy. They incorporate multiple cameras in a dedicated, precalibrated space and require the subject to wear a large number of markers, and potentially a mocap suit.\nTraditional mocap systems were initially designed for Hollywood animation studios, with their high-fidelity requirements. Over time, these systems found their way to academic institutions and high end biomechanics research labs. They boast high definition and frame rates capable of capturing complex whole kinetic chain movements such as gait, or a professional baseball pitchers full speed movements. Research grade accuracy and the “gold standard” label enable them to find adoption in the scientific community and highly specialized, high end clinics.\nLimitations of traditional motion capture systems are:\nNear-prohibitive cost for most practices: most such systems cost $75,000 to $200,000. In some cases, costs can skyrocket past $1,000,000!\nHigh operational requirements: marker setup, camera calibration, and software operation all take non-trivial amounts of time. Furthermore, complex post-processing, requiring dedicated, highly-skilled, and expensive staff, add more time and cost to an already operationally intensive process.\nDifficult integration into standard clinic operations: Most capture runs with such systems take at least one (1) to one and a half (1.5) hours, and often the better part of a day. As a result, they pose significant disruption to standard clinic operations: a typical client session easily goes beyond 60 minutes.\nDownload Your Free Motion Capture for PT E-book Below!\nInertial measurement (IMU) & electromagnetic (EMU) motion capture\nAccuracy 2/5 (edited from 3 to 2 based on feedback from IMU users)\nEase of use 3/5\nIMUs and EMUs incorporate accelerometers, gyroscopes, and sometimes magnetometers into small wearable devices to extrapolate motion. IMUs and EMUs were first utilized in navigation systems for large commercial vehicles such as planes and submarines. Over the years made, they have made their way into consumer electronics for orientation tracking and were popularized by gaming systems such as the Wii. Within the context of physical health and wellness, IMUs and EMUs have become incorporated into some professional systems, but have found greater popularity in consumer-oriented products such as step trackers. With good calibration and operation, IMUs and EMUs can obtain excellent accuracy and capture rate. In some cases, they can sample at over 200Hz. Furthermore, most IMU and EMU systems are not constrained to a predetermined, precalibrated environment, and therefore can be used in many situations, both indoors and outdoors.\nLimitations of marker based IMU / EMU systems are:\nLong setup time: Each IMU / EMU needs to be precisely placed on specific parts of the body. If improperly placed, the resulting data may turn out to be meaningless, or worse: misleading.\nBad data due to marker slippage: markers can move around due to poor adhesion (e.g. sweat, friction) during movements and exercises, invalidating any collected data during that run.\nSignificant post-processing: resulting data needs to be manually analyzed and interpreted in a process which requires time and expertise.\nConstraints on subject’s natural motion: the presence of markers on the subject’s body can affect the subject’s natural motion because of friction and weight of the attached sensors.\nSome usage limitations: the presence of large metal objects or sources of electromagnetic waves can significantly alter the readings of some EMUs.\nMulti-Camera Markerless Motion Capture\nEase of use 2/5\nMulti-camera markerless motion capture systems are an extension of the original multi-camera marker based systems. These systems do away with the need for markers by leveraging advanced mathematical techniques and multiple 2D camera feeds to identify body positions in real time at a high frame rate. They were initially designed to enable more affordable animation capabilities for movie creators and video game designers, but have found low penetration in the physical wellness space. The accuracy of such systems is good but still a step below that of marker-based multi-camera systems. Calibration and setup processes are still required. Such systems are not typically portable, require dedicated space, and can cost over $60k. The convenience of no markers is somewhat offset by the reduced accuracy, significant cost, and space and calibration requirements.\nLimitations of markerless multi-camera motion capture systems are:\nHigh cost for most practices: most such systems cost over $60,000.\nHigh operational requirements: while marker setup is avoided, a calibration and setup phase is still required. Additionally, non-trivial post-processing is required to obtain relevant biomechanical analysis.\nLastly, such systems are not portable and require significant dedicated space.\nDownload Your Free Motion Capture for PT E-book Below!\nSingle camera 3D markerless motion capture\nEase of use 5/5\nSingle camera 3D markerless motion capture systems leverage the latest advances in machine learning and computer vision techniques to provide good body tracking at a fraction of the cost and setup required of the above listed systems. Single camera markerless 3D systems were originally created for general human recognition, but today, several of these systems have been designed specifically for the practicing clinician, from the ground up.\nBecause of the ease of use of these systems, movement screens can be conducted in 1-2 minutes. Post-processing is not required, as biomechanical analysis software is typically prepackaged. These systems are lightweight and portable and can conduct full kinetic chain analysis at the push of a button. An example of a 3D markerless motion capture is EuMotus BodyWatch.\nLimitations of single camera 3D markerless motion capture systems are:\nSituational constraints: some computer vision models require the subject to be facing the camera to properly function. This eliminates movements in the prone position (e.g. push ups, planks etc). Some of these systems also rely on infrared technology, which can be impacted by natural sunlight and lose accuracy in certain poor lighting indoor or outdoor situations.\nReliance on implied skeleton models: machine learning and computer vision techniques construct a probabilistic skeleton model from a camera feed without the need of markers. The results in a lightweight and easy-to-use system. The trade-off for this convenience is a reduced accuracy compared to traditional mocap. White papers show 3 – 9 degrees difference vs gold standard traditional mocap systems.\nLower frame rate: because of the intensity of the required image processing, the frame rate of such systems hovers around 30 frames / second. While this is sufficient to analyze most movements, such as gait and jumps, certain specialized and fast movements – e.g. full speed baseball pitch, tennis serve – will be out of scope for these systems.\n2D video playback + annotation\nEase of use 4/5\n2D Video playback systems have been around for many years as a cheap way to do video analysis for a large range of use cases. Today, with the proliferation of cell phone cameras, this type of software can be installed on a phone or tablet as an app. It’s easy to set up and run and can be used outdoors. No laptop or computer is required given the minimal amount of data processing.\nWithin the context of biomechanical analysis, several applications have been created to enable manual annotation and calculation of biomechanical angles. Going back and estimating an angle from a still frame may work better than a just-in-time naked eye observation in controlled scenarios.\nManual post-processing: most 2D video playback systems require human intervention to manually delineate the joints and angles of interest.\nInaccurate and sometimes misleading calculations: most measurements obtained by drawing on 2D video still frames are incorrect unless the camera is directly perpendicular to and centered on the angle of interest at all times. In most use cases, that requirement is not followed nor practical and results in erroneous measurements. 2D video analysis is considered a qualitative, not a quantitative analysis system.\nNot holistic: 2D video analysis is typically limited to specific frames or focuses on single joints. It is not effective in capturing and analyzing full body dynamics.\nDifferent end users have different requirements. The choice of a mocap system therefore is a unique decision making process.\nA traditional mocap system may satisfy the needs of an academic biomechanics lab and may be out of reach for a one-off PT clinic. It can however, be the right choice for your clinic, and a major differentiating factor. With a dedicated space, dedicated resources and expertise, a multi-camera system could be set up at a high clinician / patient clinic in a location where there is market demand.\nFor clinics focusing on a high velocity data capture (e.g. golf swing), IMUs or EMUs may be a good way to go. For a locale with a large supply of golf enthusiasts or higher levels of baseball players, this may be a great way to cater services to the local sports community.\nFor most clinics, markerless motion capture is an interesting way to add value. Designed for ease of use and the clinician in mind, these systems can screen patients in minutes and can be integrated into the clinic operational flow. They can be used for return to sport, as well as for systematic screening of teams to find individuals and/or groups displaying faulty movement patterns.\nFinally, 2D smartphone mocap apps are simple ways to record motion, and are one of the few (if not only) way to record motion at close range outdoors. Biomechanical analysis functionality is limited at best, yet while these systems lack accuracy and vast majority of analytics provided by other systems, they can be used to occasionally capture gross faulty movement patterns (e.g. valgus, at great angle). These type of systems might be great for your middle or high school soccer or basketball coach.\nConsidering integrating mocap into your clinic?

Because of their unique flexibility and broad coverage, PTZ cameras are often chosen to remotely monitor large areas such as parking lots or stadiums. If you are considering installing PTZ surveillance cameras for your property, here are some of the best PTZ camera features and benefits.\nLarge Field Of View\nDepending on where you install your PTZ camera, it could have a 360 degree field of view. In addition, most cameras can be pre-programmed to provide specific viewing angles at pre-determined times. Pan and Tilt can also be pre-programmed. Thanks to this, PTZ cameras can do the job of a multi-camera installation, making them a cost-effective and smart alternative for large area surveillance and protection.\nMost PTZ cameras come with built-in tracking which can be set to detect motion and track a person or object, automatically panning, tilting or zooming to follow the person or object as it moves. This feature can prove invaluable should a theft or vandalism occur on your property. When choosing a PTZ camera, full motion tracking capabilities is a must.\nThis is an important feature in nearly all security cameras, but especially in areas with poor lighting conditions. The modern, more advanced PTZ cameras can capture images in total darkness thanks to LEDs and special IR filters. The small LEDs emit infrared light, which is not visible to the human eye, but with the special IR filter, the camera sees a well lit area.\nRemember that a PTZ camera that is rated for a detection range of 600 feet or more will usually be rated for a max range of 400 feet for night vision. Also, it is recommended that you set up your PTZ cameras in the same lighting conditions they will be recording in, whether dark or light.\nIf you will be installing PTZ cameras outdoors, they must be weatherproof. Most PTZ cameras are designed to withstand harsh elements, but it is wise to double check the specifications to ensure their durability. Weatherproof PTZ cameras can be installed in very remote locations such as rooftops or the sides of tall buildings.\nPTZ security cameras have a detection ability that ranges from 150 feet (on the low end) up to 1,000 feet (on the higher end). The ability to zoom in on a person or object ranges from 12X to 36X for higher level PTZ Speed Domes. This makes them ideal for large parking lots or building tops as it allows the camera to be discreetly out of sight while still providing the option to zoom in for a better picture of what is happening.\nThe best place for a PTZ camera is mounted high above the ground, which enables the best view possible, a wide 360 degree range, and added protection. As mentioned, most PTZ cameras are built tough, with rigid metal housings and high-strength polycarbonate domes that are virtually shatterproof to vandals.\nMost PTZ cameras have four alarm inputs, which connect to other important devices (ex. motion detectors, door contacts, glass break sensors). The camera can be programmed so that when activity occurs in a given area, other programmed activity is halted in order to zero in and record what is going on.\nThe good PTZ cameras will have full range auto focus built in. This ensures clarity no matter where you pan, tilt or zoom. In addition, most have an auto adjust IR LED that quickly focuses the picture when moving the camera in areas of complete darkness. This feature is almost always missing from cheaper cameras.\nBecause they can cover a wider area, it may be more cost-effective to install a couple PTZ cameras to monitor your property (ex. parking lots, garages) rather than implementing several fixed security cameras. You can save on both the initial cost and installation of your system.\nHigh Definition Options\nHigher end PTZ Speed Domes are also available in IP versions, which will deliver resolutions from 720i to 1080P, and with HD-SDI technology, which provides high definition video in full 1080P resolution. The HD-SDI PTZ cameras are easier to install and maintain than IP cameras since they are installed and set up exactly the same way as standard analog cameras.\nThese types are only recommended when you need the highest resolution images possible. They require 2-4 times as much hard drive space as regular analog security cameras and are rather expensive for large installations.\nFor a great selection of PTZ security cameras and other surveillance system equipment, please visit SecurityCamExpert.com or call 888-203-6294.

Because there are a plethora of security camera types and surveillance features to be considered, it will take some time to decide. Evaluate your security needs, do some research and weigh your options. To make it easier, we will break down the different types, housing, and common features of security cameras.\nThe following are the advantages and disadvantages of common security camera types.\nFor zoom capabilities, 32X is fairly common, although some higher end cameras may have a greater zoom range. While a greater zoom range is helpful when covering a large area, it is not always necessary.\nHowever, there are some downfalls. Because PTZ cameras can adjust its viewing range, there are chances that they may miss something. Also, zoom decreases the size of the area being covered, and the camera can only be facing one direction at a time.\nUnfortunately, these cameras are often oversold as a universal solution, despite the fact that very few rooms allow for an unobstructed view in all directions. In applications where this camera is necessary, it often does wonderfully. However, a standard fixed camera can be paired with a lens to give it a 120-degree to 140-degree view. Also, many rooms are better monitored with cameras in corners (which only require a 90-degree field of view).\nOnce you have chosen the camera type, housing will come into play.\nAll types of housing can be made to be vandal resistant, which is a step up from weather resistant. These types of housings are most commonly dome shaped and are designed to withstand unfriendly environments while still providing a usable image.\nThe selection of features for your security cameras will depend on the application and your individual needs.\nTo demonstrate the differences in resolution, an old analog camera is about ¼ megapixel, an HDTV screen is just over 2 megapixels, and the highest resolution projected image in movie theaters (4K) is 8.8 megapixels.\nWhile higher resolution cameras may be appealing, these do not respond as well as lower resolution cameras in low light situations. Thus, it is possible to buy more resolution than you need, unnecessarily increasing storage costs while decreasing performance.\nThere are also cameras with infrared illuminators, which provide their own light source to obtain better images in low light settings. As mentioned, in order to improve low light performance, you will need to sacrifice some resolution.\nNo matter what the application, there’s likely a perfect security solution thanks to the comprehensive options available. And while the selection process may seem overwhelming, we are here to help.

But what happens if criminals proceed anyways?\nIndoor security cameras will show you what happens when the intruders get in. Should theft or damage occur, you are left with video evidence of the crimes to assist in capturing the criminals.\nFor everyday use, indoor security cameras help to monitor daily activities, such as kids returning home from school, or checking in on pets while you’re at work.\nWhile there are several benefits of indoor cameras, it may be difficult discerning the most effective places to install them. Here are some helpful tips for choosing the best locations for your indoor security cameras.\nStatistics show that the most common entry points for burglars are through first-floor doors or windows, thus, your main entrances should be your top priorities. The front door, back door, garage door, and other first-floor exterior doors and windows should be equipped with some type of security (ex. locks). If possible, installing security cameras to cover all of these spots would be ideal.\nFor a great selection on indoor security cameras and more, visit SecurityCamExpert.com. For more information on site surveys and our installation services, please call 888-203-6294.\nTransit stations receive lots of foot traffic, with people taking advantage of its low cost and convenience. Unfortunately, these public transportation systems are also highly targeted for graffiti, thefts, assaults, and terrorist attacks. In an effort to fight back, an influx of advanced security cameras and high quality equipment have arrived.\nUpgrading security camera systems to the latest technology produces better response times, heightened image quality, and, consequently, better suspect identification. With these sophisticated features, rider and driver safety is better preserved, deterring crimes and catching suspects faster.\nAn upgrade to IP systems from analog systems provides better, high resolution pictures and a way to wirelessly archive footage. Reviewing footage is simplified, allowing easy tagging of potential evidence. Power over Ethernet (PoE) technology is helpful in the sense that separate power cables are unnecessary, consolidating functions and cutting costs.\nSecurity cameras installed closest to the driver booth enable audio function with built-in microphones. With this, direct communication to and from command centers is permitted and more efficient responses to problematic events can be delivered. Vandal proof security cameras help to maintain function if physical tampering occurs.\nWide angle camera lenses help increase the viewing field while decreasing the number of security cameras needed. With wide angle camera lenses and proper placement, blind spots can be minimized. Overall cost of the security camera system will go down because of the reduction in security camera needs.\nInfrared/night vision and thermal imaging proves extremely beneficial transit systems, subways especially. These features help to see in darkness and detect warmth. Used in search and rescue efforts, an unconscious person can be found via thermal cameras. In cases of shootings, the heat from a recently fired gun will help locate the weapon, if discarded at the scene.\nAn excellent monitoring system is vital to the overall security camera system, providing remote viewing of the live feed and giving local authorities to access footage as necessary.\nOverall, the security camera systems for public transit stations will help clear any liability issues or potential attacks or abuse. This will help protect both workers and civilians alike, helping to catch suspects faster and possibly prevent crimes before they happen. As our technology continues to improve, crime rates should continue to drop.\nTo employ your own security camera systems within your home or business, visit SecurityCamExpert.com.

This spike in sales and usage is most likely due to its compact design and cost-effective prices. But just because these cameras are affordable does not mean they skimp in the features department.\nYou can find dome cameras equipped with fantastic features for a reasonable price. PTZ (Pan, tilt, zoom) capabilities are common in dome cameras. This allows a single dome camera to reach a wide viewing range, possibly eliminating the need for multiple cameras in a given area. The zooming abilities can zero in on specific details which can be significant in identifying a culprit.\nThe inconspicuousness of the dome camera is often cited as a selling point. Truth is, nowadays, you know a dome camera when you see it. The tinted dome covering is a more optimal feature of the dome camera. While the actual camera is easy to spot, it is nearly impossible to tell which direction the lens is pointed. Furthermore, some dome cameras employ a tracking component, so a person could not suspect the camera is tracking his or her movements.\nDue to varying light in different settings, dome cameras usually have infrared, low light or day/night vision to produce better pictures throughout the day and night. The IR irradiation distance depends on the camera so paying close attention to specifications is important.\nMost dome cameras are vandal proof, adding built in security to your camera investment. If the environment permits, you may be able to install your dome camera out of reach to minimize the possibility of vandalism. However, in some areas, it is inevitable to place the dome camera on a wall or a low ceiling. The vandal proof, tinted dome then comes into play, protecting your camera from any possible damage or destruction from powerful blows.\nOften referred to as the “eye in the sky,” dome cameras offer functionality in an appealing package. If you have any questions regarding dome cameras, please call us at 1-888-203-6294 and our staff will gladly assist you. You may also visit us at SecurityCamExpert.com to browse our inventory of dome cameras and more."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ba046dac-09fd-4a10-9ffb-7e791ba682ab>","<urn:uuid:48ca9c2b-36b2-4046-89f8-687a350caa33>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the optimal way to create coral frags from Frogspawn coral, and what safety precautions should be taken during the process?","answer":"To create coral frags from Frogspawn coral, an electric bandsaw should be used for clean, precise cuts at least 2 inches away from the top. The branching type Frogspawn is more receptive to fragging than the wall type. After cutting, the frag should be attached to a coral frag plug or live rock using cyanoacrylate gel or 2-part epoxy adhesive. Safety precautions are essential - gloves must be worn as Frogspawn stings can cause skin rash, and protective goggles are recommended. It's important to handle the coral carefully to avoid soft tissue damage, and the coral should be irritated slightly to retract its tentacles before cutting. After fragging, treating the new frags with an iodine solution can help prevent diseases.","context":["Euphyllia divisa, better known as the Frogspawn coral is one of the most popular large polyp stony (LPS) coral in the reef hobby alongside its sibling species, Hammer coral (Euphyllia ancora) and Torch coral (Euphyllia glabrescens).\nThe name Frogspawn was coined from its attractive multi-tipped tentacles that bear a striking resemblance to a mass of frog eggs. This coral species is hardy, semi-aggressive, and able to attain rapid growth spurts in favorable water conditions.\nThis article provides an insight into the captive care of Frogspawn corals; these consist of feeding, behavior, placement, care tips, and lots more.\nQuick Notes about Frogspawn Corals\n|Scientific Name||Euphyllia divisa|\n|Tank size (minimum)||30 gallons (~120 liters)|\n|Propagation||Easy to moderate|\n|Optimal Temperature||24 – 28°C (~76°F – 83°F)|\n|Optimal Salinity||SG = 1.023 – 1.025|\n|Optimal PH||8.1 – 8.4|\n|Optimal KH||8 – 12|\n|Nitrate||Less than 20 ppm|\n|Tank placement||Bottom to Middle|\n|Growth Rate||Slow to moderate|\n|Color Form||Brown to tan, green to yellow-green and blue (rare), with cream, pink, lavender or white visible tips at the end of the tentacles|\nOrigin and Taxonomy of Frogspawn Corals\nFrogspawn coral is a large polyp stony coral that belongs to Euphylliidae, a family of zooxanthellate scleractinans. The coral species Euphyllia divisa was first described by Veron & Pichon in 1979. Frogspawn coral can also be referred to as Octopus coral, Grape coral, Honey coral, and Wall coral, and it is related to other renowned LPS corals, namely: Torch coral and Hammer coral.\nSpecies: Euphyllia divisa\nHabitat of Frogspawn Corals\nFrogspawn coral is a species that can be found in a variety of reef regions around the world. They form colonies in reef slopes of fairly deep turbid waters to a depth of 40 m (131 ft) where they enjoy planktonic matter and indirect bright lighting.\nThis coral is naturally domiciled in the Indo-Pacific, Fiji, Australia, Solomon Islands, East China Sea, The Great Barrier Reef, and Ryukyu Islands.\nDescription of Frogspawn Corals\nFrogspawn corals form large colonies with corralite walls that emerge on the outer edges, these corralites are thin and sharp-edged. Some colonies are capable of reaching up to 1 meter (3 ft) in size.\nThis Euphyllia species has very long tentacles when fully extended, they are covered with short branches that are tipped with multiple small rounded knobs. Another prominent feature is the presence of a flabello-meandroid skeleton.\nFrogspawn coral tentacles are thick, lumpy, and long; with some branching into double skeletal or single heads, at the end of these tentacles are brightly colored tips. These polyps have a bubble-like outward appearance that resembles a mass frog spawn (frog eggs).\nA variety of Frogspawn corals is the Euphyllia paradivisa known to hobbyists as the Branching Frogspawn coral. This species is endemic to the waters of the Central-Indo Pacific and American Samoa. Like Euphyllia divisa, it has very long tentacles ending with multiple tipped branches, this variety has a branching/phaceloid skeleton. Branching Frogspawn corals also grow a little bit faster and easier to frag.\nThe color of Frogspawn coral tentacles is usually brown to tan, green to yellow-green, and blue (rare), with cream, pink, lavender, or white visible tips at the end of the tentacles.\nBehavior of Frogspawn Corals\nEuphyllia corals can be quite aggressive when placed in close proximity to other corals, as they tend to battle/compete for real estate in your aquarium. Therefore they should be adequately spaced from other corals in the tank.\nFrogspawn coral is hostile but not to the species in its own genus, however, corals of other genera in the family Euphylliidae are not exempted from this hostility.\nAs observed, the polyps extend during the day and only partially at night. Their sweeper tentacles can extend up to 25 cm in larger colonies when they witness hunger pangs, this poses a threat to nearby corals because of the powerful sting they can deliver.\nSome shrimp species dwelling nearby will enjoy the protection of the Frogspawn coral tentacles by means of commensalism.\nFeeding Frogspawn Corals\nFrogspawn coral has a symbiotic relationship with algae hosting in their tissues, this alga is called zooxanthellae. This specialized feeding mode enables them to feed through the conversion of light into food, the zooxanthellae provide just enough nutrition to sustain itself and the coral.\nAdditionally, the corals will capture planktonic organisms and food particles suspended in the water column, as well as the absorption of organic matter.\nRegardless of the presence and role of the photosynthetic zooxanthellae, they should also be fed live and meaty frozen food. Through supplemental or manual feeding, the corals will grow more vigorously, so don’t assume that the nutrition they get from photosynthesis is enough to make them attain rapid growth spurt and gain enormous mass.\nThey can be fed:\n- mysis shrimp,\n- vitamin-enriched brine shrimp,\n- daphnia or small fish,\n- reef roids (link to Amazon)\nFrozen foods can be thawed to make it easier for the corals to consume them.\nTank Requirements and Water Parameters\nThe minimum tank size for housing Frogspawn corals is 20 gallons (80 L). Opting for a larger tank is even better as it allows for adequate spacing amongst the corals and stability of water parameters.\nWater type, Temperature, Hardness, and pH:\nTemperature: The optimal temperature range for keeping Frogspawn corals is between 76 – 83 °F (24 – 28 °C). Keeping the temperature constant (avoiding fluctuation) is more important than the actual temperature itself.\npH: The ideal pH level is between 8.1 – 8.4. Make sure to keep your tank from experiencing rapid swings in pH.\nHardness: Frogspawn corals will appreciate water hardness value between 8 – 12 dKH.\nAlthough Frogspawn corals can tolerate a wide range of light intensity, including high lighting, they still prefer moderate lighting for best growth and coloration. Output from fluorescent bulbs and LED lighting are enough for the lighting and energy requirements of the corals.\nMetal halides might seem like a good option, but this light source gives off too much heat that is capable of damaging the corals’ tissues.\nNote: The output from LED lighting around 50 – 100 PAR value, is sufficient for the lighting needs of the corals.\nTip: Do not forget that in nature these corals are commonly attached to vertical surfaces. So, place Frogspawn corals at of an angle. If the light cannot reach their branches, they often stop growing and their head do not sprout at all.\nThe water flow should be moderate, not too weak or strong. It should be good enough to keep detritus from collecting on the body of the Frogspawn corals.\nEnsure that the corals do not get hit by direct water flow. It may damage the corals or even make the polyps unable to extend fully.\nNote: Under too low flow Frogspawn corals take on more water to inflate themselves. As a result, there is more space between tissue, it leads to the loss of the coloration, from the visual point.\nCare and Maintenance of Frogspawn Corals\nEndeavor to carry out partial water changes of either 20 – 25% monthly, 10 – 15% bi-weekly, or 5% weekly to maintain good water quality and replenish the required trace elements.\nIn addition, the corals should be inspected frequently, this goes a long way in the timely detection of any damage, infection or unusual changes in their behavior. A sick or unhealthy coral should be separated from the rest, and moved to a quarantine tank for proper treatment, this helps to prevent further spread of infections.\nRegular inspection and a good water change schedule are essential in ensuring good health of the corals and optimal water chemistry. Maintain the following trace elements and compounds in the right proportions to promote the best growth conditions.\nCalcium: Between 400 to 450 ppm.\nMagnesium: 1,250 – 1,350 ppm\nSalinity/Specific Gravity: 1.023 – 1.025\nStrontium: 8 – 10 ppm\nNitrates: < 1 ppm\nPhosphate: < 0.05 ppm\nAmmonia: 0 ppm\nPlacement in the Tank\nPositioning the Frogspawn coral should be subjected to three factors:\n- light intensity,\n- water flow and\n- proper spacing to curb aggression.\nA best practice in housing Frogspawn corals is to abide by the 6-inches (15 cm) rule. Place other corals at least 6 inches away from Euphyllia divisa. An exception to this rule is with other similar Euphyllia species like the Hammer corals, as they will not be harmed by the sweeper tentacles of the Frogspawn coral.\nNote: Even though Torch corals Frogspawn corals are different species of the same genus. Torch corals can be too aggressive towards Frogspawn corals. It is not recommended to keep them together as they tend to compete with other corals for space in the reef tank.\nThe placement of the corals should be subjected to an exercise of trial and error in different areas of the tank till you locate a pleasant spot, they will extend their polyps fully and feed properly when they are situated in a comfortable place.\nAvoid placing the corals in a spot with very fast or direct water flow, this can cause the polyps to retract and hamper on its ability to filter-feed.\nPotential Problems Associated with Frogspawn Corals\nBrown jelly infection: This is a common disease for corals. It is characterized by a jelly-like brown mass that appears to be floating on the surface of the coral. Brown jelly disease is caused by poor water quality or tissue damage, it can lead to rapid tissue necrosis and it is capable of spreading to other corals in the tank.\nSolution: Brown jelly disease can be treated using a broad-spectrum on the infected areas. You should remove the sick colony from the main tank, scrub off and siphon any visible brown jelly. Afterward, treat the sick colony in a freshwater or iodine dip (15ppt), then place the colony in a quarantine tank till it recovers before transferring to the main tank.\nDo not overdose. Use the instructions on the bottle based on your tank size.\nRust brown flatworms: Brown flatworm is an acoel worm prevalent in the reefkeeping hobby. These organisms are tan-brown or rust-colored with a red dot and can reach a quarter of an inch in size. They are characterized by an oval and slightly elongated structure with two tail-like appendages at their posterior.\nRust brown flatworms grow rapidly in aquariums with high nutrient levels, often existing in high populations, they will actively attach to the Frogspawn coral’s body and block light from reaching their tissues.\nSolution: These flatworms can be controlled by maintaining low nutrient levels in the reef tank through the use of carbon, aggressive protein skimming, and increased water flow. Also, proper quarantine of new corals and other fauna before placement will help to minimize the risk of transferring acoels into the tank. They can also be tackled using natural predators like the Blue Velvet Nudibranch (Chelidonura varians) and Wrasses.\nIn addition, an infected colony can be treated by dipping it in a dechlorinated freshwater dip for 5 to 10 seconds (Acoels are sensitive to salinity changes). Before doing that, ensure that the water has a similar pH and temperature as the aquarium water, this is to reduce the amount of stress on the colony.\nMishandling: The corals should be handled with caution during fragging, placement, relocation, or transfer between tanks; that way the risk of soft tissue damage will be highly minimized. Furthermore, shy away from fragging corals with a bone crusher of scissors to avoid splintering into the fleshy polyp area.\nSolution: The use of band saw allows for a safer and precise cutting of the corals when compared to bone cutters and sheers.\nFragging and Propagation Frogspawn Corals\nFrogspawn corals can reproduce through sexual and asexual means.\nIn the wild, they carry out sexual reproduction by releasing gametes into the water, resulting in a fertilized egg which eventually gives rise to a free-swimming planula larva. Afterward, the planula larva will metamorphose to a tiny polyp which begins to excrete calcium carbonate, thus developing into a coral.\nMoreover, Frogspawn corals are capable of reproducing asexually. As seen in reef aquariums, a Frogspawn coral will bud off a small group of polyps with little skeletons present. It usually takes them a few months to turn into full-sized heads.\nThey will also break-off individual polyps in response to stress, these polyps will relocate elsewhere and start a new colony.\nAnother method is through coral fragging. However, it can be a little bit tricky because, as I have mentioned earlier, there are two types of Frogspawn corals: the wall type and the branching type.\nPersonally, I would not recommend fragging the wall type if you do not have the skill to make clean cuts with a bandsaw. The branching type is way more receptive to this process.\nThis process is simple, but you have to be cautious.\n- You should ensure your hands are clean or wear a pair of gloves. Do not touch it with your bare hands. Their stings can cause skin rash for a few days!\n- You will need a decent-sized, healthy, and lively coral for this purpose.\n- Take out the coral and irritate it a little bit, so that it will retract the tentacles. Frogspawn corals are pretty sticky and it is easy to accidentally rip their feeder tentacle off.\n- Using an electric bandsaw, divide the coral into several parts by cutting through it at least 2 inches (5 cm) away from the top.\n- Attach the frag to a coral frag plug or live rock using cyanoacrylate gel or 2-part epoxy adhesive, place them back into the aquarium and provide ample water flow.\nTip: Take a frag plug and put it in the water for a couple of minutes to release the air bubbles that might be in the ceramic frag plug.\nTip #2: Treat the new frags with an iodine solution (for example, Lugol’s solution) to prevent them from contracting diseases, then you can attach them to a live rock before placing them back into the tank.\nThings that you might need depending on your method:\nFrogspawn Corals and Tankmates\nAlso, in the absence of sea anemones, Clownfish are known to host in Frogspawn corals in reef tanks. Is it good? No, it is not.\nClownfish may accidentally damage Frogspawn corals that can cause infections like brown jelly. Basically the same can be said about hermit crabs, crabs, etc.\nFrogspawn corals do not like to be disturbed.\nBuying Frogspawn Corals\nThis hardy LPS coral can be purchased at offline pet stores and from reputable online breeders/vendors as well.\nEndeavor to inspect or enquire extensively to be sure of the coral’s health condition in order not to obtain specimens that may have soft tissue damage.\nA head may cost about $50 – $200 depending on size and other factors.\nFrogspawn corals make for a great addition to reef aquariums. It is adored for a lot of reasons which include fast growth rate, ease of care, attractive colors, and the gentle sway of its long multi-tipped tentacles in the water current.\nThis Euphyllia coral is lively, charming, intriguing, and beginner-friendly. Therefore, it can be easily recommended to get one or two for your reef aquarium.\nTop 10 Corals for Beginners\nHow to Care for Green Star Polyps\nHow to Care for Bird’s Nest Corals\nProper Care for Carpet Anemone\nHow to Care for Zoanthid Corals\nHow to Care for Acan Corals\nHow to Care for Torch Corals\nHow to Care for Hammer Corals\nHow to Care for Elegance Coral\nHow to Care for Duncan Corals\nHow to Care for Bubble Tip Anemones\nHow to Care for Pulsing Xenia\nHow to Care for Ricordea Coral\nHow to Care for Palm Tree Polyp\nHow to Care for Kenya Tree Coral","What is a Coral Frag?\nA coral frag is simply a fragment of a coral. Instead of saying coral fragments we often refer to them as a frags. 10 years ago in the aquarium hobby the idea of buying, selling or trading frags was still relatively new. Now frags are the commonly accepted form of coral among aquarists.\nA collection of different coral frag species\nHow are coral frags made?\nCoral frags are made by cutting or breaking off pieces of larger coral colonies. A colony is the term used to describe a larger or unfragged coral. Fragging a colony would entail cutting fragments off of it or is some cases cutting up the entire colony into many small pieces. With proper aquarium care the frags will once again grow into colonies were the process can be repeated.\nIt took about 1 year to grow this Tenuis frag from a frag to a colony\nHow to make coral frags\nWe use a special bandsaw in order to safely make frags from our colonies. Some corals we frag we use simple tools and others we are even able to frag by hand. We often use razor blades aswell to cut soft corals. There is no rule book when it comes to making coral fragments and no two colonies would be fragged the same. Every piece is unique and approached differently and fragged with different techniques\nA special bandsaw with a diamond blade is used to safely and precisely cut the corals and make frags\nIn some cases bone cutters are the best option for cutting through the hard skeleton of corals\nWhat is a Frag Plug?\nA Frag plug is a small piece of specially designed ceramic that holds the coral in place. The coral pieces are glued with special adhesive to frag plugs. The frag plug is used to mount the coral in the correct position. Most coral we want facing up towards the light. Similar to planting a tree you want to plant it straight and not have it fall over. There are few corals that grow sideways and in those cases we would frag and glue them according to the way we know or think the will grow. The stem is designed to fit in coral frag racks, these rack allow people to hover or hold many coral frags in their aquarium until they can decide were they want to glue the frags. Once a coral is adhered to your rock work its not advisable to move it. These frag rack holders give people time to decide and have the corals held in limbo into they are ready to commit to a spot\nFrags plugs in many peoples opinion are unsightly. We are trying to recreate reef aquariums that mimic natural reefs and you wouldn’t find small ceramic frag plugs all over the reef. With time many coral frags will completely cover their respective frag plugs and you can no longer see them.\nThis coral is very close to covering the entire frag plug to the point where its not longer visible\nIts important to remember some corals contain poison. Corals are living animals and want to protect themselves. We need to respect them and be careful when fragging. We always recommend wearing gloves and goggles when make coral frags.\nIts important to safely frag corals and always use gloves and goggles\nWhy do people Buy Coral Frags ?\nPeople buy coral frags in order to one day grow them into colonies.\nThere are a couple of great advantages of purchasing frags over colonies\nIts fun to watch them grow\nThey are fun to collect\nYou can try many different corals for much less that buying a colony\nIf a single frag dies it may only cost $10-20 were colonies often sell for $100-200\nThey are sustainable and many corals are now being grown and traded in Canada resulting in less impact in our oceans\nThe downside is they can , depending on the coral species take a long time to grow into a colony. This hobby however rewards those who are patient\nThis beautiful watermelon chalice frag will one day grow into a showpiece colony"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:093c6046-c81b-4fba-b706-0428e483c065>","<urn:uuid:a2e1603d-030a-495c-9d98-036f2fe8a9f2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do supermarkets monitor and reduce their food waste using modern technology?","answer":"Supermarkets can monitor and reduce food waste using big data and eco-friendly aerobic digesters with cloud-based data programs. These digesters work like mechanical stomachs, converting waste into liquid that's discharged through sewers. When food waste is placed in these digesters, it's weighed and detailed data points are generated immediately. This real-time information and analytics allow supermarkets to monitor their input and output, helping them better manage their ordering processes and ensure most products go toward sales rather than landfills.","context":["Each year, approximately 1.3 billion tons of food waste is created globally. In the United States alone, approximately 34 million tons of food is delivered to landfills, which accounts for more than 35% of total landfill waste. These jarring statistics may not be top-of-mind for a supermarket that is clearing out inventory that is unsellable, but they demonstrate that the abundance of food that is not consumed is a serious problem that needs to be addressed, both here in the U.S. and worldwide.\nFood waste in landfills and the hazards it creates through the release of harmful methane gas not only present a dangerous scenario for our environment, it is also an issue of concern for any business that is forced to dispose of a significant amount of food, including grocery stores. For a supermarket, which — due to an increased demand for produce and the freshest products, goods that are damaged during distribution, or simply inefficient purchasing — must dispose of food that is unable to be donated, the economic impact of disposal sometimes can be severe.\nFortunately, there are emerging technologies that can play a role in managing this problem, and provide businesses the opportunity to enhance their operations, help their bottom line, and, most importantly, improve environmental sustainability. It should be acknowledged that food retailers have made progress through industry initiatives and partnerships, such as the Food Waste Reduction Alliance. But these efforts are not enough on their own and may not be the most effective in terms of achieving lasting results.\nThe best solution that has emerged in recent years is big data. If a supermarket — from the local independent grocer to the regional or national chain — is provided real-time information and analytics that track their processes related to food disposal, they can better manage the amount and timing of what they order. In the end, this will ensure the vast majority of products they are bringing into their stores are going towards sales and not a landfill, and the products they are not able to sell are disposed of safely and kept to a minimum.\nSo how does a business achieve these environmental and operational efficiencies? Products such as on-site eco-friendly aerobic digesters, which feature cloud-based data programs, are an example. When a supermarket places their food waste into these digesters — which work like a mechanical version of your stomach and convert the waste into liquid that is safely discharged through sewers — it is weighed and then detailed data points are generated immediately and cataloged. Having these metrics at its fingertips allows a supermarket to immediately monitor its input and output, which can provide a sophisticated model to achieve maximum efficiency and profitability.\nFor supermarkets, in an era when accessibility through online delivery is changing the way people shop for groceries, the ability to limit costs and increase profit margins (all while shrinking their carbon footprint) is vital to their long-term success. In a perfect world, all the food that a store does not sell would go to those suffering from hunger and not a landfill. But while we should all try to achieve this goal, the reality is that donating food is much harder than it should be, for a variety of reasons, and not all food waste is recoverable for human consumption or animal feed. Absent better infrastructure to get this food to those in need, supermarkets and other businesses must make sure that when they are disposing of food waste, they are doing so responsibly and effectively. If so, we will be headed in the right direction towards addressing a global issue and give supermarkets enhanced tools to make a significant and cost-effective contribution to the problem."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:24ba85dd-b8ec-4538-b79d-b8faad44acab>"],"error":null}
