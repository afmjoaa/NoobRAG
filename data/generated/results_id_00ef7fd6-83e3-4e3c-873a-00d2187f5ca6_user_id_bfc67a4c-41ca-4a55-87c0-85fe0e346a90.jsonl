{"question":"I'm comparing different research sampling methods for my thesis. What are the main distinctions between qualitative and quantitative research approaches when it comes to sampling strategies and data analysis techniques?","answer":"Qualitative and quantitative research differ substantially in their sampling and analysis approaches. Qualitative research uses non-probability and purposive sampling, with smaller sample sizes, and continues until data saturation is reached (no new themes emerge). Its data analysis focuses on codes, themes, and patterns rather than statistical analysis. In contrast, quantitative research methods, used in scientific research and disciplines like economics, involve measuring subjects or data and typically require larger sample sizes. For data analysis, qualitative research may use computer software for coding and produces rich descriptions or theories, often including direct participant quotes, while quantitative research employs statistical analysis. Additionally, qualitative research aims to generalize to theoretical understanding rather than making empirical inferences to entire populations.","context":["Limitation in research methods refers to the variables or influences the researcher can't control. These uncontrollable variables often mean a lack of adequate information on the given research subject.Continue Reading\nResearch Methods and Design\nWhen conducting any form of research, there are multiple things that can determine the design of a specific research project. The research question, the ethics involved in the research, the methodology of the project and the budget the researcher has available are all major parts of how a research project is designed and carried out.\nThere are two types of research methods: qualitative and quantitative. Both research methods involve gathering information on a subject. Qualitative research is used most often in the social sciences to study people, behavior, language and culture. Quantitative research methods are used in scientific research and in some disciplines, such as economics. This kind of research involves quantifying or measuring the subject or data relating to the subject.\nLimitation in Research Methods\nAll research has some limitations because there are always certain variables that the researcher is unable to control. Sometimes these limitations are more or less significant, depending on the type of research and the subject of the research. Some possible occurrences of limitation in research methods include a lack of available or reliable data, lack of prior research on the subject, the sample size available or the measure used to collect the data.\nWhile limitations in research methods can cause problems in the research, most often the research project can continue despite the limitations present. There are instances wherein limitations can render a certain research project unusable or unreliable, particularly when there isn't enough information or variables to obtain an accurate interpretation of the data being researched. Often in qualitative research, certain limitations stop the findings from being applied to the larger population, making the research findings unusable or unable to be used for larger control groups.\nIn additions to limitation in research methods, there can also be limitations of the researcher conducting the study. True, accurate research is meant to be unbiased to offer an accurate representation of a certain group or groups of data. When a researcher has a bias that would skew an interpretation of the research, it is considered a researcher limitation. Lack of proper access to information, experiences and familiarity with the subject matter can all be researcher limitations that can affect a research project or method.\nTypes of Research Studies\nIn addition to the different methods of research, there are varying research studies. Any research method or study can have limitations to some extent. Limitations will vary depending on the type of research study and what is being studied.\nMany research studies fall into one of a few common categories. Correlation research examines the covariation of multiple variables, such as the covariation of heart disease among those diagnosed as obese. True experiments are defined as studies wherein all variables are attempted to be controlled, aside from the variable that is the focus of the study. These studies are often laboratory studies and include traditional control group studies and double-blind studies.\nQuasi-experiments are another type of research study similar to true experiments. The major difference between true and quasi-experiments is that quasi-experiment research uses groups that are naturally formed, rather than bringing groups together for the purpose of the research study.Learn more about Social Sciences","Statistics from Altmetric.com\nQualitative research methods have become increasingly important as ways of developing nursing knowledge for evidence-based nursing practice. Qualitative research answers a wide variety of questions related to nursing's concern with human responses to actual or potential health problems. The purpose of qualitative research is to describe, explore, and explain phenomena being studied.1 Qualitative research questions often take the form of what is this? or what is happening here? and are more concerned with the process rather than the outcome.2 This editorial provides an overview of qualitative research, describes 3 common types of qualitative research, and gives examples of their use in nursing.\nSampling, data collection, and data analysis\nSampling refers to the process used to select a portion of the population for study. Qualitative research is generally based on non-probability and purposive sampling rather than probability or random approaches.3 Sampling decisions are made for the explicit purpose of obtaining the richest possible source of information to answer the research questions. Purposive sampling decisions influence not only the selection of participants but also settings, incidents, events, and activities for data collection. Some of the sampling strategies used in qualitative research are maximum variation sampling, stratified purposeful sampling, and snowball sampling.3 Qualitative research usually involves smaller sample sizes than quantitative research.4 Sampling in qualitative research is flexible and often continues until no new themes emerge from the data, a point called data saturation.\nMany data collection techniques are used in qualitative research, but the most common are interviewing and participant observation.5 Unstructured interviews are used when the researcher knows little about the topic, whereas semi-structured interviews are used when the researcher has an idea of the questions to ask about a topic. Participant observation is used to observe research participants in as natural a setting as possible. The types of participant observation range from complete participation to complete observation.5 To learn more about the topic being studied, qualitative researchers may also use other data sources such as journals, newspapers, letters, books, photographs, and video tapes.\nQualitative data analysis, unlike quantitative data analysis, is not concerned with statistical analysis, but with analysis of codes, themes, and patterns in the data.6 Increasingly, qualitative researchers use computer software programs to assist with coding and analysis of data.6 The product of qualitative research varies with the approach used. Qualitative research may produce a rich, deep description of the phenomenon being studied or a theory about the phenomenon. Qualitative research reports often contain direct quotes from participants that provide rich illustrations of the study themes. Qualitative research, unlike its quantitative counterpart, does not lend itself to empirical inference to a population as a whole; rather it allows the researcher to generalise to a theoretical understanding of the phenomenon being examined.\nTypes of qualitative research\nThere are many different types of qualitative research, such as ethnography, phenomenology, grounded theory, life history, and ethnomethodology.6 As in quantitative research, it is important for the nurse researcher to select the qualitative research approach that would best answer the research question. Three of the most commonly used approaches to qualitative research in nursing are phenomenology, ethnography, and grounded theory.5 The goals and methods associated with each approach will be described briefly in the following sections. Examples of research studies that use each approach and that have previously been abstracted in Evidence-Based Nursing are summarised to illustrate some of the similarities and differences among approaches. Other sources are available that provide a more complete description and comparison of these approaches and their use in nursing.2, 4, 7\nThe aim of a phenomenological approach to qualitative research is to describe accurately the lived experiences of people, and not to generate theories or models of the phenomenon being studied.8 The origins of phenomenology are in philosophy, particularly the works of Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty.8 Because the primary source of data is the life world of the individual being studied, in depth interviews are the most common means of data collection. Furthermore, emerging themes are frequently validated with participants because their meanings of that lived experience are central in phenomenological study.\nPhenomenology was used to answer the research question what is the lived experience of adults who are integrating a hearing loss into their lives?9 (See Evidence-Based Nursing, 1998 October, p131). The convenience sample consisted of 32 adults with mild to profound degrees of hearing loss. Data were collected through semi-structured, audiotaped interviews with participants. Analysis involved identification of core and major themes in the data, and validation of the findings with selected participants. The core theme of dancing with eloquently captured the participants' perceptions of moving, gracefully or awkwardly, with the changes required by hearing loss, never sure of the next steps. The major themes of dancing with (a) loss and fear, (b) fluctuating feelings, (c) courage amidst change, and (d) an altered life perspective, provide the reader with a rich description of the participants' perceptions of what it was like to live with hearing loss. These findings offer nurses a deep understanding of the phenomenon that they can apply in their interactions with people living with hearing loss. The phenomenological approach was key to uncovering participants' meanings of the complex and dynamic process of integrating hearing loss into their lives.\nThe goal of ethnography is to learn about a culture from the people who actually live in that culture.10 A culture can be defined not only as an ethnic population but also as a society, a community, an organisation, a spatial location, or a social world.11 Ethnography has its roots in cultural anthropology, which aims to describe the values, beliefs, and practices of cultural groups.10 The process of ethnography is characterised by intensive, ongoing, face to face involvement with participants of the culture being studied and by participating in their settings and social worlds during a period of fieldwork. The essential data collection methods of participant observation and indepth interviewing permit the researcher to learn about the meanings that informants attach to their knowledge, behaviours, and activities.12 The context (social, political, and economic) of the culture assumes an important part of an ethnographic study, unlike a phenomenological study.\nAn ethnographic approach was used to answer the research question what is it like to be a young urban African-American who has at least one AIDS-afflicted family member?13 (See Evidence-Based Nursing, 1998 October, p130.) Stories of 6 young people are described in the article. There was an extensive 4 year period of in depth fieldwork that included telephone and in person interviews and participant observation. The stories powerfully illustrated how the culture in which the youths had to survive was so alienating that they deliberately sought exposure to HIV. The findings provide an important understanding for nurses working with adolescents in either preventive or acute care roles. The ethnographic approach was uniquely suited to bring attention to the important influence of the context of marginalisation, insensitive social policies, and demanding caretaking responsibilities, on the lives of these youths.\nThe purpose of a grounded theory approach to qualitative research is to discover social-psychological processes.14 Grounded theory was developed by Glaser and Strauss in the 1960s and is founded philosophically on symbolic interactionism.15 Distinct features of grounded theory include theoretical sampling and the constant comparative method. Theoretical sampling refers to sampling decisions made throughout the entire research process in which participants are selected based on their knowledge of the topic and based on emerging study findings. In data analysis, the researcher constantly compares incidents, categories, and constructs to determine similarities and differences and to develop a theory that accounts for behavioural variation. Both observation and interviewing are commonly used for data collection.\nGrounded theory was used to answer the research question what is the process of reimaging after an alteration in body appearance or function?16 (See Evidence-Based Nursing, 1998 October, p133.) The theoretical sample consisted of 28 participants who had experienced body image disruptions such as significant weight change; amputation or paralysis of body parts; and scars from burns, surgery, or trauma. Participants were interviewed at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after the physical alteration. The constant comparative method of concurrent data collection and analysis was used to develop a 3 phase theory of the process of reimaging: (a) body image disruption, (b) wishing for restoration, and (c) reimaging the self. Nurses can use this vital understanding of the phases of reimaging to assist clients through the process by anticipating potential needs or problems, providing information and support, and exploring alternative problem solving strategies. The grounded theory approach was ideally suited to discovering the social-psychological process of reimaging.\nThe examples of nursing research studies using 3 different approaches exemplify the value of qualitative research in answering important nursing questions. The studies also provide rich illustration of the differences and similarities between the disparate approaches that are captured by the term “qualitative research.” The approaches differed in the type of research question asked, the philosophical underpinnings, the methods used, and to some extent, the final product. All studies, however, resulted in important new information about the phenomena studied. This new information facilitates a deeper understanding of participants' experiences by nurse readers and—as long as nurses remain aware of the theoretical rather than empirical basis for generalising from the qualitative findings—has the potential for influencing nursing practice in similar situations.\nIf you wish to reuse any or all of this article please use the link below which will take you to the Copyright Clearance Center’s RightsLink service.

{"question":"How does industrial symbiosis benefit the environment and economy?","answer":"Industrial symbiosis creates multiple environmental and economic benefits. For example, in the UK's National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP), the initiative cut carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 42 million tonnes and redirected over 48 million tonnes of resources from landfill. Economically, it generated more than £1 billion in benefits, providing a 6-9:1 return on government investment. The program also generated additional tax revenues, secured over 10,000 jobs, and stimulated new business startups. Nearly 20% of the synergies involved new R&D, bringing new technologies to market rapidly due to the program's demand-pull on eco-innovation.","context":["UK-based International Synergies Limited is widely acknowledged as the world’s leading expert in industrial symbiosis, having developed a model that has been applied across five continents. In this article, the company’s Chief Executive, Peter Laybourn, discusses how the approach helps policy makers and business to move towards a circular economy.\nIndustrial symbiosis is recognized across the world as a driver of green growth, acknowledged for its contribution to eco-innovation, job creation, securing critical materials and resource efficiency. The idea behind industrial symbiosis is relatively simple; all resources used in industrial processes are redirected (whether previously used or just under-valued) and used as inputs by other companies, typically from a different industry sector. In essence, industrial symbiosis keeps resources in productive use for longer – a fundamental feature of the circular economy.\nInitial perceptions about industrial symbiosis focused just on material re-use, but we have found that the approach can equally be applied to energy, water, asset utilization, knowledge transfer, and expertise. Additionally, we have found that through the industrial symbiosis engagement model, other circular economy tools can be introduced such as design for environment (DfE), cleaner production, remanufacturing, etc.\nUnlocking the value embedded in under-utilized industrial resources can be challenging, especially as it involves more than merely brokering a link between two or more companies. Extensive knowledge of different industrial processes or manufacturing techniques, combined with an understanding of the latest processing technologies and innovations, is essential to identify immediate, medium, and long-term opportunities for resource recovery and reuse.\nWhile there are a number of different models of industrial symbiosis around the world, to date, the facilitated model, which has been implemented at regional or national level so far in 18 countries, is the most successful thanks to its ability to be applied at scale. A facilitated cross sector engagement model, we have found, is key to bringing together producers and users of waste resources with innovators, the research community and entrepreneurs, especially as most industrial symbiosis transactions occur between partners outside traditional supply chains.\nOur most successful programme to date is the UK’s National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP), which has effectively created a blueprint for projects around the world. NISP has been operating in the UK since 2005 and, at its peak, engaged with 15,000 businesses, the majority of which were SMEs or micros – a difficult segment of industry to engage on the sustainability agenda given all the other pressures upon them.\nWith such an extensive network of companies, NISP completed thousands of synergies, collectively cutting the country’s carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (CO2e) by 42 million tonnes, and redirecting over 48 million tonnes of ‘wasted resources’ from landfill. At the same time, NISP generated more than £1 billion in economic benefits, resulting in a healthy 6-9: 1 return on the government’s investment, as well as generating additional tax revenues. Nearly 20% of NISP synergies involve new R&D, many bringing new technologies to market in record time because of the demand-pull of the programme on eco-innovation. It also was responsible for securing over 10,000 jobs and a number of new business start ups.\nGlobal acknowledgement for NISP includes the World Wide Fund (WWF) for Nature, which in 2010 credited it as being one of the world’s top 20 “Green Game Changing Business Innovations”. In the same year, the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) cited industrial symbiosis (à la NISP) as “systemic innovation, vital to future green growth”.\nThe experience of implementing NISP in the UK has enabled us to evolve the model for application around the world. China, for example, is in the process of implementing its third regional scale industrial symbiosis project with our support – the most recent being established in Jiangsu province. Both Brazil and Turkey also have established programmes and we have recently begun work in Western Cape in South Africa, again building capacity to develop a programme based around the NISP model. Across Europe we have worked with in-country partners to support implementation in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Poland and Romania.\nPolicy-makers and regulators are beginning to integrate industrial symbiosis into spatial planning, economic development, regeneration, and sustainability policies. In its ‘Big City Plan’, Birmingham City Council (UK) is ‘exploiting opportunities around industrial symbiosis. This ‘pro-active’ approach is very complementary to the successful ‘demand-led’ approach of the NISP model. While in Mexico, the Sustainable Production and Consumption Policy (2013–2018) includes a line of action to improve resource utilization through the implementation of industrial symbiosis.\nEurope is in the throes of embracing industrial symbiosis at scale; it is written as a policy recommendation within the European Commission’s Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe and, subsequently, championed as an approach for making immediate environmental and economic gains by the European Resource Efficiency Platform, a high-level working group set up by the Commissioner for the Environment, Mr. Janez Potočnik. (See GLOBE-Net article “A European launch to mark the importance of Industrial Symbiosis“)\nIn response to this increased appetite in Europe, International Synergies has been a key driving force behind the establishment of the European Industrial Symbiosis Association (EUR-ISA). The Association aims to support the wide-scale implementation of industrial symbiosis and promote cross border resource trading with neighbouring networks working together. Speaking at the formal launch in Brussels last year, Commissioner Potočnik said:\n“One company’s waste and by-products, can be another company’s opportunity and cost saving. We need to put those two companies in touch so we don’t just throw away valuable materials but make the most of them. Some companies are already making contacts through successful symbiosis programmes, but it needs to happen much more if we are to move towards a truly resource efficient economy for Europe. This makes business sense, but it is also common sense in Europe where we are so dependent on imports for our raw materials, and in a world where pressure on resources is having increasing environmental impacts.”\nTowards the end of 2013, the European Commission announced it is has earmarked €50 million over the next two years specifically to support the ‘move towards a circular economy through industrial symbiosis’ via Horizon 2020, its newly-labelled research and innovation programme.\nIndustrial symbiosis is proving to be a flexible tool and, over time, we are finding new applications. There are bright prospects for industrial symbiosis to be used to add value to the assets of private equity companies and there is potential to use this approach to rebuild post conflict and post disaster economies. These opportunities are just starting to be addressed by international forums such as the Global Green Growth Forum (3GF) held in Copenhagen in October 2013, and now GLOBE 2014. I hope that it is now only a matter of time (and not a long time) before industrial symbiosis is adopted as mainstream policy and practice across all countries.\nFor more information about International Synergies visit, www.international-synergies.com or EUR-ISA visit, www.EUR_ISA.org. You can also keep up to date with all the latest in the world of industrial symbiosis by following @Peter_Laybourn @IntlSynergies or @EUR_ISA.\nPeter Laybourn is presenting at GLOBE 2014 under the theme of ‘Towards the Circular Economy’. By embracing the opportunities towards a more circular economy, organizations are reinventing products and processes to come up with new solutions through the adoption of nature-inspired design, the sharing of best practices and eco-efficiencies using industrial symbiosis, and leveraging on new business models."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b5c0364b-9563-407a-bf80-c0c3e439d42e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do African lions and impala rams demonstrate different territorial behaviors, and what are their respective hunting patterns?","answer":"Lions and impala rams show distinct territorial behaviors. Lions live in savanna areas with tall grasses and bushes, using this cover for ambush hunting, and will generally face challengers rather than avoid confrontation. They are unpredictable and may charge when annoyed or threatened. Impala rams, driven by testosterone levels linked to shorter days, establish and defend territories and harems, engaging in fights that can sometimes be fatal. While lions are predatory hunters, impala rams become preoccupied with territorial defense and herding females, making them less vigilant and more susceptible to becoming prey themselves.","context":["It’s that time of the year again when impala rams seem to go slightly crazy. Driven by rising testosterone levels linked to shortening day length, rams are beginning to establish and defend territories and harems. What this means is that for 24 hours a day, one can hear strange grunts, snorts and roars across the landscape at Londolozi as rams chase one another about.\nThey do this to establish hierarchies amongst bachelor herds. Once a ram has separated off from a bachelor herd, it is then a challenge to stake out and defend a territory along with the herds of females within that territory. Severe fights can ensue between rams, sometimes even ending in death from the slip of a dagger-sharp horn. Ultimately though, the aim is to impregnate the ewes, who in six months time will drop lambs again, continuing the cycle of impala life.\nThe trouble for the rams is that they become so focused on trying to herd females and keep ownership of their territories that they become incredibly distracted. They spend less time eating and more time chasing each other; less time grooming themselves and more time thrashing their horns in bushes… They also seem to forget that they are top of the menu for the abundance of predators out here.\nThere are hundreds of impala spread across the open crests of Londolozi at present. I am not a betting man but if I was I would quite confidently say that if you take five herds at any one time, there is at least one leopard within a few hundred metres busy watching. Take for example the crests opposite the Londolozi camps up towards Ximpalapala koppie – a stretch of about two kilometres. In five game drives in a row, we saw a leopard on each one; four different individuals along that stretch. Every single sighting involved watching an attempt at hunting rutting impala rams!\nOn three different occasions, we saw the Makomsava female trying over and over to catch any unsuspecting impala. With her in mind, we set off one afternoon to see if she had any success throughout the day. We were surprised when a male leopard walked out next to us – it was the Flat Rock male. He walked a large semi-circle with the aim of approaching a herd of impala without being seen. We almost lost view of him as he lay flat in a small patch of grass on the edge of a game trail. It was almost scripted as within about five minutes, two impala rams came trotting along the path straight towards him! We held our breaths excitedly. The powerful male leopard launched out of the grass. He was within two metres of the impala, but missed the antelope!\nWhat made the sighting even better was the fact that the same impala ram seemed to forget about the leopard and not even twenty minutes later, came running back in the same direction. The second time it took a slightly different path and managed to avoid running into the leopard. Probably just by chance.\nSo in three days and five consecutive game drives we saw: the Makomsava female, the Nhlanguleni female, the Flat Rock male, and the Xinzele female. None of the leopards were seen at the same time, but all were seen in the same area. Every one was within 50 metres of a rutting impala ram. There’s probably a leopard with a hoisted ram right now that is yet to be found…","Big five game\nIn Africa, the big five game animals are the African lion, African elephant, Cape buffalo, African leopard, and White/Black rhinoceros. The term big five game (sometimes capitalized or quoted as \"Big Five\") was coined by big-game hunters and refers to the five most difficult animals in Africa to hunt on foot. Subsequently the term was adopted by safari tour operators for marketing purposes. The term is used in most tourist and wildlife guides that discuss African wildlife safaris. The members of the Big Five were chosen for the difficulty in hunting them and the degree of danger involved, rather than their size.\nThe big five are among the most dangerous, yet most popular species for big game hunters to hunt.\nCountries where all the members of the big five can be found include Botswana, Zambia, Uganda, Namibia, Ethiopia, South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Malawi.\nThe African elephant (Loxodonta africana) is a very large herbivore having thick, almost hairless skin, a long, flexible, prehensile trunk, upper incisors forming long curved tusks of ivory, and large, fan-shaped ears. There are two distinct species of African elephant: African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) and the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana). The elephants are difficult because despite their large size, they are able to hide in tall grass and are more likely to charge than the other species.\nThe black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) is a large, thick-skinned herbivore having one or two upright horns on the nasal bridge. Rhinoceros may refer to either black or white rhinoceros. Among big five game hunters, the black rhinoceros is preferred, although it is now critically endangered.\nThe African or Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is a large horned bovid. Buffalo are sometimes reported to kill more people in Africa than any other animal, although the same claim is also made of hippos and crocodiles. It is considered the most dangerous of the big five, reportedly causing the most hunter deaths, with wounded animals reported to ambush and attack pursuers.\nThe lion (Panthera leo) is a large carnivorous feline of Africa and northwest India, having a short, tawny coat, a tufted tail, and, in the male, a heavy mane around the neck and shoulders. Lions are desirable to hunters because of the very real danger involved. A lion may attack without provocation, and is considered by many to be the best of the big five.\nLion hunting is challenging because of the habitat and temperament of the lion. Lions live in the savanna where tall grasses, shrubs, and bushes obscure them and provide cover and camouflage. This thick undergrowth is commonly referred to as jess. As lions are ambush hunters, they use this natural cover when stalking to creep as close as possible before making a final charge to catch their prey. Lions do not generally avoid confrontation, but will usually face a challenger. Lions are unpredictable and may charge when sufficiently annoyed or confronted by danger. These factors together make lion hunting a challenge to hunters.\nLions are hunted by three methods: baiting, stalking, and hounding. The hunting method is dependent firstly on the law, then the number of lions in a given area, the terrain, and the preference and expertise of the professional hunter, or of the concession owner or hunting outfitter and their client.\nBaiting involves the hunter lying in wait in a natural or constructed blind. Prior to the lion hunt, a prey species is hunted beforehand for use as bait. The bait is then secured to a tree or secure structure in an area which is known to be frequented by lions; usually this will be close to a watering hole. The bait is checked regularly until there are signs the carcass has been visited by a lion. Then a blind is constructed, usually 30–50 yd (27–46 m) from the bait, where the hunting party can remain concealed, usually from early evening until early morning of the next day.\nStalking involves driving along trails in areas where lions are known to inhabit. Once fresh fæces are sighted, the hunting party (which includes trackers) dismounts. The trackers follow tracks and spoor signs while scanning for the lion. When the lion is spotted, the professional hunter and/or the client will stalk in close until they reach a good shooting position. Hunting lions by stalking is conducted in daylight hours when there is sufficient light to spot the lion, which will usually be resting. Night stalking using electric light sources is banned in most countries. Lions hunted with lights may not be listed as trophies by Safari Club International.\nHounding (the method least used today) uses dogs, and may include a fighting pack and a tracking pack. The hunting party will drive through known lion territory until fresh spoor is spotted, at which time the dogs are released. The pack follows the scent trail of the lion. Once the lion is encountered, the pack attempts to hold the lion at bay until the hunting party arrives to dispatch the lion. Like stalking, hounding is usually conducted during daylight hours. The lion will usually stand and fight rather than flee.\nMany concessions in Africa have been known to release captive lions into enclosed areas where they may be hunted with or without the client's approval and/or knowledge. Sometimes the lion is drugged to slow it down, making it an easier target. Many hunters and hunting organizations consider this unethical and an affront to fair-chase hunting practices.\nThe lion has thin skin and does not require the use of a big-bore rifle. Furthermore, lions are evidently susceptible to hydrostatic shock when impact velocities are above 3,000 ft/s (910 m/s). Lion hunting requires at a minimum a .300 Winchester Magnum. However, certain jurisdictions require a .375 H&H Magnum or a 9.3x62mm Mauser as a minimum caliber. A few professional hunters are known to carry 12-gauge semiautomatic shotguns loaded with buckshot as a backup weapon when hunting lion.\nThe leopard (Panthera pardus) is a large, carnivorous feline having either tawny fur with dark rosette-like markings or black fur. Of the big five, it is most difficult to acquire hunting licenses for leopards. The leopard is considered the most difficult of the big five to hunt because of their nocturnal and secretive nature. They are wary of humans and will take flight in the face of danger. The leopard is solitary by nature, and is most active between sunset and sunrise, although it may hunt during the day in some areas. Leopards can be found in the savanna grasslands, brush land and forested areas in Africa.\nLeopard hunting uses the same methods as hunting for lions. Baiting, hounding, and stalking are the most common methods used today to hunt the cat.\nBaiting is the method most often used to hunt leopard. This requires the finding and then following of spoor in an area known to be frequented by a leopard. Once a suitable area is located, a prey species is hunted and used as bait. Because of the nocturnal nature of the cat, the blind needs to be constructed close to the bait, as shooting will more than likely be during the night. The client and the professional hunter will spend the night in the blind waiting for the leopard to come to the carcass.\nHounding with dogs to hunt leopard requires the hunting party to locate an area where a leopard has been recently active, as in the baiting method. Once such an area is located, the dogs (usually bloodhounds or ridgebacks) are released. The dogs attempt to pick up the scent and follow it to the leopard. The leopard will usually flee from the loudly baying dogs and take refuge in a tree or in an area out of their reach. The dogs will hold the leopard at bay in this manner until the hunting party arrives to dispatch the leopard.\nStalking is rarely used to hunt leopard, as it is extremely time-consuming, tedious and has a very low success rate. A month-long hunt using the spot and stalk method may not be successful at even sighting a leopard.\nThe male leopard is less than half the size of a male lion. The leopard is the smallest of the big cats, and rarely exceeds 200 lb (91 kg).\nThere is a concerted effort to stop the hunting of the leopard due to the rarity of it and any subsequent big cat.\nThe African lion and the African bush elephant are classified as vulnerable. The leopard and the white rhinoceros are classified as near threatened. The black rhinoceros is classified as critically endangered so cannot be hunted at all.

{"question":"Can a city permit override a neighbor's rights regarding boundary tree removal?","answer":"No, having a City-permit does not override a co-owner's rights to keep a boundary tree. The permit alone does not give automatic permission to remove a boundary tree, as it does not supersede the co-owner's rights.","context":["You have your trees in your garden and your neighbour has their trees in their garden, but what about the trees that grow on your boundary, who do they belong to? Trees with trunks that grow across the property line are known as boundary trees and these are considered common or co-owned property. And if an issue arises and tree removal is necessary, who is responsible?\nUnfortunately, boundary trees can lead to disputes between neighbours, especially if one neighbour wants to keep the trees and the other wants to remove them. The law, however, favours the neighbour who wants to keep the trees and the Ontario Forestry Act Section 10 states that it is a prosecutable offence to injure or remove boundary trees without your neighbour’s permission. Failing to comply with the Forestry Act is subject to a fine or time in prison. Many homeowners and developers have fallen foul of this law and it has led to a costly court case with fines ranging from $6000 to close to $40000.\nHow does the law define boundary trees?\nWhen deciding who a tree belongs to, you need to know that the Boundary Tree Ruling of 2013 established that the “trunk of the tree” includes everything from the root-collar to the trees lowest branch. If any portion of the trunk, as defined in the previous sentence, crosses the property line, the tree is considered a boundary tree and is subject to the rules of co-ownership. This means that even if the base of the tree is clearly on your property, it is not necessarily your tree. If at any point the trunk of the tree crosses over onto your neighbour’s side of the boundary, the tree is considered co-owned and you do not have sole control over what happens to the tree.\nBefore you contemplate any tree removal from the periphery of your garden, it is important to establish if they are boundary trees and to be aware of your rights and responsibilities. If you are unsure about the status of a tree, it is best to consult a professional tree service company for advice to help you determine who owns the trees in question.\nWhat about City-Permits?\nDon’t think you can bypass your neighbour and get the cities permission to remove boundary trees. Just because you have a City-permit to remove a tree, it does not automatically give you the right to do so, as the City-permit does not supersede the co-owners rights to keep a tree.\nIf a boundary tree is dangerous or poses a threat to personal safety or your property, then it will be easier to get permission to remove it. Martin Tree Service can assess your boundary trees and ascertain if they pose any risks.\nProtecting trees is important\nMost trees grow extremely slowly, and you should always think twice before removing an established tree from your garden. You may think that merely planting a new tree somewhere else will make up for the one you removed, but this is not entirely true. Trees are not only decorative, but they also filter the air, absorb carbon, provide shade for your garden and homes for a variety of birds and small animals. A tree with a 75 cm diameter stores up to 90 times more carbon, filter 10 times more air pollution and contributes up to 100 times more leaf canopy than a younger tree with a 15 cm trunk diameter.\nEven though most cities have many city-owned trees, private homeowners are the majority of contributors to tree conservation. Trees growing on private land are part of a larger city ecosystem and it is important to conserve large, established trees in order to maintain a healthy urban forest.\nMartin’s Tree Service will not only assist you with the physical removal of boundary trees, but we can also establish the status of the trees on your property and help you navigate the intricacies of the Forestry Act."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e849b7ce-e062-41c9-afba-d0446f8366dd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do I handle depreciation when selling a rental property?","answer":"When selling a rental property, depreciation affects your capital gains tax calculation. The cost basis of your property is reduced by the amount of depreciation you've taken over the years. For example, if your original cost basis was $200,000 and you've claimed $25,000 in depreciation, the IRS will use $175,000 to calculate capital gains. So if you sell for $300,000 after expenses, your capital gain would be $125,000 instead of $100,000. However, you can avoid paying capital gains taxes by doing a 1031 exchange, which involves using all the money from the sale to purchase a property of equal or greater value.","context":["Depreciation is the process of reducing your tax liability thanks to the IRS’s underlying belief that wear and tear reduce the value of and potential income generated by a rental property.\nWhat is Depreciation?\nDepreciation is when you subtract the cost of buying and improving rental property from the taxes you pay. Instead of making the deduction in the year you purchase or improve your property, depreciation divvies out the deduction across the useful life of the property (the useful life of an asset is the estimated amount of time it can provide cost-effective income). It’s a non-cash deduction. Instead, depreciation lowers your taxable income.\nHow Does Rental Property Depreciation Work?\nThe starting assumption of real estate depreciation is that wear and tear make your property decline over time. This, however, isn’t typically the case. A properly maintained property whose parts are appropriately replaced will continue to generate income, and may even appreciate in value.\nSo, you may have a cash flow from your property while still showing a tax loss. This is just a quirk of rental property investment! Few other types of investment have comparable depreciation deductions.\nWhat is Depreciable?\nProperty that’s rented is depreciable, as are improvements to the property. Land, however, is not, so you’ll have to separate the cost of the land from the cost of the property. Maintenance is also not depreciable.\nFor a property to be depreciated it has to meet all of the following criteria:\n- You own the property. It doesn’t matter if the property is subject to debt; the important thing is that you are considered the property’s owner.\n- You use the property to generate income as part of a business.\n- The useful life of the property is determinable. This means that the property is something that experiences wear and tear in various forms and ultimately goes down in value.\n- The property is expected to be around for more than one year.\nThe property can’t be depreciated, though, if you got rid of it the same year that you got it, or if you stopped using it the same year you got it.\nClearing, planting, and landscaping are all classified as part of the cost of the land, so that cannot be depreciated.\nSome improvements that count toward depreciation include:\n- new additions to the property\n- air conditioning, heating, etc\n- roof replacement\n- wall-to-wall carpeting\n- wheelchair ramps\n- other accessibility upgrades\nRegular repair and maintenance, however, do not count toward depreciation. Maintenance is simply deducted in the year you spend the money. Fixing a crack in your driveway is maintenance; replacing your entire driveway is depreciation.\nWhen Does the Depreciation Period Begin and End?\nDepreciation starts as soon as the property is either rented or ready and open to being used as a rental. Depreciation continues until you’ve deducted the entire value of the property, or until you stop renting the property. The latter stipulation holds even if you’re not fully made back the cost of the property. This may happen because the property is no longer rented, you sell or exchange it, start using it yourself, abandon it, or if it’s destroyed.\nThe one exception is if the property is “idle” or not in use for some time. If you’re making repairs to the property between tenants, you can still depreciate the space during that time.\nHow Should I Determine the Appropriate Depreciation Method?\nThere are three considerations when calculating your year’s depreciation: your basis in the property, the recovery period, and the depreciation method used. If your property was put to use after 1986, depreciation is assessed using the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS), which is an accounting formula that spreads costs over a period of 27.5 years. That’s the number of years the IRS considers to be the “useful life” for a rental property.\nDetermine the basis of the property\nThe basis is the amount you paid for the property, whether it be in the form of cash, a mortgage, or some other means. Your closing costs and all other fees are also included in the basis, although some aspects of the closing costs and fees are not included.\nSome examples of excluded figures are:\n- fire insurance premiums\n- rent charged before the closing\n- costs of getting refinancing\n- mortgage insurance premiums\n- credit cards\n- the cost of an appraisal\nSeparate the cost of land and buildings\nAs you may remember, land does not depreciate. So, you must determine the cost of the land and the cost of the home and subtract one from the other. You can use the fair market value of each at the time of purchase, or you can use the assessed real estate values.\nLet’s say you bought the property for $110,000, and the most recent real estate tax assessment says the property costs $90,000, with $81,000 being for the house and $9,000 being for the land. With those figures in mind, you can separate 90% ($81,000 ÷ $90,000) of the purchase price for the house and the rest, 10% ($9,000 ÷ $90,000), for the land.\nDetermine the adjusted basis (if necessary)\nYou may need to alter your basis between the purchase of the property and the moment your property is actually rentable. The basis might go up, for example, if you spend money to restore damaged property, spend money on legal fees or have to pay to get utility services to the property. Decreases to the basis may be caused by insurance payments you received due to damage or theft.\nWhat are Common Depreciation Methods?\nIn most cases, the General Depreciation System (GDS) will be used to calculate your depreciation. This is something you’re best off having a tax professional do for you. You’ll use the Alternative Depreciation System (ADS) only if you meet the following criteria:\n- Your property has a qualified business use equal to or less than 50% of the time.\n- Your property has tax-exempt use.\n- Your property is financed by tax-exempt bonds.\n- Your property is primarily used for farming.\nHow Do I Calculate the Depreciation?\nThe General Depreciation System (GDS) applies the declining-balance method rate on a non-depreciated balance. If an asset valued at $1,000 is depreciated 25% on a yearly basis, then the deduction os $250.00 in year one $187.50 in year two, and so on.\nYou’ll go the GDS route until there’s a reason to use ADS. The recovery period for a property is 27.5 for GDS. For ADS, the recovery period is 30 years for property serviced after Dec 31, 2017, and 40 years for a property placed into service before then. Using the GDS system, you’ll depreciate the property by 3.636% each year. If you rented your property for only part of the year, then you’d depreciate the property for less. You’d use the Residential Rental Property GDS table to make that determination:\n- January: 3.485%\n- February: 3.182%\n- March: 2.879%\n- April: 2.576%\n- May: 2.273%\n- June: 1.970%\n- July: 1.667%\n- August: 1.364%\n- September: 1.061%\n- October: 0.758%\n- November: 0.455%\n- December: 0.152%\nSo, if you have a property that cost you $99,000 and it was rented out on July 15th, you’d depreciate 1.667%, or $1,650 ($99,000 x 1.667%) the first year, and then the rest at a rate of 3.636%, or $3,599.64 (so long as the property is rented the entire year). This number is basically taking the cost of the property and dividing it by 27.5. The only difference in this example was that the property was used for only part of the year the first year.\nHow Much Does Depreciation Reduce Tax Liability?\nUsually, you report your rental income and rental expenses on the appropriate line of Schedule E, and your net gain or loss goes on your 1040 form. Depreciation is included on Schedule E, so it makes your tax liability less every year. If you depreciate $3,599.64 and you’re in the 22% tax bracket, then you’ll pay $3,599.64 x 0.22 = $791.92 less in taxes that year.\nHow Do I Report Depreciation of Rental Property?\nDepreciation is reported when you fill out your taxes. While you can do it all yourself, it’s best to have a tax professional do it for you. After all, you are making money off your rental property, so why even risk compromising your profit?\n1. Use a Schedule E to Record Income and Expenses\nSince your rental property is depreciable but its land is not, you’ll have to separate the value of the two to calculate depreciation. You’ll use Schedule E to documental the income and expenses of your rental property. The net gain or loss is recorded on your 1040 form, which also where your record your depreciation.\n2. Figure Out Your Net Gain or Net Loss\nSome examples of improvements that count toward depreciation include a new roof, replacing the bathroom, and replacing the kitchen. The way you depreciate these is by dividing the cost of the improvement by the useful life of the improvement If you spent $15,000 on a new roof with a 15-year useful life, then you divide $15,000 by 15 to get $1,000. That means you can write off $1,000 per year during the driveway’s 15-year long useful life.\n3. Depreciate the Purchase of the Property\nAfter you subtract the cost of the land from the cost of the property, divide that amount by 27.5 years. So, if your property is $175,000 after the cost of land has been subtracted, your depreciation is $175,000 ÷ 27.5 = $6,363.64 per year. Your tax liability goes down $6,363.64 while your income remains untouched.\nDo I Have to Take Real Estate Depreciation?\nOne of the risks of filing your own taxes is overlooking depreciation. A lot of first-time real estate property investors simply don’t know that depreciation exists. There’s no penalty for not taking advantage of depreciation, other than the penalty of not taking depreciation! Luckily, you can take your depreciation benefit after the fact. Just file an amended tax return using Form 1040X, in addition to any other schedules or forms you’re changing.\nHow Does Deprecation Affect Selling?\nThere is one sizeable drawback to depreciation. If you take depreciation deductions every year, your cost basis in your property goes down for capital gains purposes. So, if your cost basis is $200,000 and you’ve made use of $25,000 worth of depreciation, then the IRS uses the number $175,000 to calculate capital gains. That means that if you sell your property for $300,000 (after expenses), the IRS uses $125,000 to calculate capital gains rather than $100,000.\nWhat you can do, however, is a 1031 exchange. This will get you out of paying capital gains taxes! Simply put, a 1031 exchange is when you use all of the money made on the sale to purchase a property of equal or greater value. A 1031 exchange is also a great way to change up your real estate investment, whether it be for the purpose of diversification or to no longer have to deal with a high maintenance property.\nDepreciation is a way to save money when investing in a rental property. It makes it easier to own rental property because the less money you pay on taxes the more you have to reinvest into your business. And since managing a rental property can be quite demanding financially, you’ll need all the help you can get! It’ll be worth it, though, because real estate provides a steady income source, appreciates in value, and has a low correlation with other commodities and the stock market, which means it can help you ride out hard times."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ad704212-e3e4-4582-867d-1f1091d5073d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do poultry farms determine their fertilizer needs, and what challenges did they face during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding fertilizer access?","answer":"Poultry farms primarily determine their fertilizer needs through soil sampling, with 98.7% of growers using this method often or always. They also use leaf tissue testing (21.5%) and leaf petiole testing (22.8%), though less frequently. During the COVID-19 pandemic, fertilizer access was severely disrupted. The animal feed supply was disrupted due to lockdown, as countries like Argentina and Brazil had to reduce their exports of raw materials. This led to increased costs of feed in several countries and reduced access to feed additives including vitamins and minerals. Small-scale farms were particularly affected due to market closures and transportation restrictions.","context":["Careful attention to nutrient management is an important consideration in profitable cotton growing. In particular, providing adequate, but not excessive nutrition to a cotton crop is critical in order to realize the full genetic yield potential of the seed planted. In addition, because the primary nutrient sources currently used are increasingly expensive, petrochemical-based synthetic inorganic fertilizers, growers can not afford to apply more than is needed. Further, improper management of all applied nutrients, whether synthetic or from natural sources, has the potential to pollute surface or groundwater quality.\nSoutheastern SSP has funded approximately 29 studies dealing with some aspect of cotton nutrition. These include: leaf petiole and tissue analysis, use of starter fertilizer, applying nitrogen by side-dress or split application, foliar application of nutrients, application of poultry or hog manure, winter cover crops (e.g., rye or wheat), and, where nematodes are not a problem, planting winter legume cover crops to fix soil N.\nWe presented growers with a variety of ways to determine the fertility and lime needs of their fields and asked how frequently they rely on each one. Growers responded by circling numbers from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). We included questions on how often they conduct soil testing, leaf tissue and petiole testing. We also presented growers with a variety of methods for applying fertilizer and asked how frequently they use each one. Growers responded by circling numbers from 0 (never) to 3 (always).\nGrower responses to items about the ways they determine fertility and lime needs of their fields are depicted in Figure F. The figure shows the proportion of respondents who indicate they rely on this either often or always.\nFigure F - How Growers Determine Fertility and Lime Needs\nNearly all growers (98.7%) say they use soil sampling often or always. Substantially fewer growers frequently rely on leaf tissue testing (21.5%) and leaf petiole testing (22.8%). Frequent use of precision grid sampling (17.4%) and aerial photos (4.9%) was even less common. For growers who do use soil and leaf testing, Table 3 shows the proportion that conducts those tests at least once per year.\nTable 3 - Annual Soil and Leaf and Tests\nGrower responses to items about the fertilization methods they use are depicted in Figure G. The figure shows the proportion of respondents who indicate they use this method often or always.\nFigure G - Fertilization methods\nApplying nitrogen by side-dress was the most frequently used technique with 88.6% indicating they use this method often or always. Nearly two-thirds (64.3%) frequently use split applications of nitrogen and 62.1% apply starter fertilizer. Less than one-third (30.5%) frequently use variable rate application. Poultry litter is used by about one-quarter (26.2%) and nitrogen fixing winter cover crops was used the least frequently (14.2%) of the methods we surveyed.\nOther reports have noted that soil sampling is a standard practice frequently used by nearly all growers81. This is despite the fact that some Southeastern states do not recommend soil testing, at least for Nitrogen64 and several studies found little benefit in determining N status from surface samples.63 Our results may have reflected use of soil tests for nutrients other than N. However, many states do recommend the practice and consider soil sampling a BMP when developing nutrient management plans. 99\nWhile reliance on leaf testing (tissue and petiole) was relatively low, further analysis of our survey data is required to reveal if growers who use consultants rely on these methods to evaluate lime and fertility needs more frequently than growers who do not use consultants. If this is the case, the extent of these differences may be obscured in our survey as some growers may not be fully aware of the specific nature of the tests that consultants are conducting. In any case, relatively low use of leaf petiole testing may be appropriate given the impact of weather on the need for sampling. These data suggest that many cotton growers are knowledgeable and sophisticated in their use of tools of nutrient management. 69\nThe prevalence of N application by side-dress and split applications likely reflects grower understanding of effective and efficient ways to meet crop needs. These methods appear to limit the potential for loss through leaching, especially on sandy soils. 36,2 Use of starter fertilizer was also common. This is despite the fact that while it has been shown to increase plant height 22,28,55 its impact on yield has been mixed21,28,55,22. The lack of clarity concerning starter fertilizers effects on yield may be due to differing soil moisture conditions after planting.100\nGrowers make only limited use of poultry litter although there is accumulating evidence that this practice is sound and cost-effective. One study found that poultry litter applied at equivalent of 70, 110 and 150 lbs./A of plant available N increased lint yield to at least 915 lbs./A., and that litter at 2.8 Tons per acre is equivalent to an application of a standard inorganic commercial fertilizer85. Although broiler litter can reportedly support normal cotton growth in the absence of any significant other nutrient sources, under some conditions, litter may need to be supplemented with inorganic fertilizer. 96 Poultry litter as a nutrient source should enhance profitability, especially as fertilizer prices continue to increase.74\nFoliar fertilizer applications were used by less than half of growers. Expanded adoption may not be at the grower's discretion as they may be forced into an integrated soil and foliar feeding program if and when nutrient management plans (NMP) become mandated.82\nThe least commonly used source of soil amendment was planting of N-fixing cover crops. Although use of winter legume covers is both feasible and economical65. lack of use may be due to pre-existing problems with nematodes, seed expense, and difficulties with establishment and termination.69\nWe conclude that prevalence of soil testing to determine nutrient needs is seen as a sound and cost-effective practice by growers and that that limited use of leaf or tissue testing as a supplement to soil testing is probably the appropriate approach. Future research to document that leaf tissue and petiole testing are cost-effective and have clear benefits may not be warranted. It is interesting that use of starter fertilizer is substantial given inconsistent yield effects and may reflect grower interest in strong early growth of cotton seedlings irrespective of final yields.\nSubstantial levels of adoption of several fertilizer methods suggests that SSP-research has enhanced grower profitability both by helping determine what practices work and which ones do not. Further field demonstrations containing economic analyses are desirable given increasing cost of inorganic (petroleum-based) fertilizers.\nWhere it is available, use of poultry liter appears to be economically beneficial. The limited use of poultry litter may reflect the limited availability of the material.","Poultry Production and Sustainability in Developing Countries under the COVID-19 Crisis: Lessons Learned\n2.

Concern about the Spread of SARS-CoV-2 from Animals and Social Rumors\n3.2. Lockdown and Restrictions of Trades\n- The animal feed supply was disrupted as due to lockdown, several countries such as Argentina and Brazil had to reduce their exports of raw materials of feed such as soybean and corn, which led to a shortage of dry feed in several developing countries [7,8,43]. In several African countries, the cost of chicken feed has increased .\n- Poultry services were reduced, such as equipment, day-old chicks for stock replacements, feed, vaccines, drugs, diagnostics, and feed additives (vitamins and minerals) . Exporters in several countries also faced a considerable drop in demand for livestock-based foods in major importing markets.\n- Market closures and transportation restrictions hampered access to markets and customers, affecting both animals and animal products, such as eggs and meat.\n3.3. Small-Scale Poultry Farms\n- Lockdown harmed small-scale production severely because small-scale producers in developing countries rely more on labor than machinery.\n- Most small-scale-producing farms, including poultry farms, operate informally and, therefore, are excluded from the stimulus plans offered by governments to private businesses. Smallholder poultry producers mostly live in rural areas (sell eggs and live birds and purchase day-old chicks, feed, drugs, and disinfectants) . However, the animal husbandry services were severely interrupted due to lockdown and movement restrictions. Because most small-scale poultry farms are unregistered, they are not eligible for government stimulus programs .\n- The implementation of sanitary measures in small-scale farms is difficult due to the lack of logistical and financial resources , making them more vulnerable to other infections.\n4.

{"question":"How do the traditional materials used in katana handles compare to those used in kris handles?","answer":"Katana handles (tsuka) have a steel core and are typically wrapped in nylon or leather, with occasional use of stingray leather. In contrast, kris handles (ukiran) are traditionally made from wood, though some examples were made from ivory or covered in gold sheets. Some particularly beautiful kris handles were even made from fossilized mammoth molar, called 'graham', which exhibited attractive orange, white, and beige stripe patterns.","context":["The kris or keris is a distinctive, asymmetrical dagger indigenous to Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and the southern Philippines. Both a weapon and spiritual object, krisses are often considered to have an essence or presence, with some blades possessing good luck and others possessing bad.\nThe kris spread from the island of Java to many parts of the archipelago of Indonesia, such as Sumatra, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, South Sulawesi, Kalimantan, and to the Southeast Asian areas now known as Malaysia, Brunei, southern Philippines, southern Thailand, and Singapore.\n•Kris vs. keris\nThe term keris probably had a Javanese origin, though it cannot be ascertained how it came about. The term “keris” may have evolved from the old Javanese word ngeris which means ‘to stab’ or ‘to pierce’. Kris is a European rendering of this Javanese term. As noted by Frey (2003), kris is the more frequently used term, but this pertains mainly to the Western world. The term “keris” is more popular in the native lands of the dagger, as exemplified by the title of a popular Javanese keris book entitled the “Ensiklopedi Keris” (Keris Encyclopedia), written by the late Bambang Harsrinuksmo. Some collectors prefer keris, others kris. Other spellings used by European colonists include cryse, crise, criss, creese.\nThe Kris is also loosely used to differentiate between the Moro kris swords found in Southern Philippines and the keris daggers found everywhere else in the archipelago.\n•Blade and fittings\nKeris blades are usually narrow and have a wide, asymmetrical base. Blade length is highly variable. The blade is made from different iron ores and often contains nickel. A bladesmith, or empu, makes the blade in layers of different metal. Some blades can be made in a relatively short time, while more legendary weapons can take years or even a lifetime to complete. In high quality the metal of the blade has been folded dozens or even hundreds of times and handled with the utmost precision. There are keris blades that purportedly carry the imprints of the smith’s thumbs, or even lips, which were impressed upon the blade during the forging process. The different metals used to forge the blade gives the keris its distinctive ‘watered’ appearance. This is called pamor and is similar in concept to Damascus patterning on Indo-Persian blades and “hada” on Japanese blades. Blades are acid-etched after forging to bring out the contrasting patterns formed by the various metals used in the keris. Iron ore sources are rare in some areas of the Malay world, especially in Java. The keris-smiths, called Empu (for those highly skilled smiths in the employ of Kratons, who can pass down their title of Empu to their sons) or pandai keris (for smiths of varying skill levels, working outside of kratons), often use myriad types of metal ores that they can find to make the blade. There are tales of blades made from meteorite iron (rare and highly prized due to its spiritual significance and higher nickel content) to scrap metals from vehicles, tools, railway tracks, captured Dutch cannons and blades, and in recent times, bicycle chains. Keris blades can be straight or sinuous. With sinuous blades, the bends are called luks. Most keris have fewer than 13 luks and the number of luks should be odd, or the keris would be considered unlucky. The sinuous blade has become synonymous with the keris, especially today as it has become a popular tourist souvenir. In reality more than half of the old keris have straight blades. The luks maximize the width of wound while maintaining its weight.\nA keris and its sheath have many parts. The names for these parts vary by region. The following terms apply mainly to the Javanese keris. ukiran – handle/hilt; patra – handle carvings (especially on Javanese ukiran); selut – metallic cap on the ukiran (not on all krisses); mendak – metal cup on the tang between the ukiran and the blade guard; wilah – blade; pocok – blade point; peksi – tang; ganja – guard/parrying structure; wrangka – the wide, top portion of the sheath; gandar – the narrow portion of the sheath; pendok – a metal sleeve for the gandar; buntut- end of the pendok.\nThe ukiran and the sheath are often made from wood, though examples made from ivory or covered in gold sheets could be found. Different regions in Southeast Asian produce different styles of wilah, ukiran, and sheaths. One beautiful material used for some ukiran and wrangka was fossilized mammoth molar, called “graham”. Such a molar would be cut to reveal the dentine patterns within the molar. Aged graham sheaths exhibit an attractive orange, white, and beige stripe pattern.\nFrey (2003) concludes from Raffles’ (1817) study of the Candi Sukuh that the kris recognized today came into existence around AD 1361. Scholars, collectors and others have formed myriad theories about the origins of the kris. Some believe the form that is credited with being the earliest form of the kris, the keris majapahit, was inspired by the daggers of the Dong-Son in Vietnam (circa 300 BC). Frey (2003) dismisses the Dongson origin of the Majapahit. Unverifiable claims of another form predating the Majapahit exist. Kris history is traced through study of carvings and bas relief panels found in Southeast Asia. One of the more famous renderings of a kris appears on the Borobudur temple and Prambanan temple.\nFunctionally, the kris is not a slashing weapon like a bowie knife or other fighting knife, but rather a stabbing instrument. If a kris fighter had stealth on his side, the kris was lethal. There are many stories of a kris being made especially for killing a specific person.\nKrisses were worn everyday and at special ceremonies, with heirloom blades being handed down through successive generations. Yearly cleanings, required for as part of the spirituality and mythology around the weapon, often leaves ancient blades worn and thin. In everyday life and at events, a man usually only wore one kris. Women sometimes also wore krisses, though of a smaller size than a man’s. In battle, a warrior carried three krisses: his own, one from his father-in-law, and one as a family heirloom. The other krisses served as parrying daggers. If the warrior didn’t have another kris to parry with, he used the sheath. Krisses were often broken in battle and required repairs. A warrior’s location determined what repair materials he had. It is quite usual to find a kris with fittings from several areas. For example, a kris may have a blade from Java, a hilt from Bali and a sheath from Madura.\nIn many parts of Malaysia and Indonesia, the kris is the choice weapon for execution. The specialized kris, called an executioner’s kris, has a long, straight, slender blade. The condemned knelt before the executioner, who places a wad of cotton or similar material on the subject’s shoulder/clavicle area. The blade is thrust through the padding, piercing the subclavian artery and the heart. Upon withdrawal, the cotton wiped the blade clean. Death was fairly quick.\nOne of the most famous folk stories from Java describes a legendary kris bladesmith, called Mpu Gandring, and his impatient customer, Ken Arok. Ken Arok wanted to order a powerful Kris to kill the chieftain of Tumapel, Tunggul Ametung. Ken Arok eventually stabbed the old bladesmith to death because he kept delaying the scheduled completion of the kris, which Ken Arok had probably ordered several months before. Dying, the bladesmith prophesied that the unfinished or incomplete kris would kill seven men, including Ken Arok. The prophecy finally came true, and the unfinished kris of Mpu Gandring disappeared.\nDiscussing the essence of the kris is a complicated topic. For the most part, blades were considered to almost be alive in some cases, or at the very least vessels of special powers. Krisses could be tested two ways. A series of cuts on a leaf, based on blade width and other factors, could determine if a blade was good or bad. Also, if the owner slept with the blade under their pillow and had a bad dream, the blade was unlucky and had to be discarded. However, just because a blade was bad for one person didn’t mean it would be bad for another. Harmony between the owner and the kris was critical.\nIt was said that some krisses helped prevent fires, death, agricultural failure, and myriads of other problems. Likewise, they could also bring fortune, such as bountiful harvests and the like. Krisses could also have tremendous killing power. Some are rumored to be able to stand on its tip when its real name was being called by its master. Legends tell of krisses moving on their own volition, and killing individuals at will. When making a blade, the empu could infuse into the blade any special spiritual qualities and powers the owner desires.\nBecause some krisses are considered sacred, and people believe they contain magical powers, specific rites needed to be completed to avoid calling down evil fates. For example, pointing a kris at someone is thought to mean that they will die soon, so in ceremonies or demonstrations where ritualized battles are fought with real krisses, the fighters will perform a ritual which includes touching the point of the blade to the ground to neutralize this effect.\nA Moro kris is a heavy sword of Philippine Moro invention with an asymmetrical blade approximately 50 cm long. It may or may not be sinuous.","Before you can run out and start buying your next katana to add to your arsenal we must first discuss what size you need by running through a few simple methodologies on how to size a katana. We also need to go over the various parts of the katana so you can identify each properly.\nParts of the Katana\nTo become proficient in using the sword we need to first understand our weapon from the top down. This is important when looking for the optimal katana since it will help you better understand the sword descriptions and what each component is made from. The nice thing about katanas is that though the parts all have the same name, there can be a wide variation of material used to create them or just in the general aesthetics of the parts.\nFor example the tsuba alone could come in brass, steel, silver, or gold and can have an infinite number of designs on it. The tsuka most commonly comes in a leather or nylon wrap but can also come in more unique materials. The metal itself as we learned in the previous step can come in various steels and forging methods.\nI made the image below to help you identify the various parts of the katana. Now other samurai swords such as the Tanto, Iaito, or Wakizashi will have slightly different components as well and vary in their size and use.\nKatana Parts & Common Materials Used In Them:\n- Kashira (Pommel) – Brass, copper, gold, silver, steel\n- Tsuka (Handle) – A form of steel at the core yet can be wrapped in nylon or leather (occasionally stingray leather)\n- Tsuba (Guard) – Brass, copper, gold, silver, steel\n- Habaki (Blade Collar) – Brass, copper, gold, silver, steel\n- Ha (Edge) – A form of steel\n- Hi (Groove) – A form of steel\n- Bashi (Curved Edge) – A form of steel\n- Kissaki (Point) – A form of steel\n- Mune (Back of Blade) – A form of steel\n- Saya (Scabbard) – Commonly wood which can be covered with leather\n- Sageo (Hanging Cord) – Nylon or leather\nIf you are looking at any katanas that have plastic for any of these components DO NOT buy them. These are either cheap imitators or solely are used as novelty props or Halloween costumes.\nHow to Size a Katana\nThe length of the Tsuka (or handle) is very important so that we can have the proper leverage and balance. Depending on what training you are in the length required can vary.\nWhy is sizing so important? Well if you enjoy having all of your body parts and intend to keep them then yea it’s kind of important. If you try performing any martial arts with a katana that is too large for you you then run the risk of misjudging your distance from the target, or yourself with the blade which could result in an accidental slash.\nI strongly advise talking with your sensei to get the proper length before buying. However, if you do not have a sensei to go to for advice on these highly specialized weapons, or are just looking for some loose sizing recommendations I can give you the sizing guide that my friends and I go by. You could also seek advice from various online forums (or in our forum here as well) to get feedback on how to size a katana.\nAgain, as a little disclaimer remember to use these weapons at your own discretion since they can be very dangerous and anyone using a katana should have the proper training before doing so.\nMeasuring the Tsuka\nThe best way to measure yourself for a blade in my opinion is the tsuka-to-arm-length ratio. This method involves using the length of your forearm to get an idea of how long the tsuka should be.\nTo do this you’ll just need a simple measuring tool. Get out a tape measure or ruler and measure the length of your forearm. So from your elbow to your wrist; this distance is how long the tsuka should also be.\nIt is ok if it isn’t the exact length but I usually do prefer it to be within plus or minus an inch. Most katanas will have an 11″ tsuka, so unless you are either very short or very tall you most likely would go with an 11″.\nAnother method that I’ve seen some use is the hand measurement technique. This is where you place your hands down flat on the table side by side so that they are touching, make sure the fingers are closed (as in the image below), then measure the width of them combined (from the left side of the left hand to the right side of the right hand). Whatever the width is you would then add 3″-4″ to this measurement to provide you with some room on the tsuka.\nMeasuring the Blade\nThere are a ton of forums out there with numerous sizing information so it’s difficult to go with a one size fits all approach, which again is why I suggest talking with a sensei first. Factors that can influence the exact nagasa (blade length) you need are: skill level, height, and use (iaido, kendo, etc.). In terms of the most common height to nagasa ratio, please reference the table below I made for you.\nIf you can’t seem to find something that fits you perfect it’s always safer to go on the shorter end than the longer. These blades will be lighter and quicker to draw.\nBy going with a shorter blade you also reduce the risk of inaccurate depth perception. This is when you assume a target is further away than it actually is from your sword which could result in accidental slashing. Let’s avoid that situation.\nGreat, now that we’ve got the first two steps in the Katana Readiness Guide out of the way (these are usually the lesser ‘fun’ parts of the process) we can move on to the fun part, choosing a katana. Since there are so many variations of katanas out there I’ll help you focus your search with a few katanas I believe are good quality. You are by no means limited to these swords but they can help you find a starting point for what you may like, so lets get into my katana reviews!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f437e7fd-f49c-40b1-bf3c-8b7a7b306fd9>","<urn:uuid:196e0928-eb61-4453-aed1-d15a3df6fb66>"],"error":null}
{"question":"My daughter needs scoliosis treatment - what are the key differences between bracing and surgical intervention in terms of when each is recommended?","answer":"Bracing is recommended when a patient is still growing and has an idiopathic curve of 25-30 degrees or more, or has a curve between 20-29 degrees that is getting worse. Surgery, on the other hand, is advised when the patient is still growing and has a curve that is more than 45 degrees and is getting worse. The decision between treatments depends on factors including the patient's age, curve location, curve shape, and curve severity. While bracing aims to prevent curve progression, surgery's goal is to correct the curve and typically involves correction, stabilization, and fusion of the spine.","context":["|Return to Savvy Consumer Information Center - Home Page|\nQuestions and Answers About Scoliosis\n- What Is Scoliosis?\n- Who Gets Scoliosis?\n- What Causes Scoliosis?\n- How Does the Doctor Diagnose Scoliosis?\n- Does Scoliosis Have To Be Treated?

You may be interested in contacting one or more of the organizations referenced at the end of the fact sheet for more information.\nWhat Is Scoliosis?\nScoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine, or backbone. The bones that make up the spine are called vertebrae. Some people who have scoliosis require treatment. Other people, who have milder curves, may only need to visit their doctor for periodic observation. The section \"Does Scoliosis Have To Be Treated?\" describes how doctors decide whether or not to treat scoliosis.\nWho Gets Scoliosis?\nPeople of all ages can have scoliosis, but this fact sheet focuses on children and adolescents. Of every 1,000 children, 3 to 5 develop spinal curves that are considered large enough to need treatment. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (scoliosis of unknown cause) is the most common type and occurs after the age of 10. Girls are more likely than boys to have this type of scoliosis.\nSince scoliosis can run in families, a child who has a parent, brother, or sister with idiopathic scoliosis should be checked regularly for scoliosis by the family physician.\nIdiopathic scoliosis can also occur in children younger than 10 years of age, but is very rare. Early onset or infantile idiopathic scoliosis occurs in children less than 3 years old. It is more common in Europe than in the United States. Juvenile idiopathic scoliosis occurs in children between the ages of 3 and 10.\nWhat Causes Scoliosis?\nIn 80 to 85 percent of people, the cause of scoliosis is unknown; this is called idiopathic scoliosis. Before concluding that a person has idiopathic scoliosis, the doctor looks for other possible causes, such as injury or infection. Causes of curves are classified as either nonstructural or structural.\nNonstructural (functional) scoliosis: A structurally normal spine that appears curved. This is a temporary, changing curve. It is caused by an underlying condition such as a difference in leg length, muscle spasms, or inflammatory conditions such as appendicitis. Doctors treat this type of scoliosis by correcting the underlying problem.\nStructural scoliosis: A fixed curve that doctors treat case by case. Sometimes structural scoliosis is one part of a syndrome or disease, such as Marfan's syndrome, an inherited connective tissue disorder. In other cases it occurs by itself. Structural scoliosis can be caused by neuromuscular diseases (such as cerebral palsy, poliomyelitis, or muscular dystrophy), birth defects (such as hemivertebra, in which one side of a vertebra fails to form normally before birth), injury, certain infections, tumors (such as those caused by neurofibromatosis, a birth defect sometimes associated with benign tumors on the spinal column), metabolic diseases, connective tissue disorders, rheumatic diseases, or unknown factors (idiopathic scoliosis).\nHow Does the Doctor Diagnose Scoliosis?\nThe doctor takes the following steps to evaluate a patient for scoliosis:\nMedical history: The doctor talks to the patient and the patient's parent or parents and reviews the patient's records to look for medical problems that might be causing the spine to curve; for example, birth defects, trauma, or other disorders that can be associated with scoliosis.\nPhysical examination: The doctor looks at the patient's back, chest, pelvis, legs, feet, and skin. The doctor checks if the patient's shoulders are level, whether the head is centered, and whether opposite sides of the body look level. The doctor also examines the back muscles while the patient is bending forward to see if one side of the rib cage is higher than the other. If there is a significant asymmetry (difference between opposite sides of the body), the doctor will refer the patient to an orthopedic spine specialist (a doctor who has experience treating people with scoliosis). Certain changes in the skin, such as so-called cafe au lait spots, can suggest that the scoliosis is caused by a birth defect.\nX-ray evaluation: Patients with significant spinal curves, unusual back pain, or signs of involvement of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) such as bowel and bladder control problems need to have an X ray. The X ray should be done with the patient standing with his or her back to the x-ray machine. The view is of the entire spine on one long (36-inch) film. Occasionally, doctors ask for more tests to see if there are other problems.\nCurve measurement: The doctor measures the curve on the x-ray image. He or she finds the vertebrae at the beginning and end of the curve and measures the angle of the curve. Curves that are greater than 20 degrees require treatment.\nDoctors group curves of the spine by their location, shape, pattern, and cause. They use this information to decide how best to treat the scoliosis.\nLocation: To identify a curve's location, doctors find the apex of the curve (the vertebra within the curve that is the most off-center); the location of the apex is the \"location\" of the curve. A thoracic curve has its apex in the thoracic area (the part of the spine to which the ribs attach). A lumbar curve has its apex in the lower back. A thoracolumbar curve has its apex where the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae join.\nShape: The curve usually is S- or C-shaped.\nPattern: Curves frequently follow patterns that have been studied in previous patients. The larger the curve is, the more likely it will progress (depending on the amount of growth remaining).\nDoes Scoliosis Have To Be Treated? What Are the Treatments?\nMany children who are sent to the doctor by a school scoliosis screening program have very mild spinal curves that do not need treatment. When a child does need treatment, the doctor may send him or her to an orthopedic spine specialist.\nThe doctor will suggest the best treatment for each patient based on the patient's age, how much more he or she is likely to grow, the degree and pattern of the curve, and the type of scoliosis. The doctor may recommend observation, bracing, or surgery.\nObservation: Doctors follow patients without treatment and re-examine them every 4 to 6 months when the patient is still growing (is skeletally immature) and has an idiopathic curve of less than 25 degrees.\nBracing: Doctors advise patients to wear a brace to stop a curve from getting any worse when the patient:\nis still growing and has an idiopathic curve that is more than 25 to 30 degrees;\nhas at least 2 years of growth remaining, has an idiopathic curve that is between 20 and 29 degrees, and, if a girl, has not had her first menstrual period; or\nis still growing and has an idiopathic curve between 20 and 29 degrees that is getting worse.\nAs a child nears the end of growth, the indications for bracing will depend on how the curve affects the child's appearance, whether the curve is getting worse, and the size of the curve.\nSurgery: Doctors advise patients to have surgery to correct a curve or stop it from worsening when the patient is still growing, has a curve that is more than 45 degrees, and has a curve that is getting worse.\nAre There Other Ways To Treat Scoliosis?\nSome people have tried other ways to treat scoliosis, including manipulation by a chiropractor, electrical stimulation, dietary supplements, and corrective exercises. So far, studies of the following treatments have not been shown to prevent curve progression, or worsening:\nExercise:(Studies have shown that exercise alone will not stop progressive curves. However, patients may wish to exercise for the effects on their general health and well being.)\nWhich Brace Is Best?\nThe decision about which brace to wear depends on the type of curve and whether the patient will follow the doctor's directions about how many hours a day to wear the brace.\nThere are two main types of braces. Braces can be custom made or can be made from a pre-fabricated mold. All must be selected for the specific curve problem and fitted to each patient. To have their intended effect (to keep a curve from getting worse), braces must be worn every day for the full number of hours prescribed by the doctor until the child stops growing.\nMilwaukee brace: Patients can wear this brace to correct any curve in the spine. This brace has a neck ring.\nThoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO): Patients can wear this brace to correct curves whose apex is at or below the eighth thoracic vertebra. The TLSO is an underarm brace, which means that it fits under the arm and around the rib cage, lower back, and hips.\nIf the Doctor Recommends Surgery, Which Procedure Is Best?\nMany surgical techniques can be used to correct the curves of scoliosis. The main surgical procedure is correction, stabilization, and fusion of the curve. Fusion is the joining of two or more vertebrae. Surgeons can choose different ways to straighten the spine and also different implants to keep the spine stable after surgery. (Implants are devices that remain in the patient after surgery to keep the spine aligned.) The decision about the type of implant will depend on the cost; the size of the implant, which depends on the size of the patient; the shape of the implant; its safety; and the experience of the surgeon. Each patient should discuss their options with at least two experienced surgeons.\nPatients and parents who are thinking about surgery may want to ask the following questions:\nWhat are the benefits from surgery for scoliosis?\nWhat are the risks from surgery for scoliosis?\nWhat techniques will be used for the surgery?\nWhat devices will be used to keep the spine stable after surgery?\nWhere will the incisions be made?\nHow straight will the patient's spine be after surgery?\nHow long will the hospital stay be?\nHow long will it take to recover from surgery?\nIs there chronic back pain after surgery for scoliosis?\nWill the patient's growth be limited?\nHow flexible will the spine remain?\nCan the curve worsen or progress after surgery?\nWill additional surgery be likely?\nWill the patient be able to do all the things he or she wants to do following surgery?\nCan People with Scoliosis Exercise?\nExercise does not make scoliosis worse. In fact, it is very important for all people, including those with scoliosis, to exercise and remain physically fit. Girls have a higher risk than boys of developing osteoporosis (a disorder that results in weak bones that can break easily) later in life. The risk of osteoporosis is reduced in women who exercise regularly all their lives; and weight-bearing exercise, such as walking, running, soccer, and gymnastics, increases bone density and helps prevent osteoporosis. For both boys and girls, exercising and participating in sports also improves their general sense of well being.\nWhat Are Researchers Trying To Find Out About Scoliosis?\nResearchers are looking for the cause of idiopathic scoliosis. They have studied genetics, growth, structural and biochemical alterations in the discs and muscles, and central nervous system changes. The changes in the discs and muscles seem to be a result of scoliosis and not the cause. Scientists are still hopeful that studying changes in the central nervous system in people with idiopathic scoliosis may reveal a cause of this disorder.\nResearchers continue to examine how a variety of braces, surgical procedures, and surgical instruments can be used to straighten the spine or to prevent further curvature. They are also studying the long-term effects of a scoliosis fusion and the long-term effects of untreated scoliosis.\nWhere Can People Get More Information About Scoliosis?\nNational Scoliosis Foundation\n5 Cabot Place\nStoughton, MA 02072\n(800) NSF-MYBACK (673-6922)\nFax: (617) 341-8333\nThis is a nonprofit voluntary organization that provides pamphlets, a newsletter, and other information materials on childhood and adult scoliosis.

(FREE)","Pediatric Idiopathic Scoliosis: diagnosis requires exam and often X-rays; several treatment options available.\nPediatric Idiopathic Scoliosis Diagnosis And Treatment\nScoliosis is a musculoskeletal disorder that adversely affects the shape of the spine (backbone). A scoliotic spine (when viewed from behind) will not be straight and may instead look like the letter \"C\" or \"S\" due to the side-to-side (right-to-left) curvature. Idiopathic scoliosis is the most common type of pediatric scoliosis. Idiopathic simply means of unknown origin; therefore, idiopathic scoliosis means that the exact cause of scoliosis is not known (i.e., there is no clear cause).\nHow is Pediatric Idiopathic Scoliosis Diagnosed?\nRegardless of the type of idiopathic scoliosis, early diagnosis is of primary importance. Remember that in order to diagnose scoliosis as idiopathic all other causes must be ruled out; therefore, extensive examination and testing may be required. The following are used to evaluate patients for pediatric scoliosis:\nThis includes an interview with a doctor and a review of the patient's medical records and family history of scoliosis. These are done in order to determine the presence any medical conditions that may be causing the spine curvature.\nA portion of the exam will be done while the patient is bending forward (called the Adam's Forward Bend Test) as this position makes it easier to visualize certain irregularities.\nItems that will be looked for during the exam include:\n- Shoulders are not level (one shoulder is higher than the other)\n- If the head is centered\n- One side of the rib cage is higher than the other\n- Pelvis is tilted/uneven\n- Significant asymmetry between opposite sides of the body\n- Certain changes in the skin (e.g., cafe au lait spots)\nPatients with abnormal spinal curves typically need imaging studies. These may include full-length X-rays, CT scans, or an MRI of the spine. Which of these imaging studies will depend on what conditions are suspected to be involved in causing the scoliosis. The standard method for assessing the curve is to measure the amount (severity) of the curve. This is technically called the Cobb angle. This measurement is determined from an X-ray of the spine. Abnormal curves measuring less than 10 degrees are not formally classified as scoliosis.\nHow is Pediatric Idiopathic Scoliosis Treated?\nTreatment of idiopathic scoliosis depends on many factors, including:\n- Patient's age\n- Location of the curve\n- Shape of the curve\n- Severity of the curve (i.e., the Cobb angle)\nMany patients with very mild idiopathic curves do not need treatment. However, they should be monitored by a doctor on a regular basis. Pediatric scoliosis treatment involves both surgical and non-surgical options. Non-surgical treatment of pediatric scoliosis is focused on slowing or preventing progression of the curve, as well as on cosmetic improvement.\nFor patients with smaller idiopathic curves, generally 20 degrees or less, observation may be the course of treatment. Patients are monitored and re-examined regularly, approximately every 4-6 months.\nBracing can be effective for certain patients with idiopathic curves of approximately 20-40 degrees. However, not all pediatric patients with curves in this range will be candidates for bracing; other factors must be considered. The brace is worn to prevent the curve from getting worse. There are different types of braces available. The type of brace will depend on several factors including the size and location of the curve.\nPhysical therapy may be used as part of a scoliosis treatment plan. The goal of physical therapy is strengthening (especially core strengthening) and symptom relief.\nPediatric patients may be self-conscious of their posture or their appearance when wearing a back brace, and therefore may benefit from a formal support group.\nSometimes non-surgical treatments fail to work or are not an option and, therefore, surgery is required. The goal of pediatric scoliosis surgery is to correct the curve as much as possible.\nThe decision to surgically correct pediatric scoliosis is based on several factors including:\n- Severity of the curve (generally curves greater than 45-50 degrees)\n- Rate at which the curve is progressing (getting worse)\n- Patient's symptoms and overall health status\n- Patient's age\nA surgeon may use growth rods or perform a spine fusion. There are also different ways to perform pediatric scoliosis surgery. It is understandable that patients may want to avoid surgery; however, if left untreated, a curve that progresses can eventually adversely affect heart and lung function.\nAlternative Treatments for Pediatric Idiopathic Scoliosis\nAccording to the Scoliosis Research Society: \"Alternative treatments to prevent curve progression or prevent further curve progression such as chiropractic medicine, physical therapy, yoga, etc. have not demonstrated any scientific value in the treatment of scoliosis. However, these and other methods can be utilized if they provide some physical benefit. These should not, however, be utilized to formally treat the curvature in hopes of improving the scoliosis.\""],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d82b4a20-d0fb-430f-8176-07b14d5f1d5a>","<urn:uuid:a82569b2-1083-4ebe-b73a-3efc2568c54e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm researching healthcare costs worldwide - how do administrative costs and pricing structures differ between the US healthcare system and the UK's NHS?","answer":"The US healthcare system has significantly higher administrative costs, with around $190 billion in waste due to excessive administrative expenses. This is partly because the US has thousands of separate insurers, while the UK's NHS is a single publicly funded system. In terms of pricing, the US typically pays double the prices for the same healthcare services compared to other countries. This is because the US has splintered payment power among many insurers, while systems like the NHS have concentrated buying power. The NHS is funded directly through general taxation (estimated £104 billion in 2007-8) and doesn't collect premiums or charge at the patient level, making it administratively simpler than the US system.","context":["#ObamaCare and You: Uwe Reinhardt Discusses HealthCare Economics\n(Editor's Note: The following is the third in a series of four exclusive HealthWorks Collective interviews on Health Policy by our Washington DC reporter, Steven Goldstein)\nDr. Uwe E. Reinhardt is James Madison Professor of Political Economy and Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Recognized as one of the nation’s leading authorities on health care economics, Reinhardt has been a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences since 1978.\nHWC: What are strengths and weaknesses of the American healthcare system, and how is the ACA supposed to address those weaknesses?\nUR: One strength is a very well-trained workforce. We have perhaps among the best trained doctors in the world. Our hospitals are luxurious, and some think excessive. It’s very patient-focused and customer-oriented compared to other systems. In health care delivery, we have a lot of strengths. We are not heavy users of real health care by international standards. What we do is pay double the prices for the same thing. Anything that may sell in Europe for one euro is selling for two euros here. Also, with the huge amounts of money flowing into US healthcare, it has had the luxury of experimenting with novel approaches in technology and health care delivery. But for all we spend, we should have better performance. At its worst, leaving people without insurance or driving them into bankruptcy we are the worst in the world. The ACA is designed to help low income Americans to gain access to the system though federal subsidies and that is an improvement.\nHWC: Why does the U.S. spend so much on healthcare compared to other countries?\nUR: The reason is other countries have concentrated considerable buying power on the payment side of the health care system. So in Canada, it’s basically a single buyer, the government, and the same in England. By contrast, the US has splintered the payment side into thousand of little insurers, some big insurers. But within any market area, say New Jersey, very few insurers have the buying power and the hospital knows an insurer can’t sell insurance without having them in the network and that gives them market power and they exploit that. The same with drugs. In Europe, there’s more market power on the demand side and some may use price controls. We’ve structured our system so that the demand side, the payment side, has relatively little market power while the supply side has a lot of power. And that’s what drives up the prices.\nHWC: In one of your articles, you mention the $190 billion waste due to excessive administrative costs. Will ACA add to admin costs or lessen them? What about the other categories of waste – excessive services, for instance?\nUR: It’s uncertain, but my own gut feeling is that it will add to the costs. The reason why it might reduce costs somewhat is that under these exchanges there is some standardization of the offerings, etc. But then you need huge armadas of navigators to help people to pick insurers on these exchanges because they are so complicated. I see nothing in the law really addressing administrative costs, which I consider a major failing. I also don’t see the law addressing other things like excessive services directly other than through the payment mechanism. There is a distinct preference in the ACA for integrated care delivered by accountable care organizations, who get reimbursed not by fee for service but either by capitation or bundled payments. If providers who jointly deliver integrated care get a bundled payment per episode of illness or a capitation for chronic care per patient per year, they will have every incentive to minimize the excessive use of real health care resources, like tests, like imaging, like drugs. So indirectly it could eliminate some of the unnecessary care that’s now being given.\nHWC: Which health care providers and insurance companies stand to benefit the most from the Affordable Care Act?\nUR: The systems, like Kaiser or Cleveland Clinic, that have practiced integrated care for years and have been able to do that for bundled payments are ready to thrive in this world. And then there will be others, sort of the losers in some way, the independent practitioners that have a solo practice attached to their houses. I think most of that will just disappear. Things will be more aggregated. Some economists worry about creating too much monopoly power on the supply side.\nHWC: Should profits on medical devices and pharmaceuticals be contained somehow, and if they should, by whom? Government? Industry? A third party?\nUR: I’m on the board of a medical device company, so I should not comment. But I believe the marketplace should take care of it because the buying has shifted from individual physicians to a committee of device buyers in the hospitals. As for drugs, there was a debate whether Congress or the private market should regulate drug prices. I actually favor the private market. When you look at drug companies, the incremental production cost of an additional pill is actually quite low once you’ve done the R&D, the testing and the trials. When you buy a drug you’re paying back R&D expenditures for that drug and the ones that failed. Government could set prices below full cost and severely discourage R&D. But that can politicize the process, and the healthcare industry is a huge shareholder of Congress -- you can quote me. And somebody has to pay for the R&D. The bulk buying private companies like CVS control prices to some extent. A private express scrips CEO is not likely to overpay for drugs, as Congress might.\nhealth insurance exchanges / shutterstock","Premiums, or the cost of the medical coverage, are based on some factors including country of origin, age, medical history, etc. It is advised to have more comprehensive insurance for US medical coverage because it can cost a lot, but the costs of not having it can be much higher. For example, the tests and scans doctors often run are costly and typically not covered by budget medical insurance plans.\nFunding from the equalization pool is distributed to insurance companies for each person they insure under the required policy. However, high-risk individuals get more from the pool, and low-income persons and children under 18 have their insurance paid for entirely. Because of this, insurance companies no longer find insuring high risk individuals an unappealing proposition, avoiding the potential problem of adverse selection.\nInsurance plans with higher out-of-pocket costs generally have smaller monthly premiums than plans with low deductibles. When shopping for plans, individuals must weigh the benefits of lower monthly costs against the potential risk of large out-of-pocket expenses in the case of a major illness or accident. Health insurance has many cousins, such as disability insurance, critical (catastrophic) illness insurance, and long-term care (LTC) insurance.\nThe UK's National Health Service (NHS) is a publicly funded healthcare system that provides coverage to everyone normally resident in the UK. It is not strictly an insurance system because (a) there are no premiums collected, (b) costs are not charged at the patient level and (c) costs are not pre-paid from a pool. However, it does achieve the main aim of insurance which is to spread financial risk arising from ill-health. The costs of running the NHS (est. £104 billion in 2007-8) are met directly from general taxation. The NHS provides the majority of health care in the UK, including primary care, in-patient care, long-term health care, ophthalmology, and dentistry.\nHealth benefits are provided to active duty service members, retired service members and their dependents by the Department of Defense Military Health System (MHS). The MHS consists of a direct care network of Military Treatment Facilities and a purchased care network known as TRICARE. Additionally, veterans may also be eligible for benefits through the Veterans Health Administration.\nStarting October 1, new financial assistance called the Health Insurance Premium Tax Credit will be available to help make insurance premiums affordable for those who need coverage. The website Healthcare.gov will provide a single location where you find out whether you are eligible for the premium tax credit and shop for and compare the different health insurance plans available to you in your state. Check out Healthcare.gov if you would like to learn more about the new options available October 1 and what you need to do to get ready. Meanwhile, if you need coverage immediately and would like to search for and compare plans available now, go to finder.healthcare.gov to start your search.\nA survey designed and conducted by Drs. Salomeh Keyhani and Alex Federman of Mount Sinai School of Medicine done over the summer of 2009 found that 73% of doctors supported a public option. A survey reported by the New England Journal of Medicine in September, based on a random sample of 6,000 physicians from the American Medical Association, stated that \"it seems clear that the majority of U.S. physicians support using both public and private insurance options to expand coverage.\"\nGermans are offered three kinds of social security insurance dealing with the physical status of a person and which are co-financed by employer and employee: health insurance, accident insurance, and long-term care insurance. Long-term care insurance (Gesetzliche Pflegeversicherung) emerged in 1994 and is mandatory. Accident insurance (gesetzliche Unfallversicherung) is covered by the employer and basically covers all risks for commuting to work and at the workplace.\nPPO (Preferred Provider Organization) - A type of insurance plan that offers more extensive coverage for the services of healthcare providers who are part of the plan's network, but still offers some coverage for providers who are not part of the plan's network. PPO plans generally offer more flexibility than HMO plans, but premiums tend to be higher.\nHowever, with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, effective since 2014, federal laws have created some uniformity in partnership with the existing state-based system. Insurers are prohibited from discriminating against or charging higher rates for individuals based on pre-existing medical conditions and must offer a standard set of coverage.\nBefore the development of medical expense insurance, patients were expected to pay all other health care costs out of their own pockets, under what is known as the fee-for-service business model. During the middle to late 20th century, traditional disability insurance evolved into modern health insurance programs. Today, most comprehensive private health insurance programs cover the cost of routine, preventive, and emergency health care procedures, and also most prescription drugs, but this was not always the case. The rise of private insurance was accompanied by the gradual expansion of public insurance programs for those who could not acquire coverage through the market.\nAs of 2014, more than three-quarters of the country’s Medicaid enrollees were covered under private Medicaid managed care plans, and 31 percent of Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in private Medicare Advantage plans in 2016. However, the funding for these plans still comes from the government (federal for Medicare Advantage, and a combination of state and federal funding for Medicaid managed care).\nThe insured person has full freedom of choice among the approximately 60 recognised healthcare providers competent to treat their condition (in their region) on the understanding that the costs are covered by the insurance up to the level of the official tariff. There is freedom of choice when selecting an insurance company to which one pays a premium, usually on a monthly basis. The insured person pays the insurance premium for the basic plan up to 8% of their personal income. If a premium is higher than this, the government gives the insured person a cash subsidy to pay for any additional premium.\nThe bottom line? Uninsured people tend to be sicker and are more likely to die prematurely than their peers who do have health insurance. Even adults who are young and healthy can benefit from preventive care, annual checkups and chronic disease management – be it for allergies, depression, asthma, diabetes or another type of condition. And women, in particular, benefit from gynecological and reproductive care.\nAdvertiser Disclosure: Some of the offers that appear on this website are from companies which ValuePenguin receives compensation.

It lets you set aside pre-tax money for common medical costs and dependent care. FSA funds must be used by the end of the term-year. It will be sent back to the employer if you don't use it. Check with your employer's Human Resources team. The can provide a list of FSA-qualified costs that you can purchase directly or be reimbursed for. A few common FSA-qualified costs include:\n(US specific) Provided by an employer-sponsored self-funded ERISA plan. The company generally advertises that they have one of the big insurance companies. However, in an ERISA case, that insurance company \"doesn't engage in the act of insurance\", they just administer it. Therefore, ERISA plans are not subject to state laws. ERISA plans are governed by federal law under the jurisdiction of the US Department of Labor (USDOL). The specific benefits or coverage details are found in the Summary Plan Description (SPD). An appeal must go through the insurance company, then to the Employer's Plan Fiduciary. If still required, the Fiduciary's decision can be brought to the USDOL to review for ERISA compliance, and then file a lawsuit in federal court.\nOther managed care techniques include such elements as disease management, case management, wellness incentives, patient education, utilization management and utilization review. These techniques can be applied to both network-based benefit programs and benefit programs that are not based on a provider network. The use of managed care techniques without a provider network is sometimes described as \"managed indemnity.\"\nIn-network and out-of-network providers – some plans cover different costs from in-network, versus out-of-network, providers. In-network providers are those who agree to the health insurer’s policies and procedures and typically result in less expense to the insured. Out-of-network providers are those providers that have not yet agreed fully to the health insurer’s policies and procedures. The insurer typically cover less expense or no expense at all for out-of-network providers.\nHaving health insurance is important for several reasons. Uninsured people receive less medical care and less timely care, they have worse health outcomes, and lack of insurance is a fiscal burden for them and their families. Moreover, the benefits of expanding coverage outweigh the costs for added services. Safety-net care from hospitals and clinics improves access to care but does not fully substitute for health insurance. These findings are supported by much research, although some cautions are appropriate in using these results.\nInsurance companies are not allowed to have co-payments, caps, or deductibles, or to deny coverage to any person applying for a policy, or to charge anything other than their nationally set and published standard premiums. Therefore, every person buying insurance will pay the same price as everyone else buying the same policy, and every person will get at least the minimum level of coverage.\nEmployer-sponsored health insurance plans dramatically expanded as a direct result of wage controls imposed by the federal government during World War II. The labor market was tight because of the increased demand for goods and decreased supply of workers during the war. Federally imposed wage and price controls prohibited manufacturers and other employers from raising wages enough to attract workers. When the War Labor Board declared that fringe benefits, such as sick leave and health insurance, did not count as wages for the purpose of wage controls, employers responded with significantly increased offers of fringe benefits, especially health care coverage, to attract workers."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:218c4377-bc6f-4ca4-b17d-4eb76cee0a2d>","<urn:uuid:3832eb35-dd2b-4c20-a110-f1728539d4bf>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do I establish a proper IP addressing management system for a large enterprise network?","answer":"To establish IP address management: 1) First understand your IP address blocks. 2) Allocate address blocks to network areas in a way that promotes summarization. 3) Define standard subnet sizes for specific applications (building subnets, WAN links, loopback subnets). 4) Create standards for IP address assignments within subnets - for example, assign first available addresses to routers and HSRP virtual addresses, next addresses to switches and gateways, followed by fixed address assignments, and finally dynamic addresses for DHCP. 5) Document all standards and reference them in network engineering plan documents to ensure consistent deployment.","context":["Configuration management is a collection of processes and tools that\npromote network consistency, track network change, and provide up to date\nnetwork documentation and visibility.

We recommend the following standards for optimal network\nSoftware version control is the practice of deploying consistent\nsoftware versions on similar network devices. This improves the chance for\nvalidation and testing on the chosen software versions and greatly limits the\namount of software defects and interoperability issues found in the network.\nLimited software versions also reduce the risk of unexpected behavior with user\ninterfaces, command or management output, upgrade behavior and feature\nbehavior. This makes the environment less complex and easier to support.\nOverall, software version control improves network availability and helps lower\nreactive support costs.\nNote: Similar network devices are defined as standard network devices with\na common chassis providing a common service.\nImplement the following steps for software version control:\nDetermine device classifications based on chassis, stability, and new\nTarget individual software versions for similar\nTest, validate, and pilot chosen software versions.\nDocument successful versions as standard for similar-device\nConsistently deploy or upgrade all similar devices to standard\nIP address management is the process of allocating, recycling and\ndocumenting IP addresses and subnets in a network. IP addressing standards\ndefine subnet size, subnet assignment, network device assignments and dynamic\naddress assignments within a subnet range. Recommended IP address management\nstandards reduce the opportunity for overlapping or duplicate subnets,\nnon-summarization in the network, duplicate IP address device assignments,\nwasted IP address space, and unnecessary complexity.\nThe first step to successful IP address management is understanding the\nIP address blocks used in the network. In many cases, network organizations\nhave to rely on\naddress space, which isn't Internet addressable, but can be used to\naccess the network in conjunction with\nAddress Translation (NAT). Once you have defined the address blocks,\nallocate them to areas of the network in a way that promotes summarization. In\nmany cases, you'll have to further subdivide these blocks based on the number\nand size of subnets within the defined range. You should define standard subnet\nsizes for standard applications, such as building subnet sizes, WAN link subnet\nsizes, loopback subnet size, or WAN site subnet size. You can then allocate\nsubnets for new applications out of a subnet block within a larger summary\nFor example, let's take a large enterprise network with an east coast\ncampus, a west coast campus, a domestic WAN, a European WAN, and other major\ninternational sites. The organization allocates contiguous IP classless\ninterdomain routing (CIDR) blocks to each of these areas to promote IP\nsummarization. The organization then defines the subnet sizes within those\nblocks and allocates sub-sections of each block to a particular IP subnet size.\nEach major block or the entire IP address space can be documented in a\nspreadsheet showing allocated, used, and available subnets for each available\nsubnet size within the block.\nThe next step is to create standards for IP address assignments within\neach subnet range. Routers and Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) virtual\naddresses within a subnet might be assigned the first available addresses\nwithin the range. Switches and gateways may be assigned the next available\naddresses, followed by other fixed address assignments, and finally dynamic\naddresses for DHCP. For example, all user subnets may be /24 subnets with 253\navailable address assignments. The routers may be assigned the .1 and .2\naddresses, and the HSRP address assigned the .3 address, switches .5 through\n.9, and the DHCP range from .10 through .253. Whatever standards you develop,\nthey should be documented and referenced on all network engineering plan\ndocuments to help ensure consistent deployment.\nConsistent, structured use of naming conventions and DNS for devices\nhelps you manage the network in the following ways:\nCreates a consistent access point to routers for all network\nmanagement information related to a device.\nReduces the opportunity for duplicate IP addresses.\nCreates simple identification of a device showing location, device\ntype, and purpose.\nImproves inventory management by providing a simpler method to\nidentify network devices.\nMost network devices have one to two interfaces for managing the\ndevice. These may be an in-band or out-of-band Ethernet interface and a console\ninterface. You should build naming conventions for these interfaces related to\nthe device type, location, and interface type. On routers, we strongly\nrecommend using the loopback interface as the primary management interface\nbecause it can be accessed from different interfaces. You should also configure\nloopback interfaces as the source IP address for traps, SNMP and syslog\nmessages. Individual interfaces can then have a naming convention that\nidentifies the device, location, purpose, and interface.\nWe also recommend identifying DHCP ranges and adding them to the DNS,\nincluding the location of the users. This may be a portion of the IP address or\na physical location. An example might be \"dhcp-bldg-c21-10\" to\n\"dhcp-bldg-c21-253\", which identifies IP addresses in building C, second floor,\nwiring closet 1. You can also use the precise subnet for identification. Once a\nnaming convention has been created for devices and DHCP, you'll need tools to\ntrack and manage entries, such as\nStandard configuration applies to protocol and media configurations, as\nwell as global configuration commands. Descriptors are interface commands used\nto describe an interface.\nWe recommend creating standard configurations for each device\nclassification, such as router, LAN switch, WAN switch, or ATM switch. Each\nstandard configuration should contain the global, media, and protocol\nconfiguration commands necessary to maintain network consistency. Media\nconfiguration includes ATM, Frame Relay, or Fast Ethernet configuration.\nProtocol configuration includes standard IP routing protocol configuration\nparameters, common Quality of Service (QoS) configurations, common access\nlists, and other required protocol configurations. Global configuration\ncommands apply to all like devices and include parameters such as service\ncommands, IP commands, TACACS commands, vty configuration, banners, SNMP\nconfiguration, and Network Time Protocol (NTP) configuration.\nDescriptors are developed by creating a standard format that applies to\neach interface. The descriptor includes the purpose and location of the\ninterface, other devices or locations connected to the interface, and circuit\nidentifiers. Descriptors help your support organization better understand the\nscope of problems related to an interface and allows faster resolution of\nWe recommend keeping standard configuration parameters in a standard\nconfiguration file and downloading the file to each new device prior to\nprotocol and interface configuration. In addition, you should document the\nstandard configuration file, including an explanation of each global\nconfiguration parameter and why it is important.\nManager Essentials (RME) can be used to manage standard configuration\nfiles, protocol configuration, and descriptors.\nUpgrade procedures help ensure that software and hardware upgrades\noccur smoothly with minimal downtime. Upgrade procedures include vendor\nverification, vendor installation references such as release notes, upgrade\nmethodologies or steps, configuration guidelines, and testing requirements.\nUpgrade procedures may vary widely depending on network types, device\ntypes, or new software requirements. Individual router or switch upgrade\nrequirements may be developed and tested within an architecture group and\nreferenced in any change documentation. Other upgrades, involving entire\nnetworks, can not be tested as easily. These upgrades may require more in-depth\nplanning, vendor involvement, and additional steps to ensure success.\nYou should create or update upgrade procedures in conjunction with any\nnew software deployment or identified standard release. The procedures should\ndefine all steps for the upgrade, reference vendor documentation related to\nupdating the device, and provide testing procedures for validating the device\nafter the upgrade. Once upgrade procedures are defined and validated, the\nupgrade procedure should be referenced in all change documentation appropriate\nto the particular upgrade.\nYou can use solution templates to define standard modular network\nsolutions. A network module may be a wiring closet, a WAN field office, or an\naccess concentrator. In each case you need to define, test and document the\nsolution to help ensure that similar deployments can be carried out in exactly\nthe same way. This ensures that future changes occur at a much lower risk level\nto the organization since behavior of the solution is well defined.\nCreate solution templates for all higher-risk deployments and solutions\nthat will be deployed more than once. The solution template contains all\nstandard hardware, software, configuration, cabling, and installation\nrequirements for the network solution. Specific details of the solution\ntemplate are shown as follows:\nHardware and hardware modules including memory, flash, power, and\nLogical topology including port assignments, connectivity, speed, and\nSoftware versions including module or firmware\nAll non-standard, non device-specific configuration including routing\nprotocols, media configurations, VLAN configuration, access lists, security,\nswitching paths, spanning tree parameters, and others.\nOut-of-band management requirements.\nInstallation requirements including environmentals, power, and rack\nNote that the solution template does not contain many requirements.\nSpecific requirements such as IP addressing for the specific solution, naming,\nDNS assignments, DHCP assignments, PVC assignments, interface descriptors, and\nothers should be covered by overall configuration management practices. More\ngeneral requirements, such as standard configurations, change management plans,\ndocumentation update procedures, or network management update procedures,\nshould be covered by general configuration management practices.\nWe recommend documenting the network and changes that have occurred in\nthe network in near real-time. You can use this precise network information for\ntroubleshooting, network management tool device lists, inventory, validation,\nand audits. We recommend using the following network documentation critical\nCurrent device, link, and end-user inventory information enables you to\ntrack network inventory and resources, problem impact, and network change\nimpact. The ability to track network inventory and resources in relation to\nuser requirements helps ensure that managed network devices are actively used,\nprovides information needed for audits, and helps to manage device resources.\nEnd-user relationship data provides information to define change risk and\nimpact, as well as the ability to more quickly troubleshoot and resolve\nproblems. Device, link, and end-user inventory databases are typically\ndeveloped by many leading service provider organizations. The leading developer\nof network inventory software is\nThe database may contain tables for like devices, links, and customer\nuser/server data so that when a device is down or network changes occur, you\ncan easily understand the end-user impact.\nA configuration version control system maintains the current running\nconfigurations of all devices and a set number of previous running versions.\nThis information can be used for troubleshooting and configuration or change\naudits. When troubleshooting, you can compare the current running configuration\nto previous working versions to help understand if configuration is linked to\nthe problem in any way. We recommend maintaining three to five previous working\nversions of the configuration.\nTo identify who made configuration changes and when, you can use TACACS\nlogging and NTP. When these services are enabled on Cisco network devices, the\nuserid and timestamp is added to the configuration file at the time the\nconfiguration change is made. This stamp is then copied with the configuration\nfile to the configuration version control system. TACACS can then act as a\ndeterrent for unmanaged change and provide a mechanism to properly audit\nchanges that occur. TACACS is enabled using the Cisco Secure product. When the\nuser logs into the device, he/she must authenticate with the TACACS server by\nsupplying a userid and password. NTP is easily enabled on a network device by\npointing the device to an NTP master clock.\nTopology documentation aids in the understanding and support of the\nnetwork. You can use it to validate design guidelines and to better understand\nthe network for future design, change, or troubleshooting. Topology\ndocumentation should include both logical and physical documentation, including\nconnectivity, addressing, media types, devices, rack layouts, card assignments,\ncable routing, cable identification, termination points, power information, and\ncircuit identification information.\nMaintaining topology documentation is the key to successful\nconfiguration management. To create an environment where topology documentation\nmaintenance can occur, the importance of the documentation must be stressed and\nthe information must be available for updates. We strongly recommend updating\ntopology documentation whenever network change occurs.\nNetwork topology documentation is typically maintained using a graphics\napplication like Microsoft\n. Other products like\nsuperior capabilities for managing topology information.\nConfiguration management performance indicators provide a mechanism to\nvalidate and audit network configuration standards and critical success\nfactors. By implementing a process improvement program for configuration\nmanagement, you can use the performance indicators to identify consistency\nissues and improve overall configuration management.\nWe recommend creating a cross-functional team to measure configuration\nmanagement success and improve configuration management processes. The first\nobjective of the team is to implement configuration management performance\nindicators in order to identify configuration management issues. We'll discuss\nthe following configuration management performance indicators in detail:\nAfter evaluating the results from these audits, initiate a project to\nfix inconsistencies and then determine the initial cause of the problem.\nPotential causes include a lack of standards documentation or a lack of a\nconsistent process. You can improve standards documentation, implement\ntraining, or improve processes to prevent further configuration\nWe recommend monthly audits, or possibly quarterly if only validation\nis needed. Review past audits to confirm that past problems are resolved. Look\nfor overall improvements and goals to demonstrate progress and value. Create\nmetrics to show the quantity of high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk network\nThe configuration integrity check should evaluate the overall\nconfiguration of the network, its complexity and consistency, and potential\nissues. For Cisco networks, we recommend using the\nconfiguration validation tool. This tool inputs all device configurations and\ncreates a configuration report that identifies current problems such as\nduplicate IP addresses, protocol mismatches, and inconsistency. The tool\nreports any connectivity or protocol issues, but does not input standard\nconfigurations for evaluation on each device. You can manually review\nconfiguration standards or create a script that reports standard configuration\nDevice, protocol, and media audits are a performance indicator for\nconsistency in software versions, hardware devices and modules, protocol and\nmedia, and naming conventions. The audits should first identify any\nnon-standard issues, which should lead to configuration updates to fix or\nimprove the issues. Evaluate overall processes to determine how they could\nprevent suboptimal or non-standard deployments from occurring.\nRME is a configuration management tool that can audit and report on\nhardware versions, modules and software versions. Cisco is also developing more\ncomprehensive media and protocol audits that will report inconsistency with IP,\nDLSW, Frame Relay and ATM. If a protocol or media audit is not developed, you\ncan use manual audits, such as reviewing devices, versions and configurations\nfor all like devices in a network, or by spot checking devices, versions and\nThis performance indicator reviews network and standards documentation\nto ensure that the information is accurate and up to date. The audit should\ninclude reviewing current documentation, recommending changes or additions, and\napproving new standards.\nYou should review the following documentation on a quarterly basis:\nstandard configuration definitions, solution templates including recommended\nhardware configurations, current standard software versions, upgrade procedures\nfor all devices and software versions, topology documentation, current\ntemplates, and IP address management."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1a51c970-0696-4b42-b79b-998a69416090>"],"error":null}

Intrigued by anthropology, he gave up plans for a technical career. In 1927 he received a degree from the École Nationale de Langues Orientales, where he concentrated on Amharic and Gueze.\nBetween 1928 and 1933 Griaule participated in two large-scale ethnographic expeditions -- one to Ethiopia and the ambitious Dakar to Djibouti expedition which crossed Africa. On the latter expedition he first visited the Dogon, the ethnic group with whom he would be for ever associated.\nIn 1933 he received a diploma from the École Pratique des Hautes Études in religion.\nThroughout the 1930s Griaule and his student Germaine Dieterlen undertook several group expeditions to the Dogon area in Mali. During these trips Griaule pioneered the use of aerial photography, surveying, and team work to study other cultures. In 1938 he produced his dissertation and received a doctorate based on his Dogon research.\nWith the outbreak of World War II Griaule was drafted again in the French Air Force and after the war he served as the inaugural professor of the first chair of anthropology at the University of Paris - Sorbonne.

Known popularly as India’s Little Tibet, Ladakh is also known as a Moon Land due to its outlandish landscape of vast barren mountains, the bluest of skies, and beautiful turquoise lakes that change colour as day progresses.\nLadakh a land of jagged peaks and barren landscapes, a cold mountain desert is alluring and awe-inspiring. Hidden behind the harsh and forbidden façade is an ancient civilization of Buddhist simplicity. The unique culture of Ladakh, the towering monasteries and the beautiful people allure people to this land in plenty. Besides the beauty and mysticism of Ladakh, it also has a lot of adrenalin rush for the adventurous lot. It is after all the highest adventure playground for various trekking routes, scaling up peaks that are more than 6000 meters above sea level and rafting on the most challenging rivers. All this and more makes Ladakh more than just a leisure trip.\nThe Great Indus River flows through Ladakh and the province is divided into Leh (Capital), Nubra, Zanskar, Lower Ladakh and Rupshu. It receives approximately only 50mm of rainfall annually which makes it a cold and dry place. Winter is long, bitterly cold and the landscape gets frozen but gorgeous. Summers are short and hot with melted glaciers. In September, The Ladakh Festival is celebrated in Leh which sees an influx of tourists. The festival showcases the traditional dances, sporting skills and handicrafts of the local people with a lot of pomp and fan fare. Ladakh offers excellent opportunities for adventure sports. The 26 km stretch from Phey to Nimo in the Indus river is the highest river rafting experience one can have. Ladak’s high altitude mountains make it an ideal location for paragliding, mountaineering, and skiing.\nWhile visiting Ladakh one must make a trip through the highest motorable road in the world – the Khardung La Pass, 18,348 feet – to the high altitude breathtakingly beautiful Nubra Valley perched at a height of 10,000 feet above sea level. At a distance of 150 km from Leh arrives the Nubra Valley, a Y shaped valley drained by the Nubra River and the Shyok River. The Valley separates the mountains of Ladakh and the Karakoram mountain range. The Siachen glacier melts into the Nubra river. Siachen is the world’s highest battlefield. The western part of the valley borders on Baltistan, in Pakistan Occupied Kaskmir.\nThe ancient silk route to Central Asia passes through the Nubra Valley. The Mongols from Central Asia are believed to have brought the Bactrian Camel, the two humped camel to India. These bactrian camels are only found in Nubra Valley in India.\nThe main road access to the valley is through the Khardung La Pass which is 39 km from Leh. Inner Line Permit is required for visiting Nubra. The pass is of strategic importance as it is used to carry supplies to the Siachen battlefield. The roads are fully tarred up to an altitude of 16,000 feet beyond which they become rough due to snow and landslides. But the views are breathtakingly beautiful!\nThe main attractions of the Nubra Valley are the Bactrian Camels of Hunder, The Khardung La Pass, the Diskit and Samstaling monasteries, and the hot springs of Panamik.\nDiskit is the headquarters of the Nubra Valley and the town is dominated by the huge 14th century monastery which is the oldest and largest in the valley. It houses the remains of a respected 14th century lama from Nubra who returned from Tibet after serving as regent to the first Dalai Lama at Tashilhunpo Monastery in Tibet. The monastery has been a very sacred place since centuries.\nOn the opposite hill lies the landmark of the valley – the impressive 32-metre statue of the Buddha Maitreya. It took four years to complete and was inaugurated by the Dalai Lama on 24th July 2010\nHunder is a beautiful town, about 7 km away from Diskit. It was the capital of the erstwhile Nubra kingdom in the 17th century. Between Diskit and Hunder lie several kilometres of massive white sand dunes that are popular for Bactrian Camel Safari.\nBeyond Hunder are many small and beautiful towns such as Turtuk, Tyakshi, Thang, Chalunka, Sumur and Panamik. The villagers of the Balti towns have fair skin, blue eyes and auburn hair and are believed to be the descendants of the soldiers of Alexander the Great. Some also believe that their ancestors were Greek tribes that came in search of Jesus Christ’s Tomb and who eventually settled here. Most of these places were under Pakistan till 1971. Turtuk was opened to tourists only in 2011.\nPanamik is the last village in India beyond which is the Siachen battlefield. It is supposed to have hot spring with therapeutic qualities but most tourists come back disappointed with the condition of these springs. . It is easy to spot Pashmina goats here and the village also serves as the base camp for trekking expedition to the 250 year old ENSA GOMPA.\nDiskit Monastery – Spreading Serenity in the Wilderness\nHunder Sand Dunes – The White Beauty of Ladakh\nPanamik – Amalgamation of Scenic Beauty and Curative Hot Springs\nSamstanling Monastery – the Flag bearer of Ladakhi Traditions\nOn the way to Panamik village, you will come across a white structure with a tint of traditional gold and red orchard that makes it easily visible from a distance. It is Samstanling Monastery, believed to be the main Gompa of the valley. The path to the Gompa is equally eye-catching with bushes full of berries and Tibetan prayer flags welcoming you. The monastery was originally founded in 1841 by Lama Tsultim Nyima and presently 50 monks reside in it.\nYarab Tso Lake – The Virgin Beauty of Nubra Valley\nYarab Tso holy lake is situated close to Sumur village. The picturesque setting of the lake is enough to win the hearts of the visitors.\nNUBRA VALLEY TREK is one of the foremost trekking expeditions in Ladakh that every hard-core trekker wants to experience once in a lifetime. Freezing conditions, strong winds, rocky mountainsides and the passes put all your mental strength and physical stamina on test. And that’s why Nubra Valley Trek is not everybody’s cup of tea.\nDuring this trekking expedition, trekkers will come across various interesting places like Diskit Monastery, Khardung La, Khardung Village, Hunder Village and Khalser. While trekking, explorers can also enjoy Bactrian camel safaris.\nHow to Reach\nNubra Valley can be easily accessed from Leh, the capital town of Ladakh, via Khardung La. But special permits are required for tourists to enter the valley and the permit is valid for a maximum period of seven days only. Tourists and trekkers need to hand over photocopies of the permit on both the sides of Khardung La and also at the checkpoint by the bridge to Sumur. Tourists can reach the capital town Leh easily by any mode of transportation. For better convenience, the town has its own domestic airport that is well connected with all major cities of India.","TRANSFER TO THE UNITED STATES\nLouisiana still in Spainís hands. Delivery to France. Cession by France to the United States. A country without government. Congress gives the President power. Importance of the precedents. The territory divided. A last foreign invasion.\nAnother curious feature of this history is that although France had sold Louisiana to the United States, it had not yet been delivered by Spain to France. On the 30th of November, 1803, however, this ceremony was formally performed in the old Cabildo (City Hall) of New Orleans. The French commissioner, Laussat, delivered to the Spanish commissioners the order of the king of Spain for the transfer of the province to France, and showed the authority which Napoleon had given him to receive it. Then the Spaniards yielded the keys of New Orleans and absolved the people from allegiance to Spain. The Spanish flag was lowered, the French tricolor rose in its place, and the reign of Spain in Louisiana was ended.\nThe next step was the formal cession to the United States, and there were reasons for haste. Spain had protested against the act of France in selling the territory, for there was a clause in the original treaty which forbade its alienation.1 These protests were so strong that Jefferson even prepared to meet an armed resistance by sending a small military force under General James Wilkinson2 to New Orleans. Furthermore, in this interval there -was no formal government in that city.\nJefferson appointed William C. C. Claiborne, governor of Mississippi territory and General Wilkinson as the American commissioners to receive Louisiana. On December 20 they were escorted into the city by American troops and were received by Laussat in the Cabildo. The ceremonies performed at the Spanish cession twenty days before were repeated now for the most part, with one vital difference. This time the flag of France was replaced with the Stars and Stripes. It was the outward sign of a new destiny, the beginning of a new life richer and greater than any one who watched the unfurling of the flag could have dared to imagine.\n1An interesting modern Spanish view of the Louisiana Purchase has been afforded by Señor Jeronimo Becker, archivist of the ministry of state, in La España Moderna for May, 1903. This writer maintains that after securing the cession of Louisiana back to France, Talleyrand assured the Spanish government that the cession was desired merely for display and effect, and that later, on the payment of two million dollars, half in cash, Louisiana would be returned to Spain.\nSeñor Becker also states that in 1815 the Spanish government hoped to regain Louisiana through the action of the Congress of Vienna, and Labrador, the Spanish representative, was instructed to make the attempt. He saw that this was impossible, but it was believed in Vienna in 1815 that the English were in possession of New Orleans and therefore practically of Louisiana, and he suggested that they might be willing to transfer it to Spain, ó a plan, he added, which was approved by the Duke of Wellington. Señior Becker expresses a feeling of inherited resentment against France on account of the sharp practice by which Napoleon obtained Louisiana from Spain in exchange for the award to the Duke of Parma of the so-called kingdom of Etruria, which remained under the control of French soldiers after Napoleon had sold Louisiana to the Americans and the Americans were claiming the Floridas. But he shows no ill-will at the action of the United States.\n2An unfortunate representative of the United States. His apparent willingness to prove false to his country in connection with Burrís plottings, and his military incompetency, have not been palliated by his acquittals."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:829df68a-c141-4f0b-8dd7-a3c5031ae620>","<urn:uuid:bde7a573-401e-4666-9cc6-5e98ae06ed8f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the educational pathways available in agricultural science, and how does organic farming compare to conventional farming in terms of environmental impact?","answer":"Agricultural science education offers multiple pathways, from full degree programs to diploma courses. Students can pursue basic and advanced degrees that cover subjects like animal husbandry, botany, soil science, and agricultural economics. For those unable to commit to full-time studies, diploma options include Basic Diploma, Post Graduate Diploma, and Advanced Diploma courses. Regarding environmental impact, organic farming shows significant advantages over conventional farming. It uses 30% less energy and water to produce the same yields, while avoiding soil and water contamination from pesticides and toxic chemicals. Organic farming creates better soil biodiversity, performs better during droughts, and emits nearly 40% fewer greenhouse gases per unit of crop compared to conventional systems.","context":["Farming science is study regarding the practices involved in the area of agriculture. Farming science and agriculture, although associated with one another, are basically quite different from each other. Agriculture is the skill of growing plants, vegetables and fruit for people to drink. Farming science, however, handles research, improvement and rise in techniques of production like irrigation management, pest management etc. It offers the processes essential for increasing the quantity and quality of farming products.\nFarming science handles transforming the main products to finished, consumption-ready products. Additionally, it requires the prevention and correction of adverse factors hampering productivity. It’s been known as local science due to its strong regards to the neighborhood areas. It’s frequently regarded as a science coping with eco-regions because it depends largely on climate and qualities of soil inside a particular area. These 4 elements vary largely in one spot to another. Many people are of the perception that farming science depends upon the neighborhood weather and native soil characteristics, so specific crops have to be studied in your area.\nThe road breaking work of Gregor Mendel in the area of agriculture made its study extremely popular all over the world. However, in the current era caffeine fertilizer industries in Germany revolutionized the concept of agriculture three hundred years ago. In USA, a revolution in farming science started using the passing from the Hatch Act in 1887. The driving pressure behind the Hatch Act was the necessity of the country to empower the maqui berry farmers so they could improve productivity and feed the growing population. Because the early 19 sixties, agriculture has acquired lots of importance in developing and civilized world.\nThis method was referred to as Eco-friendly Revolution and it was from the procedure for selecting and substantially improving crops for optimum productivity. To this day, lots of research is happening in this subject of study, that has brought towards the emergence of numerous new regions of study like waste treatment, bug control, farming philosophy yet others that focus basically on food production. Using the development in world population, farming science may be the one science that will play a huge role in making certain the continuity of mankind.\nFarming Science Degree\nFarming science is really a multi-dimensional method of understanding and exercise of numerous economic, social and natural sciences that take part in agriculture. Students who graduate in the area of farming science possess a fair knowledge of the connection between maqui berry farmers, environments and finish-consumers with the intensive study of financial aspects, animal husbandry, botany and anything else that is involved in the area of farming and food production. Since over fifty percent the populace around the globe is not directly or directly involved with agriculture and manufacture of food, levels in farming science give a broad spectrum of opportunities varying from education to agronomy.\nThe amount includes a curriculum that prepares the scholars for basic level jobs in this subject. They’re been trained in animal and plant biology, horticulture, animal agriculture, soil science, sustaining agriculture, fundamental chemistry, manufacture of food and also the financial aspects of farming production. These varied subjects be sure that the student is ready for just about any challenge that she or he might encounter in this subject.\nThe amount courses concentrate on a rigorous and focused study of specialties in agriculture. The classes include advanced level chemistry, financial aspects, control over water, computer application needed for control over agriculture, ecological design, biological engineering, use of pesticides and insecticides, education and biotechnology etc. The amount also requires extensive laboratory and field work. A student may then go for specialization courses in these subjects studied earlier. They might opt for either online or campus based levels in farming science.\nSince farming science involves field and laboratory work, students cannot go for master levels in this subject of study, through online education. However, many online schools offer advanced courses in a variety of fields like ecological policies, ecological studies as well as ecological management. These 3 fields are important within the study and control over food production. The classes are much like those of farming science. There are lots of private and condition universities around the globe that offer fundamental and advanced level courses online.\nMany universities in america are recognized for offering various degree and diploma courses in this subject. Within the last couple of decades, universities in India and Australia emerged as heavyweights during this field of study by undertaking revolutionary research and effectively applying approaches to the various parts of production in agriculture. Hence, farming science students are highly sought after, in regions.\nIt’s not always possible for a person to pursue full-time degree courses, because of insufficient money and time. In such instances, people can go for diploma courses. Many students that has completed senior high school education can use of these diploma courses. Such diploma courses can be found in the concept of agriculture. The classes are designed in a way they supply the students having a thorough summary of horticulture, animal husbandry and agriculture. Farming diploma classes are highly suggested for college students who wish to pursue a job in Horticultural management or Control over Farming Farms.\nThere are lots of kinds of diploma courses like Fundamental Diploma, Publish Graduate Diploma and Advanced Diploma courses. These courses provide the students using the understanding of various facets of farming science. These courses also cover some elementary subjects like hr, physical and financial management.","(June 2016) Not all meat and dairy products are the same; not in nutritional quality nor in how they affect our planet. Quality and environmental impact vary greatly from the variety of agricultural practices employed, and how food is processed. I have spoken often about the health and nutrition benefits of organic, grass-fed animal-based foods. This blog, however, is about sustainability and environmental stewardship.\nThe multitude of methods used for meat and dairy production include organic, free range, intensive livestock, and subsistence farming. Beyond organic are sustainable practices like no-till and biodynamic farming. Some organic operations are far superior to others, while some conventional farms are quite a bit cleaner than others, or on the path to becoming organic. So, some of these distinctions are not clear cut. Yet, it’s always good to know from where your food comes. That’s one of the clear advantages to buying local.\nWhen it comes to raising animals for food, there’s much to consider: Water consumption, methane gas emissions, the real cost of raising grain for feed, air and water quality, etc. Regardless, beef and milk production require tons of water, to the tune of 2000 gallons to produce just one pound of beef, or a gallon of milk. Much of that is used to grow grains for cow feed. That’s at least three times as much water as it takes to grow the same quantity of soy milk, and twice that needed for almond milk.\nIndeed, most of our water use goes to what we eat. Eighty percent of the water used in California is consumed by agriculture, according to the Pacific Institute. Irrigation projects in the former Soviet Union to grow cotton dramatically emptied the Aral Sea, destroyed fisheries, depopulated large areas and caused disease epidemics. Generally speaking, agriculture uses approximately 70% of the world’s freshwater supply. Looming climate change is likely to alter both water availability and agricultural water demands, so it behooves us to conserve as much as possible, and to improve on the goods and services it produces.\nThere is potentially an enormous difference between conventional and alternative farming practices in the amount of water and land consumption, fossil fuel use, and pollution. Organic farming uses 30% less energy and less water than conventional farming to produce the same corn and soybean yields, while yielding healthier, pesticide-free produce and far less groundwater pollution. Organic farming does not contaminate soil, rivers and drinking water like industrial farming does (Gonzalez, 2008). Conventional farming and livestock production are major stressors on the planet. They are major sources of greenhouse gases and loss of biodiversity, and major water polluters [Steinfeld et al., 2006].\nIndustrial agriculture relies on pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers and other toxic chemicals that increase the use of machinery, which contributes to a larger carbon footprint and global warming. Conventional systems emit nearly 40% more greenhouse gases per unit of crop than organic systems, while organic farming systems use 45% less energy (Middleton & Smith, 2011).\nOrganic farming may be especially competitive during droughts. Berkeley researchers concluded that organic farming creates biodiversity in the soil and environment not seen with synthetic chemicals. Organic plots can even outperform conventional ones, regarding yield, when the going gets tough. Organic plots are especially resilient to droughts, and extremes of frost and flooding, according to the Rodale Institute. Microbes and other organisms in organic soil create intricate relationships with plants and affect soil architecture. Organic soil absorbs and stores water better, and needs less water than conventional soil (Ferris, 2014). Organic farming is a more sustainable way of doing agriculture, hands down.\nThe Environmental Working Group has concluded that grass fed beef is better for the environment. Benefits from well managed grass fed operations are multifaceted, whereas large-scale confined feedlots have tremendous negative impacts on air and water quality. In “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” Michael Pollan points to the lighter carbon footprint in grass-fed operations, due to the fertilizer, pesticide and fossil fuel required for grain used in feed lots. More methane is produced by grass-fed cattle because it’s harder to digest grass than grain, but grasslands sequester enough carbon to more than make up the difference. A healthier soil and richer humus result from cows trampling their manure into the soil. The increased diversity maintains a healthy soil that keeps CO2 out of the atmosphere. Grazing cattle help stabilize soil, control weeds, and reduce the risk of wildfire (Profita, 2013).\nThe animals our ancestors ate roamed free and ate grass, whereas cattle and dairy cows today are force-fed grains. What we feed them has a major effect on the nutrient composition of the milk and beef. Numerous studies conclude that these nutrients vary significantly, depending on what the cows eat. For example, grass-fed, whole milk contains a third of the omega-3 fatty acids we need for brain, heart, skin and joint health, while conventional milk is virtually devoid of omega-3s. Grass-fed, full-fat dairy also contains 3-5 times as many antioxidants like beta-carotene, lutein and vitamin E (Chang, 2016). Grass-fed beef and milk also contains about twice as much conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) as grain-fed beef products. CLA is associated with reduced body fat and other benefits (Whigham et al., 2007). Plus, organic milk and meat do not contain the antibiotics, hormones and pesticides found in conventional animal-based foods. These drugs and chemicals contribute significantly to antibiotic resistance and the chronic diseases of modernity.\nSome folks opt to cut their environmental impact by not eating meat, or cutting back on their purchases. Yet meat and dairy provide nutrients that are hard to find in other foods. If done right, these foods are not only more nutritious, but also much less harmful to the earth. We should pay attention to how our ancestors thrived, and abide by nature’s wisdom.\nChang K. 2016.

{"question":"I'm planning trips to both Japan and South Korea - how do their rainy seasons compare in terms of timing and impact on tourism?","answer":"Japan's rainy season occurs from early June to mid-July, characterized by warm and humid weather with overcast skies and occasional light rain. The rain doesn't necessarily pour every day. In contrast, South Korea's monsoon season runs from July to August, bringing uncomfortable dampness, muggy conditions, and torrential rains. South Korea's rainy season is actually best avoided for tourism, as it coincides with school holidays making attractions crowded, and the country experiences 1-3 typhoons annually, mostly in August. Japan offers various indoor activities during its rainy season, including museums, spas, shopping centers, and cultural experiences like tea ceremonies.","context":["Japan is known for its rainy season which falls towards the beginning of June and into mid-July. However, the rainy season in Japan is quite warm, and humid and does not have a downpour every day. Some days are light but the sky is often overcast and grey. Don’t let the rain dampen your fun, here are some things to do on a rainy day in Tokyo.\nUnder my umbrella\nIf you planned in advance for the rainy weather in Tokyo, chances are you packed a rain jacket or an umbrella. In case you didn’t, not to worry! You may actually want to purchase your umbrella while in Japan. You will see many locals with the large, clear umbrellas which make it easier to see. Also, you will notice that in many stores there are machines at the front that will wrap your umbrella in plastic for you, so you can walk around without dripping water. Umbrella culture in Japan is something unto itself, and you will certainly find an array of small, cheap, accessible umbrellas for purchase for a rainy day in Tokyo.\nVisit a Museum on a rainy day in Tokyo\nTo get out of the Tokyo rain, why not spend the day indoors at one of the many museums found in the city. The Tokyo National Museum is the oldest Japanese national museum, and not only one of the largest art museums in the country, but also in the world. Originating in 1872, the museum showcases art and archeological findings and focuses predominantly on Japan.\nAnother museum worth visiting on a rainy day in Tokyo is the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum housing fine art, photography and sculpture and the works of both local and world-renowned artists. The exhibitions are beautifully curated, and it is easy to spend a few hours here.\nRelax at the Spa to escape Tokyo’s rain\nWhat better way to relax your tired feet and body from all the sightseeing, than in a traditional Japanese spa? These Japanese bathhouses are categorized in Onsen and Sento which both offer a communal bath experience. Traditionally, onsens are supposed to be filed with natural volcanic spring water, and sento are filled with tap water which has been heated. In the tradition onsens, the volcanic water is mineral-rich and has healing properties. If you are looking to escape the gloomy rainy day in Tokyo, look for a Tokyo Bathhouse which is spa-like usually offering saunas, outdoor pools, and massages. The settings are very natural and serene, and a great way to relax and think of Tokyo’s rain outside as part of the cleansing process.\nShop til you drop\nShopping in Tokyo can be done rain or shine! On rainy days in Tokyo, however, check out Shinjuku underground. A variety of shops and stores all found underground meaning there is no need to step outside and get wet. First Avenue Tokyo Station also offers some great underground shopping in case it rains in Tokyo.\nEnjoy some Japanese Tradition\nWhy not enjoy a traditional Japanese tea ceremony on a rainy Tokyo day? This is a special and unique experience and a way to connect to the traditional culture. Learning about the tea etiquette and practices involved along with the tea, the ceremony is deeply rooted in tradition. Some tea ceremonies will offer you a kimono to wear for the full experience, regardless of where you go, the tea ceremony is an insight into the culture and a nice way to connect and forget about the rainy day outside.\nPlay some video games\nWhen it is a rainy day in Tokyo, a perfect indoor activity is at a Japanese arcade. Whether you are a gamer or not, it is worth checking out these impressive arcades. Japan is advanced in many ways, and when it comes to gaming, they are the leaders in the industry and it shows. Visiting a Japanese arcade is not only fun to play the games, but to also watch the hardcore gamers and their skills.\nSumo Wrestling Practise\nEnjoy a rare opportunity to observe a sumo wrestling training practice. One of the most popular sports in Japan, sumo wrestlers are embedded in the culture. Get up close and personal with the wrestlers on join a Tokyo Sumo Wrestling Practise. It may be raining outside, but in the wrestling stable, it will be hot.","When is the Best Time to Visit South Korea?\nThe best time to visit South Korea depends largely on what you want to do. South Korea’s four distinct seasons cater to all types of traveller, offering different perks year-round. If you’re going for the cherry blossoms, then late March to mid-April is the time to visit. For colourful autumn leaves and traditional festivals, September to November is a great time to go. The best time to enjoy South Korea’s snow is from December to February, particularly if you’re a winter sports enthusiast. South Korea’s monsoon season lasts from July to August, so it’s best to avoid travelling there during those months.\nThe best time of year to visit South Korea\nMany travellers looking to experience Asia’s cherry blossom think of Japan; however, South Korea is a great alternative. The best time to catch a glimpse of these beautiful Spring colours is from the end of March to mid-April. For the best cherry blossom views, visit Seoul’s Yeouido Spring Flower Festival or Busan’s Jinhae Gunhangje Cherry Blossom Festival. On Jeju Island, Seongeup Folk Village showcases the pastel colours in an authentic and charming way.\nAutumn colours: September to November\nOutside of “sakura” season, Autumn is the best time to visit South Korea. The leaves change colour, with stunning shades of orange and red appearing all over the country. In September, chilly autumnal temperatures can follow some of the hottest days of the year, so it’s worth packing a few extra layers. October has nearly perfect weather and is a great time to enjoy the array of reds, oranges and yellows appearing across South Korea. In November, festivals such as the Seoul Lantern Festival and Seoul Kimchi Festival complement mild temperatures and natural beauty.\nDecember to February is South Korea’s winter, which is cold but cosy. This is the best time to visit South Korea if you are looking enjoy some winter sports, such as skiing and snowboarding. Cooler temperatures also mean that points of interest will be far less crowded than usual. If you need to escape the cold for a while, head to one of South Korea’s many jjimjilbangs – traditional Korean spas complete with saunas and thermal baths.\nWhen not to go to South Korea\nIn July, rainy season means that the whole of South Korea feels uncomfortably damp and muggy. August brings scorching temperatures alongside torrential rains. It’s also the holiday season for most Korean schools and universities, meaning it can get extremely crowded. South Korea experiences one to three typhoons per year, with most of them passing over the country in August, so this time of year is best avoided.\nSeollal (Lunar New Year) and Chuseok\nSouth Korea’s lunar new year, Seollal, is celebrated at some point in either January or February. Chuseok, a Korean harvest festival, falls between September and October. During both festivals, many South Koreans go home to see their families, making travelling around the country quite difficult. Many attractions are also closed during these times, so Seoul becomes quite quiet. As both celebrations depend on the lunar calendar, their dates change slightly each year. It’s a good idea to check whether your planned travel dates coincide with either festival before you book your trip.\nFestivals and culture\nAs well as being the best time of year for South Korea’s cherry blossom, many exciting festivals take place between March and May. In March, Jeju Fire Festival celebrates the arrival of Spring. Farmers on Jeju Island set their pastures alight to kill old grass and eliminate pests before cattle and horses start grazing again. Daljip, or moon houses, are also burned to help fulfil villagers’ prayers for good fortune. The fascinating Jindo Miracle Sea Road Festival occurs between the end of April and early May. During this time, an incredible natural phenomenon allows festival-goers to walk straight through the middle of the parted Jindo Sea.\nAvoid the crowds\nWeather still tends to be mild in June, particularly in South Korea’s coastal towns such as Busan and Jindo. South Korea’s coastline can become overrun with tourists in July and August, so visiting in June is a great way to avoid the crowds, especially as Spring comes to an end and the rainfall is still yet to come. Although the weather is unlikely to be inclement, evenings can still be cool so it’s worth packing a light jacket.\nWhatever you want from your trip to South Korea, our team of expert travel designers are ready to help."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9b1d7484-7cca-4c92-bcc1-206df2e084f8>","<urn:uuid:4452ac6f-4a5e-4fab-a85d-483b3f51cff0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role do instrumental solos play in Stockhausen's compositions, and how do performers interpret these technically demanding works in live settings?","answer":"In Stockhausen's compositions, instrumental solos serve as vehicles for complex musical experimentation, as seen in works like TRAUM-FORMEL for basset-horn, which creates a polyphonic 6-layered web requiring constant large interval leaps, making it highly virtuosic. In live performance settings, musicians must demonstrate exceptional technical skill and concentration, as evidenced by the Guildhall New Music Ensemble's disciplined performance of Adieu, which demands precise control of sustained notes and ensemble coordination. Additionally, pianists like Nicolas Hodges have shown brilliant execution of the Klavierstücke, successfully navigating the composer's experiments with sound and pushing the boundaries of what is achievable on the piano.","context":["|SAMSTAG AUS LICHT|\n|Michael Leibundgut as \"Lucifer\"|\nin the 2013 Munich Production\n(LUCIFER's Dream, or Piano Piece 13)\nfor Bass vocalist and piano\n1st Scene of SAMSTAG AUS LICHT\n(SATURDAY from LIGHT)\nNo. 51 1/2 (ie - 51.2): KLAVIERSTÜCK XIII (Piano Piece 13), for solo piano, 1981 [36']\nNo. 51 2/3 (ie - 51.3): TRAUM-FORMEL (DREAM-FORMULA) for solo basset-horn, 1981 [9']\nLUZIFERs TRAUM (LUCIFER'S DREAM) is the 1st Scene of Stockhausen's dramatic music work SAMSTAG AUS LICHT (SATURDAY from LIGHT), which was the second-composed entry of his 7-part, 29-hour opera cycle LICHT (Light). LICHT is a work for acoustic and electronic operatic forces, divided into the 7 days of the week (one opera for each day). This opera cycle revolves around 3 archetype characters, MICHAEL, EVE and LUCIFER, and over the 29 hours each of these characters are introduced, come into conflict, face temptation and finally come into union. The music is almost entirely based on a \"super-formula\", which is a 3-layered melodic-thematic representation of the 3 characters. These formula-themes are together and separately threaded throughout the opera's vocal and instrumental fabric. Story-wise, actors and narrative can (and often do) change from scene to scene, and the libretto text is sometimes made up of non-traditional grammar (or even purely phonetic sounds).\nSAMSTAG is LUCIFER's day, which is the Day of Death (and Resurrection), as well as the Night of the transition to the LIGHT. In LUZIFERs TRAUM, the character LUCIFER, played by a bass vocalist, has a dream which is interpreted as a piano solo. At the end of the scene, LUCIFER is entranced by a \"simple melody\" and apparently \"dies\".\nAlso known as KLAVIERSTÜCK XIII (Piano Piece 13), this piece was apparently originally designed as a work for solo piano and then 4 bass vocal solos were added to it to create its dramatic arc of being LUCIFER's dream. The melodic formulas of MICHAEL, EVE and LUCIFER and their derivations from the full LICHT super-formula are interwoven throughout LUZIFERs TRAUM both as actual melodic material and as transposition pitches for several repetitions of the EVE and LUCIFER formulas. However, despite the construction as 5 temporal layers, the whole work really does feel like a \"dream\", with lots of melodic ruminations.\n|This is the Saturday section from the LICHT super-formula.|\nThe first 3 staves are the MICHAEL, EVE and LUCIFER formula layers.\nThe 4th staff is the complete LUCIFER Nuclear formula.\nThe scene structure of LUZIFER'S TRAUM is assigned the first measure.\n- MICHAEL formula (one cycle/repetition)\n- EVE formula (eight cycles, with transpositions based on the LUZIFER'S TRAUM segment of the EVE formula (8 descending notes, staff 2, m. 1 above))\n- LUCIFER formula (one cycle)\n- LUCIFER formula (five cycles, with transpositions based on the LUZIFER'S TRAUM segment of the LUCIFER formula (5 ascending notes, staff 3, m.1 above))\n- LUZIFER'S TRAUM segment of the LUCIFER Nuclear formula (4 notes, 1 very long, then ascending to 3 short descending, staff 4, m. 1 above)\nThe 2nd and 4th layer cycle transpositions are based on pitches from the 1st measures of the EVE and LUCIFER formulas from the LICHT super-formula's Saturday day-segment (the super-formula is divided into 7 segments, one for each day of the week). The 5th layer is the first measure of the LUCIFER nuclear formula (simplified version of the formula). There is also actually a 6th layer based on the LUCIFER's TRAUM measure of the LUCIFER formula (the 5 ascending notes in the 3rd staff).\n|The EVE Formula is traversed 8 times.\n(click to enlarge)\n|The LUCIFER Formula is traversed 5 times.\n(click to enlarge)\nAfter a brief introduction consisting of 7 chords using the LUCIFER \"signature\" motif (major 7th) and a quotation of Layer 4 (5 ascending notes), the main \"dream\" begins.\nLayer 2 is the most obvious, and it is basically seven cycles (repetitions) of the complete EVE formula, each time starting on a different pitch, depending on the seven transpositions. This is followed by an eighth cycle called \"The Simple Melody\", which is also based on the EVE formula. These multiple statements of the EVE formula are put through a variety of elaborations and expansions, using all aspects of piano performance, including playing the inside piano strings (with fingers, nails or hammer), striking the piano frame, dense clusters, whistling, shaking Indian bells, vocalized counting and even small model rockets (site-permitting). Melodic figures are also enhanced or simplified with additional harmonic and melodic elements.\nSimultaneously, Layer 4 is played, consisting of five cycles of the complete LUCIFER formula, each time starting on a different pitch, depending on their 5 transpositions. These five LUCIFER statements are also elaborated on in the same way as Layer 2's EVE cycles. Additionally, the melodic elements (called \"human figures\" by the bass vocalist) are temporally compressed and the percussive gestures (knocks, rests, whispers, etc...) are lengthened (see \"Dissolution of the LUCIFER formula\" down below).\nLayers 1 and 3 are each single iterations of the MICHAEL and LUCIFER formulas, but temporally stretched from the original formula length of 1 minute to about half an hour. In other words these are slowed down to 1/30th of their original tempo. Layer 5 is a single measure the length of a half note, stretched out to almost a half hour. Actually, \"temporally stretched\" is probably not exactly a correct way to describe it, since notes do not sustain 30 times longer. More accurately, the formula note \"attack moments\" are spread out over these long durations. In other words, notes and sounds from the MICHAEL and LUCIFER formulas will just \"drop in\" on top of the more active cycle-based layers.\nThe final effect is a polyphonic work with a foreground layer based on the eight EVE cycles, a middle-ground layer based on the five LUCIFER cycles, and background (very background) layers created from the very slowly portioned out notes from single statements of the MICHAEL and LUCIFER formulas, and the basically too-sparse-to-be-heard 5th layer from the 1st measure of the LUCIFER nuclear formula. The layers are graphically illustrated in the stage lighting form scheme (see Live Performance below).\n|Majella Stockhausen from score cover|\nSecond column is CD track numbers for Stockhausen Complete Edition CD 33 featuring Majella Stockhausen.\nLUCIFER Nuclear Formula\n|1||38||LUCIFER as a bass vocalists leans on a cloud (or chair) and looks into the distance.\nMAJELLA (the pianist) plays 7 major 7th LUCIFER chords in G\n(some stacked with BbM7th intervals and a high F, probably from the L's TRAUM LUCIFER and LUCIFER Nuclear formula segments)\nas LUCIFER the bass vocalist intones 5 ascending notes\n(L's TRAUM LUCIFER layer)\n|LUCIFER sits down and falls into a dream, interpreted by MAJELLA.\nLUCIFER Cycle 1 (Layer 4) begins with Ab pedal rhythm\nEVE Cycle 1 (Layer 2) also begins in right hand\n|16||40||high cluster glissandi||etc...|\n|19||high tremolos (Bb/Db and Bb/C) w slow ascending bass|\n|21||41||1st knocking phrase|\n|24||2nd knocking phrase|\n|26||EVE Thursday gesture: 8 colored glissandi|\n|30||42||LUCIFER's 7 numbers (whispered),\nfingernail string gliss, plucks\n|32||back and forth fingernail \"scrubbing\" on strings|\n|38||44||dense LUCIFER (Layer 3) tremolo on C begins||etc...|\n|44||LUCIFER Friday gesture:\n3 voiceless calls (\"piu\")\n|47||45||Layer 3 C tremolo continues|\n|49||(MICHAEL formula silent pause)|\n|50||LUCIFER's 5 numbers (whispered)\nw finger gliss on strings\n|52||46||E2||EVE Cycle 2 begins|\n|57||47||EVE \"shhh\" descending gliss|\n|59||48||tremolo on A and F#|\n|65||thumps under the keyboard|\n|66||49||LUCIFER's 12 numbers (whispered),\n|67||EVE Thursday gesture:\nseveral colored glissandi\n|69||MICHAEL cluster briefly interrupts EVE's glissandi|\n|71||LUCIFER bass vocal solo: \"13…1,\n(LUCIFER Nuclear formula retrograde melody, hence the backwards numbers)\n|73||descending whistle gliss|\n|77||50||L2||LUCIFER Cycle 2 begins|\n|82||MICHAEL cluster briefly interrupts chord rhythm|\n|98||53||E3||EVE Cycle 3 begins (from part of m.97)|\n|102||LUCIFER's 8 numbers (1...7, 1)|\n|112, 113||(MICHAEL & LUCIFER Layer 3 formulas silent pause)|\n|116||knocks w tongue clicks|\n|122||57||LUCIFER Friday gesture:\n3 voiceless calls (\"piu\"), string pizz.\n|125||fingernails on strings|\n|128||58||LUCIFER's 8 numbers (mysteriously),\n|129||LUCIFER's 5 numbers|\n|140||59||bass pedal notes|\n|141||(momentary \"full voice\" counting from LUCIFER slow formula)|\n|147||60||E4||EVE Cycle 4 begins (end of 146),\nLUCIFER's 13 numbers\n|148||counting becomes witch-like|\n|153||LUCIFER bass vocal: \"13…5, Majella\n- crescendo decrescendo, colored silence, noises...shades, colors of\n(retrograde LUCIFER & EVE formulas)\nnail glissandi on strings\n|159||61||L3||LUCIFER Cycle 3 begins|\n|165||62||EVE Thursday gesture:\nseveral colored glissandi w clusters and hissing\n|174||nail glissandi on strings|\n|177||63||nail glissandi on strings again|\n|185||64||LUCIFER's 8 numbers,\n|195||(LUCIFER slow formula silent pause)|\n|197||66||even 8th note figurell|\n|204||67||E5||EVE Cycle 5 begins (actually 202)|\ninhale, exhale breathing\n|212||69||LUCIFER Friday gesture:\n3 voiceless calls (\"piu\") gliss, bells\n|216||70||high register large interval tremolos|\n|221||Count 1-5-1-5, knocks|\n|230||EVE Thursday gesture:\nseveral colored glissandi\n|234||72||bells, LUCIFER Friday gesture: 3 voiceless calls (\"piu\"), very slow|\n|236||use mallet to strike and rub low strings|\n|242||73||Big scale run before count|\n|243||LUCIFER's 13 numbers, very slow|\n|250||74||LUCIFER bass vocal: \"Compression\nof figures, of humans' music, expansions and pauses for annulment of\n(retrograded forms of LUCIFER & MICHAEL formulas)\n|258||75||L4||LUCIFER Cycle 4 begins|\n|265||76||tremolo before EVE Cycle 6|\n|266||E6||EVE Cycle 6 begins||F#\n|269||77||staccato scale run|\n|273||EVE big descending gliss|\n|282||knock on piano edges|\n|284||79||hammer against metal bell stand, whistling, string scraping begins|\n|287||LUCIFER's 8 numbers, vary fast|\n|291||EVE Thursday gesture: several colored glissandi w nails on strings|\nnail and string brushing, pizz.\n|310||81||LUCIFER Friday gesture:\n3 voiceless calls (\"piu\")\n|314||82||Low tremolo accel.|\n|319||83||LUCIFER's 5 numbers,\nfast and repeating\n|329||EVE Cycle 7 foreshadow|\n|332||85||E7||EVE Cycle 7 begins|\n|338||86||EVE big descending \"shhh\" gliss, bells|\n|340||LUCIFER's 5 numbers,\nincreasing to 13, witchlike\n|343||87||LUCIFER's numbers repeating with different speeds (\"7\" loudly during LUCIFER's solo)|\nLUCIFER bass vocal (stares at the ceiling, raises hands, uses \"finger language\"): \"Elements five thirteen -

Each cycle (parallel with the 5-cycle Layer 4) has proportional tempo elements which relate to intervals in the LUCIFER formula.\nKohl also mentions (in his article \"Into the Middleground: Formula Syntax in Stockhausen's Licht\", Perspectives of New Music 28.2) that the 4 bass vocal solos at the ends of the first 4 LUCIFER cycles is based on retrograded forms of the LICHT formulas. First the LUCIFER Nuclear formula is sung in retrograde (backwards), then LUCIFER (Nuclear) and EVE are combined and in retrograde, then LUCIFER and MICHAEL formula forms retrograded, and then finally all 3 previously sung formulas are sung in retrograde.\nThe LUCIFER formula goes through 5 cycles, but in each iteration after the first, a process of progressive \"dissolution\" occurs. Stockhausen does this by increasingly compressing the melodic figures and expanding the pauses and \"colored silences\" (the bass vocal text in bar 250 actually states this outright). In \"Time and LIGHT\" (Contemporary Music Review 7, 1993), Kohl describes Stockhausen's initial sketches for LUCIFER's TRAUM and how he realizes these distortions in the final score. In sections 2 through 5, 20 \"distortion events\" (pauses or mostly un-pitched \"noises\" such as the knocking, etc...) are spread out and are increasingly lengthened with the use of the Fibonacci series and \"magic square\" matrices. These progressive expansions of \"null time\" are a bit hard to detect, but the counting bit obviously gets slower and slower.\nIn addition to the 5 layers described above, there is also a 6th layer which is very subtle (maybe more so than Layers 1 and 3). This 6th layer, based on the LUCIFER's TRAUM measure of the LUCIFER formula expresses the 5 crossed ascending notes as what Jerome Kohl calls \"halo chords\" (also described in notes from his lecture, \"Neotonality in SAMSTAG AUS LICHT\"). These are chords which are pressed down silently with the middle piano pedal down. For large sections of the work, this pedal is held down so that when the rest of the notes in the piece play, the notes from the silent chords subtly vibrate as a background texture, and new notes which are part of these chords are emphasized. There are 18 of these held chords, but they are divided into 5 main tonalities, each matched with one of the 5 rising notes in the 6th layer. The 5 notes are labeled in the LUCIFER formula as \"voiceless\", so the usage of silent chord pedaling is very appropriate.\nSee KLAVIERSTÜCKE V–X for more on halo tones...\n|The lowest staff is labeled Gesäß (\"Buttocks\"). \"Stand up, lay entire left leg on the keyboard...slide buttock each time, suddenly head pulled back, chest forward...\" The last text is an instruction to use the hammer as a wedge to keep the right sustain pedal down so that the clusters continue to ring after the pianist has left the stage.|\nNino Jvania (Zhvania) performs the solo concert version of KLAVIERSTÜCK XIII.\nNew England Conservatory, Williams Hall, Boston, MA, USA, 05.15.10\n|Score cover (© www.karlheinzstockhausen.org)|\nTRAUM-FORMEL, or \"Dream-Formula\", is very similar to LUZIFER's TRAUM in that it creates a polyphonic 6-layered web from the Saturday LICHT formulas. It's a very virtuosic piece because Stockhausen places the layers in different registers in order to separate them, and so the bassett-horn has to constantly make large interval leaps.\n|The MICHAEL Formula|\n- The MICHAEL formula (at right)\n- The LUCIFER formula (see earlier section)\n- LUZIFER'S TRAUM segment of the MICHAEL formula (1 note)\n- LUZIFER'S TRAUM segment of the EVE formula (7 notes)\n- LUZIFER'S TRAUM segment of the LUCIFER formula (5 notes)\n- LUZIFER'S TRAUM segment of the LUCIFER nuclear formula (5 notes)\nThe main body is book-ended by an introduction (high expanding vibrato-trill, 57\") and coda (ending with low vibrato tones with grace notes, 55\"). The full cycle is completed twice (2'58\"/2'52\"), with 3 additional short \"insert\" sections. The first insert is a slow, low 2-note figure (middle of the 1st cycle), the second is a long B note (between the 2 cycles), and the third is a tremolo on C# and a descending 2nd note, based on the LUZIFER'S TRAUM segment of the EVE formula (near end of the 2nd cycle). Stockhausen also writes \"If at all possible, DREAM FORMULA should be performed wearing a blue-black, green-black, glittering costume, nocturnal-erotic\". This description as well as some lighting cues come from a vision Stockhausen experienced.\nBeginning of the main body.\nThe MICHAEL formula is traced in BLUE.\nThe LUCIFER formula is in RED.\nThe other layers' pitches are interspersed among these 2 main layers.\n(score © www.karlheinzstockhausen.org)\nLUZIFER's TRAUM is has alot of meticulous structural elements, but its basic fabric is very \"liquid\". Since the scene is that of a dream, the themes and gestures take on a quality of rumination - themes are savored before moving on to the next motif. The EVE formula goes through 8 cycles, yet one never feels that one's been there before, due to the changing \"tidal forces\" of the other 4 layers. However the EVE formula's Wednesday segment does surface many times as a welcome \"anchoring\" motif. At times the work feels very jazzy and improvisatory. Sometimes when the texture threatens to become too languid, a heavy tremolo or piano string scrape will suddenly break the spell.\nTRAUM-FORMEL is one of Stockhausen's most impressive solo wind works and it's a great example where structural complexity is not sacrificed on the altar of virtuosity.

They remind us what a startling impact Stockhausen had on the music-world in the early 1950s when he literally changed the way music was conceived, listened to and appreciated, and how far reaching his influence would be; and they are an interesting pointer and contrast to the larger, more ambitious works from Gruppen onwards.\nFrom later, the wind quintet, Adieu (1966) was a departure for Stockhausen at a time when he was concentrating on electronic pieces. It was commissioned as a memorial to an oboist who had worked with him and who had died in a car crash. Adieu, from its title and subject matter, is a subdued work, long sustained notes interrupted by abrupt passages of ensemble-playing before the instruments take off in their own direction. This sequence of passages where players are allowed a certain amount of freedom before briefly coming together comes around slowly, then quickly, at times the music grinding to a halt. Played softly throughout, the effect is of reflection and meditation. Under the direction of Richard Baker, the members of Guildhall New Music Ensemble showed commendable discipline in music demanding the utmost level of concentration.\nThey returned at the end of the first half to give Kontra-Punkte, the work from 1952 for ten instruments that is widely credited with having made Stockhausen’s reputation. Here the composer expanded on his technique of composing. As Paul Griffiths explained in his programme notes, this music “gradually gives way to a flow of groups – of groups in counterpoint with “points” or with other groups”. In Kontra-Punkte, wind, brass, strings, harp and piano combine at the outset, go their separate ways and eventually, one-by-one, drop out. The music reduces to pianissimo, the keyboard the only instrument left at the end; again a disciplined performance with an outstanding contribution from pianist Richard Uttley.\nNicolas Hodges played brilliantly Several Klavierstücke. Here we could hear Stockhausen experimenting with sound, consciously pushing the boundaries of what is achievable on the piano, the textures of notes being openly examined, played in sequence, then individually, and held until the decay drifts into silence. Out of this seeming randomness arrives a sense of order and of meaning so that each gesture and each note seems to make perfect sense.\nThere were two a cappella works from 1950. “Choral” from 1950 finds Stockhausen experimenting with the 12-note technique to his own text, one with overt Christian overtones reflecting the composer’s Catholic faith. “Chöre für Doris”, dedicated to Stockhausen’s future wife, sets three poems by Verlaine. Both pieces find Stockhausen at his most accessible. The BBC Singers were on superb form in well-rehearsed performances that made light of the works’ complex use of harmony.\nNicolas Hodges returned for Klavierstück IX, composed in 1955 but held back until 1961. This ten-minute work is something of a shock after the earlier such pieces, Stockhausen pushing his experiments further still, but the music is now much more severe and complex, one passage of abrupt chords quite shattering in its intensity.\n“Litanei 97” – from that year – is in the form of a ritual, lasting some 25 minutes. Reworked from a piece originally commissioned in 1968, “Litanei 97” owes much to the opera-cycle “Licht” in its use of “Intuitive Music” and its extravagant visual input.\nDressed in flowing blue robes, druid-style, the BBC Singers stood in a circle whilst David Hill, similarly attired, conducted the ceremony from within their midst, singing the introduction to each verse and striking a variety of Japanese gongs. After each verse the singers would take a step to the right, halfway through the piece a step to the left, eventually turning 180 degrees to face the audience. There was also some foot-stamping and jumping. The ‘singing’ is set to the composer’s text, explaining his way of communicating his music, how vibrations flow through him to the listener, how he functions like a radio, transmitting these sounds, these currents. If you can imagine how the human voice would try to reproduce the sound of a short-wave radio being tuned, then you have some idea of what “Litanei 97” sounds like.\nWords are twisted, elongated, hissed and distorted (the BBC Singers quite brilliant) creating an effect that is startling and arresting – and for much of the time quite hilarious! Some members of the audience were giggling while others were stony-faced. At the end, the Singers distributed the score or “formula”. Some have pointed to “Litanei 97” as evidence of Stockhausen’s megalomania in his later years; others see it as work which was very much of its time. Judging by this audience’s reaction, it still polarises opinion.\n”Highlights” of this concert to be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on Saturday 24 January from 10.30 p.m. in Hear and Now"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5d73d9c1-a5dc-4e7e-8e6f-ca46b0655c2b>","<urn:uuid:41eb0db6-3b39-4b7f-8405-32bba7e5c5ee>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do paid search marketing and traditional SEO differ in terms of website visibility and cost?","answer":"Paid search marketing and traditional SEO differ in several key aspects. With paid search marketing, companies pay to have their ads displayed when specific keywords are searched, appearing in advertisement boxes on search engines like Google, and they must pay every time a user clicks on their sponsored ads. In contrast, traditional SEO takes a more organic approach where companies optimize their websites through content and HTML coding to rank higher in search results without direct payment for clicks. While paid placement stops when payment stops, companies using traditional SEO may not hit the top spot but can continue to be successful without additional advertising costs. However, both approaches require careful keyword selection and ongoing optimization efforts.","context":["Search Marketing Consultant\nMany businesses will hire a search marketing consultant to plan and execute online marketing campaigns that will increase accessibility and exposure of a website or group of websites. Most entrepreneurs are not experts in how to maximize web presence. They need help developing ad text and landing pages, tracking website performance and using web search engines to attract new customers. Search engine optimization, or SEO, is of the most productive ways to gather quality leads and is vital to the livelihood and success of online campaigns. When used correctly, SEO places a website in front of individuals who are looking for the particular product or service that company offers. Traditional media forms - print, radio and television - place products and services in front of very casual audiences who may or may not be interested in buying at that time. This is not the case for online media. On the Internet, consumers make an effort to seek out a product or service by typing in keywords into online vehicles such as Yahoo or Google. A search marketing consultant can help companies rise above their competitors to get prime space when those results pop up on a consumer's screen.\nSearch engine optimization is more than simply driving a lot of traffic to a website. Proper SEO only attracts individuals who are looking for particular information and want to find websites that provide it. When an individual types in a keyword, he or she receives links to websites in two ways: a list of related links that the search engine has determined fits the criteria of the words provided and links to companies that have paid to have their websites listed when certain keywords are used. Web engines generally scout web pages for repeated words in text and HTML coding to determine the rank of listed results. Paying clients usually submit the specific keywords which will bring up a link to their site. A search marketing consultant knows the technology well enough to provide guidance on both techniques. Clients who choose to pay for top visibility must realize that when payment stops, so does the top placement. Companies that take the more traditional approach may not hit the top spot, but continue to be successful without shoveling money into additional advertising costs. In both cases, keyword selection is vital. Companies and consumers tend to use different language in regard to products and services. Entrepreneurs must be willing to sacrifice industry jargon for the everyday language of the common person.\nA search marketing consultant is an expert in web technology and can develop effective campaigns that are customized for each business. These professionals analyze the existing or proposed website and creates a strategy to optimize the site to meet the business' goals. This analysis includes what keywords people use, which search engines referred them to the site and top exit pages. Consultants use this data to define project benchmarks, develop a plan and follow it through from start to finish. The plan focuses on bringing people specifically interested in the company's products and services to the website. Consultants track visitor traffic through the website to make sure it is performing well. Many search marketing consultant agencies also offer additional services such as pay-per-click management, social media optimization and the creation of landing pages. Realistically, even these professionals cannot guarantee top positions in search engines, but they can help increase and maximize visibility as much as possible. Space in online directories in highly competitive industries are limited and search engine algorithms change often. Professionals are aware of the best techniques to draw specific traffic and know that ranking is not always an indicator of success.\nHiring a search marketing consultant isn't ideal for every situation. Business who can only afford to place a minimal amount of funds to SEO will be limited in who they can hire. Most agencies will only consider companies who are willing to spend tens of thousands of dollars each month in advertising. Long-term goals must also be taken into consideration. Companies that would eventually prefer to hand their own SEO should consider investing in an intense two-week training with a consultant. The initial cost is high, but it could save a lot of money in the long run. \"Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.\" (Psalm 119:66) Other businesses prefer to pay a few extra dollars each month to have a professional handle the promotion for them. Consultants are paid in a variety of ways. The most popular method is by the hour, but many are paid according to the percentage of what clients spend each month or by revenue share based on the amount of profit made.\nPicking the right agency can be one of the best decisions an entrepreneur makes, but choosing the wrong search marketing consultant can spell financial disaster. Services vary from agency to agency. Some deal with only certain aspects of SEO like keywords and ads, while others assist with the entire campaign. Be sure to choose an expert with experience developing campaigns for similar websites. Ask for a list of current or past clients and evaluate their marketing efforts. Meet the actual person or team who will be managing the account. Some agencies are nothing more than sales forces for other agencies that actually do the work. Review the contract thoroughly for fees and cancellation policy. Consult a lawyer if possible.\nEven with the help of a search marketing consultant, it takes a lot of work to remain at the top of search engine rankings. Each account needs constant monitoring and planning. For every company trying to maximize visibility, there are hundreds of other competitors trying to do the same thing. Getting to the top is not the ultimate goal. Continuing the momentum is. Staying at the top involves continually revising content so that it is appropriate and optimized, building targeted links, and enhancing website features so that it continues to bring in the needed customers.\nSearch Marketing CompanyHiring a search marketing company is an effective way to increase sales and profits. But, this service isn't cheap and does come with risks attached. Some companies charge several thousand dollars to provide the service. Essentially, what these providers do is work to increase the number of visitors to a client's online website. Not only that, these providers also attempt to steer more qualified visitors to a client's website. And, more visitors will hopefully equate to more customers and higher profits. Running any business is difficult. Trying to run one solo or with a small inexperienced staff is even more difficult. Sales, marketing, public relations, customer service, and hundreds of other important details require day-to-day attention to keep a business solvent. Many businesses, from small mom and pop operations to large multinational corporations, outsource some of their work. Cyberspace is large and vast. As a result, products, services, and even business can be easily over looked and lost. So, in a sales arena as large and vast as the Internet, acquiring expert help from a search marketing company to increase product visibility makes good business sense. Visibility is everything. Without visibility there are no customers, no sales, no profits, and no business.\nA search marketing company will use several techniques to help increase visibility. And, a market analysis is the first step in developing a strategic marketing plan. Part of the plan will be to enhance an individual or company's reputation and credibility. By examining market trends and key issues the marketing company will be better able to successfully position a person or business for greater visibility. According to results from a keyword search, there are five techniques used by many companies: web development, pay per click management, online media planning, search engine optimization, and reputation management. Arguably, reputation management may be the most crucial task that a search marketing company can take on. But enhancing a businesses' reputation may also be the most difficult. Obviously, the manner in which a business is perceived directly affects sales and profits because reputation is also directly tied to character.\nGenerally speaking, reputations are built over time. Once perceived as unfavorable by the public or community, a person or organization is fighting an uphill and arduous battle to change the opinion. Whether the perception is right or wrong is irrelevant. There are four categories that reputations fall into: excellent, good, bad, and ugly. Excellent and good reputations can be lost rather quickly. But bad and ugly reputations are difficult or impossible to shed. Hiring a search marketing company to manage a reputation may be considered by some people to be stepping slightly into the deceptive side of things. Reputations won't just disappear, but parts can be concealed. Basically, reputation management is nothing more than keeping track of a company's or an individual's actions as well as other people's opinions and reactions to those actions. Now, there are really only two ways of dealing with other people's opinions. The first is to respond to them directly. And, the second is to do nothing and hope they just go away. That's not very realistic nor is it good business.\nSo, the search marketing company has an interesting task because applying a public relations type spin that highlights the positive aspects of a client or business while burying the negative may cross a fine moral or even legal line. If nothing else, burying the negative aspects of company may call into question the trustworthiness of the organization, once they are uncovered. Reprehensible behavior will most certainly be found out. And, once it is, any negative situation will only become worse. Therefore, it is best to keep business practices beyond reproach. The Gospel of Luke is clear on both concealment and trustworthiness: \"For nothing is secret, that will not be made manifest; neither anything hid that shall not be known and come abroad...If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteousness mammom, who will commit to your trust the true riches? And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? (Luke 8: 17; Luke 16: 11-12)\nOnce the reputation issue is under control, a search marketing company may use a tool called search engine optimization (SEO). This technique is used to increase the volume and quality of visitors to a website from the many Internet search engines. The way it works is quite simple and is often used in one form or another in other areas of the business world. For example, some retailers, specifically high-end specialty retailers, will place the higher quality and more expensive products at eye level with the customer. The theory is that the first thing the customer sees he or she will consider buying. Search engines basically do the same thing by ranking websites and assigning them prominent positions. Higher ranking sites will appear first in the search results. Therefore, it would be beneficial for a company's website to appear on top of the first screen that appears to online visitors. Optimizing involves editing a website and reworking the HTML coding to make it more relevant to specific keywords. This can be incorporated directly into a business website design by the search marketing company. Another way to increase visibility and direct potential customers to a website is called pay per click. When a person uses a search engine to find a specific product or service, advertisements will appear on the results page. Advertisers pay for the placement of the ad only when a visitor clicks on it. Basically, online media planning is identifying what parts of the internet a target group uses and then developing a strategy to direct the group to a specific website. Web development is complicated but is self explanatory as to what it is. Research all companies thoroughly before hiring. Contracting with a bad provider can be costly in more ways than ones.","SEM: Keywords Anatomy in Paid Search Marketing\nSearch marketing, also known as search engine marketing (SEM), is a form of online marketing strategy that promotes websites by increasing their rankings and visibility on search engines such as— Google, Yahoo, or Bing.\nSearch marketing employs both paid and unpaid (organic) tactics to help Internet users find the right website among millions.\nIn case of paid search marketing, the most common and prevalent type is the Pay-Per-Click (PPC) or Pay-Per-Action (PPA).\nPaid search marketing includes PPC (pay-per-click) listings, contextual advertisements, and paid inclusions. Pay-per-click advertising is based on keywords.\nPPC results show up in advertisement boxes on Google. Companies pay to be represented by specific keywords, and are bound to pay the advertiser every time a user clicks on their sponsored ads.\nFor example, Google's Adword will display your ad at the top or right side of the search results page (placement depends on a number of factors including keywords and quality of ad).\nThere are other types of PPC marketing, such as Facebook Ads. Paid search differs in that your goal is to have your website or offer displayed higher in search results.\nThe first step in paid search marketing is keyword research. In paid search, bidding on the wrong keywords can be disastrously costly. You could use specialized keyword tools to eradicate the chances of failure.\nHere are a few things to keep in mind when building your paid search keyword list—\n1) Emphasize on using negative keywords\nNegative keywords enable you to filter out search terms that aren’t relevant to your products and services, so your ads won’t show up for those irrelevant searches. In the long run, this can save you a lot of money for you.\n2) Don’t go too broad\nPay special attention to the long tail of search—that is, the longer, less frequent keyword phrases that actually add up to a greater volume of visits than the few most common keywords.\nLong-tail keywords tend to show a high degree of intent, so they can be excellent prospect for your paid search campaigns.\nFor example, it's a good bet that someone who searches on \"organic tomato seeds free shipping\" is later in the buying cycle than someone who searches on \"tomato seeds\" alone.\n3) Always remain relevant\nAnother useful tip is to make sure your keywords match the text of the landing pages you’re linking to.\nGoogle keeps a close eye on that sort of accuracy and keeps the least accurate/relevant or dishonest marketers from earning links to their services under the head of the ads reading “increase returns on stock investment” or popular feeds or celebrity gossips.\n4) Include variations and synonyms\nSearch engines can make connections between related terms such as, realizing that \"sport shoes\" and \"running shoes\" are the same product, but not always, so it's best to include them. Include short forms, abbreviations and even plurals.\n5) Expand and refine your keywords list with tools\nHaving a decent list of terms to bid on, the next step is to use the keyword research tools at your disposal to determine which keywords to keep, and which to drop.\nKeyword tools help you reach to the terms that people are actually typing into search engines. Most popular of these tools are Google AdWords and WordStream.\nTherefore, keyword strategies are essential to develop successful search engine marketing campaigns. Your keyword strategy should involve selecting high-performing keywords that drive relevant traffic to your business.\nChoosing the right keywords for advertising can determine how well your advertisements will rank on Google and other search engine platforms.\nOnce you know the keywords you want to bid on, the next step in your keyword strategy involves crafting text ads that incorporate your keywords.\nWhen visitors click on your ads in the Search Engine Results Page (SERP), you pay the amount that you've bid on the keyword.\nThis process is what exactly known as pay-per-click (PPC) advertising. The amount you’ll spend with your keyword bidding strategy when you advertise on Google is determined by how competitive your keywords are.\nThe secret to successful keyword bidding strategies is discovering your favorable spot of less competitive and therefore less expensive but highly relevant keywords through keyword research."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:16d5c837-ccec-41d3-b3bd-46db1015c3a6>","<urn:uuid:0eb9e361-bc51-4322-b053-5da962992763>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you explain how Google Analytics segments visitor data for analysis and what privacy protections are required under GDPR for this segmented data?","answer":"Google Analytics allows powerful segmentation of visitor data through behavior segments based on characteristics like date of first visit, frequency of visits, and transaction patterns. Users can be segmented by browsing habits and traffic sources, with the ability to create up to 1000 segments per view. Custom dimensions can also be created to measure unique characteristics. Regarding GDPR compliance, all this segmented data collection requires specific privacy protections. Organizations must have a comprehensive understanding of what data they collect, how it's stored and used. They must be able to expose or remove data upon request, and obtain valid consent through affirmative action for both existing and new users. Additionally, any data breaches involving identifiable personal data must be reported to relevant authorities within 72 hours.","context":["What You Need to Know About Google Analytics\nGoogle Analytics provides a lot of data when it comes to visitor behavior analysis. These statistics include bounce rate, the percentage of visitors who view only one page, sessions (a group of interactions during a 30-minute window), pages per session, goal completions, and conversions. Get started now to learn more about all the data that is available through this program. Here are some ways to understand these reports. These metrics can also be used to increase your company’s profitability.\nUnderstanding some metrics is key to understanding how visitors interact with your site. The average time spent on each page is one metric that you can use to improve your website’s performance. Another is the session quality metric, which shows how many pages are viewed in a single session. The session quality metric can also help you identify which channels are struggling with engagement. The conversion rate is also an important metric for web analytics. The conversion rate measures how many visitors complete the desired actions, like signing up for your newsletter or making a purchase.\nA high number of pageviews indicates that users are not engaging with your website. The average number of pageviews may indicate that a website is not appealing to the masses. The average session length may not reflect user engagement. It is therefore not possible to use this as a key performance indicator.\nBesides the above-mentioned KPIs, Google Analytics provides an excellent overview of how people are using your website. In addition to that, it also provides information on how visitors find specific products or pages. You can create the website you want to attract the best traffic by understanding what visitors are searching for. Analytics can be used to enhance your email marketing campaigns, paid advertising, and social media campaigns. This way, you can improve the quality of your advertising campaigns and ultimately make more sales.\nMetrics of Google Analytics also tell you how much traffic your website is receiving. You can get traffic from search engines or direct sources. The source of the traffic is not always easy to determine, so it’s important to understand where your website visitors are coming from. You can choose to display this information in the Behavior report and the Source of the traffic in the Audience report. If you want to learn how to make improvements in the customer experience, you can customize the content and design to make it more relevant to those countries.\nThe dimensions in Google Analytics refer to different levels of organization. At the highest level, a user can have multiple Sessions, and one Session can have multiple Hits. Google Dimensions also include User Types and New Sessions. E-Commerce Analysis can use the product-level scope to identify which metrics are important to a particular product. This reporting can also be used to compare user behaviour across segments. The more detail you can get, the better it will be.\nGoogle Analytics offers many options for combining the different dimensions. Google Analytics offers standard measurements but you have the option to create customized descriptions that measure your unique characteristics. You can use the Sessions metric to combine with hit-level dimension data in order to determine which keywords led you to phone calls. You can also combine dimensions and metrics to collect information about your website’s time-of-day usage and logged-in users. You can import non-Google Analytics data into Google Analytics.\nYou can set custom dimensions or hit them. Custom dimensions are not visible in GA4 reports until they have been registered. The implementation process for custom dimensions involves sending the data to GA4 and registering the parameter. It may take up to 24 hours for the data to show in reports. A custom dimension can take up to 24 hours to appear in the reports, so it’s best to wait for at least a day or two before implementing it.\nYou can view qualitative data when you use Google Analytics dimensions. If you’re an ecommerce merchant you might be able to use the dimension values landing page to find out which pages are popular with new customers. You can also use the dimension values landing page if your business is an ecommerce retailer to see how well your products are performing. You can view metrics to measure the rank of your products on various pages, in addition to analysing how they perform within each category.\nGoogle Analytics has powerful tools that allow you to separate data sets to analyse and compare. Filters can be applied to all data. They may include metrics like Returning Users and Bounced Session, as well as dimensions such Converts. You can compare data and analyse it in greater detail. Segments can also be used for many years, even after they are deleted. Here are some of the benefits of segments:\nSegmenting users based on their behavior is possible with the behavior segment. The date of the first visit, the number of visits, and the frequency can all be used to target certain audiences. Users can be segmented based on their browsing habits and behaviors, as well as transactions. These characteristics can also be used to create customized segments. To narrow your search to specific users, you can use the source traffic option. UTM parameter tags can be used to further segment users by source.\nYou can create user-based segments that allow you to choose the dates your visitors will be able to visit your website. The date ranges typically span between 93 and 96 days. A single view can have up to 1000 segments. For user-based segments, the default range of dates is 93 days. If a user has more than 1000 sessions in the window, it will be treated as bot traffic. You can then see what pages are most popular.\nYou can use Google Analytics to create customized segments and metrics when you analyze the data. Google Analytics has a variety of pre-defined and default system segments. Before creating your own, make sure to look through the list of available segments. It is easier to compare results when you have custom segments. You can also analyze the data within them. In the end, you’ll know which ones are most profitable for you. So go ahead and make use of Google Analytics!\nID of the user\nThe User ID feature allows you to monitor your customer’s behavior and track the various stages in their journey. It is important to note that User IDs only work when the user logs into your website. Without this feature, you won’t be able to track anonymous users. You can also use it in conjunction with other identifiers like email addresses. The User ID can be used to link sessions with Google Analytics if your site collects email addresses.\nTo get started, you will first need to enable the User ID feature in your Google Analytics account. You can enable this feature on any website that provides login functionality or social media platforms. This feature should be enabled before you set up Google Analytics. After activating the feature you need to embed the tracking code on your site and then send IDs from Google Analytics. To get started, follow the steps outlined below.\nA Google Analytics User ID is a unique combination of alphanumeric characters that identifies a website user. This feature can identify a single user across different devices and browsers, making it easier to measure and track the behavior of specific people. You can also associate several sessions with the same person across different devices. This is especially helpful for cross-device measurement. It also helps to fix attribution problems. You may want to set up a Google Analytics UserID for your app or website if you are a business owner.\nA User-ID, which is an identifier that enables you to track users’ experience, is a crucial part of user tracking. No matter how many users visit your site, it is important to understand their behaviour in comparison with a non-logged in user. This feature allows you to track each user individually and see what makes them tick. The user ID can be used to track users’ activity on a different device. You can integrate the user ID feature in your analytics account.\nOne way to measure customer retention is to look at how long a person spends on your website. By looking at time spent on your website, you can determine whether you’re building a customer base or simply keeping your current customers happy. Other metrics you should consider include average order value, negative testimonials, and direct or indirect communication with your customers. Google Analytics can help you understand how long your users stay on your website. Read on for more information.\nThe data retention period you set in Google Analytics is entirely up to you. You can use user data to create custom reports and apply segments to reports. You should remember that advanced features such as custom reporting or creating unique reports require the event and user data. You’ll have to delete data in the next month if you reduce your retention period. So if you’re looking to measure the value of your audience, consider changing the retention period to one month or three months.\nThe cohort chart is the best way to measure user retention. If 100 people go to your site on September 9, then two of them will come back on September 16, and 10 on September 10. This will show you how often people return to your website and how many users have been added. You can track how many people visit your site through organic and paid search to determine their duration. Google Analytics can help you determine how many of those visitors are returning.\nAnother useful tool is the cohort analysis. A group of users who share a similar characteristic is called a cohort. A cohort will include users with the same acquisition date (ACD), as well as new users. You can use cohort analysis to determine how many customers return after a period of two or eight days. This type of analysis can be very useful for B2B organizations and industries where long-term engagement is a must.","What is the General Data Protection Regulation?\nIn legal terms, the GDPR is a European Union law intended to strengthen and unify data protection rules and rights for the benefit of EU citizens. Put in other words, to give control of personal data back to the user. While great news for individuals, it presents complex problems for companies.\nThe new rules apply to all organizations (of any size) that provide goods and services to the EU or that utilize tracking technologies (like cookies or tracking pixels) to monitor EU users’ behavior.\nWhile simple in theory, the law is dense and complex and requires a comprehensive understanding of the data you collect, whether it's personal or not, how you store and use it, and how you expose or remove data upon request. To do so, you must look at every single process and line of software code to outline your data processes.\nIn most cases, your data collection will require valid consent following May 25 - not just going forward, but also from all your existing users. Under the GDPR, consent can't be implied or inferred from someone's actions. Instead, valid consent must be specific to the data being collected, by an affirmative action that is unambiguous.\nLearn more about the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n1.

{"question":"I'm planning my shade garden. Could you tell me how to properly plant and maintain Hostas, and what deer deterrent methods would work best to protect them since I heard they love eating these plants?","answer":"Hostas should be planted in full shade to part shade with rich moist organic soil. To plant, dig a hole large enough for the root ball, place the plant level with surrounding soil, water thoroughly and apply 1-2 inches of mulch. For maintenance, keep soil evenly moist, control weeds, and divide plants every 3-5 years when overcrowded. Since Hostas are indeed attractive to deer, you'll need robust protection. The most effective deterrent is an 8-foot-tall plastic-net deer fencing. You can also try commercial repellent sprays, blood meal, or garlic spray, though these may become less effective when deer are very hungry. Placing containers on elevated porches or decks, away from railings, can also help keep plants out of deer's reach.","context":["Hosta, First Frost\n2010 Hosta of the Year\nZone This refers to the USDA hardiness zone assigned to each part of the country, based on the minimum winter temperature that a region typically experiences.

Hostas prefer afternoon shade and protection from strong winds.\n- Prepare the bed by turning the soil under to a depth of 6-12, inches removing any debris, and lightly raking as level as possible.\n- The addition of organic matter (leaf mold, compost, well-rotted manure) benefits all gardens and is essential in recently constructed neighborhoods.\n- Plant on a cloudy day or in late afternoon to reduce transplant shock.\n- Dig a hole for each plant large enough to amply accommodate the root ball.\n- Unpot the plant and gently loosen the root ball with your hands to encourage good root growth.\n- Place the top of the root ball even with the level of the surrounding soil. Fill with soil to the top of the root ball. Press soil down firmly with your hand.\n- Use the plant tag as a location marker.\n- Thoroughly water and apply a light mulch layer on top of the soil (1-2 inches) to conserve water and reduce weeds.\n- Keep weeds under control during the growing season. Weeds compete with plants for water, space and nutrients, so control them by either cultivating often or use a mulch to prevent their germination.\n- Mulches also help retain soil moisture and maintain even soil temperatures. For perennials, an organic mulch of aged bark or shredded leaves lends a natural look to the bed and will improve the soil as it breaks down in time. Always keep mulches off a plant’s stems to prevent possible rot.\n- Careful watering is essential in getting perennials off to a good start. Water enough to keep the soil evenly moist. Plants are remarkable drought resistant.\n- Good air movement is also important.\n- After new growth appears, a light fertilizer may be applied. Keep granular fertilizers away from the plant crown and foliage to avoid burn injury. Use low rates of a slow release fertilizer, as higher rates may encourage root rots.\n- Some people remove the flower stalks as the plant is grown primarily for the foliage. If you do keep the flowers, cut the stalks after flowers fade unless you would like them to self-sow.\n- In colder regions, apply another layer of mulch (1-2 inches) after the ground freezes in fall. Evergreen boughs (from Christmas trees) provide additional protection. Remove this mulch in the spring.\n- Divide when plants become overcrowded, every 3-5 years. In general, divide in spring or fall when plants are dormant. Dig clumps from the ground and with a sharp knife or spade, cut into good sized divisions, each with several growing eyes and plenty of roots. Remove any dead or unhealthy plant parts and cut back stems. Replant one division where the plant was originally and plant the extra divisions elsewhere in your garden or give them away to gardening friends. Plant the divisions immediately, or as soon as possible, and water well.\n- Hostas are extremely tough and low maintenance as long as they are in the proper environment.\n- Hostas combine nicely with most shade loving plants. Plant with bleeding hearts, hellebores, heucheras and epimediums. Plant daffodils and other hardy spring bulbs around hosta clumps; as the hosta foliage emerges it will hide the ripening bulb foliage. They also make a great ground cover or specimen plant.\n- Hosta foliage makes an attractive addition to fresh flower arrangements.","Tips for Deer Resistant Plants and Deer Deterrents\nEvery editorial product is independently selected, though we may be compensated or receive an affiliate commission if you buy something through our links.

Plus, find deer-resistant plants to grow.\nCourtesy Lori Grant / Country magazine\nTips to Deer-Proof Your Garden\nDeer have gone to extremes. They’ve made themselves at home in suburbia and even in towns. Their numbers are up—and so is the level of damage to gardens. Haircut sweepings are no longer effective, because today’s deer are accustomed to the human scent. Even stinky sprays, homemade or commercial, may not work. Hanging wind chimes or foil pie plates in hopes of scaring them away? Bambi and his pals will only laugh. Instead, consult lists of the most deer resistant plants, and avoid or remove plants that attract deer, such as tulips, pansies, hostas, arborvitae and yew. There’s no sense in actively tempting deer to visit your yard!\nBut don’t be tricked into a false sense of security. “No plant is truly deer-proof,” says Brooke Maslo, an assistant extension specialist in wildlife ecology at Rutgers University. When deer are hungry, especially in fall and winter, any plant in your yard may become dinner. Contact your local extension office for a list of what deer do and don’t find appealing.\nCheck out the best deer resistant bulbs for spring blooms.\nCourtesy Kathy Diamontopoulos / Country magazine\nTry Deer Deterrents\nDeterrents are worth a try, and are best used before pests are a problem. At the low end of cost and effort, hang bars of strong-scented soap or use homemade garlic spray. Apply blood meal or deer repellent granules around plants, or spray them with commercial products to make them smell and taste bad. The measures may also deter rabbits, another common backyard pest. Motion-activated water sprays, lights and other gadgets are worth a try, too. Know that what works in one garden may not work in another. And when food gets scarce, all bets are off. Another solution is planting just out of reach. Plant flowers and veggies in containers on a porch or deck, away from deer and rabbits. Keep pots away from railings and steps, as deer stand on their hind feet to browse.\nAn energetic, barking dog is also a fantastic ally. “Since my dog passed away, the deer readily hop the yard fence to clear out my bird feeders,” reports Brooke, ruefully. “And on some mornings, I have a doe asleep in the yard.” Psst—pet owners should avoid these plants that aren’t safe for dogs.\nThe only real way to avoid deer altogether is an 8-foot-tall fence of plastic-net deer fencing around your vegetable garden or yard. “The best advice I can give is to support deer management efforts on a larger scale,” says Brooke. “Reducing local populations alleviates landscape damage more effectively than any backyard-scale attempt.” Until fertility control or special hunting regulations prove successful, be ready to go on the defensive—and take comfort in knowing you’re not alone.\nProblems with squirrels? Check out the best squirrel-proof bird feeders.\nUltrasonic Deer Repeller\n“Is there any data to prove that ultrasonic deer repellents are actually effective?” asks Gordon Kauffman of Camp Hill, Pennsylvania.\nYou are right to be skeptical,” writes garden expert Melinda Myers. “According to the University of Vermont, these ultrasonic devices are marketed to repel deer by emitting sounds above 20 kilohertz—which animals, but not humans, are supposed to be able to hear. Research found that deer hear at a different wavelength than that emitted by the ultrasonic repellent, so these products have not been proved to be effective at discouraging them.”\nDeer-Resistant Plants to Grow\nEven foraging Bambis might turn up their noses at these plants.\nPaeonia lactiflora, Zones 3 to 8\nYou’ll eat up the showy, fragrant blooms of this classic beauty, but deer and rabbits won’t.

The inspiration behind its construction and the architect is considered to be the great Ictinus. This universal architectural gem was the first of the great monuments of Greece to be recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1986. The temple can be approached from Ilia, after an enchanting journey along the banks of the river Neda, or from Tripoli and Megalopolis.\nVasses (ancient Bassae) was always a sacred place, host to numerous temples. The region’s name means \"little valleys\". And indeed, the mountainous Peloponnesian land creates a magical landscape and within it rises the imposing site of the temple. The mountains of Kotylio, Lykaio, Tetrazio and Elaio stand guard around the valley of Vasses. All the gods of antiquity - Pan, Aphrodite, Artemis, and of course, Apollo, as both ‘Vassitas’ and ‘Epicurius’, that is, “the helper” - were worshipped in this natural sanctuary, and it was here that one of the greatest religious centres of the entire of Hellenic world was to be erected.\nPower, Beauty and Harmony\nThe temple in its current form was built between 420 and 400 BC. Archaeologists are convinced that under its foundations lies an even more ancient temple, probably from the seventh century BC. This “new” temple, a unique monument to the skills of its architect, Ictinus, embodies in its structure the entire wealth of architectural knowledge of Greek civilization. With both archaic and innovatory elements, it has been greatly admired by all visiting travellers through the centuries. Pausanias, the great traveller and geographer, who arrived in Vasses in the 2nd century AD, was stunned by its majesty and strength. It is speculated that the central column of the temple was designed to reflect the first rays of the summer solstice, symbolizing the eternal light of the sun god, Apollo. If this is true, then this is the first large scale sculptural work of art in the history of mankind to represent an abstract concept.\nWhen man created the divine\nIctinus made an extensive study of the surrounding area when he undertook the building of the temple. He preferred to use grey limestone for construction, which is endemic to the site. This choice had the result of making the temple appear as a natural element of its surrounding environment, standing proud and eternal. The proportions of length and width are such that the enormous size of the temple is balanced by the grace it exudes. Light itself is used by the great artist as one of the building blocks of the temple. The play of light and shadow creates the illusion that the temple is smaller than its actual size, revealing its true dimensions to the observer only gradually as they draw near. In this way the monument does not force or impose its volume on the space, but exudes power and inspires awe when one is close to it. At the same time, it creates an evolving relationship with the god himself, Apollo, with light being the main element in this gradual revelation.\nThe outer elements of the temple are strictly of Doric order. Inside the temple the sculptural compositions and architectural ornamentation display exquisite artistry and beauty. The central column, which presides over the temple, is Corinthian and its capital is the oldest surviving example of the order. The monumental temple frieze, of great historical and artistic value, which depicts Hercules, the Centaurs and the Amazons, is today to be found in the British Museum.\nThe temple was in use throughout the Hellenistic and Roman periods. In 1765, guided by the writings of Pausanias, the French architect Joachim Bocher was able to identify certain finds as coming from the great Temple of Apollo. The first systematic excavations were started in 1812 by a group of eminent European archaeologists. They were continued in 1902 by the Archaeological Society of Athens, under the supervision of the archaeologists Constantinos Kourouniotis, Constantinos Romaios and Panagiotis Kavvadias. Thus, this brilliant achievement of Greek civilization was given back to humanity once again in all its glory."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:94d726b2-7902-4208-9de3-e6dd2c2b8e14>","<urn:uuid:42cc3a02-6529-484e-b567-db10902a3ec8>"],"error":null}

For keeping warm during the colder months, it is important to include a chimney.\nEarthbag Home Construction Timelapse Videos\nThis video (viewed more than 3.5 million times!) shows the construction of an earthbag home in Fairbanks, Alaska. The video shows the first bags being laid over a gravel foundation. The first three layers of bags are filled with gravel for extra drainage. The two-person construction team runs barbed wire along the bags to hold them in place. After each layer is laid, they tamp down the bags. The video shows the team putting in place a door frame, cutouts for electrical outlets, and windows. (Though they note in the video the doors and windows should have been done differently!) The final step shows them building a frame for a second floor, and has photos of them living in the half-finished home. In the description, the guy who filmed the video says they never actually finished the house! (But they’re working on it.)\nThis time-lapse video from Happen Films shows a team of people building a small, circular earthbag shelter. The team uses six-foot-long sandbags for the foundation, filling them with sand as they lay them down. Long sandbags can provide more stability than short bags. The bags are laid on dirt, within a pit, over a plastic tarp. Meanwhile, another group frames and windows for the shelter. As it’s a circular house, they build a circular roof, with trusses rising up from the top of the walls and meeting at a peak. The team packs mud into the gaps between the sandbags and completely covers both then interior and exterior walls. Then, they finish with a coat of adobe. They lay pre-cut plywood in the gaps formed by the roof trusses, nailing them to the trusses themselves. The roof is completed with a chimney and metal sheeting.\nThis is time-lapse (sort-of). The family that runs the channel “mylittlehomestead” bought a huge plot of land, and decided to build earthbag bedrooms for each of their four teenagers. The kids design the homes and their friends help with the construction (along with the rest of the family). This video—it’s 87 minutes long—shows everything from laying out the sandbags, to installing the electrical, the window frames, building the roof, all the way to setting up the solar panel array.\nThe Best Earthbag Home Books\nEarthbag Building: The Tools, Tricks and Techniques by Kaki Hunter and Donald Kiffmeyer.\nEarthbag Architecture: Building Your Dream with Bags by Kelly Hart (Forward by Owen Geiger).\nBuilding With Earth: A Guide to Flexible-Form Earthbag Construction by Paulina Wojciechowska\nEarthbag Home Plans\nEarthbag Home Resources\n- Great ‘how to’ resource here: buildsimple.org/earthbag.php\n- Books, Supplies, Links, Lots of Info: earthbaghouse.com\n- Cal-Earth focuses on researching, developing and teaching the technologies of Superadobe.

Combined with good quality control, they can create buildings strong enough to survive hurricanes and resist earthquake damage. Good quality construction includes:\nplumb and level walls\nappropriate building dimensions\nand maintenance of exterior plaster layers and roofs\nEngineers or expert earthbag builders may be able to make specific recommendations better suited to your site and building. This information is intended for small single story houses built of 38 cm (15\") wide walls of 50# bags filled with an earth mix containing some clay.\nEarthbag is very strong in compression (carrying loads) but can benefit from additional reinforcing in key locations, including corners, to resist lateral movement.\nMesh can help earthbag walls resist wind loads and earthquake forces. With a thick plaster coating this can become a reinforced shell.\nMesh can be wrapped from below the lowest bag to over the bond beam on both sides. Use poly fishnet, galvanized chicken wire, or plasterer's lathing. Conventional plastic plaster mesh (rust proof) or galvanized plaster mesh can be used if budget allows. Use nylon or poly twine to tie from one side to the other between bag layers.\nAll earthbag walls should be tied together vertically at least every 24 ?. Nylon strapping, the kind used to secure loads on shipping pallets, makes an excellent tie down. Wrap over the bond beam and under the wall and then cinch down with special tool and fasteners. All fasteners must be strong poly or nylon cord or strapping or galvanized metal, and protected with an earth or cement plaster.\nBecause earthbag is also a flexible form rammed earth, walls can be a little bit soft or flexible until they harden and cure. This process usually takes a couple of weeks if a wall is covered from rain. Temporary bracing can be used during construction. Some of these reinforcement techniques will also add stiffness during the building process.\nCorners can be strengthened with metal, by overlapping or extending them, or by curving them. Walls can be stiffened by corrugated metal bracing, piers, buttresses, or by curving or jogging them.\nAll rebar should be at least #4 (1/2\") diameter.\nREBAR CORNER REINFORCEMENT\nBarre/ Rebar: When walls reach 1.5 m (60\") height, hammer a 1.5m (5') long piece of rebar through the corner bags.\nSac/ Bag: Always alternate bags at corners and stagger joints for strength.\nAs high as possible on the finished wall, hammer a second rebar of the same length in. It will overlap the first.\nThis is the simplest way to strengthen corners of earthbag buildings.\nMESH CORNER REINFORCEMENT\nMaterials: Sturdy mesh of galvanized metal or plastic, bamboo strips or steel angle or pipe or tubular steel, twine or cord\nLatte/ Mesh: Place a 1m (39\") wide strip of sturdy mesh on the outside of the corner from top to bottom.\nCord/ Twine: Fasten the exterior mesh securely to the inside corner at every other course.\nVertical/ Vertical rod: Use metal or bamboo rod or additional mesh placed on the interior corner.\nSac/ Bag: Alternate earth-filled bags at corner.\nBamboo is very strong and flexible for reinforcing cement or earth construction. It can be either well encased in earth or left uncovered for inspection. Termites are very persistent. In hot regions they may be able to tunnel through earth floors. Bamboo (or wood) should be covered with thick earthen plaster that contains something like borax to deter termites if it is not left uncovered inside so that it can be checked and replaced if damaged.\nCORRUGATED METAL CORNER REINFORCEMENT\nMaterials: Corrugated metal roofing, rebar, nails, strapping or twine\nBarre/ Rebar: Drive 60 cm (24\") long rebar through corrugated metal strip at the corner to tie the reinforcement to the wall below. Repeat rebars at ends of metal strip or every 60 cm (24\").\nBande/ Strip: Cut pieces of corrugated metal roofing into strips 20- 30 cm (8- 12\") wide and at least 75 cm (30\") long. Overlap at corners and nail them into the bag below.\nSangle/ Strap: Use strong cord or mesh with wire or strapping every 60 cm (24\") to secure three layers of bags tightly around the metal.\nSac/ Bag: Stagger joints of earth-filled bags and alternate at corners.\nThis corner reinforcement stiffens and strengthens as well as unites walls if repeated every 5 bag courses.\nGalvanized metal lasts well when exposed to rain and damp air. But if metal is well incased in dry earth in a roofed building, and has been firmly tamped, it does not need to be galvanized.\nMaterials: Extra bags and barbed wire\nButtresses strengthen corners without rebar, and stiffen straight walls. Straight walls need a buttress or pier, intersecting interior wall, or a minor corner every 3- 3.5 m (10'- 11'). They also make it easier to add on earthbags to extend houses in the future.\nButtresses can be straight, sloping, or stepped. Benches or wider wall bases will also strengthen straight walls if the bags are well woven into the wall.\nA vertical-edged buttress must stick out from the wall at least 60 cm (24\"), and a sloping or stepped buttress 75 cm (30\").\nabove: First Course\nFil de fer/ Wire: Lay barbed wire between each course. Loop wire from one wall into buttresses and out the other wall.\nSac/ Bag: Extend one wall out into the buttress.\nLeft: Fourth Course\nMur / Wall: Stagger bag joints on all walls.\nContrefort/ Buttress: Criss-cross bag courses at buttressed corners every course to fasten it into the wall.\nWhen plastering, clay-rich earth can be added to create curves or add decorations.\nMaterials: Extra bags and barbed wire\nA pier is usually a thickened wall section. It only projects out from the wall the width of a single bag.\nCriss-cross the bag courses to tie the pier well into the wall.\nLay barbed wire between layers so that it loops from the wall out into the pier and back into the wall.\nSee Your Ad"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d4d79a73-898b-4219-ac5f-b825cebc0cea>","<urn:uuid:a4746ac1-787e-460d-9790-6103dbea5261>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between the ceremonial processions in the Resurrection feast and the Feast of Booths?","answer":"In the Resurrection feast, the ceremonial processions involve priests and deacons proceeding around the altar three times, then around the nave three times, and finally around the altar once more, while chanting Resurrection hymns. For the Feast of Booths, the ceremony involves taking foliage of beautiful trees, palm branches, boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook, with people living in booths for seven days as a remembrance of how the Israelites lived when brought out from Egypt. The processions serve different commemorative purposes and use different ceremonial elements.","context":["The Lord of glory rose from the dead by Himself on Sunday of the Resurrection, after He died on Friday, the Friday of the Crucifixion, on the wood of the Holy Cross. He rose for us, just as He died for us, so that we may obtain the blessings of the resurrection and the strength to defeat sin. For by the death of Christ we put away our old self and buried it with Christ, and by His resurrection from the dead, we clothed ourselves with the new man, which has the power to live with Christ once more. The hymns of the Feast of the Resurrection reflect the joy of the Church for the resurrection of the Lord of glory from among the dead, for the Divine Liturgy is prayed in a joyful tune, and the rite witnesses the joy of the Church because it received the blessings of the Resurrection.\nIn the Prime Raising of Incense after the Prayer of Thanksgiving, the verses Tenouwst are chanted followed by the Verses of the Cymbals for the Resurrection, which are chanted in a joyous tune. Then, the Litany of the Sick is prayed, followed by the hymn of the Seven Way, which begins with the verse Piouwini until the end of the verse qen han’almoc . The remaining verses are continued in a recitative tune, which is concluded by the Adam Theotokias and the hymn `Pouro . After that, the Litany of the Oblations is prayed, followed by the Doxologies, which begins with the Doxology of the Resurrection, and they are all chanted in a joyful tune. Then, some spiritual songs for the Feast of the Resurrection are chanted, followed by the Conclusion of the Doxologies. After efnoti nai nan , the congregation responds with kieryalayson three times in the melismatic tune. The Litany of the Gospel is prayed, and the Psalm is read in a joyful tune, followed by the Psalm Response. The Gospel is read and the Gospel Response specifically for the feast is chanted. The prayer concludes with the Concluding Canon of the Prime Prayer for the Feast of the glorious Resurrection. It is important to notice that the Vespers Raising of Incense is not prayed, and the reason for that is because the Divine Liturgy of Bright Saturday was completed before Vespers immediately.\nAs for the rite of the Divine Liturgy of the Feast of the Resurrection, the Lamb is offered without the prayers of the Agpeya, but an procession is made with the hymn Epouro , and during the offering of the Lamb the Offering’s Alleluia hymn (Alle-el-qorban) is chanted. After the Servantís Absolution, the hymn Tai soury is chanted, followed by the Hiten , which is organized in the following way: the first is for the Virgin Lady; the second is for the Archangel Michael, which is specifically for the Feast of the Resurrection; the third is for the seven Archangels; the fourth is for the Apostles and Disciples; the fifth is for Saint Mark; the sixth is for Joseph, Nicodemus, and Mary Magdalene, which is also specifically for the Feast of the Resurrection; then the rest of the verses are chanted, beginning with Saint George, up to the end, as usual. The Pauline is chanted in the joyous tune, and after the Catholic Epistle, the Praxis Response specifically for the feast is chanted. The Praxis is read, but theSynexarium is not read, as the whole focus of the Church during the feast and the following Holy Fifty Days is on the resurrection of the Lord of glory from among the dead, rather than on any other saint or martyr. Then, the melismatic hymn, Katanikhoros , is chanted, and it is also called the higab (veil) because it is chanted beside the altar while the veil is closed. Since this hymn is long, it is possible to chant its last part, which is O Nim Nai . Then the anthem, “ya kol al-sefoof” is chanted. After that, the lights are turned off and the Resurrection Play is enacted. The veil of the altar is opened and the lights are turned on, as a sign of the Resurrection of the Lord of Glory from among the dead. The priests and the deacons proceed around the altar three times, then they proceed around the nave three times, and then they return to proceed around the altar once. All of this is done while they chant the hymns of the Resurrection Procession. Later, they chant the mohayar hymn of Pachois, followed by the Trisagion in a joyful tune, and then the Gospel Litany. The Psalm is read out in the melismatic Singary tune, then the Psalm Response is chanted. The Gospel is read, which is followed by the exposition pioni chanted in the fe’lla exposition tune. After the sermon, the Gospel Response specifically for the feast is chanted. The Divine Liturgy continues normally, including what is necessary for the feast, such as the Adam Espasmos and Watos Espasmos. During communion, Psalm 150 is chanted in a joyful tune, and after it the hymn Katanikhoros is chanted, followed by any spiritual songs for the Feast of the Resurrection. At the end, the Concluding Canon for the Feast of the Resurrection is chanted.\nAs for the period between the second day of the feast to the thirty-ninth day of the feast, its rite is as follows: During the Vespers and Prime Raising of Incense, the Verses of the Cymbals are chanted in a joyful tune, and it begins with the verses specifically for the Feast of the Resurrection. The Doxologies are also chanted in a joyful tune, and it begins with the Doxology of the Feast of the Resurrection. The Psalm and Gospel Responses are those of the feast as well, and the Concluding Canon of prayer is the same as that chanted on the Feast of the Resurrection. As for the rite of the Divine Liturgy, the Agpeya prayers of the Third and Sixth Hours are prayed. Then, the Lamb is offered, and the Liturgy continues as in the Feast of the Resurrection, except that the Resurrection Play is not enacted, since the rite of the Resurrection Play is only for the night of the Feast of the glorious Resurrection.\nMay the blessings of these holy days be with us all. Amen.\nMikhail, Deacon Albair Gamal, The Essentials in the Deacon’s Service, (Shobra, Egypt: Shikolani, 2002), p.706, 707. Translated from Arabic by Bishoy K. R.

{"question":"What are the key principles of structuralism in psychology, and how do modern neuroscience findings support its approach to visual processing?","answer":"Structuralism, developed by Wilhelm Wundt, attempted to break down conscious mental life into fundamental elements that form more complex mental structures. While initially abandoned because it couldn't be tested behaviorally, modern brain-scanning technology has validated some of its principles, particularly in visual processing. For instance, specialized brain cells have been identified that respond exclusively to basic lines and shapes, which are then combined in subsequent brain areas to form more complex visual structures. The early visual processing center V1 identifies simple forms like vertical and horizontal edges, while downstream areas combine these basic elements into more complex visual patterns - supporting Wundt's original hypothesis about mental elements combining into more complex structures.","context":["Introduction to Psychology/Introduction< Introduction to Psychology\nPsychology is the scientific study of behavior, cognition, and emotion.\nPsychology is an academic and applied discipline involving the scientific study of mental processes and behavior. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including relating to individuals' daily lives and the treatment of mental illness.\nPsychology differs from the other social sciences — anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology — in that psychology seeks to explain the mental processes and behavior of individuals. Whereas biology and neuroscience study the biological or neural processes and how they relate to the mental effects they subjectively produce, psychology is primarily concerned with the interaction of mental processes and behavior on a systemic level. The subfield of neuropsychology studies the actual neural processes while biological psychology studies the biological bases of behavior and mental states.\nPsychology is an academic and applied field involving the study of behavior, mind and thought and the subconscious neurological bases of behavior. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including problems of individuals' daily lives and the treatment of mental illness. It is largely concerned with humans, although the behavior and mental processes of animals can also be part of psychology research, either as a subject in its own right (e.g. animal cognition and ethology), or somewhat more controversially, as a way of gaining an insight into human psychology by means of comparison (including comparative psychology). Psychology is commonly defined as the science of behavior and mental processes.\nPsychology does not necessarily refer to the brain or nervous system and can be framed purely in terms of phenomenological or information processing theories of mind. Increasingly, though, an understanding of brain function is being included in psychological theory and practice, particularly in areas such as artificial intelligence, neuropsychology, and cognitive neuroscience.\nPsychology describes and attempts to explain consciousness, behavior and social interaction. Empirical psychology is primarily devoted to describing human experience and behavior as it actually occurs. In the past 20 years or so psychology has begun to examine the relationship between consciousness and the brain or nervous system. It is still not clear in what ways these interact: does consciousness determine brain states or do brain states determine consciousness - or are both going on in various ways? Perhaps to understand this you need to know the definition of \"consciousness\" and \"brain state\" - or is consciousness some sort of complicated 'illusion' which bears no direct relationship to neural processes? The late 19th century marks the start of psychology as a scientific enterprise. The year 1879 is commonly seen as the start of psychology as an independent field of study, because in that year German scientist Wilhelm Wundt founded the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research in Leipzig, Germany.\nWundt combined philosophical introspection with techniques and laboratory apparatuses brought over from his physiological studies with Helmholtz, as well as many of his own design. This experimental introspection was in contrast to what had been called psychology until then, a branch of philosophy where people introspected themselves.\nIntrospection is the direct observation or rumination of one's own heart, mind and/or soul and its processes, as opposed to extrospection, the observation of things external to one's self.\nEarly Systems of PsychologyEdit\nWundt's form of psychology is called structuralism. It is in a class called systematic interpretations because It attempted to explain all behavior with reference to one systematic position. Some other systems of psychology are functionalism, behaviorism, gestalt psychology, and psychodynamic psychology.\nFunctionalism is concerned with the reason for behavior and not the structure of the brain. It allowed the study of new subjects including children and animals.\nBehaviorism is an approach to psychology based on the proposition that behavior can be studied and explained scientifically without recourse to internal mental states. Psychologists that use behaviorism are concerned mainly with muscular movements and glandular secretions.\nGestalt Psychology is a theory of mind and brain that proposes that the operational principle of the brain is holistic, parallel, and analog, with self-organizing tendencies. It has a particular interest in perceptual problems and how they can be interpreted. A Gestaltist believes that the whole is greater than or different than the sum of all of the parts. Trying to break up behavior into separate parts is simplistic because everything affects everything else.\nPsychodynamic psychology was first practiced by Sigmund Freud, although he didn't intend it to be a system.\nWhile the use of one system to solve all problems has been abandoned by most psychologists, these early systems were important in the development of new systems and ideas. There are eight major perspectives that psychologists usually take, although many use an eclectic approach instead of confining themselves to just one.\nThe psychodynamic perspective emphasizes unconscious drives and the resolution of conflicts, the behaviorial emphasizes the acquisition and alteration of observable responses, and the humanistic approaches attempt to achieve maximum human potential as set in Maslow's hierarchy of needs.\nEvolutionary psychology is a theoretical approach to psychology that attempts to explain certain mental and psychological traits—such as memory, perception, or language as evolved adaptations, i.e., as the functional products of natural or sexual selection.\nCognitive psychology accepts the use of the scientific method, but rejects introspection as a valid method of investigation. It should be noted that Herbert Simon and Allen Newell identified the 'thinking-aloud' protocol, in which investigators view a subject engaged in introspection, and who speaks his thoughts aloud, thus allowing study of his introspection.\nSocial psychology is the scientific study of how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others (Allport, 1985).\nWundt argued that \"we learn little about our minds from casual, haphazard self-observation...It is essential that observations be made by trained observers under carefully specified conditions for the purpose of answering a well-defined question.\"\nMany scientists threw away the idea of introspection as part of psychology because the observation of stimulation was speculative without an empirical approach. However the case, an opposite to introspection called extrospection has been created with a relation to Psychophysics. Psychophysics is the branch of psychology dealing with the relationship between physical stimuli and their perception.\nThe important distinction is that Wundt took this method into the experimental arena and thus into the newly formed psychological field. Other important early contributors to the field of psychology include Hermann Ebbinghaus (a pioneer in studies on memory), the Russian Ivan Pavlov (who discovered the learning process of classical conditioning), and the Austrian Sigmund Freud.\nThe mid-20th century saw a rejection of Freud's theories among many psychologists as being too unscientific, as well as a reaction against Edward Titchener's abstract approach to the mind.\nEdward B. Titchener (1876-1927) was an Englishman and a student of Wilhelm Wundt before becoming a professor of psychology at Cornell University. He would put his own spin on Wundt's psychology of consciousness after he emigrated to the United States.\nAt the turn of 19th century the founding father of experimental psychology Wilhelm Wundt tried to experimentally confirm his hypothesis that conscious mental life can be broken down into fundamental elements which then form more complex mental structures. Wundt's structuralism was quickly abandoned because it could not be tested in the same way as behavior, until now, when the brain-scanning technology can identify, for example, specialized brain cells that respond exclusively to basic lines and shapes and are then combined in subsequent brain areas where more complex visual structures are formed. This line of research in modern psychology is called cognitive psychology rather than structuralism because Wundt's term never ceased to be associated with the problem of observability.\nThe majority of mainstream psychology is based on a framework derived from cognitive psychology, although the popularity of this paradigm does not exclude others, which are often applied as necessary. Psychologists specialising in certain areas, however, may use the dominant cognitive psychology only rarely if at all.\nCognitive psychology is the psychological science which studies cognition, the mental processes that are hypothesised to underlie behavior. This covers a broad range of research domains, examining questions about the workings of memory, attention, perception, knowledge representation, reasoning, creativity and problem solving.\nCognitive psychology is radically different from previous psychological approaches in two key ways.\n- It accepts the use of the scientific method, and generally rejects Introspection as a valid method of investigation, unlike phenomenological methods such as Freudian psychology.\n- It posits the existence of internal mental states (such as beliefs, desires and motivations) unlike behaviourist psychology.\nRegardless of the perspective adopted there are hundreds of specialties that psychologists practice. These specialties can usually be grouped into general fields.\n- Clinical and Counseling Psychology: Over half of all psychologists work in this field. Clinical psychologists are more likely to treat or conduct research into the causes of abnormal behaviors, while counseling psychologists more often work with mild social or emotional problems. Typically people seeking the help of a counselor are not classified as abnormal or mentally ill.\n- Educational and School Psychology: Educational psychologists are concerned with the use of psychology to increase the effectiveness of the learning experience, including facilities, curriculum, teaching techniques, and student problems. A school psychologist works in a school environment to evaluate the structure and effectiveness of the learning environment. A school psychologist assesses, counsels or guides students who have academic,behavioral,emotional,and/ or guidance needs. A school psychologist consults with teachers,staff, and parents to help students adjust and learn most effectively in their learning environment.\n- Industrial/Organizational Psychology (also known as I/O psychology, work psychology, occupational psychology, or personnel psychology) is the study of the behavior of people in the workplace. Industrial and organizational psychology applies psychological knowledge and methods to aid workers and organizations. I/O psychologists who work for an organization are most likely to work in the HR (human resources) department.\n- Consumer Psychology:Consumer behaviour is the study of how people buy, what they buy, when they buy and why they buy.\n- Engineering Psychology: See link\n- Forensic Psychology: Forensic psychology is the application of psychological principles and knowledge to various legal activities involving child custody disputes, child abuse of an emotional, physical and sexual nature, assessing one's personal capacity to manage one's affairs, matters of competency to stand trial, criminal responsibility & personal injury and advising judges in matters relating to sentencing regarding various mitigants and the actuarial assessment of future risk.\n- Sport Psychology: Sport psychology is a specialization within psychology that seeks to understand psychological/mental factors that affect performance in sports, physical activity and exercise and apply these to enhance individual and team performance.\n- Environmental Psychology: Environmental psychology is an interdisciplinary field focused on the interplay between humans and their surroundings. Areas of study include pollution effects, recycling efforts, and the study of stress generated by different physical settings.\nThe first use of the term \"psychology\" is often attributed to the German scholastic philosopher Rudolf Goeckel (Latinized Rudolph Goclenius), published in 1590. More than six decades earlier, however, the Croatian humanist Marko Marulić used the term in the title of a work which was subsequently lost. This, of course, may not have been the very first usage, but it is the earliest documented use at present.\nThe term did not fall into popular usage until the German idealist philosopher, Christian Wolff (1679-1754) used it in his Psychologia empirica and Psychologia rationalis (1732-1734). This distinction between empirical and rational psychology was picked up in Diderot's Encyclopedie and was popularized in France by Maine de Biran.\nThe root of the word psychology (psyche) is very roughly equivalent to \"soul\" in Greek, and (ology) equivalent to \"study\". Psychology came to be considered a study of the soul (in a religious sense of this term) much later, in Christian times. Psychology as a medical discipline can be seen in Thomas Willis' reference to psychology (the \"Doctrine of the Soul\") in terms of brain function, as part of his 1672 anatomical treatise \"De Anima Brutorum\" (\"Two Discourses on the Souls of Brutes\"). Until about the end of the 19th century, psychology was regarded as a branch of philosophy.\nEarly modern eraEdit\nIn 1879, Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920), known as \"the father of psychology\", founded a laboratory for the study of psychology at Leipzig University in Germany. The American philosopher William James published his seminal book, Principles of Psychology, in 1890, laying the foundations for many of the questions that psychologists would focus on for years to come. Other important early contributors to the field include Hermann Ebbinghaus (1850–1909), a pioneer in the experimental study of memory at the University of Berlin; and the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936), who investigated the learning process now referred to as classical conditioning.\nMeanwhile, during the 1890s, the Austrian physician Sigmund Freud, who was trained as a neurologist and had no formal training in experimental psychology, had developed a method of psychotherapy known as psychoanalysis. Freud's understanding of the mind was largely based on interpretive methods and introspection, and was focused in particular on resolving mental distress and psychopathology. Freud's theories became very well-known, largely because they tackled subjects such as sexuality and repression as general aspects of psychological development. These were largely considered taboo subjects at the time, and Freud provided a catalyst for them to be openly discussed in polite society. Although Freud's theories are only of limited interest in modern academic psychology departments, his application of psychology to clinical work has been very influential.\nPartly in reaction to the subjective and introspective nature of Freudian psychology, and its focus on the recollection of childhood experiences, during the early decades of the 20th century behaviorism gained popularity as a guiding psychological theory. Championed by psychologists such as John B. Watson and Edward Thorndike (and later, B.F. Skinner), behaviorism was grounded in studies of animal behavior. Behaviorists argued that psychology should be a science of behavior, not the mind, and rejected the idea that internal mental states such as beliefs, desires, or goals could be studied scientifically. In his paper \"Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It\" (1913), Watson argued that psychology \"is a purely objective [emphasis added] experimental branch of natural science,\" that \"introspection forms no essential part of its methods\", and that \"the behaviorist recognizes no dividing line between man and brute.\"\nBehaviorism reigned as the dominant model in psychology through the first half of the 20th century, largely due to the creation of conditioning theories as scientific models of human behavior, and their successful application in the workplace and in fields such as advertising.\nHowever, it became increasingly clear that although behaviorism had made some important discoveries, it was deficient as a guiding theory of human behavior. Noam Chomsky's review of Skinner's book Verbal Behavior (that aimed to explain language acquisition in a behaviorist framework) is considered one of the major factors in the ending of behaviorism's reign. Chomsky demonstrated that language could not purely be learned from conditioning, as people could produce sentences unique in structure and meaning that couldn't possibly be generated solely through experience of natural language, implying that there must be internal states of mind that behaviorism rejected as illusory. Similarly, work by Albert Bandura showed that children could learn by social observation, without any change in overt behavior, and so must be accounted for by internal representations.\nHumanistic psychology emerged in the 1950s and has continued as a reaction to positivist and scientific approaches to the mind. It stresses a phenomenological view of human experience and seeks to understand human beings and their behavior by conducting qualitative research. The humanistic approach has its roots in existentialist and phenomenological philosophy and many humanist psychologists completely reject a scientific approach, arguing that trying to turn human experience into measurements strips it of all meaning and relevance to lived existence.\nSome of the founding theorists behind this school of thought were Abraham Maslow who formulated a hierarchy of human needs, Carl Rogers who created and developed client-centered therapy, and Fritz Perls who helped create and develop Gestalt therapy.\nThe rise of computer technology also promoted the metaphor of mental function as information processing. This, combined with a scientific approach to studying the mind, as well as a belief in internal mental states, led to the rise of cognitivism as the dominant model of the mind.\nLinks between brain and nervous system function were also becoming common, partly due to the experimental work of people such as Charles Sherrington and Donald Hebb, and partly due to studies of people with brain injury (see cognitive neuropsychology). With the development of technologies for accurately measuring brain function, neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience have become some of the most active areas in contemporary psychology. With the increasing involvement of other disciplines (such as philosophy, computer science and neuroscience) in the quest to understand the mind, the umbrella discipline of cognitive science has been created as a means of focusing such efforts in a constructive way.","No matter where we call home, where we were raised, or what we ate for breakfast, our brains process information pretty much the same as anyone else in the world. Which makes sense—our genomes are 99.6-99.9% identical, which makes our brains nearly so. Look at a landscape or cityscape and comparable computations occur in your brain as in someone from another background or country.\nConsider my recent walk through China’s Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, an inspiration for James Cameron’s Avatar. Some of our first steps into the park involved a 1,070 foot ascent in the Bailong elevator, the world’s tallest outdoor elevator. Crammed within the carriage were travelers from Japan, India, China, the U.S.A., and Korea.\nNo matter our origin, the Wulingyuan landscapedidn’t disappoint: the towering red and green rock formations stretched towards the sky as they defied gravity. Gasps and awes were our linguistic currency while our visual cortices gleefully fired away.\nThe approximately 3000 quartzite sandstone pillars, with their unusual red and green contrasts, mesmerized our visual centers, demanding our attention.\nOne of the brain’s earliest visual processing centers, V1, lies at the middle of the back of our head. V1 identifies simple forms like vertical, horizontal, and diagonal edges of contrasting intensities, or lines. Look at a vertical line, and neurons that are sensitive to vertical lines will fire more quickly; look at a horizontal line, and our horizontal neurons buzz away.\nDownstream visual centers (conveniently called V2, V3, V4) weave together these basic visual forms to create the beginnings of a visual tapestry. More complex forms like squares and circles are assembled; motion and color are added to the picture.\nThe content of visual information—for example, the density and direction of the lines—determines how much of our attention a visual stimulus grabs. Studies have shown that a high density of lines, for example, grabs our attention in what is known as bottom-up orienting.\nThe brain’s orienting network selects important, behaviorally relevant information from what we see, hear, and touch. Imagine walking down Shanghai’s Bund in the cool evening air. As we gaze across the river at the Pudong District’s glowing skyscrapers we choose to shift our attention from skyscraper to skyscraper. This is called goal-directed, or top-down orienting.\nContrast this deliberate shift of attention with the reflexive, almost forced shift of attention when, staring at the skyline, a motorcycle taxi honks, demanding that we acknowledge we’re in his way. This is called stimulus-driven, or bottom-up orienting.\nVisual scenes with busy, crisscrossing lines grab and keep our attention by engaging stimulus-driven orienting networks—those line neurons fire fast enough to collect their slice of consciousness. Bright, bold, or contrasting colors do the same.\nThe combination of towering vertical lines and other-worldly fluorescent lights were the substance of the Bund’s nighttime enchantment, which attracted a global cadre of visitors—visitors that responded with smiles of approval or thoughtful gazes.\nWhether he’s painting trees billowing in the wind, “lost” abandoned buildings, or reeds in a swamp (in which he concealed a cuboid), his pieces strongly feature geometric shapes, lines. In some pieces, he teases you with mere shadows of lines, forcing your brain piece them together as you will.\nFor the last 12 years, Sima has repeatedly painted Shanghai’s most dramatic architectural display of lines: the Jin Mao tower. Completed in 1999, the Jin Mao tower captures traditional Chinese architecture and modern design within an exoskeleton of crisscrossed aluminum pipe. In his series of paintings, Sima details Jin Mao’s nearly 1380 feet of brain-tickling lines.\nWhen I asked how Sima planned each project, he told me that before each painting, he stakes out the tower and snaps a photo to use as a guide. His favorite view is at about 45 degrees from one of the faces:\n“The angle is very important. I take a photo to keep my perspective. I am very careful, like a scientist,” he told me with a grin, “But I do it by eye, by feel, by experience. I reduce the details using the photo to focus my lines and give me perspective. Taking away some details allows me to express emotion, making it more abstract.”\nSima’s trick was to blur the upper edges and set the tower within an intensely solid blue, yellow or red background that evoked awe, turmoil, passion. By subtracting detail and adding a tinge of atypical color, Sima had hit his mark.\nStanding in Sima’s half-basement studio, I wondered if the act of perception, of inference from incomplete information formed the substance of emotion, whether emotional networks were really extrapolation or inference circuits, evolution’s quick solution for patchwork processing. Indeed, while combinations of lines are strong snaggers of attention, scenes that are ominous or emotionally provocative are the most potent mesmerizers.\nSima’s choice of a solid, intense color combined with dense combinations of lines fascinated me. With the help of Baidu’s translation app, we discussed a classic study of visual attention by neuroscientists at John Hopkins University. The researchers wanted to know whether image features like color, intensity (average RGB luminance), and line orientation affected bottom-up attention. They used an eye-tracking task to measure how much each feature attracted participants’ eyes and discovered that, in cityscapes, color intensity and line orientation were most important in luring participant’s brains to attention.\n“Pretty cool eh?” I said. We chuckled at how Sima’s paintings were, in no small fashion, a neuroscience experiment.\nPointing at his head, Sima replied, “Same brain.”\nFurther Reading on Attention\nBarron DS, Castellanos FX (In Press). “Attention Networks.” In: Pfaff DW, Volkow N, Calderon DP (eds.)

{"question":"As a kitchen designer, I need to know: what are the key principles of kitchen triangle design, and what ventilation requirements must be considered for optimal indoor air quality?","answer":"The kitchen triangle design requires connecting three main points (cooking area, sink, and storage) with distances of 4-9 feet between each point, totaling no more than 26 feet, with no traffic passing through the triangle. For ventilation, specific requirements depend on dwelling size and range type. For homes over 1500 sq ft, hoods over electric ranges need 50% Capture Efficiency or 110 cfm, while gas ranges require 70% CE or 180 cfm. Smaller homes need higher ratings - homes under 750 sq ft require 65% CE/160 cfm for electric and 85% CE/280 cfm for gas ranges. This ventilation is crucial as cooking creates pollutants regardless of fuel source, from heated oils, fats and spices.","context":["Nothing is more enjoyable than the ease of switching from the fridge to the sink or to the hob when cooking in the kitchen. It’s not about the size you have, but understanding the kitchen triangle concept will make it easier for you to work there. The three main points in the kitchen itself are the cooking area (hob or oven), the washing area, and also the storage.\nThe concept of the Kitchen triangle design itself means that the distance in the work area is not too close and not too far to facilitate work in the kitchen. At the very least, you should have about 4 feet from one point to another in the kitchen and also leave enough room for preparing meals.\nEven though there are no special rules in the Kitchen triangle design, with this standard measurement it will make it easier and help you to get a better flow of work in the kitchen. To determine the layout of the kitchen triangle, you must also understand the layout that is most appropriate for it! Here are some kitchen layout arrangements that work well for your triangles.\nKitchen Triangle Design\nGalley style kitchen for Kitchen Triangle Design\nThis form of kitchen is often used in narrow or rectangular spaces, where the worktop is evenly distributed on both sides.\nThis kitchen style keeps the stove, sink, and dishwasher on one side with space flanking both of them for various meal preparations. Meanwhile, place the refrigerator on the other side facing your cooking area.\nBefore this style was redone, kitchens often lacked space for the preparation area as the existing refrigerator cut between the hob, sink and dining table on one side. Meanwhile, the sink does not have enough storage area at the top or at the bottom. The table which serves as the preparation area and dining area beside the cooking area, and the ref has been moved next to the ref and sink which has a dishwasher and top cabinet.\nG style kitchen\nBasically, this kitchen has a fairly unique shape like the letter “G” with short sleeves which is often used for small peninsulas. This peninsula is used to place a sink, or is often used for the cooking area and also serves as an additional dining area in your preparation room.\nThis G-shaped kitchen comes with a fairly wide sink and a single-lever pull-out faucet on a short arm, a hob, fridge, cupboards, as well as a prep table with long arms. This form allows the user to have more preparation and storage areas, and the elevated counter functions as a buffet and breakfast area.\nThis shape is really a great choice of ideas with a Kitchen triangle design that provides a more optimal area of motion with a clear flow.\nLayout with an island in the center\nKitchens with the island in the center of the room are a very common option and are used in a variety of styles. The island in the middle of this space is used as a kitchen table and also an optimal preparation area.\nSeveral benches are placed there with a placement that does not hinder the workflow, and also minimizes the steps from one point to another.\nThis kitchen with an elongated island is an excellent choice for an integrated kitchen as well as a dining area. Not only that, the sink on the island is often used as an additional preparation area that makes it easier for you to entertain guests.\nThis layout functions at the corner of the room and provides a flowing flow of ink without disturbing the existing work sense. With ceiling-high top cabinets and base cabinets sharing space on one arm with a sink and hob, this style has a Kitchen triangle design that makes it easy for cooks to reach it with ease.\nThis layout is ideal for rooms with large or small sizes, even with a limited square area, the U style still comes with a Kitchen triangle design that has a clear and very smooth workflow.\nThis style comes with more space for a large central island with a large enough sink on one side adding a prep or bark sink to the island will make it easier to prepare cooking and washing food in one area.\nApart from the kitchen layouts above, you will also get several other layout options. Check here for some of the best kitchen layout recommendations.\nBasically, Kitchen triangle design is a guideline for doing kitchen design and helps to plan a more efficient work area with clearer traffic. This is a triangle that connects the main components in the room such as the stove, sink, and refrigerator. With a distance of 4 and 9 feet, each cook will be more mobile and preparation activities will be more effective.\nTo get an effective Kitchen triangle design, the triangle concept itself must be substantial in the design and layout of the kitchen.\n- The sum of the three sides of the triangle cannot be more than 26 feet\n- Each leg measures 4-9\n- No traffic passes through the triangle\nTo get the best Kitchen triangle design, there are several things that must be considered!\nKitchen Work Area\nThe kitchen is not just about cooking, preparation and cleaning too! In fact, the kitchen is becoming more multifunctional than some people claim. So, when designing a kitchen triangle, you have to be more flexible and make arrangements based on frequent activities (always there).\nThis area is a storage area for various consumables and non-consumable items such as fresh food, frozen food, canned food, and so on. This zone you will get when you place the main kitchen, and also the refrigerator.\nKeeping this area close and easy to access will make the Kitchen triangle design work even better.\nThis area is often built into the area around the sink, including things like dishwashers, trash, as well as various household cleaning items and brooms. You should also install a waste cupboard near the sink to get a more comfortable space and ensure cleanliness is maintained.\nThis is a storage area with easy accents to utensils, towels, as well as plates or bowls. When creating this area, be sure to pay attention to what items are needed such as a basic drawer or a roll-up cabinet.\nAs well as the hob, you should also pay attention to where the built-in microwave and oven are located. When considering cooking storage, you should start by planning a landing area for hot dishes as well as storage for your utensils, pots, pans, and toaster as well.\nTo get the best Kitchen triangle design, making sure the work flow goes well is your obligation. So, make sure the triangle area actually works as it should. This will also make your job easier.","2022 Kitchen Exhaust Requirements\nIndoor air quality (IAQ) is an important part of today’s Gas vs Electric appliance debate. The 2022 energy code proposes additional steps to improve indoor air quality.\nIndoor Air Quality\nGas furnaces and water heaters are designed to vent pollution outside. But stoves are often inefficiently vented; in many cases, they’re entirely unvented. Recent studies conducted or referenced by the EPA, Rocky Mountain Institute, Sierra Club and Harvard University have shown that on average, most kitchens’ indoor air quality falls within harmful levels.\nBurning fossil fuels in your house is an obvious pollutant, but cooking itself creates IAQ issues, so it’s important to vent a stove, no matter what the fuel source is.\nCooking creates pollutants from heated oil, fat and spices, so choosing a cleaner -burning fuel source does not eliminate the need for local ventilation. The variety of pollutants released during cooking have been linked to health concerns including asthma, fatigue and headaches (see the Physicians for Social Responsibility for information and resources).\nRange Hood Code Requirements\nGood news: The most effective way to create a healthier kitchen environment is to install a high-efficiency range hood! To be considered high efficiency, the hood needs a high cubic feet per minute (cfm) rating for air changes and a low sones (noise) rating.\nThe 2022 Single Family Residential and Multi-Family code further defines the required Capture Efficiency Ratings (CE) per Dwelling unit floor area for both Electric and Gas ranges as the fraction of emitted tracer gas that is directly exhausted by a range hood.\nTwo items of note in the code:\n- Hoods over natural gas ranges require a higher CE or CFM than those over electric ranges, and\n- Homes with a smaller floor area have less opportunity to dilute cooking contaminants and therefore also require a higher CE or CFM.\nRequirements are listed in Table 150.0-G\nTable 150.0-G Kitchen Range Hood Airflow Rates (cfm) and ASTM E3087 Capture Efficiency (CE) Ratings According to Dwelling Unit Floor Area and Kitchen Range Fuel Type\n|Dwelling Unit Floor Area (ft2)||Hood Over Electric Range||Hood Over Natural Gas|\n|>1500||50% CE or 110 cfm||70% CE or 180 cfm|\n|>1000 - 1500||50% CE or 110 cfm||80% CE or 250 cfm|\n|750 - 1000||55% CE or 130 cfm||85% CE or 280 cfm|\n|<750||65% CE or 160 cfm||85% CE or 280 cfm|\nOther Considerations for Kitchen Ventilation\nOther exhaust fans, including downdraft fans, must meet a minimum of 300 cfm. For Enclosed Kitchens, a capacity of 5 Air Changes per Hour (ACH) would need to be calculated for the project.\nAdditionally, the energy code requires a HERS verification, stating that the hood is certified by the Home Ventilating Institute (HVI) or the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), to provide at least one speed setting that can deliver 100 cfm at less than 3 sones. If the range hood has a minimum airflow setting of 400 cfm or more, they are exempt from the noise requirement. Interested in becoming a HERS Rater?

One type of device, called a transmitter, includes superconducting wire loops attached to a resonator. It is used by companies such as Google, IBM, and Rigetti. Companies such as Quantinuum and IonQ have instead used single ions trapped in light traps. At the moment, both technologies are in a critical situation. They are clearly proven to be effective, but they need some significant quality and quality improvements before they can perform useful calculations.\nIt may be a bit surprising to see that Microsoft is committed to an alternative technology called “topological qubits”. This technology is far enough away from the company’s other options just announced I’ve worked in physics to form qubits. To better understand Microsoft’s approach, Ars spoke to Microsoft engineer Chetan Nayak about the company’s progress and plans.\nMicrosoft started behind some competitors because the underlying physics of its system were not fully defined. The company’s system relies on the controlled production of the “majorana particle”, something whose existence has only been proven over the past decade (and even then, its discovery It was controversial).\nThe particle got its name from Ettore Majorana, who proposed the idea in the 1920s. In simpler terms, Majorana particle is its antiparticle. Two majorana particles that differ in their rotation will perish if they meet. So far, none of the known particles appear to be a Majorana particle (all but neutrinos are not). But this concept has persisted because of the possibility of making Majorana quasiparticles, or collections of particles and fields that, in certain contexts, behave as if they were a single particle.\nThe most notable quasiparticle is probably the Cooper pair, in which two electrons are paired in a way that changes their behaviour. Cooper pairs are necessary for superconductivity to work.\nNayak said the Microsoft system includes a superconducting wire and its accompanying Cooper pairs. Under normal conditions, the presence of an additional non-paired electron imposes a cost on the total energy of the system. But in a wire small enough in the presence of magnetic fields, it is possible to stick an electron at the end of the wire without energy cost. “In the topological state and the topological superconductor, you end up having states that can, at no energy cost, absorb an extra electron,” Nayak told Ars.\nBeing quantum mechanics, the electron is not localized to the end of the wire where it is inserted; Instead, it is passed on to both ends. “The two extremes are the real and imaginary parts of a quantum wave function, basically,” Nayak said. These end states are called Majorana zero modes, and Microsoft now says it created them and has measured their properties.\nFrom quasiparticles to qubits\nMajorana zero modes alone cannot be used as qubits. But Nayak said it could be linked to a nearby quantum dot. (Quantum dots are pieces of a material whose size is smaller than the wavelength of the electron in that material.) Describe a U-shaped wire with majorana zero modes at each end and those ends close to a quantum dot.\n“You could, as a hypothetical process, have an electron tunnel away from the quantum dot in Majorana’s zero mode and an electron tunnel away from the other Majorana’s zero mode and onto the quantum dot,” Nayak told Ars. These exchanges change the quantum dot’s ability to store charge (its capacity, in other words), a property that can be measured. Nayak also said that the connections between the wire and the quantum dots could be controlled, which could allow Majorana zero patterns to be separated, which would help preserve their state.\nMicrosoft has not yet reached a quantum dot tethering point. But it did quite a bit of work to make the topological state work in the wire. The materials the company uses are relatively unusual: aluminum as the superconducting wire and indium arsenide as the semiconductor that surrounds it. Microsoft makes all the same hardware."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b09729d0-7fc1-4acf-bc23-56d2fe314274>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are operation times and facilities available on Caledonian Canal?","answer":"The Caledonian Canal operates seven days a week between 0800 and 1800 during summer months, and five days a week during winter. Along the canal, there are docks and piers available everywhere, equipped with bathroom facilities including showers. The canal system also features many small towns along the way, with access to food and drink establishments.","context":["Voyager on the Caledonian CanalFeb 29, 2008\nTo the editor: On a cruise from the west coast of Scotland to Norway in our J-46 Cielita during July of 2007, we had the ideal opportunity to transit the famous Caledonian Canal, which cuts right through the middle of Scotland from Fort William at the head of Loch Linnhe on the west, to the city of Inverness on the east. For the bluewater sailor this is a truly unique and delightful experience, well worth the time and expense.\nWe contacted the lockkeeper on the VHF from our anchorage nearby and entered the sea lock near Fort William just after 0800. Once inside with the gates closed behind us, we were very cordially welcomed at the office to pay the rather stiff fee and state our intentions. We were given a guidebook and a map of the canal and a few pointers about transiting the 29 locks and 10 swing bridges, and off we went.\nThe total length of the canal, which includes the entire length of Loch Ness, is about 60 nautical miles, and the passage takes a minimum of two full days. The speed limit is five knots, and a three-day transit time is recommended.\nThe canal was completed in 1822 and was designed to serve as a shortcut for commercial vessels between the Atlantic and the North Sea. About one-third is man-made, and the rest is made up of a series of lakes. The highest point on the canal is 106 feet above sea level. Since there is an abundance of fresh water flowing in from many streams and rivers, there is never a shortage of water, and, accordingly, the canal need never close for lack of water to operate the locks.\nToday the canal sees very little commercial traffic but is used quite heavily by pleasure boaters of all sorts, from kayaks to large yachts. Many Scots spend days and weeks on this system of locks, canals, and lakes in their small powerboats, where there are many small towns along the way and beautiful scenery to enjoy. Unfortunately, we were in a bit of a rush to get through, as we had crew joining us in Inverness on a tight schedule. But we would otherwise have liked to transit the area at a more leisurely pace and take in some of the local culture and historic sites.\nUnlike the Crinan Canal, where the locks are almost all of the do-it-yourself variety, the locks along the Caledonian Canal are all manned by very pleasant and competent lockkeepers who take your lines and manage all the gates. There were only two of us aboard at the time, but we never felt the need for more hands. And we rarely had to wait for long before being locked through. On one occasion, we did have to wait for the lockkeeper to return from lunch. And on one other occasion, we had to wait for traffic coming the other way to be locked through one of the multiple-lock (as many as eight) ladders or staircases, as they are known. But these brief waits are all part of the fun.\nThe locks are operated seven days a week between 0800 and 1800 during the summer months and five days a week during the winter. So when evening comes, one has to stop along the way. This is easily done, as there are docks and piers available everywhere, as well as bathroom facilities, including showers. We spent one night about half way along where food and drink ashore were only a few feet away.\nAnd then there is Loch Ness, 22 miles long, no more than 1.5 miles wide, and 1,000 feet deep. We searched hard for the monster but were unable to catch any sight of it. However, we were able to enjoy a delightful sail down wind for the entire length, with beautiful mountain scenery on both sides.\nWe were disappointed when we finally reached the end at Inverness and wished we had had more time to enjoy the passage. All in all, the Caledonian Canal is a delightful experience and a wonderful shortcut for any vessel traveling between the east and west coasts of Scotland.\n— Ned Cabot is a retired physician living in Boston when not voyaging aboard his J-46.Edit Module"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cd6b372d-9830-4ce8-b816-480cbb24449b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the installation processes differ between Amrumbank West and Dogger Bank wind farms regarding specialized equipment?","answer":"At Amrumbank West, the installation process utilizes geotextile sand containers and relies on monopiles that penetrate under their own weight, with a special filling line capable of processing 500 bags per day. In contrast, Dogger Bank uses the Voltaire, the world's largest offshore jack-up installation vessel with a lifting capacity of 3,200 tonnes, which is also the first ultra-low emission ship of its kind.","context":["Geotextile sand containers were used as an alternative to a granular scour-protection system for the Amrumbank West wind farm in Germany. There were two decisive arguments in favour of the “Soft Rock” solution: The sand containers required only a third as much of typically used rock material, and in the construction schedule, their installation is logistically uncoupled from the process of driving the foundations.\nThe Amrumbank West offshore wind park is situated 35km northwest of Heligoland and 37km west of Amrum; it extends over an area of 34km². Here, E.ON is installing a total of 80 Siemens 3.6 MW-class wind turbines. The wind farm is scheduled to gene-rate a total of 288 Megawatt, which is enough to power 300,000 households.\nGeotextile scour protection requires two-thirds less material than rock scour protection\nThe foundations for the wind turbines are situated at a water depth of -19 to -24m LAT (Lowest Astronomical Tide / sea-map zero) and are constructed as monopiles (“single posts”) with a maximum diameter of 6m. A double-layer scour-protection system is used to optimize the length of these piles, and this was originally de-signed as a rock system with a total thickness of 2.4m. But, with a thickness of only 0.8m, the geo-textile alternative consumes significantly less material with the same functionality.\nCutting tests at Hanover University\nTo assess the influence of the geotextile scour protection on the driving work, cutting tests were carried out prior to the tender procedure at the Institute of Geo-technical Engineering of the Leibniz University Hanover. The testing was focused on the execution of the lower end of the monopile and on the behaviour of the sand container during driving. It was observed that the monopiles penetrate the scour protection purely under their own weight (there is no cutting action), and that they pull the sand containers into the sea bed along with them. The sand remains inside the sand containers, since the geotextile does not necessarily tear until it is beneath the sea bed and is then trapped in the monopile/soil shear interface.\nFilling of the sand containers on site\nAdditional advantages of the sand containers become evident during construction. Since the fill material, sand, is available locally, transport costs can be significantly reduced.\nThe NAUE Secutex® Soft Rocks are 1.45m x 2.38m in size and are made from Secutex®, a specially bonded staple-fibre nonwoven made into containers using a high-performance sewing yarn. Starting in October 2012, NAUE produced 50,000 sand containers and delivered these to Rømø in Denmark. There, the contractor Peter Madsen Rederi A/S (PMR) filled each container with 1,350 kg North Sea sand, a degree of filling of 80%. PMR developed a special filling line with a capacity of 500 bags per day.\nTime-independence of installation steps\nPerhaps the most significant advantage of the geotextile sandbags became evident when installation logistics were considered. The rock scour protection would require the filter layer to be placed immediately before the monopiles were driven and the top layer shortly thereafter. The additional sand containers and the second layer were installed. After a third survey, sand containers were placed where necessary to ensure the two-layer coverage with a total thickness of approximately 0.8m.\nInspection with underwater camera\nTo complement the GPS seabed survey in assessing the quality of the scour protection, eight locations were inspected using an underwater camera and the layer thicknesses verified.\nDuring foundation construction (beginning in December 2013), it was observed that the monopiles penetrated the scour protection purely under their own weight, as had been indicated in the cut-ting tests.\nA camera inspection is now planned to indicate the condition of the sand containers after the driving operation. In addition, the possible placing of additional sand containers in the vicinity of the piles is easily available if needed.","Work to install the first of 277 turbines at the world’s largest offshore wind farm is under way.\nThe 260m tall turbines – which are almost twice the height of the London Eye – will be installed at Dogger Bank Wind Farm, around 80 miles off the coast of Yorkshire using a specialist vessel with a lifting capacity of 3,200 tonnes, the largest of its kind in the world.\nDogger Bank will occupy an area almost as large as Greater London, on seabed that once formed a land bridge between the UK and Europe.\nWhen fully complete it will have an installed capacity of 3.6GW of renewable electricity and be capable of producing enough clean energy to power the equivalent of six million homes annually.\nSSE Renewables is lead operator for the development and construction of Dogger Bank Wind Farm.\nThe project is being developed and built by the UK developer SSE Renewables in a joint venture with Norway’s Equinor and Vårgrønn (a joint venture by Eni Plenitude and Hitec Vision).\nEquinor will be lead operator of the wind farm on completion for its expected operational life of around 35 years. Vårgrønn brings specialist offshore wind expertise to the project.\nSSE CEO, Alistair Phillips-Davies said: “Dogger Bank is one of the biggest and most complex engineering and infrastructure projects anywhere in the world.\n“Our progress here with our joint venture partners Equinor and Vårgrønn proves that offshore wind projects of this size are now mainstream and will help turbocharge the transition to the cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy system we all want to see.\n“It is action, not ambition, that will secure our energy future and this project shows action on a massive scale. But we will need many more Dogger Banks to achieve our goals and we look forward to working with government to bring forward more projects at pace.”\nEach turn of a turbine’s 107m long blades will produce enough clean energy to power an average UK home for two days.\nOnce fully operational, Dogger Bank will generate annual CO2 savings equivalent to the emissions of nearly 1.5 million average internal combustion engine petrol cars.\nThe installation vessel, Jan de Nul’s Voltaire, is the largest offshore jack-up installation vessel ever built and is the first ultra-low emission ship of its kind.\nWork to install the first turbine began at the weekend.\nEquinor EVP Renewables, Pål Eitrheim said installation of the first turbine at Dogger Bank was “testament to the determination of the UK Government, the project partners, and the supply chain to deliver a world-class offshore wind project for the UK”.\nHe added: “To reach our net zero goals, we will need even more of this collaboration.\n“We’re delighted to soon begin operating Dogger Bank from our new O&M base at the Port of Tyne, which will host 400 jobs over the 35-year lifetime of the wind farm.\n“We look forward to seeing the 277 turbines installed safely over the next three years, generating green electricity at scale and powering millions of British homes.”\nDogger Bank has created and supported more than 2,000 jobs, principally in the North East of England."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0f4b6745-637a-49da-bb04-77747df044f4>","<urn:uuid:88f4353a-c8ae-4120-9915-67fd41661809>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Compare the reliability aspects of downloading videos versus streaming them through TCP?","answer":"Streaming videos through TCP offers reliable transmission through its congestion control mechanisms and window-based end-to-end flow control, where the destination sends acknowledgements for correctly received packets and the source updates window size. Unlike downloading, streaming allows users to watch videos without permanently storing them on their device, as the video files are automatically deleted once played. While downloading ensures you have the complete file, TCP streaming provides a balance of reliable transmission and immediate playback, making it suitable for services like Netflix that require dependable content delivery.","context":["Video streaming may be a continuous transmission of video files from a server to a client. Video streaming enables users to look at videos online without having to download them. Streamed video content can include movies, TV shows, YouTube videos, and livestreamed content. Netflix and Hulu have had a lot of success streaming videos to their subscribers.\nThe term “streaming” refers to the continual transmission of audio and video files from a server to a client. In video streams, content is shipped in a compressed form over the web and is displayed by the viewer in real time. The media is shipped during a continuous stream of knowledge and is played because it arrives. The user needs a player, which may be a special programme that uncompresses and sends video data to the display and audio data to speakers. Some samples of media players include Windows Media Player 12 for Windows 10 or QuickTime Player for\nHow does video streaming work?\nVideo streams normally begin with a prerecorded media file hosted on a foreign server. Once the server receives a client request, the information contained within the video file is compressed and sent to the requesting device in pieces. Audio and video files are broken into data packets, where each packet contains a little piece of knowledge. To exchange data over a network, a transmission protocol, most often Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP), is used. Once the requesting client receives the info packets, a video player on the user’s end will decompress the info and interpret the video and audio. The video files are automatically deleted once they are played.\nTCP is usually the more reliable protocol. However, UDP features a faster TRM. While UDP is employed when speed takes precedence over reliability, TCP is employed when reliability takes precedence. Many consumer streaming services use TCP, for instance, while UDP is compatible for video conferencing.Video streams are usually sent from a prerecorded video file, but they will even be distributed as a part of a live broadcast feed. During a live broadcast, the video signal is converted into a compressed digital signal and transmitted from a special web server that multicasts, or sends an equivalent file to multiple users at an equivalent time, for more info click here ดูหนังออนไลน์\nUsers can stream from their desktop computers, smartphones, tablets, and smart TVs, or through other devices like Chromecast or Apple TV. Different applications are often used to stream videos like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ or Twitch.

{"question":"Which requires more maintenance to reduce noise: an air source heat pump or a refrigerator?","answer":"Refrigerators require more regular maintenance to reduce noise, needing periodic unplugging and thorough cleaning of condenser coils, proper leveling with the floor, and regular internal cleaning to minimize noise levels. In contrast, air source heat pumps come with built-in noise reduction features like anti-vibration foot packages and specially designed fan blades, requiring less ongoing maintenance specifically for noise reduction.","context":["Keep reading to learn more about the pros and cons of air source heat pumps, so you can decide if getting one is the right choice for you. air source heat pumps are efficient both in winter and summer, thanks to an excellent SCOP (seasonal coefficient of performance). The COP of a heat pump is a way of measuring its efficiency by comparing the energy input needed to produce heat with the amount of heat produced. A figure of “seasonal COP” is adjusted for seasonality.\nFor those who are new to renewable heating systems, an air-source heat pump draws heat from outside air, even at temperatures as low as -20 to -25 degrees C, and converts it into energy that can power your home's heating and hot water. The system includes a fan that is installed on your property. The fan passes air through an exchange coil containing cooling fluid. This liquid boils and turns into steam, which is then compressed at high temperature to feed the heating and hot water.\nSamsung is one of the best-known brands in the world, manufacturing everything from phones to televisions and, yes, air source heat pumps for your home. Samsung invested heavily in research and development of renewable energy technology and has manufactured one of the most efficient, powerful and competitively priced air source heat pumps in the form of EHS Monoblock. What we love about the EHS monoblock is that, along with its efficiency and power of 16 kW, it is also one of the smallest units you can buy, about 40% lighter and more compact than the average competitor. By investing in a Samsung air source heat pump, you can be sure that the company will be present throughout the life of your heat pump and that it has excellent customer support.\nSamsung's 16 kW Monoblock EHS Air Source Heat Pump is composed of an inverter compressor that works according to the external temperature. The outdoor unit is lightweight and compact, which not only makes installation easier and cheaper, but is also more discreet in your property. The slim design also helps reduce sound. As a result, the EHS Monobloc is extremely quiet and produces an acoustic power of 66 dBA.\nThe high-end EHS monoblock has a heat output of 16 kW and 14 kW for summer cooling. The hot water can be heated up to 65°C, which is suitable for almost any use. The unit can also operate in temperatures as low as -25°C and as high as 35°C, making it perfectly suitable for anywhere you live in the UK. The Yutaki S80 system comes with a controller and anti-vibration foot package to help further reduce sound.\nYou can also purchase an optional cylindrical tank of 185 or 250 liters, temperature sensors and a three-way motorized valve for heating domestic hot water, as well as for space heating. Vaillant manufactures a range of UniStor hot water cylinders for use with Vaillant heat pumps. Capacities range from 150 to 300 litres, and cylinders are made of 100% recyclable stainless steel. The units also come with a 25-year warranty.\nThe best thing about Altherma air source heat pumps is that they can operate at extremely low temperatures. In fact, all heat pumps in Daikin's Altherma range can operate in conditions as low as -20 °C. At the same time, Altherma heat pumps can produce hot water at temperatures from 55°C to 80°C, depending on the unit you purchase. It doesn't usually drop to -25°C in the UK (except in some parts of Scotland), but having an air-source heat pump system that can operate at such low temperatures and still produce hot water and heat energy efficient gives you plenty of peace of mind during the winter months.\nThe F2040 range of air-to-water heat pumps is one of the company's most popular products, not only because of its easy installation, but also because of its low operating temperature, generous production and the company's excellent customer service. Nibe offers a wide range of accessories for use with its F2040 models (F2040-6, -8, -12 and -1). These range from control modules to better integrate your air conditioning system at home to wall mounting brackets and ventilation units with heat recovery. Nibe also manufactures optional stainless steel hot water cylinders.\nThe Nibe F2040 range is so popular because it is really the best air source heat pump for small and medium properties. The units themselves are very compact, reducing the amount of space they consume on your property. Can also be wall mounted to free up floor space. In addition, the F2040 models only need 150 mm of free space from any wall next to which it can be installed, and 1 meter of open space in front of the unit.\nThis gives you a lot of flexibility in a small space. People also love the attention to detail in the design. Fan blades are designed to move air with low noise, while anti-vibration connections also help make the F2040 one of the quietest air source heat pumps you can buy. And with options ranging from 8.7 to 15.8 kW, it should produce a lot of heat, even in cold temperatures, to heat the average UK terrace.\nTaking all these factors into account, Samsung tops our list. The South Korean firm may not have the legacy of firms like Daikin or Vaillant in this market, but it has brought its design creativity and technological prowess to an increasingly crowded market and has created a unit that offers the best of all worlds. Your EHS monoblock system is powerful, energy efficient, compact and backed by a seven-year warranty. And with an aggressive pricing structure that makes it affordable for most consumers, the Samsung EHS Monoblock stands out above the rest.\nOf course, other homeowners have more specific needs. That's why we've explored the entire market to find the best air source heat pumps for those who need something more powerful or more efficient. Or maybe you live somewhere where it's cold all year round and you want the most efficient heat pump for your climate. While this may seem like a lot of money, remember that you will make this initial investment over time by reducing energy bills and UK government payments through the Renewable Heat Incentive Program.\nSince the average air source heat pump should last 20-25 years, your system should easily pay for itself at the end of its life. Air source heat pumps use four times less energy than a traditional gas boiler to supply the same amount of heat to your home. This means you can save up to £300 or more per year on your energy bills while reducing your carbon footprint. In addition, unlike ground source heat pumps or even solar panels, the installation of air source heat pumps is much simpler and cheaper.\nHere, our HVAC professionals share what they consider to be the best air source heat pumps that many homeowners are very happy with. Lennox (the manufacturer) is a company that manufactures some of the best air source heat pumps on the market. Your XP 25 model is Energy Star certified and comes with a 10-year limited warranty that includes the compressor. If you have a zoned system in your home, this is probably one of the best air source heat pumps you can choose.\nIt also uses a Puron refrigerant that does not deplete the ozone layer, making it an eco-friendly option. Sometimes the best air source heat pumps are those that are economical. And that is exactly the case with the Comfortmaker NXHP model. It has a single-stage scroll compressor, which makes this unit quite quiet.\nWhen it comes to the best air source heat pumps, size does matter. However, a larger unit doesn't necessarily mean better for your home. Here's what happens: Even if you buy the best air source heat pumps for your home, without proper installation, it won't matter too much. For those of you who are trying to figure out if an air source heat pump is suitable for your needs, we have prepared a table with all the pros and cons, followed by more details about each of them.\nCold weather heat pumps are standard split system heat pumps that can operate effectively even when outdoor temperatures are below freezing. The acronym for Energy Star for these pumps is CCashP, which stands for air source heat pump for cold weather. If you are moving to a new construction or if you need to replace your boiler and you live in a medium-sized house, this is probably the best air source heat pump for you. For large heating needs, you can even install up to seven FlexoTherm Vaillant heat pumps together, which, together with the AroCollect unit, will provide maximum efficiency and reliability.\nTherefore, most installers suggest the 5-ton unit for a cold climate and the 3.5-ton heat pump for a milder climate. Geothermal heat pumps, which also control humidity, can reduce your home's energy use by 25 to 50 percent compared to a conventional heating and cooling system. Like any heating system, whether traditional or renewable, the cost really depends on a number of factors, such as the size and location of your home, and your overall heating needs. Too big: energy is wasted and a heat pump that is too large runs in short cycles, which can damage the system and lead to premature mechanical failure.\nIf you live in a small property with a terrace or have a small garden, this is one of the best heat pumps in the UK for you. The most efficient ones are an incredible SEER over 24 years old, and all major brands (Lennox, Carrier, Trane, Rheem and even Goodman) make heat pumps with efficiencies of 20 SEER or more. There is a table of annual heating savings and costs by HSPF that shows comparisons of heat pump costs between SEER common efficiency units. This is because they rely exclusively on outside air, and as the temperature drops, so does the total heat output that the pump can produce.\nAlthough central air heat pumps are rugged and designed to withstand all types of weather, frost can be particularly complicated. There aren't many add-ons for air source heat pump systems; however, Samsung offers a pre-installed cylinder unit that you can buy as an extra with the EHS monoblock. . .","When shopping for a fridge freezer, one of the most important factors to consider is how quiet it is. Most manufacturers list a Noise Level – the lower numbers mean the fridge freezer is quieter. Generally, anything below 40dB is considered to be very quiet, and anything below 35dB is considered to be silent.\nFridges with an A+ energy rating tend to be quieter due to their improved insulation, so a good place to start is to narrow down your search to these models. LG, Samsung, and Bosch all have great collections of A+ fridge freezers, some of which are incredibly quiet.\nAlternatively, Liebherr are renowned for their quiet fridge freezers, with some models reaching as low as 32dB.\nNo matter which brand or model you go for, there are several tips you can use to minimise the noise your fridge freezer makes. Making sure it’s level with the floor and regularly cleaning it are both effective ways to reduce noise.\nYou should also periodically unplug it and thoroughly clean the condenser coils located at the back. Proper upkeep and maintenance can help make your fridge freezer quieter than ever.\nWhich fridge is the most silent?\nThe most silent fridge on the market today is likely the Haier BRFB1050SSL 24 Inch Bottom Freezer Refrigerator. This model has a sound rating of just 38 decibels, putting it at the lower end of the sound spectrum.\nIt features fourth-generation, low-noise compressor technologies, and innovative insulation design to reduce noise and vibration. This refrigerator is also rated extremely high in terms of energy efficiency, making it both a quiet and cost-effective choice.\nAdditionally, this model features a spacious interior, with a 10. 5 cu. ft. capacity, giving users plenty of room to store their food items. With its stylish stainless steel exterior and low noise rating, the Haier BRFB1050SSL 24 Inch Bottom Freezer Refrigerator clearly stands out as one of the quietest refrigerator models available.\nWhich fridge makes less noise?\nWhen it comes to determining which fridge makes less noise, it depends on the brand, model, and type of refrigerator. Generally, newer refrigerators tend to make less noise, as manufacturers are continuously aiming to reduce the amount of noise emitted from their products.\nSome of the most modern refrigerators even come with noise-reducing features to ensure minimal disruption in the home. Additionally, larger, more expensive fridges tend to contain more soundproofing and quieter motors that are designed to reduce the noise levels.\nWhen looking for a refrigerator that makes less noise, features like temperature adjustment and defrost settings should be taken into consideration, as these can cause extra noise. Additionally, while top-freezer and side-by-side models are typically louder than bottom-freezers, all refrigerator types can come with different noise levels.\nTherefore, it’s best to research the features and specifications of a particular fridge before making a purchase. Some websites and retailers even provide noise level ratings for certain refrigerators, so researching the noise levels of a chosen model can be beneficial.\nAre all fridge freezers noisy?\nNo, not all fridge freezers are noisy. The level of noise can vary depending upon the make and model of the unit. Fridge freezers can range from being barely noticeable to quite loud. Some of the newer more modern models are designed to be quieter with insulated walls and vibration dampening technology.\nHigher end models usually include additional noise reduction options such as noise reducing fans and compressors that help reduce the sound output. In addition, many manufacturers have devised clever ways to dampen the noise with better insulation that help reduce sound levels.\nSince noise levels can vary greatly, it is important to look for a fridge freezer that has the appropriate noise rating to ensure a quiet appliance.\nWhat is the lowest noise level for a fridge freezer?\nThe lowest noise level for a fridge freezer can vary greatly depending on the type and age of the appliance. Generally, most modern fridges and freezers are designed to be quite quiet, with many models ranging between 35-45 decibels (dB).\nHowever, the lowest noise levels that can be obtained from a fridge freezer may depend on the brand and model of the appliance. Some high-end models feature ‘anti-noise’ technology which ensures that the noise and vibration emitted from them is reduced significantly to ensure a more silent kitchen.\nFor instance, some brands of fridges feature noise levels as low as 34 dB, making them practically silent. As always, it’s wise to do research beforehand to ensure that the appliance in question is suited for your needs, both in terms of size and noise levels.\nDo frost free fridge freezers make a noise?\nYes, frost free fridge freezers do make a noise. The noise is typically a faint humming noise that emanates from the compressor or fan motor. This noise can become more pronounced depending on how much the internal components are running to keep the fridge regulated.\nHowever, the noise should not be overly loud. If the noise is too loud, it could indicate an issue with the appliance and may need to be looked at by a repair technician to diagnose the problem.\nIs there such a thing as a silent fridge?\nYes, silent fridges do exist. Silent fridges are fridges that produce almost zero noise when operating. This makes them the ideal choice for people who want to avoid any sound interruptions or distractions during the day.\nSilent fridges usually have specially designed compressors that are highly efficient and quiet, as well as sound-absorbing insulation panels to help cut down on noise. Additionally, many silent fridges also include additional features such as LED lighting, energy-efficient performance, and adjustable temperature settings.\nIf you’re looking for a quiet fridge, a silent fridge is the perfect choice.\nIs LG refrigerator quiet?\nYes, LG refrigerators are known for being relatively quiet. LG refrigerates typically have noise ratings between 30 and 42 decibels, which is roughly the same volume as a low-level conversation. Even with the built-in ice-makers, the noise level remains reasonable and won’t disrupt your home life.\nAdditionally, LG refrigerators have additional noise-reducing features that help keep the noise at a minimum, such as the Inverter Linear Compressor and Multi-Air Flow Cooling technology. All LG refrigerators are subjected to LG’s arduous noise testing, which tests various model types in various situations and helps to ensure the noise level remains low.\nFinally, all LG refrigerator models come with an Eco Silent System to further reduce noise levels.\nHow can I make my fridge freezer quieter?\nMaking your fridge freezer quieter is possible, although the exact steps will depend on the model of your appliance. Generally, the best thing you can do to make it quieter is to keep the door closed as often as possible and to make sure it is level.\nUnevenness in a fridge or freezer can cause it to vibrate and make more noise than usual.\nAnother way to make it quieter is to clean the condenser coils. This is typically done about twice a year when you clean the inside of the fridge. The condenser coils are located at the back of the appliance and are used to dissipate heat.\nDust and dirt can accumulate on the coils and cause the motor to work harder and make more noise.\nFinally, if these methods don’t reduce the noise from your fridge freezer, you may want to take it to an appliance repair service for additional help. They may be able to identify any underlying issues that are causing your appliance to make more noise than normal and make the necessary repairs.\nIs 50 decibels loud for a refrigerator?\nIt really depends. 50 decibels is not particularly loud by most standards, but it may seem loud to some people, especially if the refrigerator is located in a quiet room. Generally speaking, a standard refrigerator will range between 40-50 decibels depending on its size.\nThe average amount of noise a person produces during normal conversation is around 60 decibels, so 50 decibels is very quiet in comparison. In general, differences of about 10 decibels are perceivable by people, so if it’s in the 40’s then it’s very quiet, but when it reaches the 50’s, it may sound quite loud to some people.\nIs 42 dB loud for a fridge freezer?\nIt depends on the context. 42 dB is louder than a normal conversation, but not overly loud – equivalent to the sound of a normal humming refrigerator. However, if it is closer to you and in a quiet room, it could be considered loud.\nIt is also worth considering that there can be variations between different models and sizes of fridge freezers; some will be noisier than others. Generally speaking, a noise level of 50 dB or less is considered quiet, while anything around 35 – 40 dB is considered very quiet.\nHow much noise is normal for a fridge?\nThe amount of noise that a fridge makes can vary depending on a few factors, such as age, brand, and type. Most refrigerators produce some level of noise, since they contain fans and compressors that cycle on and off to keep temperatures consistent.\nHowever, too much noise from a refrigerator can be a sign of a malfuntioning component. Generally, you can expect a standard refrigerator to make about forty decibels of noise, which is about the same as a low conversation at home.\nAnything above forty five decibels can be a sign of a problem. Some newer models are designed to run even quieter than that, though, so if you’re expecting quietness, you may want to check the model specs before buying.\nHow many dB is a loud fridge?\nIt is difficult to give a precise answer to this question since the volume of a fridge can vary depending on size, age and other factors. Generally speaking, a standard noisy refrigerator is usually around 40 to 50 dB, while a whisper is generally around 30 dB.\nThat being said, it can be difficult to accurately measure the exact sound level of a refrigerator as many other sounds might be present and difficult to distinguish. Therefore, the best way to determine how loud your fridge is would be to measure it with a decibel meter.\nWhich is quieter 40 dB or 50 dB?\nThe answer depends on the context and the environment in which the sound is being heard. Generally, decibels (dB) is a measurement of sound intensity. Generally, the higher number means the louder sound, so the 50dB sound would be louder than the 40dB sound.\nHowever, the exact difference in sound intensity between the two dB levels would require more information regarding the sound pressure and the location in which the sound is being heard. A difference of 10 decibels can make a substantial difference in perceived noise; therefore, the overall 34dB level can vary widely in loudness or quietness.\nWhat DB is a quiet fridge freezer?\nA quiet fridge freezer is an energy efficient refrigerator or freezer that has been designed to be as quiet as possible when in use. This type of DB typically has a noise level of less than 40 decibels, which is about the same noise level as a whisper.\nQuiet fridge freezers also typically have advanced insulation technology that helps to keep sound levels low. This type of DB may also have low vibration technology built in to keep noise from entering the home.\nAdditionally, a quiet fridge freezer may be designed to use a compressor-less cooling method that further reduces noise and energy consumption. Quiet fridge freezers are ideal for smaller homes and apartments, as they provide the convenience of having a refrigerator or freezer without sacrificing your peace and quiet."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dd5b8e3e-6042-4190-9b62-c0238ca94538>","<urn:uuid:4ed96309-4fd0-4a05-ab2b-0d711071ec84>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm approaching advanced reproductive age and want to preserve my fertility. What does the egg extraction process for embryo freezing involve?","answer":"The egg extraction process begins with hormone treatment to ensure correct ovulation, followed by fertility medications to increase egg production. At the hospital, a doctor extracts the eggs using ultrasound guidance for accuracy. These eggs can then either be frozen immediately or fertilized through in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In IVF, eggs are exposed to sperm and cultured for 16-20 hours, while in ICSI, a single sperm is injected directly into an egg. An embryologist monitors the resulting embryos' development for 6 days before selecting suitable ones for implantation or freezing.","context":["Embryo freezing is a procedure that allows embryos to be preserved for later use. The first successful pregnancy resulting from freezing a woman’s healthy embryos was in the 1980s. Since then, many embryos have been frozen for later use. The embryos may be stored to enable a future pregnancy, to donate to others, for medical research or for training purposes. The process begins by using hormones and other medications to stimulate the production of potentially fertile eggs. The eggs are then extracted from the woman’s ovaries to either be fertilized in a lab or frozen for later use.\nSuccessful fertilization may lead to at least one healthy embryo, which can then be transferred to the woman’s womb or uterus. Hopefully, the embryo will develop and the woman can carry the developing infant through pregnancy to a live birth. Since fertilization often results in more than one embryo, the remaining embryos can be preserved through freezing.\nWhat is an embryo, and how is one created?\nA human embryo is created when an egg is fertilized. According to the Oxford Living Dictionaries, an embryo is “a human offspring during the period from approximately the second to the eighth week after fertilization.” Before freezing can take place, suitable embryos have to be created. To create an embryo in the laboratory, the eggs must first be harvested and fertilized. First, the woman will be given hormones to make sure she ovulates correctly. She is then given fertility medications to increase the number of eggs she produces.\nIn the hospital, a doctor will extract the eggs, using an ultrasound machine to ensure accuracy. The eggs may be frozen or used at once. If the woman wishes to become pregnant at once, in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) may be used to fertilize the egg. During the process of IVF, the eggs are exposed to sperm and the mixture is cultured in a laboratory. Fertilization may take 16 to 20 hours. The fertilized eggs are called embryos.\nAn embryologist will monitor the development of the embryos over the next 6 days, after which a suitable embryo may be chosen for implantation. In ICSI, once the eggs have been extracted, a single sperm is injected directly into an egg. This may be done if there is a problem with the sperm or if past attempts at IVF have been unsuccessful. While one embryo can be used for pregnancy, others may be frozen.\nHow is an embryo frozen?\nThe main goal of embryo freezing is to preserve the embryo for later use. The biggest problem is the water within the cells. When water freezes, crystals can form. This expansion can burst the cell, causing it to die.\nTo prevent this happening, the water in the embryo’s cells is replaced with a protective substance called a cryoprotectant. The embryos are left to incubate in increasing levels of cryoprotectant before they are frozen.\nOnce most of the water has been removed, the embryo is cooled to its preservation state through one of two methods of embryo freezing:\nSlow freezing: This involves protecting the embryos from damage in sealed tubes and then slowly lowering the temperature in the tubes. This prevents the embryo cells from aging and becoming damaged. Embryos can last much longer in their frozen state than in their fresh state. However, slow freezing is time-consuming, and it requires expensive machinery. Vitrification: In this process, the cryoprotected embryos are frozen so quickly that the water molecules in the embryos do not have time to form ice crystals. This helps to protect the embryos and to increase their survival rate during thawing.\nAfter freezing, the embryos are stored in liquid nitrogen until they are needed for future use.\nSuccess rates of thawing frozen embryos\nThe process of thawing an embryo is relatively successful. Some research has indicated that embryos frozen through vitrification have a better chance of survival, both at the freezing stage and during thawing.\nSide effects of embryo freezing\nAny risks and side effects involved in embryo freezing usually happen during the process of extracting the eggs from the woman’s body. Common side effects from extracting embryos for freezing are typically mild and temporary.\n- Cramping or bloating\n- Feelings of fullness\n- Changes in vaginal discharge\n- Overstimulation of the ovaries\nHow long can embryos be frozen for?\nEmbryos are stored in liquid nitrogen\nIn theory, a correctly frozen embryo can remain viable indefinitely. The embryos are held in sealed containers at temperatures of -321ºF. At this temperature, almost no biological processes such as aging can occur.\nThere are examples of successful pregnancies that have resulted from eggs that had been stored for up to 10 years. There is no long-term research into embryo freezing, because this procedure has only been carried out since 1983. Some countries choose to regulate the length of time an embryo can be stored. Freezing and storing embryos is also expensive, and each clinic has its own rules about what happens if a woman can no longer use her own embryos or keep them frozen.\nFrozen or fresh embryos?\nA study posted in the International Journal of Reproductive Medicine looked at the results of over 1,000 cases of embryo transfer using either fresh or frozen embryos. The results found no statistical difference between using fresh and frozen embryos for transfer. The study noted that frozen embryos could also be used for additional embryo transfers in the future while fresh embryos could not.\nOther research suggests that frozen embryo transfer may be better than with fresh embryos. A recent study compared fresh and frozen embryo transfer. The results indicate that frozen embryo transfer is associated with a higher rate of pregnancy, and better outcomes for both the mother and the embryo.\nWho is embryo freezing best for?\nEmbryo freezing can be used by any woman, but there are certain groups who may find it more beneficial than others. These include women with genetic disorders of ovarian sensitivities, those who are due to undergo chemotherapy, and those who take medications that affect fertility. Women who are approaching advanced reproductive age and are not ready for children yet may also benefit from freezing embryos for later use.\nBy Jon Johnson\nBy Suzanne Falck, MD, FACP Knowledge center"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:91775b7d-baa7-400f-9a3d-aa0a1621c3c0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How to maintain bedtime routines when a parent is ill?","answer":"When illness prevents normal bedtime routines, there are two main approaches: Either have another caregiver (like a grandparent or babysitter) follow the regular routine as closely as possible, or create a modified temporary routine that the ill parent can manage, such as reading to the child in a chair instead of in bed. It's important to maintain some form of routine as it helps children feel safe and secure.","context":["Information central for parenting with breast cancer.\nTaking Care of Your Family\nPreserving Continuity and Routine\nChildren thrive on routine. It makes them feel safe and secure. Lots of change, on the other hand, can make kids anxious and agitated. When you have breast cancer, maintaining a routine can be difficult at a time when your kids need it most. You can help keep your kids feeling safe and secure by minimizing change, reassuring them, sharing control, and limiting surprises.\nMinimize change. Disruption in family routines is inevitable when a mother has breast cancer. Treating this disease is much like taking on a second job, so moms need help carrying on with the family’s daily activities. Here are some tips for minimizing the changes to our children’s routines:\nTransportation - Try to keep some continuity in the people who help transport your children. For example, instead of having a different person drive your children to school every day, try to have one person drive the kids to school for a week.\nMeals - You can help keep mealtime familiar even when friends and family members offer to cook for you. Many moms are reluctant to give people direction about cooking for their family because they fear offending the cook or appearing ungrateful. Yet most volunteer cooks will be happy to have some direction. They want your family to enjoy the meal they prepare for you. Here are a few suggestions:\n- Be frank with volunteer cooks. Tell them what your children will (and won’t) eat. You can say, “I am so grateful that you’ve offered to cook for us. You should know up front that my kids are very picky eaters. I don’t want you to go to a lot of trouble to prepare something they won’t eat. Would you like some suggestions about what to make?”\n- Suggest food combinations that your children are used to eating. You can say, “Tacos would be terrific. My kids love them! They would be especially happy if you would include some corn. I always serve corn when we have tacos, and I know that familiar touch would make them especially happy.”\n- Offer the brand names of specific products. You might say, “If you’re making a special trip to the store, my kids really like Prego Traditional spaghetti sauce. That would be a great choice.”\n- Post information online. If you use the internet to communicate with your helpers, you can give them information about meal suggestions, brand names, food allergies and intolerances, and even some favorite recipes. See Online Communication in the Resources section of this website.\nOf course, don’t get carried away with making demands on people who are kind enough to cook for you. Only you can prepare familiar meals exactly the way your children like them. Your kids will get used to trying new or differently prepared foods. If you’re up to it, consider thanking the cook by phone, e-mail, or with a brief note in the mail.\nBedtime - Routines make bedtime easier for the whole family, and they help your child feel safe and secure. If your illness prevents you from carrying on with your normal routine, try changing either the routine or the person who does it (such as your partner, a grandparent, or a babysitter).\nIn other words, it’s easier for your children if Grandma does her best to follow your child’s regular bedtime routine. Alternatively, come up with a temporary routine that you’re capable of doing yourself, such as reading to your child in a chair instead of reading to him in bed.\nReassure them. Reassure your children that their needs will be met, that you still love them, and that most of the changes related to your illness will be temporary. While this may be obvious to adults, children need reassurance about these basic facts. They have rich imaginations that can attach mistaken meaning to changes in routine. Your children may need to hear reassurances like these:\n“I love you as much as ever, even if the way I show you my love changes for awhile.”\n“I will make sure that you have everything you need, I just may not be able to do it for you myself.”\n“Some things might change for awhile, like who drives you places or what you have for dinner, but this won’t last forever.”\n“I can’t put you to bed tonight, but it’s not because I don’t want to or don’t love you. My heart wants to, but my body just isn’t up to it right now.”\nBesides talking to your kids, you can reassure them with your actions. Put an unexpected note in their lunch boxes or send them periodic e-mail messages. You can even send younger kids a note in the mail. They will be thrilled to tear open a letter addressed to them, even if it comes from someone in their own house.\nShare control. Being in control helps people feel secure. You can share this feeling with your children by giving them some control over the changes in your household. You can share control by offering choices and by inviting open-ended discussions.\n- Offer choices. You can include younger children in decision-making by giving them limited choices. Only offer choices that are realistic and that you can accept.\nYou might say something like this: “I can’t take you to practice tomorrow because I have an appointment with my doctor. Would you rather have Mike’s mom or Ben’s mom drive you?”\nYour child might not want to make a decision, or he might insist that you drive. You can say, “I really want to drive you, too, but it’s just not going to be possible tomorrow. Would you like to decide or should I decide for you?”\n- Invite open-ended discussions. Older children can be included in open-ended conversations about some changes that will affect the family. Be sure to discuss the issue with your partner first, so you agree in advance on what outcomes will be acceptable to you both.\nThis is an example: “My doctor doesn’t want me to go on our hiking trip later this month. Dad and I talked about it, and we had a few ideas. We could postpone the trip until next year or you could go without me. We could also go somewhere closer to home instead. What do you think we should do?”\nLimit surprises. While it’s not always possible, informing kids about changes in advance makes the changes easier to accept. (Be cautious with telling younger kids about potentially scary changes, like upcoming surgery. By giving them too much notice, they have a lot of time to worry.)\nGiving your kids a calendar will help reduce their anxiety. A calendar keeps them informed and shows them that changes are temporary. Some kids will enjoy making a calendar with you, and some kids will want to cross off each day that passes. They’ll also have activities to look forward to, like sleepovers, playdates, and birthday parties.\nHere are some suggestions for making calendars for your family:\n- Tell your kids that events on the calendar will likely change, but that you’ll do your best to make sure they know about the changes in advance.\n- You can buy a paper calendar or a wipe-off calendar for the wall, desk, or bulletin board. You also can make one yourself. If you’d like to make a calendar, you can download one for free at www.calendarsthatwork.com or click on Calendar in the Tools section of this website.\n- These are some items to consider including in your calendar:\n- After-school activities\n- Birthday parties\n- School programs\n- Hot lunch days\n- Religious school\n- Field trips\n- If you choose to make a calendar, consider using clip art for young children. Calendars are helpful even for children who cannot read. Just seeing repeating patterns of pictures, like a soccer ball indicating soccer practice every week, is reassuring. You can find free clipart at the Microsoft website. You can also find clipart for some common children’s activities in the Tools section of this website.\n- If you make one calendar for the entire family, consider using different colors or symbols to indicate which family members participate in each activity.\n- Consider sharing the calendar with babysitters, family members, teachers, carpool drivers, and anyone else who is involved with the daily care of your children.\n- Minimize confusion by indicating when your calendar was last updated by writing “Updated on [date]” in one corner."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:70bbd29a-31b9-4877-9d6e-b54267185dc3>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What are the benefits of waste separation systems in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and what adverse environmental impacts can occur when waste is improperly managed in landfills?","answer":"Waste separation systems provide significant benefits in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as demonstrated by Xiao Er Township where implementing 'a little separation' resulted in reducing emissions by 165 tonnes of CO2 equivalent compared to no separation. Without separation, their waste would have generated 4,626 tonnes of CO2e, but with separation it was reduced to 4,461 tonnes. Regarding adverse impacts of improper waste management in landfills, these include gas and leachate generation from microbial decomposition that can cause fires, explosions, unpleasant odors, vegetation damage, ground water pollution, air pollution and global warming. The migration of gas and leachate beyond landfill boundaries presents serious environmental and health hazards.","context":["Industrialisation and urbanisation have brought a great variety of glittery commodities. However, material prosperity has its cost. Perpetual consumption results in waste piling up. When we throw garbage out of our houses, we may like to think that it vanishes forever. In reality, our waste can return quietly and punish us for our reckless behaviour. When it rots, garbage releases waste water and may also release toxic substances. Left untreated, they flow into streams, rivers and fields, get in our food and end up on our tables, resulting in food poisoning and chronic diseases…..\nWe can no longer ignore the waste problem—a product of modern civilization. Mainland China is experiencing a period of unprecedented economic growth. In the meantime, cities and towns are under siege by waste, and the situation of towns are particularly neglected. In 2006 Xiao Er Township in Gong County, Yibing, Sichuan Province was faced with such a crisis. Since there was no waste treatment system, people dumped their garbage outside of the local government office. The rubbish piled up so high that the windows of the government office were blocked and the stench was so strong that government officers simply could not ignore the problem. The local government collaborated with Partnerships for Community Development (PCD) and a pioneer pilot project on waste separation was launched in 2007. After six years of trial, most people of Xiao Er Township now attach greater importance to waste treatment and they are much more aware of the issue than before. Moreover, the volume of greenhouse gas emissions of Xiao Er has gone down which in turn contributes to improving the environment.\nIn Xiao Er, garbage is divided into dry and wet waste at source, i.e. at home. Wet waste is organic and biodegradable. It is recycled into compost and methane gas,which is then distributed to farmers around the township. Compost is used for farming while methane gas is used for home cooking. Other waste like plastic materials and glass are to be recycled. What remains after sorting will be disposed of in a landfill.\nPCD Emphasises on Environment Education\nPCD has been giving support to the project mainly by supporting environmental education organised in the form of community activities in which local people reflect on the relationship between consumption, the waste problem and everyday life in modern society. In the process, concepts of sustainable living are promoted. While the local government is responsible for the clearing and burial of garbage as well as composting, PCD, which has injected an equal amount of capital into the project, provides supervision. Funds from the government are mainly used for human power, clearing and transportation of waste as well as fixed assets such as garbage trucks, while those from PCD are mainly used for training, workshops and environmental education.\nAfter six years of trial, PCD commissioned the Sustainable Research and Education Centre of the College of Architecture and Environment of Sichuan University to study Xiao Er Township's waste separation and treatment project in terms of economic cost, characteristics of the local people’s waste separation behaviour and attitude, and the impact of the programme in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The study was completed last year. Detailed scientific data output and recommendations were provided.\nAccording to the study, the impact of the project includes the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which is the most meaningful part regarding the mitigation of global warming. Based on the volume of garbage generated and types of waste classified, the study divides waste treatment systems into four forecast scenarios—“no separation”, “a little separation”, “medium level of separation”, and “ advanced level of separation”. The volume of greenhouse gas emissions is estimated for each scenario. The waste separation system of Xiao Er Township belongs to the second type, i.e. “a little separation”. In 2011, a total volume of 4,753 tonnes of waste was generated in Xiao Er. The study estimates that if there were no waste separation system, the volume of greenhouse gas emissions would be 4,626 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) . It is estimated that after the implementation of “a little separation”, the volume of greenhouse gas emissions would be 4,461 tonnes of CO2e , a reduction of 165 tonnes of CO2e.\nPositive Impact Recorded Six Years Later\nAccording to the study, the economic cost of waste separation is low, helping reduce the final cost of waste treatment. The cost includes clearing and transportation of waste, terminal processing (infrastructures for landfill, composting and methane gas production), management, project supervision and staff expenses, community publicity and education, external experts and capacity building, etc. Between 2007 and 2012, the cost of implementing waste separation was RMB 110/tonne which was lower than the cost of non-separated waste treatment (which includes clearing, transportation and final disposal) in other cities in mainland China. For example, in Huizhou City in Guangdong Province, the cost of waste treatment was RMB 163.44/tonne in 2004-2005. In 2012, the local government of Xiamen City paid RMB170 for each tonne of waste incinerated.\nIn Xiao Er Township, recycling waste has not brought direct economic benefits to the civic authority because the compost and methane gas are provided to farmers free of charge. There are, however, indirect economic benefits. The number of recycled waste collectors in the township has increased from two to eight.\nUsing questionnaires, the researchers interviewed 182 Xiao Er residents among whom 67% responded that their families had been dividing their garbage into wet and dry waste according to instructions given to them. Only 11.5% of those interviewed had not been sorting their garbage. In terms of their attitude towards waste separation, both positive and negative responses were recorded, but the majority attitude appears to be positive. This shows that local people’s awareness of waste separation and environmental health has grown, thanks to the efforts of the local government and PCD over the last six years.\nThe study has made a number of recommendations for the continuation and future implementation of the waste separation programme. They include increasing the efficiency of waste separation, reducing the volume of waste to be cleared and transported, and reducing the volume of waste for burial. The study has also found that toxic or chemical waste (used batteries, old fluorescent light bulbs and bottles for pesticides and chemical fertilisers) has been improperly disposed of. Only one third of families dispose of these types of waste separately. Some families even dump them into natural watercourses, causing pollution. It is recommended that education and publicity in this matter be strengthened.\nThe experience of waste separation in Xiao Er Township shows that garbage treatment is everyone’s responsibility. Everyone contributes to garbage creation every day. If the waste is not treated appropriately, our holistic health will be affected. The effort of any one government department or organisation is not enough, in itself, to solve the garbage problem. Everyone must take part in solving the problem since we all play a part in creating it.\nAccording to Dr. Lu Hong-yan of the Laboratory of Solid Waste Reuse at Sichuan University, we should not use a single, intensive method to deal with our waste problem, such as burying all the garbage in one place. This is not sustainable because the landfill would very soon be filled up. A long term, sustainable strategy is to have a system that combines different methods of waste treatment, including the reduction of garbage at source (for example, reducing packaging and use of plastic bags), separating the waste generated, and recycling garbage. Only the waste that remains after this process should be sent to landfill.\nPCD has produced a short film on the experience of waste separation in Xiao Er Township and sustainable approaches to waste treatment. The title of the film is “Reversed Assault” which is a term used by online game players to emphasise the importance of positive energy and the spirit to strive for improvement. It was chosen as the title of the film to describe waste treatment plans that are community-based and start from grassroots level. Although grassroots people have limited power at the individual level, when they collectively and determinedly exert themselvesin practising sustainable living , they are powerful enough for a “reversed assault”. The idea behind the waste separation system combining various methods was explained in detail by Dr. Lu Hong-yan in the film.\nPlease click the link below to watch “Reversed Assault”, a film about the experience of waste separation in Xiao Er Township and other efforts made by the grassroots to address the waste problem: http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNTQ2MzU1OTYw.html\n+ Click thumbnail to enlarge photo\n- Volume of carbon emission is used to measure the total volume of all types of greenhouse gas generated by human activities and in production or consumption of a certain commodity. It involves mainly the consumption of fossil fuels such as gasoline in our everyday activities or in the production of goods and use of electricity, and the generation of other greenhouse gases such as methane or N2O produced by organic waste. The unit of measurement of carbon emissions is t CO2-eq/yr which is equivalent to metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emission per annum. Since there are other kinds of greenhouse gases apart from carbon dioxide (such as methane), other gases are converted into equivalent volume of carbon dioxide emissions to show their impact on greenhouse effect. That is why t CO2-eq/yr is used.\n- The volume of greenhouse gas emissions in Xiao Er Township after waste separation was implemented is calculated by adding volume of greenhouse gas emissions generated from recycling waste to the volume of greenhouse gas emissions when residual waste is treated in landfill.","Environmental Impacts Of Solid Waste Landfilling\nInevitable consequences of the practice of solid waste disposal in landfills are gas and leachate generation due primarily to microbial decomposition, climatic conditions, refuse characteristics and landfilling operations. The migration of gas and leachate away from the landfill boundaries and their release into the surrounding environment present serious environmental concerns at both existing and new facilities. Besides potential health hazards, these concerns include, and are not limited to, fires and explosions, vegetation damage, unpleasant odors, landfill settlement, ground water pollution, air pollution and global warming. This paper presents an overview of gas and leachate formation mechanisms in landfills and their adverse environmental impacts, and describes control methods to eliminate or minimize these impacts.\nTable of Contents\n- Title Page\n- Table of Content\n- 1.1 Background of the Study\n- 1.2 Statement of the Problem\n- 1.3 Objective of the Study\n- 1.4 Research Hypotheses\n- 1.5 Significance of the Study\n- 1.6 Scope and Limitation of the Study\n- 1.7 Definition of Terms\n- 1.8 Organization of the Study\nReview of Related Literature\n- 2.1 Introduction\n- 2.2 Types of Solid Waste\n- 2.3 Methods of Managing Waste\n- 2.4 Theoretical Review: Integrated Sustainable Waste Management\n- 2.5 Stakeholders and Participation\n- 2.6 Conceptual Reviews; Wastes and Solid Wastes\n- 2.7 Management and Solid Waste Management\n- 2.8 Obstacle to Waste Management\n- 2.9 Landfill Development, Operations and Management in Lagos\n- 2.10 Municipal Waste Disposal and Landfill\n- 3.1 Introduction\n- 3.2 Sources of Data Collection\n- 3.3 Population of the Study\n- 3.4 Sample and Sampling Procedure\n- 3.5 Instrument for Data Collection\n- 3.6 Validation of the Research Instrument\n- 3.7 Method of Data Analysis\nPresentation Analysis Interpretation of Data\nSummary Conclusion and Recommendation\n- 5.1 Introduction\n- 5.2 Summary\n- 5.3 Conclusion\n- 5.4 Recommendation\n1.1 Background of the study\nThe Solid wastes comprise all the wastes arising from human and animal activities that are normally solid, discarded as useless or unwanted. Also included are by- products of process lines or materials that may be required by law to be disposed of (Okecha 2000). Solid waste can be classified in a number of ways, on the basis of sources, environmental risks, utility and physical property.\nOn the basis of source, solid wastes are again classified as: Municipal Solid Wastes, Industrial Solid Wastes and Agricultural Solid Wastes. Nigeria’s major urban centres are today fighting to clear mounting heaps of solid waste from their environments. These strategic centres of beauty, peace and security are being overtaken by the messy nature of over flowing dumps unattended heaps of solid wastes emanating from household or domestic or kitchen sources, markets, shopping and business centres. Solid Waste Landfills.\nCity officials appear unable to combat unlawful and haphazard dumping of hazardous commercial and industrial wastes which are a clear violation of the clean Air and Health Edicts in our environmental sanitation laws, rules and regulation. Refuse generation and its likely effects on the health, quality of environment and the urban landscape have become burning national issues in Nigeria today. All stakeholders concern with the safety and the beautification of our environment have come to realise the negative consequences of uncleared solid human wastes found in residential neighbourhoods, markets, schools, and central business districts in our cities. These solid wastes have become recurring features in our urban environment. It is no longer in doubt that our cities are inundated with the challenges of uncleared solid wastes. As a result, urban residents are often confronted with the hazardous impact to their collective health and safety. The hue and cry over the health consequences of exposed and fermenting rubbish have not been quantified, although their impact is noticeable, especially in times of epidemic in congested activity nuclei civic centres, CBDS, neigbhourhoods, etc.\nA United Nations Report (August 2004) noted with regret that while developing countries are improving access to clean drinking water they are falling behind on sanitation goals. At one of its summit in 2000 (Uwaegbelun 2004) revealed that The World Health Organization- (WHO 2004) and United Nations International Children Education Fund- (UNICEF 2004) joint report in August 2004 that: “about 2.4 billion people will likely face the risk of needless disease and death by the target of 2015 because of bad sanitation”. The report also noted that bad sanitation – decaying or non-existent sewage system and toilets- fuels the spread of diseases like cholera and basic illness like diarrhea, which kills a child every 21 seconds. The hardest hit by bad sanitation is rural poor and residents of slum areas in fast-growing cities, mostly in Africa and Asia . Solid Waste Landfills.\nAlthough there is no immediate danger from the methane emitted in atmosphere from landfills, over time it could accumulate inside the landfill mass, thus increasing its concentration with attendant potential to modify the Earth’s climate. 36 percent of human caused methane releases come from our municipal solid waste landfills (USEPA, 1999). A ton of municipal solid waste land-filled produces 123 pounds of methane- a potent greenhouse gas, 20 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (EA, 2008). Hulme et al. (1995) list the adverse impacts of the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to include: a threat to disrupt the diversity of habitats and the life dependent on them. In particular, our health, agriculture, water resources, forests, wildlife, and coastal areas are vulnerable to the changes that global warming may bring. It further state that a rise of only a few degrees in the Earth’s average temperature could result in more frequent and intense storms, flooding of beaches, bay marshes, and other low-lying coastal areas; more precipitation in some areas and not enough in others and wider distribution of certain infectious diseases. Such significant changes, note NEST (1991), Hulme et al. (1995) and Nicholson (2001) could damage communities and national economies as well as alter the natural world.\nDeveloping countries like Nigeria are particularly at risk because of her bad waste management system and unhealthy disposal practices. The problem of solid waste disposal is one of the most serious environmental problems facing many cities in Nigeria. Waste management plays an integral role in human activities. Various ways of managing solid waste includes disposal by either burying or burning, reduce or reusing, recycling and energy generation. Solid waste management differs in developing countries like Nigeria and in industrialized countries of the world like Germany. Several factors are responsible for the differences, a good example of these are the types of waste generated in developing countries. Contreau (1982) submitted that, in developing countries, there is much high proportion of organic and considerably less plastic waste such that the large amount of organic material makes the waste denser with greater moisture and smaller particles.\n1.2 Statement of the Problem\nDeveloping country like Nigeria is particularly at risk, because of her bad waste management system and unhealthy disposal practices. Global temperature will continue to increase causing further disruption to climate patterns. Ultimately, all this can only be brought under control by engaging in sustainable waste management practices, and stabilizing greenhouse gases concentrations in the atmosphere. It is on this backdrop that the researcher intends to investigate the impact of solid waste on land fill in Nigeria.\n1.3 Objective of the Study\n- To investigate the effect of solid waste management practice on the environment.\n- To determine the effect of solid waste land fill on the environment\n- To appraise the strategy for effective solid waste land fill management practice\n- To determine the management practices of Nigeria for effective solid waste management land fill\n1.4 Research Hypotheses\nFor the successful completion of the study, the following hypotheses were formulated:\n- H0: solid waste land fill has no significant impact on the environment\nH1: solid waste land fill has a significant impact on the environment\n- H0: there is no significant relationship between solid waste land fill emission and environmental pollution\nH2: there is a significant relationship between solid waste land fill emission and environmental pollution.\n1.5 Significance of the Study\nThe study shall provide a structural study on solid waste\nIt shall investigate the effect of solid waste on the environment\nThe study shall analyze strategies for effective waste management practice. It shall provide a reference source of information for environmental experts. It is believed that at the completion of the study, the findings will be of great importance to the ministry of environment in ensuring that the environment is devoid of pollution. The findings will also be of great benefit to the waste management agency in ensuring that the waste are properly disposed to ensure that it does not constitute a major air pollution in the society. The study will also be of importance to researcher who wishes to carry out investigation in similar topic. Finally, the study will be of importance to lecturers, students, teachers and academia’s as the findings will add to the pool of knowledge.\n1.6 Scope and Limitation of the Study\nThe scope of the study covers the impact of solid waste land fill in Nigeria but in the cause of the study, the researcher encounters some constrain which limited the scope of the study;\n(a) Availability of Research Material:\nThe research material available to the researcher is insufficient, thereby limiting the study.\nThe time frame allocated to the study does not enhance wider coverage as the researcher has to combine other academic activities and examinations with the study.\nThe finance available for the research work does not allow for wider coverage as resources are very limited as the researcher has other academic bills to cover.\n1.7 Definition of Terms\nA landfill site (also known as a tip, dump, rubbish dump, garbage dump or dumping ground and historically as a midden) is a site for the disposal of waste materials by burial and the oldest form of waste treatment (although the burial part is modern; historically, refuse was just left in piles or thrown into pits). Historically, landfills have been the most common method of organized waste disposal and remain so in many places around the world.\nLand, sometimes referred to as dry land, is the solid surface of the Earth that is not permanently covered by water. The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support agriculture, habitat, and various natural resources.\nWaste is any substance which is discarded after primary use, or it is worthless, defective and of no use. Examples include municipal solid waste(household trash/refuse), hazardous waste, wastewater (such as sewage, which contains bodily wastes (feces and urine) and surface runoff), radioactive waste, and others\nThe American Public Liquid Association in 1975 defined solid waste as unwanted and useless material with insufficient liquid content to be free flowing, because of its sticky nature, solid waste has the ability to accumulating and physically insulting and degrading the environment if not well managed.\n1.8 Organization of the Study\nThis research work is organized in five chapters, for easy understanding, as follows.\n- Chapter one is concern with the introduction, which consist of the (background of the study), statement of the problem, objectives of the study, research questions, research hypotheses, significance of the study, scope of the study etc.\n- Chapter two being the review of the related literature presents the theoretical framework, conceptual framework and other areas concerning the subject matter.\n- Chapter three is a research methodology covers deals on the research design and methods adopted in the study.\n- Chapter four concentrate on the data collection and analysis and presentation of finding.\n- Chapter five gives summary, conclusion, and recommendations made of the study.\nSummary Conclusion and Recommendation\nIt is important to ascertain that the objective of this study was to ascertain the land use policy and tourism development in Nigeria.\nIn the preceding chapter, the relevant data collected for this study were presented, critically analyzed and appropriate interpretation given. In this chapter, certain recommendations made which in the opinion of the researcher will be of benefits in addressing the challenges of land use policy and how to develop tourism in Nigeria.\nWaste management plays an integral role in human activity. The overall view of solid waste management is to collect, treat and dispose solid waste by urban dwellers in an environmentally and socially satisfactory manner. Until recently, Nigerians have not been particularly concerned about proper waste management, open dumping and open burning in unapproved locations has been the norms. The constraints to effective solid waste management are not limited to lack of policy or laws, but poor infrastructure, education, social awareness of problems and solutions, and lack of institution promoting sustainable environmental actions.\nFire incidents on landfills and dumps in Nigeria, especially those involving burning tyres will continue to pose a serious risk to the health of nearby residents through prolonged or repeated exposure to the toxic chemicals they emit and the contamination of groundwater. Some of the hazardous chemical compounds emitted by burning tyres are capable of causing severe health conditions such as reproductive and developmental disorders, and cancers in humans. Effective landfill management by the operators is therefore necessary to prevent the occurrence of these fires in order to protect the environment and human health. The disposal of waste tyres should be prohibited at all landfills by thoroughly inspecting and controlling incoming waste. Buried waste should also be compacted on a regular basis to prevent hot spots from forming. Since methane is highly flammable and can pose a fire hazard, gas collection and control systems should be installed at the sites to collect landfill gas which can be flared to convert methane to gases less harmful to the environment or converted to energy. This research examines landfill emission and their impact on the environment in Nigeria and therefore calls for the need to improve on waste management practices and construct well engineered sanitary landfills to ensure the protection of human health and the environment.\nHaven successfully completed the study, the following recommendations are put forward by the researcher:\n- Strategic environmental planning of waste management practices should be put in place\n- There is need to ensure strict adherence to guidance and cost analysis of solid waste options in the area.\n- Community participation in collection, selection of sites and design of facilities is inherently essential for sustainability.\n- There is need to strengthen the work force, by recruiting more personnel in the Waste Management Authority.\n- Government should provide adequate funds for waste management personnel for the purchase of more evacuating vehicles and waste disposal containers.\n- There is need for environmental and public health education on the danger of indiscriminate waste disposal in the study area.\nEnvironmental Impacts Of Solid Waste Landfilling\nThe complete material will be sent to you in just 2 steps.\nQuick & Simple…\nMake payment of ₦3,000: through USSD Transfer, Bank Mobile App, ATM Transfer, or POS Transfer to:\n|Account No.: 0811003731|\n|Name: Samphina Academy|\n|Account Type: Current|\nOr Click Here to pay with Debit Card\n|FOR CLIENTS OUTSIDE NIGERIA:|\n|Click Here to pay with Debit Card ($15)|\n|GHANA – Make Payment of 60 GHS to MTN MoMo, 0553978005, Douglas Osabutey|\nSend the following details through Text Message or WhatsApp Messenger | +234-8143831497\n- Payment Details\n- Email Address\n- Environmental Impacts Of Solid Waste Landfilling\nThe complete material will be sent to your email address after receiving your payment information | T & C Apply\nYou may also like:\nThis research material “Environmental Impacts Of Solid Waste Landfilling” is for research purposes and should be used as a guide in developing your research project / seminar work.

{"question":"What lighting considerations differ between photographing the ocean versus capturing images on wooded nature trails?","answer":"When photographing the ocean, light management is particularly challenging due to water reflection and the ocean's inherent bluish tint. You need either cloud-free days for consistent 'noon' lighting or overcast conditions for flat light levels, and matching shots at different times can be difficult without cloud cover. In contrast, on wooded nature trails, the main lighting challenge comes from tree density creating an almost overcast effect even during bright, sunny conditions like golden hour. The ocean environment requires planning around weather conditions since you can't affect the light without professional equipment, while nature trails present a more contained but still challenging lighting environment due to the natural canopy effect of the woods.","context":["Digital video has democratized media in a way that allows most people the ability to capture beautiful images from the world they inhabit. The ocean has often been an inspirational part of our environment that sparks the creative imagination of artists in a whole range of mediums, and there are more than a few types of projects that may ask you to jump behind the camera and record images of the ocean. Here are a few tips for successfully filming this body of water for different types of digital video projects you may need it for.\nThe first thing you are going to have to remember is not only that direct contact with the ocean water will damage equipment, but the general salt air and spray that is going to characterize the environment is going to cause problems with your digital video equipment as well. You are going to need to stabilize your equipment in a way that will prevent them from actually hitting the water in any unmediated kind of way, but you will also need to protect it from the more silent risk of what is just floating in the air. Make sure to use protective coatings and covers on all equipment, especially your digital video camera. There can be internal problems, rust formation, and degenerative breakdown that can occur over multiple shoots.\nFraming the image can be difficult as the ocean itself can appears so limitless and out of context. You are going to want to rely on many of the classic composition elements used in wide shots or master shots, but you may want to focus on relevant objects to provide context. This means having part of the shore or land mass in the shot to give a reference point. You may want to maintain the open appearance, but would like to dial in to a boat or other floating mass in the water. Whatever it is, you are going to try to get another object in there to add to the shot and to make it appear as though it has real weight.\nImage balance can also be a critical issue when filming the ocean as it can be hard to stabilize an image in a weather dependent area like the beach. You may find that your normal ways of finding out whether or not an image is straight, such as the level on your tripod or monopod, are not going to be enough. The main point is that when you are pointing out at the ocean you want to make sure that the horizon appears straight in the image. If the horizon appears as a straight line across the entire frame then this will tell you if it is straight or not and will be very obvious when the image is actually viewed in the final project. The horizon should act as the permanent straight line in your project, and when it is viewed across the ocean it is going to be the only time that it is completely uninterrupted, and therefore the perfect natural manifestation of this straight line. If you have another land mass here this is also going to not only give you the audience reference point, as mentioned above, but also a compositional one for basic image construction.\nLight is difficult around all bodies of water, but of particular concern when filming the ocean. The ocean acquires its bluish tint through reflection and the light of the day really affects how it appears. You will not be able to affect the light around the ocean unless you are using the highest level professional equipment. Instead, you want to plan your shoot around the weather, and try to just light objects and subjects that will be filmed either in or near the water. The weather that you want is going to be dependent on what you are going to need, but you will want a relatively flat level of light if you want to film for a consistently long period of time. If you want a certain amount of light on the image, such as that which comes down straight in a “noon” fashion, then you will want cloud-free days to assert this. Remember, if you do not have a barrier like you do during an overcast day you will find that it is hard to match up shots that are taken at different times. Rain is always going to cause a problem unless you have the appropriate protective gear, and the light is usually going to have to be artificial.","Welcome back for week 13 of the 2018 photography challenge! The theme for Week 13 of the 52 Photo Challenge is leading lines in photography.\nBack by popular demand, use lines to lead the viewer to your subject.\nThe challenges for each week are also divided into categories.\nThe category for this week is…\nWhen this category comes up, you really have room to express yourself. You can interpret the assignment literally or figuratively. Unlike the other categories, the idea of this category is to let your artistic impression shine.\n- 1 Leading Lines in Photography\n- 2 Two common mistakes to avoid when leading lines\n- 3 Different ways to set up your composition\n- 4 Using Leading Lines in Photography Challenge\n- 5 Leading Lines Photo Edits\n- 6 Photo Challenge 2018: Leading Lines in Photography Wrap-Up\nLeading Lines in Photography\nAs the name suggests, leading lines refers to a composition technique that directs the attention of the viewer through lines that lead them to the main subject in an image.\nRoadways come to mind when thinking of leading lines; there isn’t much difference between the two, only that roadways and paths direct our attention toward a vanishing point compared to a line where the focus is to lead our attention toward our main subject.\nHere are a few man-made objects that can serve as leading line in photography:\n- Lamp posts or rows of buildings in a street\n- Doorways and window panes\nIf you’re in a nature setting, you can use rivers, shorelines, trees, cliffs and rocks to great effect alongside incorporating various angles that compliment leading lines.\nTwo common mistakes to avoid when leading lines\nThere are two ways that you can go wrong when you use leading lines in your composition to direct focus to your main subject. The first is not having a subject to lead focus to (seems explanatory, right?). It’s important to have purpose when setting up your composition. Not having any subject to direct attention to detracts from the technique for leading lines in your photos.\nThe second mistake is to not placing emphasis on specific lines. There are many different lines that lead that we can make use of in any photo shoot. It’s all about finding the right one and avoiding others that might serve only to distract your viewer.\nDifferent ways to set up your composition\nThere are many ways to set up your composition when leading lines. You can position a strong line that leads from the foreground to the background, creating depth and perspective.\nAnother method is to place your subject at the center of your line convergence to add more emphasis and important to that subject.\nInstead of converging, you can set your subject at the end of your lines to give a sort of visual journey from start to finish. You can even perform a circular composition to keep the viewer’s focus within the frame.\nDifferent types of lines that lead in your photos\nAdditionally, you can make use of different kinds of lines to produce various results in your composition.\nThese are great for shooting nature and relaxing photos, especially if you can achieve the sunburst effect as the sun sets on the horizon behind an object or the natural landscape.\nThese kinds of lines produce a more authoritative effect for your subject in the photo.\nWinding pathways are an example of this as they draw the attention of a reader through a photo. Again, you can place your subject at the end of the line to produce more of a natural flow.\nWaves of a beachhead are a good example of curved lines and can be used to great effect in nature photos. I made great use of this in my photos of New Mexico and Colorado during my dealership visits in July.\nAgain, these lines produce a sense of importance because the focus a viewer’s attention to a single point in the photograph.\nYou should be careful when using intersecting lines in your composition. They can be used to great effect but can also serve to confuse or distract the viewer.\nUsing Leading Lines in Photography Challenge\nFor this week’s challenge I decided to hit up the nature trails and see what I could find. There wasn’t anything crazy that caught my eye, but I shot a few photos during my walk that I’m happy with.\nI didn’t account for the tree density causing an almost overcast effect despite it being bright and sunny during golden hour, or that the nature trail was directly within the woods. One of my biggest challenges didn’t have anything to do with camera settings or composition, but rather the 100,000 mosquitos that took every opportunity to swarm me the minute I stopped walking to shoot.\nThis forced me to set up my shoot quickly and continue walking or risk getting eaten alive. It didn’t matter much as I now have 40 mosquito bites on my arms alone, but I was aiming to hit a bridge juncture in the nature trail for a better demonstration of leading lines in my photo.\nAfter spending nearly an hour walking I finally stumbled across the bridge that I wanted. This is where I really got eaten alive as I laid down flat on the gravel to get the angle I wanted for the bridge. It turned out great, but my arms still haven’t forgiven me for spending three minutes setting up and attempting to hold still as a dozen mosquitos landed on me.\nLeading Lines Photo Edits\nAlthough I shot multiple photos, I’m sticking with just the edits for the bridge (I consider it to be the best shot that I took). Here are my edits:\n- Contrast: +31\n- Shadows: -14\n- Blacks: -29\n- Clarity: +48\n- Vibrance: +30\n- Saturation: +21\n- Point Curve: Medium Contrast\nAs you can see I didn’t do much for this shot. I wanted to saturate the photo just a smidge to provide more depth and color. I also played with the clarity as I normally do in all my photos.\nOne thing that I want to mention regarding the other photos that I shot is performing color selection and reducing the saturation to make other aspects of the subject stand out. My intent was to draw more attention to the subject or viewing points in the photos, but I’ll leave that up for your interpretation!\nPhoto Challenge 2018: Leading Lines in Photography Wrap-Up\nWhat did you think of this week’s photos?

{"question":"How do confined and unconfined aquifers differ in terms of their vulnerability to contamination and natural attenuation processes?","answer":"Confined and unconfined aquifers have significant differences in their vulnerability to contamination and natural attenuation processes. Unconfined aquifers are directly connected to the surface and recharge quickly, making them more prone to contamination. In contrast, confined aquifers have an aquitard both above and below, which protects them from direct surface impacts and can result in high quality water. Natural attenuation processes in these aquifers, including dispersion, sorption, and biodegradation, work to lower contaminant concentrations, but their effectiveness varies depending on the hydrogeologic system. The time required for natural attenuation depends on factors such as the organic matter content of aquifer sediments and the sorptive properties of individual contaminants.","context":["Natural attenuation processes combine to disperse, immobilize, and biologically transform anthropogenic contaminants, such as petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated ethenes, in ground-water systems. The time required for these processes to lower contaminant concentrations to levels protective of human health and the environment, however, varies widely between different hydrologic systems, different chemical contaminants, and varying amounts of contaminants. This report outlines a method for estimating timeframes required for natural attenuation processes, such as dispersion, sorption, and biodegradation, to lower contaminant concentrations and mass to predetermined regulatory goals in groundwater systems.\nThe time-of-remediation (TOR) problem described in this report is formulated as three interactive components: (1) estimating the length of a contaminant plume once it has achieved a steady-state configuration from a source area of constant contaminant concentration, (2) estimating the time required for a plume to shrink to a smaller, regulatoryacceptable configuration when source-area contaminant concentrations are lowered by engineered methods, and (3) estimating the time needed for nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) contaminants to dissolve, disperse, and biodegrade below predetermined levels in contaminant source areas. This conceptualization was used to develop Natural Attenuation Software (NAS), an interactive computer aquifers. NAS was designed as a screening tool and requires the input of detailed site information about hydrogeology, redox conditions, and the distribution of contaminants. Because NAS is based on numerous simplifications of hydrologic, microbial, and geochemical processes, the program may introduce unacceptable errors for highly heterogeneous hydrologic systems. In such cases, application of the TOR framework outlined in this report may require more detailed, site-specific digital modeling. The NAS software may be downloaded from the Web site http://www.cee.vt.edu/NAS/\nApplication of NAS illustrates several general characteristics shared by all TOR problems. First, the distance of stabilization of a contaminant plume is strongly dependent on the natural attenuation capacity of particular ground-water systems. The time that it takes a plume to reach a steady-state configuration, however, is independent of natural attenuation capacity. Rather, the time of stabilization is most strongly affected by the sorptive capacity of the aquifer, which is dependent on the organic matter content of the aquifer sediments, as well as the sorptive properties of individual contaminants. As a general rule, a high sorptive capacity retards a plume.s growth or shrinkage, and increases the time of stabilization. Finally, the time of NAPL dissolution depends largely on NAPL mass, composition, geometry, and hydrologic factors, such as ground-water flow rates.\nAn example TOR analysis for petroleum hydrocarbon NAPL was performed for the Laurel Bay site in South Carolina. About 500 to 1,000 pounds of gasoline leaked into the aquifer at this site in 1991, and the NAS simulations suggested that TOR would be on the order of 10 years for soluble and poorly sorbed compounds, such as benzene and methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE). Conversely, TOR would be on the order of 40 years for less soluble, more strongly sorbed compounds, such as toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (TEX). These TOR estimates are roughly consistent with contaminant concentrations observed over 10 years of monitoring at this site where benzene and MTBE concentrations were observed to decrease rapidly and are approaching regulatory maximum concentration limits, whereas toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene concentrations decreased at a slower rate and have remained relatively high.\nAn example TOR analysis for petroleum hydrocarbon NAPL was performed for the Laurel Bay site in South Carolina.

They can be located right at the ground surface or very deep underground where they are impossible to access. They can be very large (e.g. some aquifers can span a province) or quite small.\nAquifers can have high permeability, so water can flow easily in this layer. There is always a barrier below an aquifer that will not let water pass through to lower layers. This barrier, called an aquitard, is a layer with very low permeability. It is very difficult for water to pass through an aquitard, so it helps contain the water in the aquifer. Every aquifer has an aquitard below it and many also have an aquitard above. When an aquifer has an aquitard on top of it, it is called a confined aquifer. If an aquifer only has an aquitard below it and does not have an aquitard above then it is called an unconfined aquifer. Unconfined and confined aquifers are shown in Figure 1.\nUnconfined aquifers are directly connected to the surface. When water infiltrates into the ground it passes through the unsaturated zone. The unsaturated zone has mostly air in it and is highly permeable. When the water passes the unsaturated zone it reaches the saturated zone. The saturated zone is filled with water. The boundary between the saturated zone and the unsaturated zone is called the water table. When water seeps into the earth it will travel down the soil layers until it reaches the water table. The water table moves up and down depending on how much water is in the unconfined aquifer. Since unconfined aquifers are connected to the surface, they recharge quickly, and are prone to contamination.\nConfined aquifers are confined because they have an aquitard above and below the aquifer. These aquifers do not recharge quickly because it takes a long time for water to pass through the top aquitard. In some cases, confined aquifers contain high quality water because they are not directly impacted by human activity on the surface. Confined aquifers can contain groundwater that is very old. Water can stay in a confined aquifer for several millennia.\n|Figure 1: Confined and unconfined aquifers: This figure shows the two types of aquifers, confined and unconfined, within an impermeable bedrock basin. The dark blue layer between the aquifers is an aquitard .|\nTypes of Aquifers\nFast Fact: Groundwater makes up the largest source of useable freshwater in the world. A major aquifer like the Guarani aquifer in South America holds almost double the amount of water as major surface water reservoirs, such as the North American Great Lakes. In Alberta only 0.01% of groundwater is recoverable.\nSource: Rivera, A. (2014). Canada’s Groundwater Resources. In print.\nAquifers are categorized as confined or unconfined, but there are many types of aquifers that are classified by where they are located in the earth and the material of which they are comprised. There are three types of aquifers: unconsolidated deposit aquifers, bedrock aquifers and quaternary aquifers.\nUnconsolidated Deposit Aquifers\nAn unconsolidated deposit aquifer is an aquifer that is made up of loose sediment such as gravel and sand. These aquifers are close to the surface and are almost always unconfined. This type of aquifer is commonly found near rivers in a floodplain. Unconsolidated deposit aquifers are formed as the result of old rivers that no longer exist, by glaciers that have moved the sediment or by deposition at the bottom of a lake. The water in an unconsolidated deposit aquifer is directly connected to the surface water system.\n|Fast Fact: Most of the sand and gravel that lies on top of bedrock in Alberta was placed there by glaciers over 10,000 years ago!|\nBedrock is the hard rock that lies below all the sand, gravel and soil near the ground surface. A bedrock aquifer is an aquifer that is confined within hard bedrock layers. Water can travel through porous bedrock, or through cracks, fractures and crevasses in the hard bedrock. In Alberta, 84% of groundwater wells draw from bedrock aquifers . These aquifers are easily accessible in areas where the bedrock is near the earth’s surface, such as in southern Alberta.\nIn Alberta, there are three types of bedrock aquifers: carbonate aquifers, sandstone aquifers, and fractured shale aquifers.\nCarbonate aquifers are made of rocks such as limestone and usually contain saline water. Sandstone aquifers are made of sandstone, a highly permeable rock, and can contain either saline or freshwater. The largest aquifer in Alberta, the Paskapoo Aquifer, is a sandstone aquifer. One third of groundwater wells in Alberta are located in the Paskapoo Aquifer . Shale is a rock that is similar to sandstone, but is less permeable. For shale to be an aquifer, it must be fractured, or cracked, so water can flow into it. Fractured shale aquifers are relatively rare in Alberta. The wells that draw from this type of aquifer do not produce as much water.\nQuaternary aquifers are aquifers that were created by glaciers. They are located between bedrock and the earth’s surface. These aquifers can be confined or unconfined. There are two types of quaternary aquifers: buried valley aquifers and alluvial aquifers.\n|Fast Fact: Coal can also be an aquifer. Water can easily flow through the porous and permeable layers of coal in the rock layers.|\nBuried valley aquifers are confined aquifers that can be directly above bedrock or higher up in the rock layers. These are ancient valleys that are filled with permeable sand and gravel. Unconfined sand and gravel aquifers are located at the surface or near the surface. An alluvial aquifer is a specific type of unconfined aquifer which has a river flowing through it. The river is the main source of recharge. Quaternary aquifers generally contain freshwater."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:564b9a1b-3c28-4d0e-8e69-5b26b3d9af19>","<urn:uuid:f90307ca-dbab-4f28-9a04-03a3c0219752>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the temperature management challenges between winter composting and regular hot composting?","answer":"Hot composting in winter requires a larger mass to build and maintain compost heat compared to regular hot composting. While regular hot composting can reach temperatures of up to 180°F (82°C), winter composting needs special considerations like building compost piles with an insulated north side and southern exposure to maintain an optimum environment for decomposition organisms. Even in January, properly managed hot compost piles will show narrow columns of steam rising. Both types need careful temperature monitoring - if temperatures exceed 155°F (68°C), the pile must be turned to prevent it from going anaerobic, regardless of season.","context":["What is Compost?\nComposting is the transformation of organic material (plant matter) through decomposition into a soil-like material called compost. Invertebrates (insects and earthworms), and microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) help in transforming the material into compost. Composting is a natural form of recycling, which continually occurs in nature.\nWhat to Compost:\ngrains and pasta\nfruit rinds and peels\ncoffee grounds, filters\npaper napkins, towels\nleaves and other yard waste\nWhat Not to Compost:\nfish and poultry\nother animal products\nHot Compost – also known as fast composting. The critical part of hot composting is the ratio of brown material(*1) to green material(*2). A good rule of thumb is a 6:1 ration brown to green.\nCold Compost – also known as slow composting. You just pile grass clippings and dry leaves on the ground or in a bin. This method will take several months to a year for the pile to decompose. This works well if you don’t have time to tend the compost pile frequently, have little yard waste or are not in a hurry to use the compost.\nCold composting has been shown to be better at suppressing soil born diseases than hot composting.\n* low maintenance\n* can add materials as they become available\n*doesn’t heat up enough to kill weed seeds\n* may create unpleasant odors if there’s not an equal amount of “greens” and “browns” or a balance between wet and dry material\n(*1)Brown materials are the source of carbon. Such materials include dried leaves, wood chips, evergreen leaves, paper, or straw.\n(*2)Green materials are the source of nitrogen. Such material include fresh grass clippings, blood or cottonseed meal, coffee grounds, fruit and vegetable scraps, and manure.\nHow to Make Compost:\nCompost is made by layering brown and green materials in a container. The container can be pallets tied together, a barrel with holes punched in the bottom or you can layer on the ground. Alternate layers of brown material and green material using a 6:1 ratio. We cover the mixture with straw.\nHow to Use Compost:\nThe most common uses of compost are as mulch on established plants, as a soil enricher at planting time, and in potting mixes.\nThis is another method of building humus. It involves spreading the organic material directly where you need it on beds and in guilds in the same layering fashion you used to develop the compost bin. This process may take a full year to fully compost.\nGet the Community Involved!\nEvery fall we put out a flyer for leaves. The community loves to see their leaves go some place other than the dump. Those leaves are added to our garden beds in the fall in the form of sheet compost that will cook all winter. We also recommend building compost piles with an insulated north side and southern exposure to maintain an optimum environment for all the organisms doing the real work of decomposition throughout winter.\nThe best primer of composting is “Let it Rot” by Stu Cambell","Hot Composting is a form of accelerated composting that yields finished compost in 3-6 weeks (longer in winter), instead of the 3-6 months needed for static pile composting.\n© Steve Masley…Click IMAGE to Enlarge\nThis compost is dark, rich, and free of viable weed seeds and plant diseases.\nIn a hot compost pile, the size of the pile—and the particle size and mix of materials that go into it—are optimized to generate high temperatures.\nThis steamy heat kills weed seeds and plant diseases and dramatically accelerates the composting process, but it has to be managed carefully.\nTemperatures in a large, poorly-managed hot compost pile can reach 180° (82° C). On hot days, the dry materials on top of these piles can spontaneously combust!\nApart from the fire hazard, at temperatures above 160° (71° C), all of the oxygen is quickly used up, and the compost pile “goes anaerobic”. That’s when you get problems with odors, nutrient losses, and toxins.\nSmell ammonia wafting from your compost pile? That’s your nitrogen, the element most important for plant growth, venting into the atmosphere.\nSmell a hint of rotten eggs? That’s your sulfur, needed for critical plant enzymes and plant immunity, dissipating as hydrogen sulfide, rotten egg gas.\nSee a ghostly, pale image floating over your compost pile? That’s your phosphorous, needed for root and fruit formation, floating away as phosphene gas—the “swamp gas” that floats over boggy areas and landfills, and sometimes results in UFO reports.\n(Thanks to Dr. Elaine Ingham, Oregon State University, for this paraphrased description of what goes wrong when compost piles go anaerobic.)\nAll of these nutrient losses are due to anaerobic bacteria taking over your compost pile, starting with the hot core.\nThis can happen occasionally in a static compost pile, but it will happen in a hot compost pile, if you don’t turn it when the temperature exceeds 155° (68° C).\nHot Composting has Several Advantages Over Static Pile Composting:\nHot composting avoids this problem. The pile heats up to 150° (65° C) within a day or two, and kitchen scraps dissolve quickly in this heat.\nManaging a hot compost pile takes a lot of attention and effort, especially during the first 2 weeks. You have to check the temperature of the pile with a compost thermometer daily, and turn and mix the pile every time the temperature climbs over 155° (68° C).\nIn practice, this means you’ll probably have to turn the pile every day for at least the first week, and 10-12 times for the first 2 weeks after building a hot compost pile.\nPlan on putting at least 12-18 hours into a hot compost pile—most of it the first week.\nIf you can’t commit to this kind of attention and work, DON’T try hot composting. Use a compost tumbler or build a static compost pile instead.\nWhen there’s enough carbon to fuel the lives of billions of microbes, enough nitrogen and water to build these billions, and enough oxygen to give aerobic bacteria the advantage, magical things happen in compost piles.\nHeat builds in the pile, and thermophilic (heat-loving) bacteria multiply, breaking down all but the most resistant materials around the hot core of the pile, driving off moisture and carbon dioxide in the process.\nEven in January you’ll see narrow columns of steam rising from hot compost piles.\nAs temperature increases in the pile, populations of bacteria rise, dominate, and fall, either going dormant, or becoming fodder for the next wave of bacteria that thrive in hotter temperatures still.\nNutrients in the pile are concentrated and bound into organic molecules, bacterial glues, and the bodies of bacteria, all of which feed the soil food web when the compost is added to the soil.\nYou’ll need some basic composting equipment for hot composting:\nA Compost Thermometer, (a thermometer with a 20”–50cm– probe) for monitoring compost heat. This is a critical piece of equipment for thermal composting.\nA short, sturdy Spading Fork, with a D-handle, preferably one with square—as opposed to rectangular—tines, for turning the pile. I often bounce forkfuls of compost on the tines to break up clumps as I’m turning the pile. Square tines are stronger and have a thinner profile that allows the material to fall through more easily.\nA way to chop or shred compost ingredients. If you have a large yard or garden, a chipper-shredder simplifies processing yard waste. For smaller gardens, you can use a pair of hedge clippers or a machete and a board to chop compost materials.\nA water wand with a shower setting, for even moistening of the layers of the pile.\nA compost bin or wire cylinder to contain the pile. For accelerated composting, you’ll need a bin or cylinder that’s at least 3’ x 3’ x 3’ (1m x 1m x 1m)—larger, if you’re planning on winter composting.\nA compost bin isn’t absolutely necessary for hot composting, but it “stacks” the compost materials, so it heats up faster.\nA compost bin or compost tumbler can cost $40-250, but you can achieve the same result with a hoop of welded wire fencing from the hardware store for $40-50.\nA 14-foot (3.5 m) length will create a 4-foot (1 m +) diameter hoop, with room to overlap the ends. Use 1x1” (2.5 x 2.5 cm) or 1x2” (2.5 x 5 cm) welded wire. The advantage of hoop bins is you can make them narrower when you don’t have a lot of materials, and wider when you have plenty.\nBefore building a hot compost pile, you’ll need to collect—and process—materials.\nThermal composting requires a certain mass to build compost heat, especially if you’re composting in winter.\n(For information on what to compost—and what not to compost—see Compost Ingredients).\nStraw bales, bags of tree leaves, lawn trimmings, wood chips, and bags of manure should be collected at your composting site. If you use stalky materials, chop them into 3-4” (7-10 cm) pieces.\n© Steve Masley…Click IMAGE to Enlarge\nTo “pre-compost”, open the compost hoop out to form a wide cylinder, and bury kitchen scraps between thick layers of brown materials.\nThe pile develops some compost heat, but not enough to require turning. The goal at this point is to start the composting process, and let it “simmer” until you’re ready to turn up the heat.\nWhen the cylinder is almost full, I gather whatever additional compost ingredients I plan to use—tree leaves, straw, stalky materials, wood chips, and manure—then proceed with building a hot compost pile.\nArray the materials in small, separate piles around where you plan to build the pile—much as you array pre-chopped vegetables for throwing into a wok when making a stir-fry.\nThe warm material from the middle of the static pile acts as a compost activator for the rest of the pile.\nInstead of just layering compost materials on whole, or slightly chopped, as you do in static pile composting, hot composting requires that the compost ingredients be chopped or shredded, to increase the surface area in contact with microbes in the pile.\nSmaller pieces also make turning the pile much easier. If you layer whole plants in with manure in a big compost pile, it will heat up to 160° (71° C) in a day or two, and need to be turned.\nMost of the leaves will have dissolved in the middle of the pile, but the stems and stalks will remain. They’ll be softened, but still tough and fibrous, and they’ll be threaded through the pile like strands of rope.\nTurning such a pile is a nightmare. Every forkful is a tug-of-war. You feel like you’ve been in a wrestling match after turning the compost pile.\nThe finer the compost materials are shredded, the faster the pile heats up.\nIf you have access to a chipper-shredder, you can shred green and brown materials at the same time, blending materials as you shred. This creates a fine-textured mix that heats up fast, with high compost heat going almost all the way out to the edges of the bin.\nA chipper-shredder also lets you shred tree leaves, so they’re less likely to mat down in the pile.\nIf you have a large garden and yard, they’re a huge time- and- effort-saver that will help you make better compost, but chipper-shredders, especially good chipper-shredders, don’t come cheap.\nNeighbors or other gardeners may be willing to share the cost, so you can pool resources and share the shredder to save money.\nThey’re a big investment for backyard organic gardeners, one I’ve never been able to justify with my small garden. My solution? A tarp, a board, and a machete.\nSpread a tarp on a flat piece of ground near your compost area, and put a couple of sawhorses on top of the tarp. Lay a 2” x 12” (38x286mm) board across the sawhorses. (I built a squared U-shaped frame with 2 boards bolted to 2 x 4’s (38x89mm's), so it’s one piece and easy to move, but a board on sawhorses works as well.)\nPick up an armload of plants to be composted and set it on the board with the long stems going in the same direction as the board.\nRoll the plants on top of the board, pulling stray ends into the middle to create a cigar-shaped bundle. Whack it into 3-4” (8-10 cm) pieces with the machete, being careful to keep your fingers at least 8” (20 cm) back from where the blade will cut.\nWhack thicker stems into shorter 2-3” (5-8 cm) pieces, and as the stems taper and become thinner, whack longer pieces. To make turning the pile easier, no pieces should be longer than a spading fork is wide, about 10” (25 cm).\nIn addition to processing the materials first, there are two main differences between hot composting and static pile composting:\nin a Hot Compost Pile ©\nSteve Masley…Click IMAGE to Enlarge\nUse thicker layers of green materials as you build the pile, or thin layers of higher-nitrogen materials like manure. Or use a combination of the two.\nWith static pile composting, you add a slightly thicker green layer when the pile is built up one-third of the way, and again at the 2/3 mark. With hot composting, you add a thick green (high-nitrogen) layer when the pile is 2’ (1.3 m) high, then contain the pile inside a compost bin or wire cylinder.\nin a Hot Compost Pile 2\n© Steve Masley…Click IMAGE to Enlarge\nThis is also a good time to sprinkle on some Rock Phosphate or rock dust, (rock milling fines) to increase the phosphorous content of your compost. Greensand is a good source of organic potassium, mined from mineralized sea shells.

This is a critical piece of equipment for thermal composting.\nHot composting requires careful monitoring and frequent turning to prevent the pile from going anaerobic.\nScientists use an oxygen probe to check oxygen levels in the middle of compost piles, but oxygen probes are expensive and delicate, and you can get the same result using an inexpensive Compost Thermometer.\nCompost thermometers have a 20” (51 cm) stainless steel probe that allows you to read the temperature at the center of the pile. When the core temperature climbs over 155° (68° C), oxygen will be depleted within a few hours, so it’s time to turn the pile.\nTurning the pile opens and aerates the core before all the oxygen is depleted. It also allows you to adjust the moisture level of the compost, adding water to dry areas, or mixing saturated layers with dryer materials.\nIn a hot compost pile, half the mass will eventually off-gas as carbon dioxide and water vapor. Moisture cooks out of the pile around the hot core, and may have to be replenished when you turn the pile.\nThe photo table below shows changes that occur when hot composting.

{"question":"What are the main differences between the treatment of music in Arab culture versus Islamic religious views?","answer":"In Arab culture, music is a rich artistic tradition with established classical forms, various genres, and pop music adaptations. However, from an Islamic religious perspective, particularly among puritanical Muslims, music is often viewed controversially as a frivolous or forbidden activity. While complete rejection of music remains a minority view among Muslims, increased religiosity has led to greater opposition, especially toward less traditional forms like heavy metal music, which some authorities associate with devil-worship. This tension is particularly evident in countries like Saudi Arabia, where authorities are especially suspicious of modern music genres.","context":["The term “Arabic Music” is a broad one and lends itself somewhat to blanket analysis of a tradition with an extraordinary diversity of styles. This is often seen as a negative, where entire societies are perceived to be uniform in customs, tradition and ritual. As an example; being in Jordan would not yield any difference in experience from being in Iraq. Of course, for a student of any anthropological field, this mindset is an atrocious vantage where whole discussions could be engaged on communities the size of a few families. There is, however; sometimes a need to organize subjects through very large groupings in order to distill greater cultural contrast. The Maqam tradition in Arabic music is shared throughout much of the Greater Middle East and aspects of it can be found in Europe or as far away as Indonesia and China. In this respect, seeing a unity of tradition which courses through a large area of the world can actually be incredibly useful for recognizing where common heritages exist.\nCulturally speaking, the Arab world could simply mean the group of countries who use the Arabic language to communicate. This of course would not include nations that make up the what has been called in the last decade; “the Greater Middle East.” These countries, such as Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, and Israel have a host of national languages that include Turkic, Ind-European, and other Semitic tongues as their means of communication (Achcar 2004). Racially and Ethnically these nations have little in common as well and therefore; politically speaking, the need to socially group these countries together has largely to do with the majority religion being Islam. In terms of a musical culture, however; these groups do share enough to be able to speak of the Maqam tradition in terms of not only the Greater Middle East, but also (as noted above) some places in southern Europe as well as Asia.\nFrom a technical standpoint, a “Maqam” may be translated as a mode or scale, and in the same way that in the west there is an association with a minor key being sad and a major being happy, so too are there associations with moods in the Maqam tradition. According to Aboudi Badawi, an oud player and Arabic music educator; “a scale is made up of a sequence of specific notes, these notes produce melodies that evoke emotions and feelings” (Badawi, 2003). The Arabic term for the emotions brought about through melodic instrument playing or singing is known as “tarab” which can be translated to the word “ecstasy” in English. This is one of the most important aspects of musical practice in the Arab world, that the music should be infused with a powerful amount of emotional capacity. Anne K. Rasmussen punctuates this point in her chapter on Arabic music in the text Worlds of Music where she notes that; “The concept of tarab gets to the very heart of Arab musical aesthetics. The term refers to a repertory of traditional compositions as well as to a style of performance that both embodies and invokes tarab (Rasmussen, 2009). It should be noted that music which is modal does not often lend itself instinctually to harmonies other than drone sounds and therefore; much of Arabic music is played either by solo instruments and percussion or multiple instruments playing heterophonically.\nExamples and Discussion of Maqamat\nWhat follows are the eight primary Maqamat (plural of Maqam). Although dozens of Maqamat exist, there are eight that are popularly played by musicians and the other Maqamat are seen as subordinate to the parent scales (Badawi, 2003). One consideration for the reader to keep in mind is that by default all of the primary Maqamat are eight consecutive notes (seven distinct notes plus the octave of the tonic), however; there are Maqamat of the north African tradition which can be pentatonic scales (Zhedan, ND).\nFigure 1. Maqam Ajam\nThe Maqam “Ajam” carries with it many of the same connotations as the western major scale, namely an association with happy emotions. Cameron Powers, author of the book; Arabic Musical Scales, writes that Ajam's associated moods are: “bright, happy, majesty, pride, loftiness, national anthems, strength, [and] seriousness” (Powers, 2005) While Aboudi Badawi states that “Ajam is a cheerful Maqam that gives the listener and instant feeling of happiness and joy, it can be used for either slow or fast music, but regardless of the tempo this Maqam will always result in a happy feeling” (Badawi, 2003). It is possible that this Maqam's popularity has something to do with colonial European rule over Arabic-speaking lands, where native music makers would be performing for foreign audiences they might have attempted to find melodic sequences closer to the European visitors own home music, this might explain some of the same emotional associations mentioned above. Of course, without any primary source information on the subject, this remains pure speculation.\nOne intriguing aspect of the Maqam system is it seems as though the range has something to do with the character of the melody. For instance; a “major” scale started on B flat is called “Ajam” whereas the same scale with an F tonic would be \"Jar-kah,” and a C tonic is called “Mahoor.” (Zhedan, ND). This aspect of the Arab musical mindset exemplifies the importance of the above mentioned concept of “tarab.” In this instance, the height of a note might have a great deal to do with how the listener perceives the effect and therefore; change the mood of the piece.\nFigure 2. Maqam Hejaz\nMaqam Hejaz (sometimes spelledn Hijaz) is easily recognizable due to the augmented second appearing between steps two and three of the scale. The traditional practice of musicians has been to slightly lower the f-sharp and slightly raise the e-flat in order to create a more cohesive line within the melody. Badawi states that “this Maqam is often described as 'snake charming music” (Badawi, 2003) but this is really more a reflection of western composers applying augmented seconds in their scores to give an exotic flavor than of native perceptions of the music. Cameron Powers writes that “this Maqam is associated with the lonely treks of the camel caravans and with fascination and enchantment” (Powers, 2005). This sense of the Maqam draws from its association with folk music of the Saudi Deserts (in fact, Hijaz is a region of Saudi Arabia). This Maqam is known by other names in other regions of the greater middle east. In Turkey this scale is known as “Usbaein,” in Africa it is known by the names “Zedan” and “Alhijaz Alkabeer” (Zhedan, ND).\nFigure 3. Maqam Nahawand\nNahawand, like the western Dorian mode has theoretically the same intervals in its ascending and its descending form, furthermore; its lower and upper tetrachord is identical in their arrangement of whole and half steps. In practice, musicians often employ a raised seventh in order to pull back to the tonic, this is most common in the lower octave. As to the character and associated mood of this mode, there seems to be some minor inconsistencies in the way it is described. Powers writes that “Nahawand is a straightforward and sweet Maqam” (Powers, 2005) whereas Badawi states “Nahawand produces extreme changes in emotion, it is the Maqam of feelings” (Badawi, 2003). It is as if to infer that one writer sees Nahawand as uncomplicated and somewhat plain and the other sees it as passionate and vibrant. In this instance it is important to keep in mind that varying views of musicologists are equally as frequent in Arabic music as it is in other cultures.\nFigure 4. Maqam Bayyati\nWhat has been described as the interval of a “quarter tone” by theorists, has actually existed in Arabic music practices for some time. It is one of the most distinct aspects of music from the Middle East. E-half-flat is known in the Arabic language as \"Sikah,” which used to specifically refer to the second note of Bayyati but is now used to describe all half-flats.\nThe remarkability of the “quarter tone” in world music texts, is in of itself remarkable. Tunings that differ from the western equal tempered system are commonplace around the world and even Europe has a history of alternate tuning systems that were quite distinct from the modern form, the most famous being meantone temperament. It is however, through the west's dominance over the rest of the world that all practices seem to measured against it. It is clear that the “specialness” of the “Sikah” notes became apparent during colonial times. Anne K. Rasmussen writes;”Prior to this time, notes like E-half-flat, or Sikah in Arabic, were simply considered natural, regular notes” (Rasmussen, 2009). This happens in such a frequency that mention of the “quarter tone” (sometimes called “neutral interval”) is always reserved as a caveat in books and research done on intonation. This point was raised at the 2009 annual conference of the Society for Ethnomusicology, November 22nd, 2009 in Mexico City, Mexico. In a presentation by Sami Abu Shumays it is noted that; “almost all of the research done into how the brain processes music has dealt exclusively with Western Classical music (Shumays, 2009). Bayyati is, of course one of many examples of modes with half-flats.\nFigure 5. Maqam Rast\nCameron Powers summarizes the moods of Rast as; “Romantic and positive, cheerful, stately and elegant” (Powers, 2005). Maqam Rast is notable for its association with the Islamic call to prayer, and in general this is a common scale for religious music (although it is not the only scale used in religious music). Indeed, in many countries religious recitation is an art form highly praised and looked upon with great admiration. As an example of this; in Indonesia (the country with the largest population of Muslims in the world) there are many competitions in Koranic recitation in which the contestants are regarded in very esteemed lights (Rasmussen, 2009). It should be noted that the description of the call to prayer or Koranic recitation in general as music faces some dubious criticism in Muslim circles. The above mentioned vocal styles are not actually considered music, and indeed, some of the more conservative members of the religion frown upon any type of music.\nThe discussion on music in Islam is always one that is destined to occur in any investigation of music in the Greater Middle East. Dr. Rabah Saoud (an author for Muslim Heretige.com) writes in his essay; The Arab Contribution to Music of the Western World; “In dealing with the subject of music in Islamic civilization one cannot avoid falling into various arguments about the Islamic views on this art” (Saoud, 2004). Throughout recent history there have been attacks on the practice of making music. This stems from conservatives within Islam, most notably in Iran with the recent banning of western music and eventually any instrumental music in schools (Bloch, 2009).\nFigure 6. Maqam Kurd\nMaqam Kurd is named after the Kurdish people and their region of the Middle East. This area consists of southern Turkey, northern Iraq, and the western part of Iran. The scale itself is very similar to the West's Phrygian mode and in the Persian Dastgah system it is known as \"Shur\" (Malm, 1977). Aboudi Badawi states that Kurd is; “airy and spacious, and creates the feeling of freedom. It is the typical Maqam for modern Arabic singing.” Badawi goes on to say that in the fusion of Arabic and Western dance music, Kurd is an appropriate choice (Badawi, 2003).\nFigure 7. Maqam Saba (theoretical form)\nFigure 7a. Maqam Saba (practical form)\nWhat is interesting about Maqam Saba is that it is the only example out of the eight where the mode changes its root note in the upper tetrachord. From a music-theory standpoint this has led modern musicologists to describe the scale in two ways; a theoretical form and a practical form. In its theoretical form it is somewhat reminiscent of Hijaz with the emphasis on the augmented second. In its practical form it becomes a very rich basis for melody as the root-to-eighth note ends up being a diminished octave and continuing onto what sounds like a completely new scale.\nMaqam Saba is often heard in folk music as well as religious music of the Sufi-Muslims (Powers, 2005). In middle eastern Jewish ceremonial music this mode is used to accompany circumcisions, this is explained that “Sabi” in Arabic translates to “baby-boy” (Pizmonim.com, ND). It is impossible to say if this association exists in the rest of the Middle East. Some musicians describe this scale as sad, others describe it as mystical. Badawi describes Saba as “the blues scale of Arabic music” (Badawi, 2003). It is not surprising, though; given the tonal variety of the makeup in the upper region, why there would be such varying opinions on what mood or emotion this Maqam evokes.\nFigure 8. Maqam Sikah\nPerhaps one of the most fascinating examples of the Maqam System is Sikah. As the name would imply, Sikah is built off of the E-half-flat. Because the tonic note is a “detuned” tone, it renders all the subsequent notes an unequal distance from the base. This creates for a very vibrant and alive character of melodies in this mode and very rich orchestral beating occurs when played with an ensemble. It can also sound very unusual to western listeners who are primarily accustomed to the equal temperament of western music. This is much more the case with Sikah than other scales that contain “quarter-tones” because it is the half-flat that is the resting place of the melody. William Malm writes on this issue and states that to some listeners there is an; “out-of-tune' sound of Near Eastern music (when in fact it is being played very accurately and artfully with the varied intervals mentioned)” (Malm, 1977). Once a listener is accustomed, however; it becomes a very rich and expressive mode.\nThere are many members of the greater Sikah family of scales, these include; Huzam and Mustaar. In Huzam, the fourth tone is lowered and the fifth raised (on the scale above this would include an A-flat and B-natural), and in Mustaar, there is a raised second (F-sharp on the scale above). Cameron Powers writes that Sikah is; “sacred, mystical, [and] common in folk melodies” (Powers, 2005). Aboudi Badawi describes Sikah as; “the Maqam of youth and strength... It was originally known as the 'music of the mountains' but later became standard in traditional Arabic music” (Badawi, 2003).\nIt should be noted that the Maqam system represents only a theoretical basis for explaining the tonal vocabulary of the Pan-Arab musical tradition. In practice, the Maqamat are subjected to many permutations; sometimes differing in their ascending and descending order, sometimes emphasizing particular patterns (or pitch cells), and often transposing or modulating to another mode completely. This is usually the case in what could be called the Arab “classical tradition,” which, like so many other classical traditions of the world, has its roots in the court patronage system. Folk music and religious music, however; tend not to be as virtuosic in its approach.\nIn Arabic music, taqsim generally refers to either an introductory prelude to a piece of music, an improvisation within a per-composed piece, or simply a freestanding demonstration on an instrument. In the first and last examples, the taqsim takes on an air of freedom in terms of timing. This isn't to say that the music is without meter, but rather without regular meter. Usually these sorts of performances consist of short phrases evolving into longer melodies not unlike the Alap of a Hindustani Drupad composition. A prime example of this style was the many taqsims demonstrated by the famous Oud player; Munir Bashir. Bashir, who recorded in all of the primary Maqamat (and indeed, a good deal of the less common ones) would usually begin his improvisations with short phrases which brought out the major character of the mode while giving a great deal of space between interjections of new ideas. Unencumbered with a regular meter, this seemed to give Bashir the freedom to express whatever mood the Maqam was suggesting to him. As the performance moved forward the tempo would change from slow to progressively faster and the phrases would get progressively longer. The volume would also crescendo which usually resulted in a kind of strumming which would appear to push the instrument to breaking, although this never actually happened. As in so many other traditions which prize the ability to improvise, the performer of a taqsim is at the same time composer and performer, there is not the same separation of the two as there is in the west.\nWhen writing on any musical tradition it is important to keep in mind that the very nature of the craft is one of constant evolution, therefore; the classical Arabic music available for consumption today cannot be said to be a faithful representation of music from Arabia's ancient past. Like all other cultures, those of the Greater Middle East have influenced each other, as well as being influenced by those outside, namely Europe and India. This has always been the case, that music, like language is subjected to periods of fashion, rebellion and resurgence. Currently there are large ensembles playing Arabic music in restricted heterophonic orchestras using a great deal of European instruments (such as the violin family and woodwinds). There are also smaller ensembles of about eight or less who perform in a more liberal heterophonic style on traditional Middle Eastern instruments. There have been many well known soloists such as Bashir as well as the phenomenally popular Um Kathoom who form a pantheon of stardom in their own right. Finally there are the home and folk musicians, the amateurs who form the true and direct line from not only Arabic Music's past but who will also preserve it for the future in whatever form it decides to take.","\"Arab music\" is music created by Arabs. Beyond that, it is difficult to say precisely what makes it \"Arab\". As in other parts of the world, its development is the result of multiple influences.\n\"It is an amalgam of the music of the Arabs in the Arabian Peninsula and the music of all the peoples that make up the Arab world today. It also influenced and has been influenced by ancient Egyptian, ancient Greek, Persian, Kurdish, Assyrian, Turkish, Indian, North African music (i.e. Berber), African music (i.e. Swahili), and European music (i.e. Flamenco).\" – traditionalarabicmusic.com\nAlthough the characteristics of classical Arab music are well defined, there is also a wide variety of musical genres, some of them largely confined to specific parts of the region. Existing alongside these traditional forms is modern Arab pop music – often with a distinctive \"Arab\" sound – but also including Arab versions of rock, rap and even heavy metal.\nIn an article on the Turath website, Ali Jihad Racy, a professor of ethnomusicology, identifies several unifying traits of Arab music, though he cautions that these may not be universally and their orientation and detailed features may differ from one community to another:\nOne aspect of unity in Arab music is the intimate connection between the music and the Arabic language. This is demonstrated by the emphasis placed upon the vocal idiom and by the often central role played by the poet-singer. Examples are the sha'ir, literally \"poet,\" in Upper Egypt and among the Syrian-Desert Bedouins, and theqawwal, literally \"one who says,\" in the Lebanese tradition of zajal, or sung folk-poetry. This link is also exemplified in the common practice of setting to music various literary [poetic] forms, including the qasidah and the muwashshah.\nAnother salient trait is the principal position of Arab melody in Arab music and the absence of complex polyphony, a phenomenon distinguishing music of this part of the world, and a good portion of Asia, from the music of Europe and certain areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. Instead, Arab music exhibits refinement and complexity in the melody marked by subtle and intricate ornaments and nuances. Melody in Arab music also incorporates microtonality, namely intervals that do not conform to the half-step and whole-step divisions of traditional Western art music.\nThe concept of melody is commonly connected with modality, a conceptual organisational framework widely known under the name maqam(plural maqamat). Each of the maqamat is based on a theoretical scale, specific notes of emphasis, and a typical pattern of melodic movement, in many instances beginning around the tonic note of the scale, gradually ascending, and finally descending to the tonic ...\nThe modal conception and organisation of melody is paralleled by a modal treatment of Arab rhythm. In Arab music, metric modes are employed in various metric compositions and are widely known by the name iqa'at (singular iqa') ... Eachiqa' has a specific name and a pattern of beats ranging in number from two to twenty-four or more ...\nAnother feature of musical unity in the contemporary Arab world lies in the area ofmusical instruments. Instruments such as theqanun (a trapazoidal plucked zither), 'ud (a fretless plucked lute), nay (a reed flute) and the Western violin are found in most urban Arab orchestras.\nClassical Arabic music\nA website focusing on classical and traditional Arab music.

In the words of one Islamic scholar:\n\"Music is a useless activity which, in fact, is a state of passiveness.\"\nComplete rejection of music is still very much a minority view among Muslims, though it has become more prevalent with the growth of political Islam and increased religiosity.\nIn general, the less traditional types of music – especially those that develop a cult following among Arab youth – tend to meet with stronger disapproval. In several countries, for example, the authorities have tried to suppress heavy metal music on the grounds that it involves devil-worship.

Thanks to our incredible multi-hospital collaboration, altruistic donors, and forward-thinking transplant physicians, HCA Healthcare led the nation in 2018, performing more live donor kidney transplants than any other hospital system in the country.\nLed by industry leader Dr. Adam Bingaman, the organization’s medical director of solid organ transplants, HCA Healthcare transplant centers outperformed systems such as Mayo Clinic and the University of California Health System in live donor kidney transplants, according to the latest data put forth by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN).\nAlone, affiliate Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital accounted for 53.2 percent of HCA Healthcare’s total living kidney donor transplants.\n“Living donation is a fantastic option for patients with kidney failure, because they can receive a kidney from a living donor, without even having to be on the transplant waiting list at all,” said Dr. Bingaman, who also serves as the director of abdominal transplant at Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital. “With living donation, patients get kidneys in record time and have exceptional outcomes and survival rates.”\n“Kidneys from living donors work better and last longer with the average deceased kidney lasting from seven to 10 years, said Dr. Bingaman. “Whereas, an average kidney from a living donor is expected to last 15 to 20 years.”\nKidney disease: a public health crisis\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is an under-recognized public health crisis, affecting more than 30 million people in the U.S.\n“Diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure in the United States with links to the country’s obesity epidemic,” said Dr. Bingaman. “The second leading cause is high blood pressure with other contributory factors being auto-immune diseases, like Lupus, and genetic contributors, such as polycystic kidney disease. Patients either need a transplant or dialysis to stay alive.”\nIn the United States, more than 113,000 people wait for life-saving organ transplants. Topping the list, kidney organs are the highest in-demand with nearly 95,000 patients waiting for a kidney.\n“We have an extreme kidney shortage, and to make matters critical, just last year about 40,000 patients were added to the waiting list. There simply aren’t enough kidneys to go around. This is a tragedy.”\nOne of the most critical challenges for patients in need of a new kidney is finding a donor. The national waitlist for a deceased donor can be several years. Even altruistic friends and family members aren’t always a good match. Patients are forced to wait on transplant lists.\nHCA Healthcare affiliate Medical City Fort Worth ranks among the nation’s most efficient centers, moving patients from the waiting list to transplant the fastest in the country.\n“We’re proud to have hospitals in the HCA Healthcare system that are being recognized as one of the nation’s quickest transplant centers,” said Dr. Bingaman. “The goal is to be excellent at everything our transplant centers do. It’s an added achievement to be able to address this crisis quickly.”\nEnter Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nIn 2008, Dr. Bingaman teamed up with a software architect from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop new artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm methodology that has increased the odds of matching hopeless patients with potential donors. Through this technology, computers are able to delve into patient and donor charts, like never before, to locate complicated blood and antibody matches. The data system helps match patients in need of a kidney to those willing to donate one.\nBefore, kidney donors who were not used due to incompatibility, but were willing to donate, would get lost in the system. The patient would go back on the list to wait for a deceased donor organ. Now, through intricate algorithms, patients are identified to “swap” their incompatible donors with compatible ones from other incompatible donor-patient pairs. This can be done in a single swap or through multiple swaps in chains of unrelated donors.\nPatients interested in a paired exchange must procure a donor, even one who isn’t a match, to volunteer to donate a kidney to another patient.\nPaired Exchange is an innovative donor-recipient matching tool\n“Paired exchange has provided remarkable opportunities for the kidney transplant community,” says Dr. Bingaman. “During the first year in 2008, we did a total of 10 paired donations. Now, fast forward to 2019, we are closing in on our five hundredth paired exchange transplant at Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital.”\nExcellent systems, excellent relationships, excellent people\nWhen not advocating for living donor kidney transplantation, Dr. Bingaman can be found in the operating room at Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital in San Antonio, Texas.\n“Contributing to the live donor kidney transplant volumes, is the innovation in paired exchange for incompatible donors that we have pioneered,” said Dr. Bingaman. “Also, great systems, like online donor screening, make it easier for physicians to transplant more patients, faster than we ever have before.”\nBut, the standout reason behind the margin is “the people behind it. HCA Healthcare builds a team of great people and great people are the foundation of every great organization,” said Dr. Bingaman.\nConfronting a community need\nMethodist Transplant and Specialty Hospital also was a standout amongst hospitals nation-wide for their ability to transplant the most total Hispanic patients and living donor Hispanic patients.\nA skilled surgeon, Dr. Bingaman chooses to transplant patients in South Texas because of the transplant needs of the community. The average person is on the waiting list in South Texas for more than six years.\n“Kidney disease discriminates. African Americans have a three times rate of end-staged kidney disease as compared to Caucasians and Hispanics have a one and half times increased rate,” said Dr. Bingaman.\nTexas, a state with a large Hispanic population, has been a huge focal point for Dr. Bingaman and his team to revolutionize. The transplant team is part of the South Texas community and understands the needs of the community members.\n“It’s vital that our transplant teams have great relationships with the community, immunology labs and amongst each other,” Dr. Bingaman said. “In order to save lives, our social workers, dieticians, nurses, administration, nephrologists and surgeons all need to be on the same page.”\nFostering those relationships in Texas border towns such as Laredo and Eagle Pass, the team at Methodist Transplant and Specialty Hospital are able to bring world-class care to those who need it. “We can’t be successful if we are not a part of the community,” said Dr. Bingaman.\nEarly referral to transplant\nHCA Healthcare forges into 2019 with campaigns to give referring nephrologists and chronic kidney failure patients more tools to assist in identifying living donors. Often, many patients do not get referred to transplant until it’s too late or they are already adhering to the grueling process of dialysis. Patients with kidney disease have better long-term transplant success when they avoid dialysis and receive a kidney from a living donor.\n“Family and Friends Before Fistulas” – is a new movement that HCA Healthcare transplant centers have pioneered to increase awareness of living donation. AV fistulas are the preferred access point for hemodialysis. Through a surgical procedure, blood vessels made wider and stronger to handle the needles that allow blood to flow in and out of a dialysis machine. The surgery is typically performed in advance of needing dialysis. The point of the campaign is for patients with chronic kidney disease to identify a friend or a family member as a possible living donor and avoid dialysis altogether.\n“GFR 20 One Time” – is a new initiative intended to fast-track transplant referrals from referring nephrologists. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is a test that measures a patient’s level of kidney function. “If a patient’s kidney function is 20 One Time, then nephrologists need to refer to transplant so patients can be added to the waiting list and discuss options for transplant prior to initiating dialysis. HCA has been getting into nephrology offices everywhere and really advocating for early referrals to transplant,” said Dr. Bingaman.\nThe educational initiatives are working as more patients are pursuing live kidney donor transplants. At Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital, 33 percent of living donor transplant recipients never see a dialysis unit.\nConsider becoming a living kidney donor\nIt is extraordinary that in the U.S., 6,000 people make the decision to be a living kidney donor every year. Because we have two kidneys, we can donate one and still remain healthy with the kidney we keep. Donating a kidney is not without risks but for many, the risks seem minute compared to the lifesaving benefit the recipient receives. Of all of the decisions we make over a lifetime, the lifesaving ones like these are exceedingly rare.\n“It’s remarkable that donors allow part of their body to be taken out and given to someone else who really needs it so that a patient can live a longer and healthier life. The donors are the real heroes in the transplant community,” said Dr. Bingaman.\nIf you are interested in finding out more information about becoming a living donor, visit United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS).\nHCA Healthcare uses the most advanced technology and medical innovations to provide individualized ongoing care for kidney transplant patients.

{"question":"How do British and American terminology differ when referring to finishing techniques in knitting and crochet seaming?","answer":"In knitting, British English uses the term 'cast off' while American English uses 'bind off' or 'fasten off' to describe the same finishing technique. In crochet seaming, the terminology is more consistent across regions, with both using 'whip stitch' to describe the joining technique, which can be done as either a simple whip stitch through both loops or a flat whip stitch through back loops only.","context":["Does your stitch unravel frequently? That is because you have not done your cast-off properly. And one of the most important things every beginner should know is, how to cast off when knitting.\nDon’t stress thinking that cast off is a critical task. But actually, it’s like a pie. Just make sure you know the actual steps and procedures of binding off. Once you grab them, you will surely become a pro at this level.\nNow the million-dollar question, how to cast off in your knitting. Most of us can’t find the precise solutions for that. No need to worry. I am going to show you How To Cast Off Knitting For Beginners In Easiest Technical Method. Let’s find out.\nHow to cast off when knitting?\nBefore we go to the concept, let me tell you here you will learn about bind off, cast off, their difference, and tutorial. Now, let us not beat around a bush any more and get straight to the point.\nWhat is cast off or bind off?\nAt first, I got confused on bind off and cast off. Like, are they different things? Or the same thing? You will get to see a vocabulary difference in the US and UK regarding cast-off in knitting. People call it to bind off in American English and cast off in British English. As simple as that.\nAs far I know, there is no physical difference between casting off and binding off. Hence, you can have an easy-going task in both the appliances.\nThe basic cast off\nThe basic cast-off process is similar to its name, basic. Here, you will have to remove your stitches from the needle very gently. And make sure you are doing it in a nice way by losing the stitches for a bind-off. As a result, you can avoid those taut edges in your yarn. Or, if you want, you can also use a larger needle and ensure a fine edge in your bind off.\nCast off: Step-by-step\nThere are multiple ways of cast-off knitting. Since you are looking for a solution as a beginner, you must go for the easiest steps first. Before you are going to cast off, you will need some cast-on stitches on your left needle.\nFor good practice, you try it out with 22 stitches and use a double knitting yarn. Talking about the needles, they will be perfect for casting off in 4mm size. With all these supplies, you have to knit two rows in your garter stitch. Then you can easily perform your cast-off in knitting.\nStep 1: Knit your first two stitches\nTake your first two stitches from the row and knit them up normally. Be alert of not going further than usual.\nStep 2: Lift your first stitch over\nHere, you will have to insert your left-hand needle by your first stitch on the right needle. Then lift that stitch over the second stitch which is on your right-hand needle and again take it off the needlepoint.\nStep 3: Knit your second stitch and repeat\nNow, you have to knit another stitch so that you can find two stitches on your right needle. Then lift the first stitch by using your left needle above the second stitch as I said in step 2. Keep doing this process until you reach the end of the row.\nStep 4: Cut the yarn and pull\nAfter you are done with all the steps, your last work will be to work with the last stitch left.\nWhen to use the basic cast off?\nDo you have a knitting pattern? In such appliances, a cast-off would really suit your yarn. However, your pattern may also demand a stretchy bind. In this regard, a basic cast-off will be all that you need. Again, you can use this process for certain knitting patterns like-\n- Knitting patterns which do not require any specific cast off knitting process.\n- Knitting patterns that require a stretchy or loose cast off.\n- Knitting projects, which you should seam together.\nCasting off knit wise\nWhen you will be knitting your last row of a project, a knit-wise cast-off can make your task a lot easier.\nAt first, you have to knit your first two stitches and set up the cast-off on your knitting needle.\nInsert the left needle in your first stitch which you were knitting on your right needle. Thus, you will get a nice stitch at the back.\nNow, you have to lift your first stitch above the second stitch. And after doing it, just drop off the needle. By doing so, a stitch will form on your right needle.\nIn this step, you will need to knit a new stitch on your right needle. After you see it, knit one more stitch with your left needle. Then you will have two stitches on your needle. Do not stop lifting your back stitches and at last drop off your needle.\nCast off purl wise\nSometimes, your knitting pattern will demand a purl stitch. This process is almost like the knit bind off but holds a little change. All you just need to do is purl instead of knitting in the cast off-row.\nDoes purling seem like a hard task to you? No problem, we got your back. Just continue the steps like knitwise cast until your all stitches are ready.\nHere, you will have to make stitches from the opposite side of your yarn. You can make it happen by reversing your knitting technique.\nCast off in pattern\nUndoubtedly, you will face a cast-off in the pattern. In such situations, repeat the work of the stitch pattern as you did at cast off. At first, make two stitches exactly like knit-wise. Then pass your first stitch to your second stitch and cast off one stitch.\nHave you got your two stitches? Great. Now it’s time to purl. Move your yarn a little bit so that it comes in front and purl your next stitch. Keep continuing it in pattern and cast off all your stitches as usual.\nCast off in round\nCasting off in rounds is not as difficult as you think. The only difference is the yarn needs to be put in a round shape compared to the flat knitting.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow do you cast off in knitting for beginners?\nDuring a cast-off in knitting, you will require two stitches in your right needle. Always remember, cast off resembles two stitches in knitting. In addition, you must have a loose hand for doing this process.\nWhat does fasten off mean in knitting?\nA cast-off or bind-off knitting is a game of two stitches. In this process, you will have to make sure that your stitches don’t unravel. Hence, securing the stitches will be your prime task. This type of cast-off or bind-off is called finishing the edge, which is like a fasten-off.\nDoes fasten off mean cast off?\nThe US people call “cast off” as “bind off” or “fasten off”. It refers to a finishing edge of the knitting project. Again, UK people call it “cast off”. Though the terms are different, they carry the same process.\nHow do you rejoin yarn when knitting?\nTo rejoin yarn, you will have to work from the right side that is facing you. Keep working from right to left so that a row forms. Then wrap your new yarn around the needle and scoop it towards you. In this way, a stitch will form.\nHow do you fasten off the last stitch in knitting?\nIn your last stitch, you shall go over the yarn you were going and drop one needle. Then take your scissor, cut the thread, and pull it to tighten up. And finally, you are done with your fastening off the last stitch.\nHope you got a nice concept on how to cast off when knitting. This is a very important step in knitting for not unraveling your stitches. Every newbie knitter can’t figure out how to cast off properly at the first time. Though you grab up all the steps, still there are possibilities of having complications at first trials.\nDon’t worry, practice makes a man perfect. Do try casting off frequently. As a result, you can make your hands fluent in such a simple process in knitting. So, what are you looking for? Go start your process and amaze your friends and family with your beautiful work.\nYou can read another articles:","The crochet whip stitch seam is a simple and versatile technique for joining two pieces of crochet fabric together.\nThis technique is commonly used for joining squares or rectangles to make blankets, scarves, and other projects.

Depending on what the pattern calls for and what you would like to show in your design, you could use either side.\nHow do I Keep a Good Tension when Working the Whip Stitch Seam?\nTo make the whip stitch seam as invisible as possible (as shown above), it is important to keep the tension of the yarn consistent throughout the process.\nIf the stitches are too tight, the seam will be noticeable and may cause the fabric to pucker. If the stitches are too loose, the seam may be too visible and the fabric may stretch out of shape. Experiment with different tensions to find the right balance for your project.\nAre There Different Methods to Working a Whip Stitch?\nYes, when creating a whip stitch seam, you can work through both loops of each stitch (aka simple whip stitch) or just the back loops of the stitches (as shown above) to make an invisible seam or flat whipstitch.\nSimple Whipstitch: Created by working through both loops of each stitch (not invisible) when joining.\nFlat Whipstitch: Created by working through only the back loop of each stitch during joining."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:482e46ca-b257-452a-a9ab-a7c29bb34711>","<urn:uuid:dc60a707-cffa-4735-9aca-bfac91b87767>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role does sunlight play in urban gardening success, and what soil testing steps are essential before starting?","answer":"Sunlight is crucial for urban gardening success - ideally plants need continuous sun exposure, but 5-6 hours minimum is recommended, with south or southwest orientation being optimal. Different plants have varying light requirements - leafy vegetables like spinach and lettuce can adapt to 3-4 hours of sun, while strawberries need only 2-3 morning hours. For soil testing, gardeners should collect samples from 6-8 inches deep from multiple spots (3-10 locations), mix them thoroughly, and send at least one cup of dry soil to a testing facility. This testing is essential to check for heavy metals, determine pH and nutrient levels, and identify if any soil treatment is needed before planting.","context":["Today there is a concern to lead a healthy life, eat healthily and know the origin of the food we eat. These concepts have popularized the fashion of creating urban gardening ideas on the terrace or balcony. Next, we give you the keys to be able to carry it out without any problem.\nThere are foods that are worthwhile to grow in your urban garden. Vegetables grown in a particular garden will have a flavor that cannot be compared to those you can buy in a package. This is due to the lack of sunlight when they are maturing. They are harvested when they are green and mature in artificially lit chambers to be transported (long distances) to the consumer.\nFoods grown in an urban garden without chemical fertilizers or pesticides have the aroma and flavor of natural products in contact with nature. See grow plants and collect their fruits to provide great satisfaction and personal pride.\nWhere to develop urban gardening ideas?\nIt is essential that the plants receive sunlight, the ideal would be a continuous exposure, but if it is not possible at least they receive it from 5 to 6 hours. The advisable orientation is the south or southwest.\nSome leafy vegetables such as spinach, lettuce, chard, watercress, aromatic plants, adapt well and prefer semi-shaded areas. With 3 or 4 hours of sun they have enough. Strawberries and strawberries only need 2 or 3 hours of light in the morning. In case of not having enough solar lighting, you can create reflective surfaces that help increase it.\nIrrigation in the urban garden\nTo work with urban gardening ideas, the balcony or terrace must have a water tap, to fill the shower or install an automatic irrigation. If you do not have a tap, you can install a water tank with a programmer in which hoses with drippers will be attached.\nPlants that are grown in containers need more water than those that grow in the soil. You have to do frequent watering but with little water to avoid waterlogging. Make sure that the containers have good drainage. To the extent possible, avoid watering leaves and foliage to prevent fungal attack.\nYou should be aware of the weather, in the hot months the plants will need a daily watering, while in winter with one every five days will be sufficient. To check if you need water you just have to touch the earth, if there are traces stuck on your finger it is still wet, but you should water.\nChoose the right containers for urban gardening ideas\nYou can choose from a wide variety of containers, depending on the available space of your terrace or balcony.\nThe pots that you use for your plants can also be used to grow vegetables and aromatic plants. If you choose the model with water reserve, you will not have to worry about watering.\nThe culture boxes are suitable for growing aromatic plants, cherry tomatoes, peppers and leafy vegetables.\nIf you have enough space you can opt for cultivation tables. They are more comfortable because you do not have to bend over, suitable for species that do not grow in height: peppers and leafy vegetables.\nYou can create a vertical garden on your terrace or balcony with mini gardens. They are polypropylene containers, a material that is very resistant to the weather. You can grow aromatic plants, lettuce, strawberries…\nChoose the substrate for your crops\nA good substrate makes the plant grow healthy and develop bearing good fruit. The most recommended is that which is composed of coconut fiber and earthworm humus because it is spongy, light and has porosity to have the nutrients. It is advisable to pay with compost regularly.\nChoose simple crops to develop urban gardening ideas\nTo get started in the urban garden, it is better to start with simple crops. When you have gained experience you can incorporate other species.\nIt is one of the most appreciated products. They need a lot of sun and heat to ripen well, in addition to constant watering.

You’ve selected those heirloom seeds with care, plotted out the beds, and stocked up on organic fertilizer. Now all that’s left to do is plot your urban oasis, right?\nNot so fast. It’s important for city-dweller’s to be mindful of the contaminants that often lace urban soil—a problem that has plagued urban gardening initiatives for decades. Centuries of mining, manufacturing, and the use and accumulation of manmade toxins (from pesticides, paints, batteries, sludge, and more) have led to higher-than-normal concentrations of heavy metals like lead, cadmium and arsenic in most urban soils.\nThe excess accumulation of heavy metals in most urban soil is dangerous to humans and other animals, largely because it is so chronic; these metals don’t leave the bloodstream of the plant or animal that ingests them, and they will remain prevalent in whichever food chain they pollute. When plants attempt to grow in contaminated soil, they inevitably take up these hazardous compounds through their roots, which ultimately cycle back into the human population through consumption. (Meaning: if the plants you eat are contaminated, you will be, too.)\nContamination will affect everything in a garden, from plants to the wildlife that comes to feast upon them. People who live in or near homes built before 1978 (when lead-based paint was taken off the market) or near roadways (a source for a streaky stream of harmful particles) are at an even greater risk.\nBioaccumulation of toxins is prevalent in greens like spinach or collards, but is for the most part absent in fruits (e.g. your tomatoes are safe). Nevertheless, gardeners with high concentrations of lead or other compounds in their soil should reconsider planting until they’ve tested (and treated) the soil (more on that below.)\nSome plants are capable of stabilizing or removing metals from surrounding areas through their roots, thus decontaminating groundwater.\nContaminated soil can be excavated from the ground and treated in a lab, or a large plastic cover can be placed over the contaminated soil to prevent runoff or direct contact with other plants and organisms. High temperature treatments (which produce a granular soil that won’t leach minerals) are among the most commonly used methods to treat soil, as are solidifying agents (which cement the soil,) and soil washing.\nThese treatments are expensive, however, so an expert will probably suggest a course of action that involves raising the pH of the soil, draining wetlands, applying phosphates, and choosing plants that are less susceptible to toxic uptake (which means planting fruits and seeds over leafy vegetables).\nSome plants are capable of stabilizing or removing metals from surrounding areas through their roots, thus decontaminating groundwater (after the Chernobyl disaster, scientists planted sunflowers in contaminated areas for this very purpose).\nSo why should you pay someone to test the dirt in your yard? For one thing, decontamination helps identify the pH and nutrient levels of your soil, which clues the gardener in to any deficiencies that may be compromising their crops. The process also helps identify potential planting hotspots, especially when tested in conjunction with major nutrients like Phosphorous, Potassium, Calcium, and Magnesium.\nKnowing this will be useful if you ever decide to purchase fertilizer with soil amendments (like added phosphate, limid, or dolomite) or if you combine soil with other additives that are already enriched.\nHere’s How To Test Your Soil\n- Using a spade or trowel, take small samples of soil from three to ten random spots in your garden. The Environmental Sciences Analytical Center at Brooklyn College recommends sampling 6 to 8 inches deep for vegetables.\n- Thoroughly mix the soil in the container, taking care to remove any pebbles, leaves, or roots you might find. Then, transfer at least one cup of the soil mixture into a plastic bag and seal it (don’t fill the bag; it’ll be flattened if you mail it in an envelope and you don’t want dirt spilling out). Make sure the sample is dry; do not dry soil on a stove or radiator as this may affect the readings.\n- Mail the bag to your preferred testing site. Many of the colleges and universities who operate soil testing programs offer testing services at a low cost (most tests cost between $10-20: be sure to ask for heavy metal testing in addition to the standard panel). If you live in the East or South, try the University of Delaware College of Agriculture and Natural Resources. Folks in the Midwest should try Midwest Laboratories (a nationally-renowned testing center), or the K-State Soil Testing Lab at Kansas State University. West-Coasters should check out Perry Laboratory and Wallace Laboratory, two California-based greats who work specifically with farmers and gardeners. New Englanders need look no further than the University of Massachusetts, Amherst Soil and Plant Tissue Testing Laboratory, which boasts a 3-6 day turnaround time for most samples.\n- Follow-up with whoever conducts your soil test on how to proceed with your gardening plans. This video from the University of Delaware’s Soil Testing Program offers a nice introduction on how to decipher the numbers that will come back with your results."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d5daa00c-c367-4519-98e7-ed3bbd40c18c>","<urn:uuid:09ff5ca8-8d30-4249-80f3-18396a48ce55>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Is having extreme flexibility beneficial for physical health?","answer":"No, extreme flexibility has no advantage and can actually be harmful. If joints are too loose or flexible, you may become more susceptible to joint injuries. Most people should only be able to stretch one or two inches (plus or minus) from the mean, as too much flexibility may increase the chance of injury.","context":["Evaluating flexibility is important. Flexibility is the ability to use a muscle throughout its maximum range of motion. The loss of the ability to bend, twist, and stretch is often a result of muscle disuse. Disuse can come from long periods of sitting or standing.\nSedentary living habits can lead to shortened muscles and tendons. This can cause lower back pain and imbalance in the strength of opposing muscles. The shortening of the hamstrings (back of the thighs) is a very common disorder. Long periods of sitting or standing lead to poor muscle and tendon adjustments and a loss of flexibility in these muscles. This loss of flexibility limits your ability in the following activity.\n- Walking smoothly.\n- Sitting down or standing up gracefully.\n- Performing efficiently in recreational pursuits.\nIs Extreme Flexibility Best?\nExtreme flexibility has no advantage. If your joints are too loose or flexible, you may become more susceptible to injuries of the joints.Â Many people are able to stretch one or two inches (plus or minus) from the man.

{"question":"What differences exist between constrained and unconstrained worldviews, and how do cybersecurity threats exploit these contrasting approaches?","answer":"The constrained vision sees human nature as unchanging and selfish, while the unconstrained vision views human nature as malleable and perfectible. These competing visions shape debates about reason, justice, equality and power. This philosophical divide is reflected in cybersecurity, where threat actors exploit both perspectives - they take advantage of the 'that-won't-happen-to-me syndrome' (reflecting an unconstrained optimism), while security experts advocate for constant vigilance and protective measures (reflecting a constrained view of persistent threats). This is especially evident in work-from-home scenarios, where employees using personal devices create vulnerabilities through activities like browsing illicit sites, using bootlegged software, and improper file sharing, demonstrating the persistent nature of security risks.","context":["A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Strugglesby Thomas Sowell, Michael Edwards (Read by)\nControversies in politics arise from many sources, but the conflicts that endure for generations or centuries show a remarkably consistent pattern. In this classic work, Thomas Sowell analyzes the pattern. He describes the two competing visions that shape our debates about the nature of reason, justice, equality and power: the \"constrained\" vision, which sees human natures as unchanging and selfish, and the \"unconstrained\" vision, in which human nature is malleable and perfectible. A Conflict of Visions offers a convincing case that ethical and policy disputes circle around the disparity between both outlooks.\n- Blackstone Audio, Inc.\n- Publication date:\n- Edition description:\n- Product dimensions:\n- 5.40(w) x 7.50(h) x 0.60(d)\nRead an Excerpt\nOne of the curious things about political opinions is how often the same people line up on opposite sides of different issues. The issues themselves may have no intrinsic connection with each other. They may range from military spending to drug laws to monetary policy to education. Yet the same familiar faces can be found glaring at each other from opposite sides of the political fence, again and again. It happens too often to be coincidence and it is too uncontrolled to be a plot. A closer look at the arguments on both sides often shows that they are reasoning from fundamentally different premises. These different premisesoften implicitare what provide the consistency behind the repeated opposition of individuals and groups on numerous, unrelated issues. They have different visions of how the world works.\nIt would be good to be able to say that we should dispense with visions entirely and deal only with reality. But that may be the most utopian vision of all. Reality is far too complex to be comprehended by any given mind. Visions are like maps that guide us through a tangle of bewildering complexities. Like maps, visions have to leave out many concrete features in order to enable us to focus on a few key paths to our goals. Visions are indispensable-but dangerous, precisely to the extent that we confuse them with reality itself. What has been deliberately neglected may not in fact turn out to be negligible in its effect on the results. That has to be tested against evidence.\nA vision has been described as a \"pre-analytic cognitive act.\"' It is what we sense or feel before wehave constructed any systematic reasoning that could be called a theory, much less deduced any specific consequences as hypotheses to be tested against evidence. A vision is our sense of how the world works. For example, primitive man's sense of why leaves move may have been that some spirit moves them, and his sense of why tides rise or volcanoes erupt may have run along similar lines. Newton had a very different vision of how the world works and Einstein still another. For social phenomena, Rousseau had a very different vision of human causation from that of Edmund Burke.\nVisions are the foundations on which theories are built. The final structure depends not only on the foundation, but also on how carefully and consistently the framework of theory is constructed and how well buttressed it is with hard facts. Visions are very subjective, but well-constructed theories have clear implications, and facts can test and measure their objective validity. The world learned at Hiroshima that Einstein's vision of physics was not just Einstein's vision.\nLogic is an essential ingredient in the process of turning a vision into a theory, just as empirical evidence is then essential for determining the validity of that theory. But it is the initial vision which is crucial for our glimpse of insight into the way the world works. In Pareto's words:\nLogic is useful for proof but almost never for making discoveries. A man receives certain impressions; under their influence he stateswithout being able to say either how or why, and if he attempts to do so he deceives himself-a proposition, which can be verified experimentally . . . .\nVisions are all, to some extent, simplistic-though that is a term usually reserved for other people's visions, not our own. The ever-changing kaleidoscope of raw reality would defeat the human mind by its complexity, except for the mind's ability to abstract, to pick out parts and think of them as the whole. This is nowhere more necessary than in social visions and social theory, dealing with the complex and often subconscious interactions of millions of human beings.\nNo matter what vision we build on, it will never account for \"every sparrow's fall.\" Social visions especially must leave many important phenomena unexplained, or explained only in ad hoc fashion, or by inconsistent assumptions that derive from more than one vision. The purest vision may not be the basis of the most impressive theories, much less the most valid ones. Yet purer visions may be more revealing as to unspoken premises than are the more complex theories. For purposes of understanding the role of visions, William Godwin's Enquiry Concerning Political Justice (1793) may tell us more than Marx's Capital. Indeed, we may understand more of Marx's Capital after we have seen how similar premises worked out in the simpler model of William Godwin. Likewise, the vision of social causation underlying the theories of the Physiocrats was in its essentials very much like the vision elaborated in a more complex and sophisticated way by Adam Smith and still later (and still more so) by Milton Friedman.\nA vision, as the term is used here, is not a dream, a hope, a prophecy, or a moral imperative, though any of these things may ultimately derive from some particular vision. Here a vision is a sense of causation. It is more like a hunch or a \"gut feeling\" than it is like an exercise in logic or factual verification. These things come later, and feed on the raw material provided by the vision. If causation proceeds as our vision conceives it to, then certain other consequences follow, and theory is the working out of what those consequences are. Evidence is fact that discriminates between one theory and another. Facts do not \"speak for themselves.\" They speak for or against competing theories. Facts divorced from theory or visions are mere isolated curiosities.\nTheories can be devastated by facts but they can never be proved to be correct by facts. Ultimately there are as many visions as there are human beings, if not more, and more than one vision may be consistent with a given fact. Facts force us to discard some theoriesor else to torture our minds trying to reconcile the irreconcilablebut they can never put the final imprimatur of ultimate truth on a given theory.\nMeet the Author\nThomas Sowell has taught economics at a number of colleges and universities, including Cornell, University of California Los Angeles, and Amherst.

(Nasdaq: CRWD), a Sunnyvale-based firm that now has a $55 billion market cap, started in Orange County where it still has a large local presence. Irvine’s Cylance sold for about $1.4 billion to BlackBerry in 2019 and also counts a base of operations here.\nIn Newport Beach, the ioXt Alliance started by Mobilitie founder Gary Jabara, wants to make sure the interconnections among the various devices used each day—such as cellphones, smart home lighting controls and automotive technology—are also secure.\nUC Irvine’s Cybersecurity Policy & Research Institute studies ways to make the internet and networks safer, including running mock attack drills. Cybercriminals\nIrvine-based Netwrix Corp. is expanding so quickly that it’s made four acquisitions since January.\n“Most organizations did not have time to prepare a transition plan and provide security training to the employees” when they started working from home last year, said Ilia Sotnikov, security strategist and vice president at Netwrix.\n“Hence the increase in reported incidents that included data loss or oversharing.”\nAttackers know that ransomware is arguably the quickest way to get money from a company without breaking into its system, he said.\n“The cybercriminals took advantage of the global pandemic and highly divisive political scene in the U.S. last year,” Sotnikov said. “We’ve seen considerable changes in how the threat landscape evolved over the last couple years with ransomware as a service, more specialized groups.”\nThe Coronavirus Chaos\n“There was so much chaos during the first few months of the lockdown that every CISO will need to go back and review all of the access and changes that happened,” said Bil Harmer, who is the chief information security officer (CISO) and chief evangelist at computer identity security software maker SecureAuth.\n“When there is chaos and change, the threat actors will be there looking for ways in.”\nHe predicted that companies “will begin putting more and more focus on digital identities and a continuous authentication methodology that will allow them to adjust access on the fly as the landscape or the user behavior changes.”\nCisoshare, founded by Gentile, placed No. 21 on this year’s Business Journal list of Best Places to Work in Orange County and No. 2 on last year’s list of fastest-growing companies, both in the small-firm category.\nCompanies who let employees work from their homes face an increasing threat level similar to that of an apartment owner who adds more apartments to a portfolio: the more units there are, the greater the business risks, Gentile said.\n“When employees are working from home, it expands the digital footprint and perimeter of the organization,” Gentile said during a recent interview.\nProviding security also requires using precious resources and talent—both of which are in short supply at plenty of companies, Gentile said.\n“The majority of security risk lives in the cracks when people don’t effectively collaborate and ‘cover all the bases’ when building something,” he said.\nTraining on workstations from which a network is accessed can reduce the risks when employees work from home in a decentralized environment, Gentile said.\nCompanies that opt for a “hybrid” model combining both work-from-home and the office should be wary.\n“Hybrid can be risky due to any time rules change, there is a higher likelihood of mistakes,” Kevin McDonald, the chief operating officer and chief information security officer of Alvaka Networks in Irvine lists 16 points of vulnerability. They include use of bootlegged software, browsing illicit sites, opening infected files that would otherwise be blocked, communicating with unverified individuals and illegal sharing of various contraband such as movies, images, and games.\n“Gambling, pornography, sports, gaming sites, alternative bulletin boards, messengers, even terrorism and extremist sites lead to infections of the host that then connects to the company,” he said.\n“We all suffer from a bit of that-won’t-happen-to-me syndrome. We’re not a target, we don’t have anything they want, we’re not that rich of a company.”\nHe says ransomware attackers are well aware of the potential payoffs: “One hit and you can retire.”\nCompanies are starting to nudge employees into coming to their offices though the daily back-and-forth from the COVID-19 Delta variant makes it difficult to set firm guidelines.\nFor example, data analytics software maker Alteryx Inc. has “voluntarily opened a number of our offices, including our Irvine location for those who are comfortable coming in,” Chief Financial Officer Kevin Rubin said on Aug. 5. “There’s no mandate that they do.”\n“We will more officially begin asking associates to start coming back no sooner than January,” he added.\nSotnikov sees some bright spots.\n“I think many of the WFH (work-from-home) specific dangers were mitigated over the last 12 months, as organizations had a chance to catch their breath, get new budgets in 2021, catch up on trainings for both admins and employees,” he said.\nThe Senate included more than $1.9 billion in cybersecurity funds as part of the roughly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package, The Hill website said on Aug. 10.\nThe funds will go toward securing critical infrastructure against attacks, helping vulnerable organizations defend themselves and providing funding for a key federal cyber office, among other initiatives.\nExperts point to the targeting of Colonial Pipeline and JBS meat packers earlier this year as examples of the dangers of ransomware demands.\nThe picture is acute on the international front, with both Sotnikov and McDonald noting President Joe Biden’s warning last month that a significant cyber-attack on the U.S. could lead to “a real shooting war” with a major power, highlighting the growing threats posed by Russia and China.\n“That is a very aggressive and provocative statement,” McDonald said. He points to China in particular as he surveys global cybersecurity threats to the U.S.\n“I should be worried about China finally deciding it’s time to become the sole world power and using its understanding of our weak infrastructure to show us how much we don’t really have control of the world anymore,” McDonald said.\nAnd the ultimate piece of bad news?\n“Replacements are made in China,” he said.\nDangers, Positive Signs: OC Cybersecurity Experts Look at Internet Risks\nOC Cybersecurity Experts Give the Business Journal These Tips:\nKEVIN MCDONALD, chief operating officer/chief information security officer, Alvaka Networks in Irvine\nSome dangers are “removed or reduced” if the equipment is owned by the employer.\n“Employee-owned computers are far less likely to be patched and kept up-to-date against vulnerability. This includes the operating systems, office applications, third party applications such as Adobe, Internet browsers, etc.\n“Having a system shared with non-employees (of unknown behavior tendency, character, education, intent) means that there is a high potential for risky behaviors that can result in a compromised local computer.\n“Big time execs and powerful people are targets and they’re the most reticent to participate in this whole process.\n“Cryptocurrency is the “primary reason” for the rise in ransomware in which hackers hijack a computer system and demand payment to release it.”\nMIKE GENTILE, founder/chief executive, Cisoshare in San Clemente\nThe biggest risk to work from home or hybrid for security “is that collaboration and effective small team dynamics are hindered when people can’t work together in person.”\n“The good news is that some of the strongest safeguards when a workforce is decentralized is a strong security training and awareness program, as well as a communication system so employees know how to get in touch with the security team and vice versa. Both of these items are highly effective, but also much more inexpensive than almost all technical safeguards.”\nBIL HARMER, chief information security officer/chief evangelist, SecureAuth in Irvine\n“The hybrid model will not go away, there is far too much upside for companies in it. From 48 extra minutes per day per employee in productivity to reduced footprints in the office (desks, power, coffee, etc), this is a model that will continue.\n“Companies will begin moving to Secure Identity as the first line of defense. They will begin putting more and more focus on digital identities and a continuous authentication methodology that will allow them to adjust access on the fly as the landscape or the user behavior changes.\n“This will allow the user to move around the physical world and have their authentication and authorization adjust as they do to keep them within the acceptable risk profile.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:946a9d32-e9f8-4968-8f0b-5778c001527d>","<urn:uuid:ad45c4f6-8fbd-4d17-b17d-404d81708d47>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between weed control methods and rhododendron care techniques when it comes to mulching?","answer":"For rhododendrons, mulching is essential and requires specific materials like pine bark, cocoa beans, pine needles, or oak leaves applied in a 2-4 inch thick layer. The mulch must be carefully managed to protect their shallow root system, with annual additions either by removing old mulch carefully by hand or adding new mulch over the old layer. In contrast, weed control through mulching falls under cultural control methods, focusing on reducing weed growth by eliminating open space. While mulching can help control weeds, they often require additional control methods such as mechanical (tillage and mowing), chemical (herbicides), or biological control (using natural enemies) due to their aggressive and persistent nature.","context":["A good gardener always starts as a good weeder. – Amos Pettingill, author\nWhat are Weeds?\nThese are some of the accepted definitions of a weed:\n- A plant growing where it is not wanted\n- A plant out of place and not intentionally sown\n- A plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered. (R.W.Emerson)\n- Plants that are competitive, persistent, pernicious, and interfere negatively with human activity (Ross, et. Al.)\nAnother better definition is:\n“Plants that originated under a natural environment and, in response to imposed and natural environments, evolved and continue to do so as an interfering associate with our desired plants and activities” (Aldrich and Kremer, 1997).\nNo matter what the definition used, weeds are invasive plants. They are competitive, fighting your garden plants or lawn grass for water, light, nutrients and space.\nTheir undesirable qualities outweigh their good points. There are approximately 250,000 species of plants around the world, and about 3% or 8000 species of those behave as weeds.\nPlant ecologists suggest that specific plants have specific characteristics that make them likely to become weeds.\nThey possess one or more of the following:\n- Abundant seed production\n- Rapid population establishment\n- Seed dormancy\n- Long-term survival of buried seed\n- Adaptation for spread\n- Presence of vegetative reproductive structures\n- Ability to occupy sites disturbed by human activities\nWeeds in Agriculture\nAround 30,000 weed species worldwide are reducing the quality and volume of crop yields. This is according to Bayer CropScience. Weeds can destroy native habitats, threaten native plants and animals, and even choke rivers and forests.\nWeeds are the most costly category of agricultural pests in organic farming. Since principles don’t allow the use of most herbicides, organic farmers consider weeds a barrier to successful production.\nMajor weed invasions can change the natural diversity, and balance of ecological communities. The alarming figures for 2014: 238 of the 1,000 worst and most commonly found weed species have developed resistance, in 84 crops and 66 countries.\nIt is estimated that weeds cost Australian farmers around $1.5 billion a year in weed control activities, and a further $2.5 billion a year in lost agricultural production.\nAnother source estimates that U.S. farmers annually spend $3.6 billion on chemical weed control and $2.6 billion for cultural and other methods of control. Weeds reduce farm and forest productivity, they invade crops, smother pastures and in some cases can harm livestock.\nOther problems associated with weeds in agriculture include:\n- Reduced crop quality by contaminating the commodity;\n- Interference with harvest;\n- Serve as hosts for crop diseases or provide shelter for insects to overwinter;\n- Limit the choice of crop rotation sequences and cultural practices\n- Production of chemical substances which are toxic to crop plants, animals, or humans.\nWeeds in the Garden\nPart of growing your own garden means that you will also be growing weeds at some point. Weed Identification is one of the most important keys to becoming a successful gardener.\nThe problem with weeds is that they are able to spread rapidly. Something gardeners seek to manage and control. However, weeds still play a key role in the ecosystem.\nWeeds are a constant fact of life in vegetable crops. With a little diligence and timely weeding, the home gardener can turn most weeds into beneficial organic matter.\nHaving an ecological understanding of weeds is the foundation of an effective organic weed management program that can make the difference between success and failure.\nGuide to Weed Identification\nKnowing what type of weed you are dealing with will help you choose the best method of control. There are generally three types of common weed plants based on their growth characteristics.\nThese germinate and spread by seed, having an average lifespan of one year. They can rapidly colonize a garden with their large numbers of seeds. In the garden, they are weeds of cultivated ground. They take advantage of the soil being broken up for crop plants.\nExamples of annual weeds include:\n- Foxtail (giant, yellow, green)\n- Wild oat\n- Fall panicum\nThese are more of a problem because they can live for several years. Most have extensive root systems, making them hard to eradicate. Even if you remove the entire root, any pieces left in the ground will regrow. They also survive the winter by storing food in their roots.\nExamples of perennial weeds include:\n- Bindweed (field and hedge)\nBiennial weeds complete their life cycle in two years, germinating and forming rosettes in their first year, and producing flowers and seeds in their second year.\nExamples of biennial weeds include:\n- Bull thistle\n- Garlic mustard\nTwo Groups of Weeds\nIn addition to their growing type, most weeds in turf and landscapes fall into two major groups. The first we call broadleaf weeds, or, as scientists refer to them, dicots. The second major group is the monocots, which includes the grasses.\nBroadleaf weeds are usually very easy to identify. As the name implies, these plants have relatively wide leaf blades compared to grasses. The leaves may be simple (having one leaflet, like dandelion) or compound (having more than one leaflet, like clover). Veins within the leaf give a netted appearance in most cases.\nA tap rooted perennial weed, the plant features a deep, fleshy taproot which often branches. Leaves branching from the taproot form into rosettes and can remain green throughout the year.\nProper mowing and watering can help Dandelion control by creating dense turf, which inhibits the weed’s ability to grow.\nAnother perennial often found in moist, well shaded areas, ground ivy can be identified by its long, creeping, square stems that root at the nodes.\nGround Ivy is a considerably aggressive weed. Mowing and manual removal can limit its growth, but these practices are likely to eliminate the weed completely.\nAn annual weed that features a taproot, black medic’s stems are hairy, growing upright and somewhat square. The weed also features small, yellow flowers that are clustered on the end of the stalk.\nMaintaining proper levels in your lawn’s soil can also help discourage this annual weed. Proper mowing and watering practices can also keep black medic at bay.\nThis plant is mostly found in gardens, orchards, and other undisturbed locations. It is a rosette-forming perennial of high or low maintenance turf. Its leaves are smooth or inconspicuously hairy and prominent veins run parallel with the margins.\nHand-pulling is only an effective short-term method for removing this weed. It can disrupt the seeds from their pods, spreading them in your lawn.\nNarrow Leaf Weeds\nThese are plants with a single cotyledon or seed leaf. Their leaf blades usually have parallel venation, and fibrous roots systems. Monocots may be grouped as grasses, sedges, or lilies.\nBeing warm-season annual grasses, giant foxtails have short hairs on the top surface and margins of the leaf blade. Mostly found in corn and soybean fields, in lawns, gardens and turf.\nA known perennial, this plant spreads easily since it reproduces by rhizomes, tubers, and seeds. One key in the identification of yellow nutsedge is the simple, triangular-shaped stem of the plant.\nA cool-season perennial, it is difficult to eliminate this weed in small grain field. It can contaminate the crop, thus lowering its value. Wild garlic propagates itself by developing underground bulbs that grow into new wild garlic plants.\nA warm-season annual, it appears in many crops as well as in gardens and lawns. Stems are erect or spreading, smooth, often rooting at the nodes. Large crabgrass seeds germinate in late spring and grow well in dry, hot weather.\nOften appear in corn and soybean fields, it’s a warm-season annual weed that can be identified by its flat stems and seedheads.\nThere are several tools to help you identify weeds on your property. This Identification Tool lets you easily identify a weed based on the features of a particular plant.\nIf you ask gardeners to track every hour spent in the garden, they would probably tell that they do an inordinate amount of weeding.\nThere are a number of weed control methods, depending on the weed and the gardener. Here are your options:\nCultural Weed Control\nIt’s one of the easiest ways to control weeds. It involves close planting to reduce weed growth by eliminating open space.\nCover crops can also be effective. It means using a plant in order to literally ‘cover’ a piece of land that is not in use.\nMechanical Weed Control\nMechanical weed control refers to any technique that involves the use of farm equipment to control weeds.\nThe two mechanical control techniques most often used are tillage and mowing.\nChemical Weed Control\nThere are weeds which can become aggressive to the point of taking over.\nIn cases like these, chemical control is sometimes necessary to control the germination or growth of the weed species. Herbicides like glyphosate, bromoxynil, and paraquat are used.\nBiological Weed Control\nRefers to any technique that involves the use of natural enemies of weed plants to control the germination of weed seeds.\nExamples of biological weed control include sheep to control tansy ragwort or leafy spurge.\nOf course, which weed goes and which weed stays depends on the individual gardener. Some weeds can actually be quite attractive in the garden, and don’t really bring harm to plants or soil.\nFor more information on weeds, here’s a helpful Photo Guide to Weeds.\nWhat types of weeds are common in your yard or garden and what methods do you use to control them?\nPhipps, N.

They require a rich well drained high organic content\nsoil mix. You can provide this by mixing into the existing soil a\nvery large amount of Peat Moss. The Peat Moss should be 50% by volume of\nthe soil. This will produce an acidic soil of about 6.0 to 6.5\npH. Check this estimate with a pH meter. After checking the pH of\nthe soil mix you will want to adjust the pH to 4.5to 5.5 using Garden\nSulphur according to the label directions. Never use Aluminum\nSulphate to adjust the pH of the soil for Rhododendrons because in\nacidic conditions the Aluminum can become toxic to the Rhododendrons\nespecially to younger plants. You should also add some leaf mold\nand coarse sand to the soil mix to encourage better growth.\nWhen you plant Rhododendrons like this Duke of York prepare a hole at\nleast 2 to 3 feet wide and 6 to 8 inches deeper than the height of the\nroot ball. If you think extra drainage will be needed place a 4 to 6 inch layer of\ncoarse gravel in the hole ensuring that you still have the required 6\nto8 inches between it and the bottom of the root ball.

{"question":"As a runner looking to improve my speed, what are the key mechanisms of hamstring injuries during sprinting, and what prevention strategies should I focus on?","answer":"During sprinting, hamstring injuries typically occur in the terminal swing phase of running when the leg is fully extended forward. At this point, the biceps femoris muscle contracts forcefully while lengthening to decelerate the extending knee and flexing hip, reaching 110% of its normal length. To prevent injuries, you should focus on several key strategies: regular stretching over at least 6 weeks to increase flexibility, strength and conditioning training to improve muscle resilience, and working with a coach to optimize running technique. Additionally, gait analysis and custom orthotics can help optimize ground contact and provide better sensory feedback for foot positioning. A good technique is crucial as it ensures more efficient movement and balanced load through the joints.","context":["Nutrition and the Musculoskeletal SystemDecember 30, 2019\nWhat Is Stress?January 12, 2020\nIt was the last two minutes of a rugby game; the ball was passed to me and I saw an open space leading to the end zone; I was going to score and my team would win.\nFor a split second this plan seemed totally feasible.\nI planted my lead leg, put my head down and pushed off in a sprint towards glory. First step, second step, third step, then it happened. I did actually score. We did end up winning. However, I was losing.\nAfter my third stride, I felt a painful twinge in the back of my right leg. Then my fourth, fifth and sixth strides all felt shorter, slower, weaker and painful. I had pulled my hamstring. This would be an injury that would show itself more than once over the course of 4 years afterwards.\nHamstring injuries (HSI) are common in sports that require powerful forceful movements such as sprinting and jumping. In the NFL, HSIs account for 12% of all primary injuries. They are the most common injury in professional soccer and account for 29% of track and field injuries in sprinter. It’s safe to say that if you’re a lawn bowler- you’re in the safe zone.\nThe problem with HSIs is that there is a high reinjury rate. The average amount of time missed from sport is 18 days, however actual time missed is often greater and costly. This is due to the complex nature of the hamstrings- a group of three muscles. Injury can vary in types, location and size, thus making it difficult to make recommendations regarding rehabilitation and prognosis about healing time. The greatest incidence for re-injury occurs within the first two weeks after return to sport.\nLet’s start with the basics – Anatomy\nThe hamstrings are a collective group of muscles located on the backside of our thigh. These muscles are: the biceps femoris, semitendinosus and semimembranosus. Together, these muscles work to flex (bend) the knee and extend (straighten) the hip. These muscles have long tendons (the connection between muscle and bone), which help develop a “spring” effect that accentuates performance during athletics. This “spring” effect can also lead to increased susceptibility to injury.\nThe part of the muscle that are most susceptible to injury is the myotendinous junction (fancy speak for where the muscle tendon meets the muscle belly)\nHow injury occurs\nHSI can occur in either a high speed state where the muscle is overstrained or in a slow speed state where the muscle is overstretched. The two mechanisms of injury contrast one another and generally occur in different locations. The most common mechanism of injury to the hamstring is during sprinting and is believed to occur during the terminal swing phase of the gait cycle (when your leg is fully extended out in front). At this point the hamstrings are actively lengthening (eccentrically contracting) and absorbing energy from the decelerating limb to prepare for ground contact. The biceps femoris is required to contract forcefully while lengthening to decelerate the extending knee and flexing hip. At this point, the biceps femoris is placed under the greatest amount of stretch (110% of its normal length!). Terminal swing is a particularly vulnerable position for bicep femoris injury due to its high activation in a lengthened state. Think about the story in the beginning…kind of makes sense now right? Still don’t understand? Think of a tug of war- quadriceps vs hamstrings. If one side is stronger than the other, the weaker side will lose the battle and break down. If there is a good balance of strength, the rope will stay at a standstill and no one loses- no breakdown.\nHSIs that occur during slow movements such as dancing or stretching involve simultaneous hip flexion and knee extension placing the hamstrings in an extremely lengthened position. The upper semimembranosus is normally affected in this condition. Although this mechanism of injury is often less painful at onset, it tends to require a longer recovery period than a HSI incurred in a high speed state.\nInjuries of this nature are usually referred to as a “muscle strain”. I prefer to classify a muscle injury as a functional muscle disorder but that’s another story for another blog post.\nGrade 1- the muscle or tendon is overstretched. Small tears to muscle fibers may or may not occur. Symptoms include pain with or without swelling\nGrade 2- the muscle or tendon is overstretched with more fibers torn but the muscle is not completely torn. Symptoms include pain, swelling, bruising and decreased movement due to pain.\nGrade 3- the muscle or tendon is mostly or completely torn or ruptures. Symptoms include pain, swelling, tenderness, bruising, movement will be difficult.\nGrades 1 and 2 should be evaluated and treated conservatively by a healthcare professional. Grade 3 should be evaluated further by a health care professional, as surgery may be necessary.\nThe main goal of physical therapy for a hamstring injury is to return the athlete to sport at the prior level of function, without pain, and with nominal risk of re-injury. As mentioned earlier, recurrence is of serious concern particularly within the first 2 weeks returning to sports. Persistent weakness in the injured muscle, reduced extensibility of the tissue due to residual scar tissue and adaptive changes in the biomechanics and motor patterns of sporting movements following the original injury should be addressed.\nIn 2014, a few Swedish researchers looked at rehab protocols for hamstring injuries and compared them in treating elite sprinters and jumpers. They found, what I deem to be, a successful treatment program for grade 1 and 2 HSIs:\nFrom date of injury to start of rehabilitation protocol, take 5 days to R.I.C.E it. (rest, ice, compress and elevate.). When icing, I’d suggest a 10min on/ 10 min off/ 10 min on approach. Try to do this once every hour.\nThe exercises – each exercise should be performed as described below without pain. If pain is experienced, reduce the range in which the exercises are performed.\nL-1 ‘The Extender’ – The player should hold and stabilise the thigh of the injured leg with the hip flexed approximately 90° and then perform slow knee extensions to a point just before pain is felt. Twice every day, three sets with 12 repetitions\nL-2 ‘The Diver’ – The exercise should be performed as a simulated dive, that is, asa hip flexion (from an upright trunk position) of the injured, standing leg and simultaneous stretching of the arms forward and attempting maximal hip extension of the lifted leg while keeping the pelvis horizontal; angles at the knee should be maintained at 10–20° in the standing leg and at 90° in the lifted leg. Owing to its complexity, this exercise should be performed very slowly in the beginning. Once every other day, three sets with six repetitions\nL-3 ‘The Glider’ – The exercise is started from a position with upright trunk, one hand holding on to a support and legs slightly split. All the body weight should be on the heel of the injured (here left) leg with approximately 10–20° flexion in the knee. The motion is started by gliding backward on the other leg (note low friction sock) and stopped before pain is reached. The movement back to the starting position should be performed by the help of both arms, not using the injured leg. Progression is achieved by increasing the gliding distance and performing the exercise faster. Once every third day, three sets with four repetitions.\nIn addition to these exercises a general exercises program should be preformed 3 times a week. This program should consist of:\nStationary cycling for 10 min\n10X 20sec fast foot stepping in place\n10X jogging 40 m with short strides\n10X 10m forward/backward accelerations\nWhen this can be performed without pain an addition of 6X 20m, 4X 40m and 2X 60m high speed running drills should be added in 3 times per week.\n*keep in mind this protocol is aimed for track athletes. For sports with lateral movements I’d suggest the addition of figure 8s and ladder drills.\nI hope this provides insight into hamstring injuries. If you are struggling with reoccurring hamstring issues and you’re in Dubai, I’d suggest coming by DISC to get checked out by a competent health care professional!\nDr. Kristian F.","How to stay injury free…\nAssess Treat Rehabilitate\nThough I mention runners, the following points applies to anyone who trains and is looking to enhance performance with the inclusion of interval training, specifically sprints.\nWhy do runners start interval training?\nUsually, to increase running speed and aerobic fitness delivering a greater stimulus to your heart, lungs and muscles. (1)\n(An easy read article can be found here: American College of Sports Medicine- https://www.acsm.org/docs/default-source/files-for-resource-library/high-intensity-interval-training.pdf?sfvrsn=b0f72be6_2)\nHow does the running stride differ between long distance runners and sprinting?\nQuite a lot really, but we’ll just take note of one major point, a longer stride, this requires a fuller range of motion through the hamstring muscles and joints (knees and hips).\nUnfortunately, the body does not instantly adapt to changes in exercise, this takes time, needing the right load at the right time with a progressive approach to development, something which becomes less efficient as we age.\nOne of the most prevalent injuries in runners is the hamstring strain, also common in football and many other sports (2).\nWhy do we get hamstring injuries?\nOutside of ankle, knee, hip and spinal issues, hamstring muscle injuries are from overload which can happen when the muscle is stretched beyond its capacity or challenged with a sudden excessive load.\nHow can you maximise the muscle length?\nMaximising the hamstring length allows for a fuller range of motion, when muscles are tight/tense they have an effectively a shorter range. Stretching, provided its regular and over a period of time can help you maintain a fuller range of motion (3).\nHow can you maximise the resilience and capacity to withstand the load placed on it?\nStrength and conditioning (7), a structured approach to developing the capacity of the body to generate and withstand the loads applied to it through actions, based on physiology (tissue response) and research.\nWhat is the best recovery and rehabilitation action plan?\nA Cochrane systematic review 2020 (8) reported that no single approach demonstrated the prevention of a re-injury to Hamstring muscles, and outside of Manual therapy (treatment inclusive of manipulation, soft-tissues and specific interventions) did not show a clinical difference. We can hypothesis that altered mechanics and function once corrected minimised altered adaptations, however this doesn’t address the reason for the mal-adaptation and compensation patterns which negatively effecting the body movements.\nThe hamstring muscles are part of a complex musculoskeletal system which requires a global approach.\nMuscle recovery will follow tissue response. Depending on the phase of repair- proliferation, regeneration or remodelling, will require the right load applied at the right time, this may include strength and conditioning exercises, stretching- isometric/PNF/static. But note the last thing you want to do with a pulled hamstring is stretch the life out of it… (4)\nWhat is the best prevention plan?\nWe need to maximise muscle and joint performance-\n-Assessment and treatment with a rehabilitation plan for prevention\n-Gait Analysis, a way of identifying how you run or walk, examining the movement pattern as your feet contact the floor, looking for any deviations from normal/optimum movement, and any dysfunction.\n-custom made orthotics- using data from the Gait Analysis these will optimise ground contact, combining custom orthotics provided greater improvements in stability and performance. (6) providing improved sensory feedback needed for a more accurate foot positioning.\n-Technique, a good technique is more efficient, less energy consuming and places a more balance load through the joints. (5)\n-Work with a coach, have a training plan that’s personal to you. A good coach can minimise the risks, improve your technique and performance whilst identifying issues that need addressing.\nHamstring injuries plague amateurs and the professionals, even with the latest research and resources, to facilitate a successful recovery and prevent reinjury you need a multifaceted approach.\nIf you are experiencing a hamstring injury or any other injury contact Deansgate Osteopathic Clinic, we offer a complete rehab solution from ground contact to injury recovery with prevention strategies.\n“Assess – Treat – Rehabilitate – Strength & Condition – Integration”\n1-Effects of Two High-intensity Interval Training Concepts in Recreational Runners (Faelli et al 2019). Research suggests that in recreational runners the 10-20-30 training is effective in improving aerobic fitness and performance.\n2-Common Running Injuries: Evaluation and Management (Arnold, Michael J, Moody, Aaron L 2018) Running is a common form of exercise but predisposes athletes to several running-related injuries..\n3-The research has demonstrated that when simple static stretching is executed regularly over a minimum of 6 weeks, flexibility is significantly increased (Bandy & Irion, 1994; Thacker et al., 2003).\n4-Prevention of Hamstring Injuries in Collegiate Sprinters (Yusaku Sugiura et al,. 2017).

{"question":"How does PET imaging technology help monitor cell-based therapies in patients?","answer":"PET (positron emission tomography) imaging allows doctors to non-invasively visualize and track the biology of therapeutic cells in living organisms. This technology enables monitoring whether transplanted cells survive and engraft, if they migrate to areas of disease, and whether they successfully reestablish the activity needed to counteract disease. It uses PET Reporter Genes (PRG) and PET Reporter Probes (PRP) to generate detectable signals that enable whole body pharmacokinetic and therapeutic outcomes information.","context":["Novel molecular imaging approaches to monitor gene and cell-based therapies Gene and cell-based therapies have ushered in a new era of opportunities in regenerative medicine and oncology. However, a critical roadblock in the effective development and evaluation of cellular therapeutics is the inability to follow the fate and function of the therapeutic genes and cells in treated patients. We propose to develop technologies for specific identification and tracking of therapeutic genes and cells in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET), a quantitative, non-invasive molecular imaging approach applicable to both preclinical and clinical settings. This application addresses a key limitation of current reporter gene strategies, in which therapeutic vectors and cells are genetically modified to produce a signal detectable by PET. Instead of commonly used, highly immunogenic viral proteins, we will generate novel PET reporter genes based on fully human proteins, to overcome this challenge to clinical implementation. This project relies on many years of grants and basic research results that are now ready to advance to the commercial domain. We propose a three year effort to turn recent advances into practical outcomes delivered as end-user-ready PET Reporter Gene (PRG) delivery kits and PET Reporter Probes (PRP) that will enable whole body pharmacokinetic and therapeutic outcomes information. This application will also deliver preliminary information from a first-in-human Phase 0 small trial of new PET reporter probe biodistribution and dosimetry. Our proposal leverages an established partnership between UCLA (the laboratories of the Ahmanson Translational Imaging Division and the laboratory of Harvey Herschman) and CellSight Technologies (CST, a biotech company based in San Francisco, CA). The UCLA-CST partnership builds on past extensive interactions at UCLA between investigators and consultants, as described in this application. We will carry out four Specific Aims.\nAim 1 consists of in vitro, cell culture and animal studies to evaluate and optimize new PET Reporter Gene-PET Reporter Probe (PRG-PRP) systems. Our new current PRG being developed is a point mutant (N44D) of the human thymidine kinase 2 (tk2) gene. L-[18F]FMAU and L- [18F]FEAU, two hTK2-N44D substrates, are our new PRPs.\nIn Aim 1 we will also determine whether the TK2- based PRG can elicit an immune response in humans and we propose a strategy to eliminate this possibility.\nIn Aim 2 we propose a stringent preclinical evaluation of the new PRG-PRP systems, using animal models of gene and cell-based therapies against two types of cancer: hepatic metastases of colorectal cancer and melanoma.\nAim 3 proposes a strategy to develop, validate, and commercialize kits for PRG delivery into murine and human therapeutic cells and a plan to disseminate this new capability to wider communities of end- users.\nIn Aim 4 we will complete an eIND submission to enable first-in-human studies of the biodistribution and dosimetry of the new PET reporter probes L-FMAU and L-FEAU. These \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"first-in-human\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" studies will set the stage for a follow-up study in which UCLA and CST will submit a full IND application to the FDA to initiate clinical testing of the new PRG-PRP systems in cancer patients. The set of new PET imaging technologies co-developed by UCLA and CST investigators may find immediate clinical applications in experimental gene and cell-based therapies in cancer and may be broadly applicable to therapies for diseases with significant public health impact, including transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells in congenital and acquired disorders such as AIDS, islet cells in type 1 diabetes, ES-derived neural stem cells in Parkinson's disease, and stem cells in myocardial dysfunction.\nOne of the great promises of cell-based therapies is that physicians will find a way to isolate and modify patient's stem cells or T lymphocytes so that they can be re-injected into patients to treat their disease. However, a key challenge is to be able to monitor the cells after they have been administered and see if they survive and engraft, whether they home to areas of disease, and whether they are able to reestablish the activity needed to counteract disease. We are developing novel tools to follow the fate and function of transplanted cells, based on a powerful medical camera called the PET scanner. PET imaging, or positron emission tomography, allows doctors to visualize the biology of cells in living organisms, including patients. The development of novel tools and technologies that will ultimately enable the routine use of PET for clinical monitoring of cell-based therapies in oncology and regenerative medicine represents a complex endeavor that exceeds the capabilities of a typical academic group and carries substantial risks for start-up biotech companies. In our opinion, the solution is an integrated approach in which academic and industry partners work together from the inception of the project, on both discovery and product development phases. The scientific yield from this work may lead to improved therapies for cancer, significantly impacting public health.\n|Campbell, Dean O; Yaghoubi, Shahriar S; Su, Ying et al.

{"question":"Which type of dryer has simpler maintenance requirements - membrane dryers or air-cooled chillers?","answer":"Membrane dryers and air-cooled chillers both offer simple maintenance, but for different reasons. Membrane dryers require virtually no maintenance as they have no moving parts, never need service or adjustment, don't require monitoring devices, and only need prefilters to keep out liquids and solids. Air-cooled chillers are noted for their relative simplicity compared to water-cooled chillers, resulting in simpler maintenance requirements and reduced maintenance costs.","context":["Water in compressed air can damage production machinery, resulting in downtime and spoiled product.\nAir dryers - continued\nTube-in-tube refrigeration dryers, Figure 3, operate by cooling a mass of aluminum granules or bronze ribbon that in turn cools the compressed air. As the tube-to-tube refrigeration dryer cycles, a thermometer in the granule mass senses its temperature. As the temperature rises, a switch turns on the refrigeration unit. When the temperature drops to a cut-off point, refrigeration stops. These dryers are designed to produce dew points of 35° or 50° F.\nWater-chiller refrigeration dryers, Figure 4, use a mass of water for cooling. An extra heat exchanger is needed to maintain chilled water flow through the condenser, as well as a water pump. Dew points can be between 40° and 50° F. Water-chiller dryers cycle as they operate.\nDirect-expansion refrigeration dryers, Figure 5, use a refrigerant-to-air cooling process to produce pressure dew points of 35° F below standard operating conditions. (100° F temperature at compressor inlet, 100 psig, 100° F ambient - from the NFPA standard). No recovery period is necessary, so direct-expansion refrigeration dryers run continuously. The cost difference between cycling and continuous operation is difficult to calculate. The difference in electrical power consumption between cycling and non-cycling refrigerated dryers is outweighed by the value of continuous operation of the plant's pneumatic equipment.\nMembrane-type dryers are gas-separation devices. They consist of miniature membrane tubes made of plastic materials compounded to allow water vapor to pass through when there is a vapor pressure differential. They work as your lungs do, venting water vapor each time you exhale.\nTypically this membrane material is formed into bundles of thousands of individual fibers from one end of the dryer to the other. Water vapor escapes through the walls of the fiber to a sweep chamber from where it is continually vented to atmosphere as a gas. A fraction of the dried air is routed through the sweep chamber to continuously purge and exhaust moisture vapor.\nIndustrial-grade membranes can be used for years to dry air continuously. They respond spontaneously to any change in inlet conditions. They perform at temperatures between 40° and 150° F (ambient or inlet), and handle pressures from about 60 to 300 psig. They will deliver a consistent outlet dew-point reduction anywhere between these extremes. The inlet flow rate and pressure determine the outlet dew point suppression. In other words, membrane air dryers deliver a consistent level of drying protection that follows the rise or fall of the inlet dew point temperature, and can easily be sized to follow the ISA recommended 20° F pressure dew point suppression below ambient. Outlet pressure dew points can also be selected as low as 50° F. Flow capacities are relatively low, but modules can be installed in parallel for higher flows.\nPrefilters mounted immediately upstream from the membrane dryer keep out liquids and solids to allow an almost unlimited service life. Because water vapor passes right through the membrane material, it does not accumulate there, so membranes do not become saturated and never need to be regenerated. Membranes have no moving parts to wear out. They are non-electric and suitable for most hazardous locations. They require no RF shielding or protection. They use no refrigerant gas or potentially dusty desiccants.\nThey make no noise. And, they can be mounted in any orientation. Their low-mass components are inherently vibration-resistant. Because they are static, inert devices, they never need service or adjustment and don't require monitoring devices. Made of plastic and aluminum, they do not rust or corrode and don't need painting. They have almost no pressurized volume, so most pressure code restrictions do not apply.\nNote: membrane gas separators will remove other gases too. Some membrane-type compressed air dryers can reduce outlet oxygen concentrations (or not permeate oxygen at all). Consult the manufacturer to determine if membrane can be used for breathing air.","What are Chiller Systems?\nCommercial buildings use Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems to dehumidify and to cool the building. Modern commercial buildings seek efficient HVAC systems and components as part of broader initiatives centered on building performance and sustainability. Building occupants similarly carry great expectations, that the HVAC system will function as intended . . . to create a comfortable interior environment regardless of the conditions external to the building.\nChillers have become an essential HVAC component of a wide variety of commercial facilities, including hotels, restaurants, hospitals, sporting arenas, industrial and manufacturing plants, etc. The industry has long recognized that chiller systems represent the single largest consumer of electrical usage in most facilities. They can easily consume more than 50% of the total electrical usage during seasonal periods. According to the US Department of Energy (DOE), chillers can combine to use approximately 20% of the total electric power generated in North America. Moreover, the DOE estimates that chillers can expend up to 30% in additional energy usage due to various operational inefficiencies. These acknowledged inefficiencies cost companies and building facilities billions of dollars annually.\nIn general, a chiller facilitates the transfer of heat from an internal environment to an external environment. This heat-transfer device relies on the physical state of a refrigerant as it circulates through the chiller system. Certainly, chillers can function as the heart of any central HVAC system.\nHow Does a Chiller Work?\nA chiller works on the principle of vapor compression or vapor absorption. Chillers provide a continuous flow of coolant to the cold side of a process water system at a desired temperature of about 50°F (10°C). The coolant is then pumped through the process, extracting heat out of one area of a facility (e.g., machinery, process equipment, etc.) as it flows back to the return side of the process water system.\nA chiller uses a vapor compression mechanical refrigeration system that connects to the process water system through a device called an evaporator. Refrigerant circulates through an evaporator, compressor, condenser and expansion device of a chiller. A thermodynamic process occurs in each of above components of a chiller. The evaporator functions as a heat exchanger such that heat captured by the process coolant flow transfers to the refrigerant. As the heat-transfer takes place, the refrigerant evaporates, changing from a low-pressure liquid into vapor, while the temperature of the process coolant reduces.\nThe refrigerant then flows to a compressor, which performs multiple functions. First, it removes refrigerant from the evaporator and ensures that the pressure in the evaporator remains low enough to absorb heat at the correct rate. Second, it raises the pressure in outgoing refrigerant vapor to ensure that its temperature remains high enough to release heat when it reaches the condenser. The refrigerant returns to a liquid state at the condenser. The latent heat given up as the refrigerant changes from vapor to liquid is carried away from the environment by a cooling medium (air or water).\nTypes of Chillers:\nAs described, two different cooling mediums (air or water) can facilitate the transfer of the latent heat given up as the refrigerant changes from vapor to liquid. Thus, chillers can use two different types of condensers, air-cooled and water-cooled.\n- Air-cooled condensers resemble the “radiators” that cool automobile engines. They use a motorized blower to force air across a grid of refrigerant lines. Unless they are specially designed for high-ambient conditions, air-cooled condensers require ambient temperatures of 95°F (35°C) or below to operate effectively.\n- Water-cooled condensers perform the same function as air-cooled condensers, but require two steps to complete the heat transfer. First, heat moves from refrigerant vapor into the condenser water. Then, the warm condenser water is pumped to a cooling tower where the process heat is ultimately discharged to the atmosphere.\nWater-cooled chillers feature a water-cooled condenser connected with a cooling tower. They have commonly been used for medium and large installations that have a sufficient water supply. Water-cooled chillers can produce more constant performance for commercial and industrial air conditioning because of the relative independence to fluctuations of the ambient temperature. Water-cooled chillers range in size from small 20-ton capacity models to several thousand-ton models that cool the world’s largest facilities such as airports, shopping malls and other facilities.\nA typical water-cooled chiller uses recirculating condenser water from a cooling tower to condense the refrigerant. A water-cooled chiller contains a refrigerant dependent on the entering condenser water temperature (and flow rate), which functions in relation to the ambient wet-bulb temperature. Since the wet-bulb temperature is always lower than the dry-bulb temperature, the refrigerant condensing temperature (and pressure) in a water-cooled chiller can often operate significantly lower than an air-cooled chiller. Thus, water-cooled chillers can operate more efficiently.\nWater-cooled chillers typically reside indoors in an environment protected from the elements. Hence, water-cooled chiller can offer a longer lifespan. Water-cooled chillers typically represent the only option for larger installations. The additional cooling tower system will require additional installation expense and maintenance as compared to air-cooled chillers.\nAir-cooled chillers rely on a condenser cooled by the environment air. Thus, air-cooled chillers may find common application in smaller or medium installations where space constraints may exist. An air-cooled chiller can represent the most practical choice in scenarios where water represents a scarce resource.\nA typical air-cooled chiller can feature propeller fans or mechanical refrigeration cycles to draw ambient air over a finned coil to condense the refrigerant. The condensation of the refrigerant vapor in the air-cooled condenser enables the transfer of heat to the atmosphere.\nAir-cooled chillers offer the significant advantage of lower installation costs. Simpler maintenance also results due to their relative simplicity as compared to water-cooled chillers. Air-cooled chillers will occupy less space, but will mostly reside outside a facility. Thus, the outdoor elements will compromise their functional lifespan.\nThe all-inclusive nature of air-cooled chillers reduces maintenance costs. Their relative simplicity coupled with reduced space requirements produces great advantages in many types of installations.\nActions to Increase Efficiency of Chiller Systems:\nChiller costs consume a substantial part of your building’s utility bills. What measures should one take to obtain energy savings through maximal efficiency of the chiller system? Let’s examine some possibilities.\nChiller systems will operate more efficiently through proper ongoing maintenance. Most organizations recognize this value and have taken steps as part of their day-to-day facility management best practices. Some common best practices for chiller systems include:\n- Inspect and clean condenser coils. Heat transfer has a large effect on chiller systems and remains fundamental to producing efficient chiller operation. Routine maintenance should inspect condenser coils for clogging and free air passage.\n- Maintain refrigerant charge. A chiller’s cooling quotient depends on proper refrigerant levels in the system. Maintaining proper refrigerant charge can greatly impact energy efficiency by reducing cooling costs by nearly 5-10%.\n- Maintain condenser water: Condenser water loops used with cooling towers must maintain proper water flow as designed. Any debris like sand, erosive solids and contamination materials can affect the condenser water loop. Fouling or scaling can inhibit water flow and greatly impact the chiller operating efficiency.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) continues to advance in everyday practical applications. Machinery such as chiller systems will benefit from AI algorithms that can detect potential failures before they occur. Predictive maintenance leverages the collection and analysis of chiller system operational data to determine when maintenance actions should be taken prior to catastrophic failure. As chillers systems represent the heart of most modern HVAC systems, the prevention of catastrophic failures that produce significant “downtime” will save on emergency repair costs as well as reputation. The critical role played by a chiller system warrants the increased scrutiny. Big Data and AI will minimize downtime and maximize productivity.\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) provides the data collection tool that can enable AI applications such as predictive maintenance. In fact, the future of HVAC is AI and IoT. IoT enables the collection of real-time data from a chiller to enable continual analysis of its operation. The granular IoT data collected from a chiller will go far beyond that obtained by visual inspection. IoT connects building engineers to real-time visibility of critical HVAC assets, thereby enabling informed monitoring of actual operating conditions.\nChillers operate as part of a complex HVAC system. Water-cooled chillers have greater complexity due to the connection to a cooling tower system. Evaluating overall chiller plant performance will therefore involve an analysis of total power consumption of the compressor, pumps, cooling tower fans, etc. to evaluate comprehensive efficiency measures such as kW/ton.\nOptimization of the overall chiller plant must be performed holistically. Various adjustments focusing on optimal chilled water set points, chiller sequencing and load balancing, peak demand management, cooling tower water management, etc. can only be performed with operational data. IoT can provide the tools for such optimization by providing real-time monitoring of power consumption from each part of the chiller plant, supply/return temperatures from the chiller and cooling tower, water flow rates from the condenser water loop, etc. IoT has found practical application in HVAC to facilitate true optimization.\nChiller operational efficiency will greatly impact your building operating costs. Ongoing routine maintenance represents the minimum from the perspective of facility management. Predictive maintenance and optimization of the chiller system requires real-time operational data. IoT has opened the door to new forms of chiller efficiencies.\nEditor's Note: This post was originally published in November 2017 and has been completely revamped and updated for accuracy and comprehensiveness."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8c33c4a9-5691-4844-8a9d-07cee8929eae>","<urn:uuid:0e282f18-3d8a-49ec-b001-5ee3512f7143>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role do emerging regional powers play in global economic stability, and how does this connect to potential risks of economic collapse through market mechanisms?","answer":"Emerging regional powers, particularly in Asia, present significant challenges to the distribution of power within the global inter-state system. This dynamic interacts with economic stability in several ways. The rise of new powers can affect investor confidence and market stability, potentially contributing to stock market crashes when there is a loss of investor confidence and dramatic decline in stock prices. Additionally, these power shifts can lead to local currency crises when foreign investors withdraw their investments, causing currency devaluation and reduced purchasing power. The post-Cold War world has seen emerging regional dynamics in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East that contribute to the complex relationship between political power and economic stability. These relationships can either stabilize or destabilize the international system, particularly when combined with economic factors like hyperinflation or stagflation.","context":["GI7007 - The Evolution of the Modern Inter-State System (2019/20)\n|Module specification||Module approved to run in 2019/20|\n|Module title||The Evolution of the Modern Inter-State System|\n|Module level||Masters (07)|\n|Credit rating for module||20|\n|School||School of Social Sciences|\n|Total study hours||100|\n|Running in 2019/20||\nThis module aims to explore the complex and dramatic changes in the structure of the inter-state system that have taken place since the end of the 19th century.

During periods of economic distress, a country is characterized by social chaos, social unrest, bankruptcies, reduced trade volumes, currency volatility, and breakdown of law and order.\nDue to the magnitude of the economic distress, government interventions for economic recovery can be slow to bring the economy back on track, and the delay causes even greater disorganization of the economy.\nCauses of Economic Collapse\nThe following are some of the causes of economic collapse:\nHyperinflation occurs when the government allows inflationary pressure to build up in the economy by printing excessive money, which leads to a gradual rise in the prices of commodities and services. Governments resort to creating excess money and credit with the goal of managing an economic slowdown. Hyperinflation occurs when the government loses control of the price increases and raises the interest rates as a way of managing the accelerating inflation.\nStagflation refers to a situation in which the economy is growing at a slow rate while simultaneously experiencing high rates of inflation. Such an economic situation causes a dilemma among policymakers since the measures implemented to reduce the rise in inflation may increase unemployment levels to abnormally high levels. Stagflations and its effects on the economy may last for several years or decades.\nFor example, the United States experienced stagflation from the 1960s to the 1970s. During said period, economic growth was stagnant, and the inflation peaked at 13% per annum while the inflation rate in the United Kingdom was at 20% per annum. Once stagflation occurs, it is usually difficult to manage, and governments must incur huge costs to bring balance to the economy.\n3. Stock market crash\nA stock market crash occurs when there is a loss of investor confidence in the market, and there is a dramatic decline in stock prices across different stocks trading in the stock market. When a stock market crash occurs, it creates a bear market (when prices drop 20% or more from their highs to hit new lows), and it drains capital out of businesses.\nCrashes occur when there is a prolonged period of rising stock prices, price earning ratios exceed long-term averages, and there is excessive use of margin debt by market participants.\nScenarios that Define an Economic Collapse\nThe following are some of the things that characterize an economic collapse:\n1. Rising interest rates\nDuring periods of economic collapse, interest rates peak at abnormally high levels, and it limits the amount of money that is available for investors to invest. High interest rates hinder economic growth since investors, corporations, and the government find it costly to service existing debt obligations and take out new loans due to the high cost of capital.\nWhen a major company declares its inability to finance its debt obligations and resorts to disposing of its assets to pay creditors, investors lose confidence in the company and will be hesitant to trade their money during periods of financial distress.\n2. Sovereign debt crisis\nSovereign debts are debts taken up by a government to finance capital-intensive infrastructural projects. However, when the government takes on too many debts and is unable to pay principal and interest obligations when they fall due, it increases the risk of defaulting on its existing debt obligations and becoming bankrupt.\nA sovereign debt crisis occurs during periods of slow economic growth, wars, political instability, drought, and when investors lose confidence in the government. Due to the large size of sovereign debts, a default by the government is likely to affect the global economy and cause spill-over effects on other jurisdictions.\n3. Local currency crisis\nA local currency crisis occurs when the currency depreciates in value due to a loss of investor confidence. This occurs when foreign investors who have invested in a country and advanced credit to the government lose confidence in the government’s ability to meet debt obligations or generate the agreed-upon returns.\nIn such situations, the foreign investors withdraw their investments in the country. The move increases the selling of the borrowing country’s currency in the international market, resulting in currency devaluation. In return, the currency devaluation increases the country’s international debts, resulting in the loss of the country’s purchasing power.\n4. Global currency crisis\nA global currency crisis involves the loss of value of a major currency that is used in cross-border trade transactions between individuals, corporations, and governments. For example, the US dollar is used as the world reserve currency in the Bretton Woods institutions, which means that if the US dollar depreciates in value, it may trigger a global economic crisis.\nCFI offers the Financial Modeling & Valuation Analyst (FMVA)™ certification program for those looking to take their careers to the next level.

{"question":"What are the main features and security benefits of VeraCrypt for data protection, and what are the key encryption security tips for using such tools effectively?","answer":"VeraCrypt is a tool that can encrypt single or multiple folders, files, directories, volumes, or any storage media. It provides endpoint encryption for entire storage drives and allows authentication via password or token before accessing files or loading the OS. VeraCrypt can also hide encrypted folders and files. For effective use of encryption tools like VeraCrypt, key security tips include: using standard ciphers scrutinized by experts (like AES), avoiding dictionary words as passwords, using unique passphrases with mixed characters, never trusting third-party services to store encryption keys, protecting against keyloggers and malware with updated antivirus and firewall, and never revealing passwords to anyone, including IT support.","context":["Computers can come in different forms such as a personal computer, tablet, or phone. All of these devices work similarly and need their own protection. The most common way to protect these systems is by using certain types of software.\nA virtual machine creates an actual virtual computer within the operating system of your system. This will block all threats from the host system and the threats will only affect the virtual system. This is a methodology called sandboxing.\nVMWare Workstation can run applications on a breadth of operating systems including Linux, Windows and more at the same time on the same PC without rebooting. VMware Workstation makes it really easy to evaluate new operating systems like Windows 10, test software applications and patches, and reference architectures in an isolated and safe environment. This is similar to the sandboxing concept but is an entire “virtual” machine instead.\nEmet-Microsoft’s Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit is a freeware security toolkit for Microsoft Windows. It provides a unified interface to enable and fine-tune Windows security features. It can be used as an extra layer of defense against malware attacks, after the firewall and before antivirus software. An application can run within EMET and then EMET can then be run inside another sandbox such as Sandboxie. https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/jj653751\nSandboxie-creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying the local or mapped drive. http://www.sandboxie.com/\nAnti-virus software is the program that scans the file system looking for virus’s that have infected your machine.\nESET Smart Security scans, detects, quarantines or removes malicious code. You can configure this application to actively scan and to also progressively (constantly) scan your device. The progressive scan option has low resource intensive operations and does not impact daily machine use.\nMalwareBytes is a freeware anti-virus but also has a paid version. Uses very low resources and is recommended as a secondary anti-virus program to supplement your main anti-virus program.\nA firewall is what regulates all connections in and out of your machine. It blocks or allows connections based on rules that are set up by the user. Many anti-virus suites come with a firewall.\nVeraCrypt- can encrypt single or multiple folders, files, directories, volumes, or any other storage media. This is considered folder encryption and is also an endpoint encryption meaning the entire storage drive is encrypted. A password or token can be used as the authentication method before any folders or files are opened or viewed.

The cyber criminals never rest, and this means that organizations need to be vigilant as well as ensure the implementation of tough security measures.\nYou will find encryption in most things that run using an internet connection, from messaging apps and personal banking apps to websites and online payment methods.\nAnd for consumers, making sure your data cannot be stolen or used for ransom has never been more important.\nWhat is encryption?\nEncryption prevents unauthorized access to your data, from emails to chat messages and bank details, by keeping communication secure between the parties involved.\nThis is done by ‘scrambling’ the information sent from one person to another into a lengthy code making it unreadable for anybody else attempting to access it.\nWhen the data is encrypted, the sender and the receiver are the only people that can decrypt the scrambled info back to a readable condition. This is achieved via ‘keys’, which grant only the users involved access to modify the data to make it unreadable and then readable again.\nPut more simply, imagine encryption to be like translating your information into a language only you and your recipient know, and more importantly which a cybercriminal can’t translate.\nWhy is encryption important?\nThe purpose of file and disk encryption is to protect data stored on a computer or network storage system. All organizations, including small and midsize businesses (SMBs), that collect personally identifiable information (PII) like names, birthdates, Social Security numbers and financial information must secure that information. An organization can be sued if a computer containing PII is stolen and the information is leaked or shared.\nIf a laptop is lost or stolen and the files or disk aren’t encrypted, a thief can easily steal the information, so it’s a good practice to encrypt your sensitive data, if not your entire hard drive. The thief doesn’t even need to know the sign-on password to access the files – it’s easy to boot a computer from a USB thumb drive and then access the disks within the computer.\nDisk encryption doesn’t protect a computer entirely. A hacker can still access the computer over an insecure network connection, or a user can click a malicious link in an email and infect the computer with malware that steals usernames and passwords. Those types of attacks require additional security controls, like anti-malware software, firewalls and awareness training. However, encrypting a computer’s files or the entire disk greatly reduces the risk of data theft.\nHow does encryption work?\nIn the online world, encryption disguises data rearranging the data bits so that nobody can read or see the information without the secret key, this key can consist of a password or a digital file, aka keyfile, encryption secures plain text as well as any other digital media like photos, videos or software, you can also encrypt a whole operating system and a partition.\nTo secure data, encryption uses mathematic functions known as cryptography algorithms, aka ciphers, some example of well-known and trusted cryptography algorithms are AES, Blowfish, Twofish and Serpent, these ciphers can be subcategorized with a number indicating its strength in bits.\nAn encryption algorithm key length indicates its size measured in bits, the length indicating the algorithm strength in bits will always be even (bit is binary unit composed of zeros and ones), these keys are used to control the operation of a cipher.\nThe more mathematical strength the encryption algorithm has the more difficult it will be to crack it without access to the key but a strong cipher normally requires more computational power, a few seconds of wait might not matter much to the home user but for businesses dealing with thousands of calculations each hour to decrypt/encrypt data in their servers it will mean that more money has to be spent in hardware and electricity.\nAdvantages of encryption\nHackers don’t just steal information, they also can benefit from altering data to commit fraud. While it is possible for highly skilled and technical individuals to alter encrypted data, recipients of the data will be able to detect the corruption, allowing for a quick response to the cyber-attack.\nSecure Data At All Times\nEncryption works when data is stored or transferred, making it an ideal solution no matter how data is being used. Usually, data is most vulnerable to attack when being moved from one place to another, therefore encryption ensures protection during this process.\nEncryption is used to protect sensitive data, including personal information for individuals. Encryption therefore ensures anonymity and privacy, reducing opportunities for surveillance by both criminals and government agencies. Encryption technology is so effective that some governments are attempting to put limits on the effectiveness of encryption.\nProtection Across Multiple Devices\nMobile devices are a big part of our lives, and we often own several. As technology develops, more and more of these devices are joining the Internet of Things (IoT) phenomenon. Encryption technology can help protect data and sensitive information across all devices, whether being stored or even during transfer.\nPart of Compliance\nMany industries and organizations have strict compliance requirements to help protect the data of their company and their customers or clients. ABIP assists clients with regulatory compliance assessments such as HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, NYDFS 500, etc. and we opine on the strength of the existing encryption processes as well as provide recommendations based on benchmark practices.\nEncryption security tips\n- Always choose an encryption program that uses a standard cipher that has been scrutinized by experts, e.g. AES\n- Do not use dictionary words as your password, use a long passphrase made up of capital and small letters with punctuation signs and numbers\n- Do not use the passphrase you use to encrypt your data for anything else like your webmail password or an online forum which security can be compromised\n- Never trust a third-party service to store your encryption keys or carry out the encryption implementation, if you store data online encrypt it yourself in your computer\n- Watch out for keyloggers and malware in your computer that could capture your keystrokes and your secret passphrase, use an updated antivirus and firewall\n- Never reveal your password to anyone, not even to an IT support desk"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ed690df4-e8d9-4150-815f-316cc9996181>","<urn:uuid:c60e8abb-85ec-4377-ab55-aeea03c86223>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Looking to start an aquaponics system - what size tank do catfish need and what potential health issues should I monitor?","answer":"Channel catfish require a 250+ gallon fish tank as they can grow to 40-50 pounds. While they are quite hardy and resistant to many diseases and parasites, they can still be affected by bacterial infections and parasitic diseases. Like other fish, they can get ulcer disease (showing as red sores and ulcers) and various parasitic infections such as Anchor Worms (appearing as small cream-colored threads) and Fish Lice (visible flat disc-shaped parasites). However, catfish are generally quite resilient, tolerating wide swings in pH and temperature (41°-93°F), making them less susceptible to stress-induced health issues.","context":["Excited about starting your aquaponics system but not sure which fish to use?\nDon’t worry – we’ve got you covered!\nAquaponics is an innovative method of farming which uses fish-waste as a natural fertilizer for plants in a nutrient-rich ecosystem. The plants and nitrifying bacteria remove ammonia and other nitrogenous compounds from the water, making it safe for fish to live in. A wide variety of freshwater, herbivorous, or omnivorous fish can be used in aquaponics. Here we give you our best list of aquaponic fishes based on their sustainability, ease of care, and size of your system.\nThis classic fish is perfect for in-home aquaponics systems for a variety of reasons. They are widely available, produce waste quickly, and are inexpensive which makes them a perfect candidate to start up your ECO-Cycle. Typically, these fish are hardy and can withstand a wide variety of temperatures, but prefer cooler water between 50°-75° F. Goldfish can be a gentle community fish if they are placed with similar sized, non-tropical fish such as Zebra Danios.\n2. Tropical Fish\nTropical fish are a beautiful and fun option to use in aquaponics! Try suckermouth fish, cichlids, mollies, clown loaches, and tetras. Make sure to place a heater in your tank to keep tropical fish comfortable. The recommended tank size for the Common Suckerfish (Hypostomus plecostomus) is a 150+ gallons, because they can easily grow up to two feet and can become aggressive. For smaller tanks try the Albino Bushynose Pleco (Ancitrus temminkii) who will max out around five inches, while still doing a great job of removing algae.\n3.

They are easy to breed, grow fast – up to 500g in 6 months, and thrive in warmer water between 65° and 85° F. Tilapia can be harvested to eat and are an excellent source of lean protein. Growing fish that you can consume adds another element to your aquaponics system – fresh fish, fresh produce – all sourced from your own home. Breeding is not difficult and fish can start reproducing at 7-8 months of age. One of the easiest ways of obtaining a pair is to let at least 5-6 fish grow up together and form their own pairs.\n4. Channel Catfish\nCatfish are an ideal option for large scale systems because of their adaptability. They grow very quickly, have a great food conversion ration, and can be harvested to eat.(Bonus! Catfish are rich in Vitamin D) Catfish prefer to live in water 75° – 86° F, but can also tolerate temperatures between 41° – 93°. Typically you want these fish to live in a 250+ gallon fish tank because catfish can grow to a size of 40 – 50 lbs. These fish are resistant to many disease and parasites, plus tolerate a wide swings in pH and temperature.\nAlways a beauty, koi fish thrive in aquaponics systems while adding a pop of color. While these fish are technically edible, they are extremely bony and can be difficult to prepare. Koi can live a long time and are resistant to parasites. Koi fish can withstand a wide pH range and can tolerate temperature from 35° up to 85° F. Since Koi can grow between 12 – 36 inches they are most comfortable in a 200+ gallon tank. Koi ponds can be transformed into beautiful aquaponics systems and improve water quality.\nRemember when choosing a fish species for your aquaponics systems, keep in mind the criteria above to give yourself and your fish the best chance of success! Choose the climatic conditions that are similar to your area. A good rule of thumb is the larger the tank, the more room for error.\nHandy Aquaponic Tips\n- Most aquaponic fish prefer a neutral pH and thrive in consistent water quality. Be mindful when adding water to your system.\n- Try using an algae-eating fish to keep your tank and decorations tidy. We also love this magnetic tank cleaner.\n- African Dwarf Frogs & aquatic turtles have the ability to thrive in an aquaponics system but they can carry Salmonella, so please do not grow edibles. Try growing non-edible plants like milkweed or ornamentals!\n- Feed your fish twice a day! Careful not to overfeed and let food touch the bottom of your tank . Uneaten food interferes with your ECO-Cycle’s water quality and too much will become harmful to fish.\n- Quarantine aquatic plants before putting them into your tank – just in case they are carrying snail eggs or other organisms that can cause harm to the ECO-Cycle.\n- Fish that are adaptable to temperature change are the best option, and temperature consistency is best for any system.\n- Gradually add fish to your system. Adding fish too quickly can spike ammonia levels and become dangerous.\n- For more information about adding fish to your tank, watch this video about adding fish to your ECO-Cycle.\nHave fun and keep experimenting! Comment below to let us know what you’ve found works best in your system.\nWritten by ECOLIFE staff and team members","Koi and goldfish disease is a broad topic that is the basis of many books. Instead of handling it comprehensively, we will hit on the topics that are important to the average Koi owner. As an example, while you will not find microscopic photos of Koi Parasites with detailed explanations of their life cycles here, you will find descriptions of how infected Koi will behave and recommendations on what you should do to treat them and/or what you can do to avoid the problem in the future.\nThe most important concept to understand with fish health is that many parasites and diseases are present in every Koi pond, but they only trigger a disease episode when the fish are under some sort of stress, resulting from poor water conditions, rough handling, bad nutrition or harassment by a predator. Therefore, when a disease episode is triggered, it is absolutely critical to determine the cause, and fix it so that after you treat the disease it does not have the opportunity to reoccur.\nKoi & Goldfish health is also highly dependent on good nutrition, water quality and environmental conditions. Therefore, we have put together a page covering each of these issues. Visit them at the following links:\nThis condition is usually caused by Aeromonas hydrophilla, but other species of Aeromonas as well as Pseudomonas and a few less common bacterial genera can cause the disease. Generally, an infection is triggered by injury or environmental stressors. Common disease signs are ulcers, red sores, red mouth, or (in more advanced cases) the fish can swell up internally, giving the appearance of a pine-cone, with its scales and/or eyes popping out.\nTreatment of this disease became much more difficult when the government banned medicated food for animals without a Veterinarian Feed Directive (VFD). What that means, is that in order to obtain medicated food to treat a disease, you must first bring in a veterinarian to assess the situation, and basically write a prescription for the fish, a VFD. Unfortunately, in many cases, the cost of doing this exceeds the value of the fish, so pond owners will face very tough decisions. In the past, Medicated Koi Feeds were generally available that proved very effective at treating this condition. Now most of them are no longer available, even with a VFD.\nSo for now, the most effective treatment, by far, is unrealistic for the vast majority of pond owners. What you are left with is prevention and supportive care.\nKoi in particular are very susceptible to bacterial infection, probably because they have been inbred so much to develop the unique color patterns. The best thing you can do to avoid bacterial disease is to not handle the fish when the water is colder than 70F. Reason being is that the immune system of Koi is almost nonexistent when the water temperatures are below this. They do not establish a vigorous immune response until the water temperatures top 75F.\nIf a bacterial disease does develop, probably the best treatment is supportive care with Pond Salt and Melafix. The issue is that Pond Salt kills aquatic plants above a certain concentration (different for different plants). So apply Pond Salt in ponds with valued plants at your own risk. People say that you can use up to 1-1/2 pounds per 100 gallons if you have plants, but different people will have different results. If you do not have plants, or are not concerned about their well being, a beneficial treatment for Koi is 3 pounds of Pond Salt per 100 gallons of pond water. DO NOT USE REGULAR SALT as some ingredients can be toxic to fish. Maintain salt level monitoring with a Koi Medic Salinity Meter until the condition has improved, and then do partial water changes, to reduce the salt concentration. Please be aware that salt does not evaporate from water, so once you put it in, its levels will not drop unless you remove and add water.\nFinally, this disease commonly occurs as a result of infection at the site of a sore caused by parasites. Consider doing a Shot-gun treatment to kill all parasites. See the Parasitic Disease section below for details.\nColumnaris Disease (Synonyms: Saddleback Disease, Fin Rot, Cotton Wool Disease)\nThis disease is caused by the bacteria Flexibacter columnaris and related species. It usually appears as erosive lesions on the head, back (hence saddleback disease) and fins (especially the tail fin). It commonly occurs as a result of rough handling in warm (above 65 Fahrenheit) water.\nTreatment options (or lack there of) are the same as those described above for Ulcer Disease.\nSaprolegniasis (Synonym: Fungus)\nThis disorder is usually caused by the fungus Saprolegnia sp. or one of a few similar types. It appears as small patches of cotton wool, usually at the site of an injury, and may take on a green appearance with the accumulation of algal cells.\nAs with Columnaris, this disease usually results from rough handling or some other adverse condition for the fish. Before treatments are initiated, steps should be taken to correct the conditions that caused the disease.\nAlthough it will not directly treat the fungus, Pond Salt is one of the best treatments to help the fish heal themselves. See the treatment information above for Ulcer Disease for proper use of Pond Salt.\nA protozoan parasite is a unicellular organism that, for at least one stage of its life cycle, parasitizes fish. The infamous Ich is the only freshwater protozoan fish parasite that is visible with the naked eye. Without the aid of a microscope, all others can only be distinguished by symptoms.\nIchthyophthiriosis (Synonym: Ich, White Spot Disease)\nThis disease is caused by the infamous protozoan Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, AKA Ich. It is the only freshwater protozoan fish parasite that can be seen with the naked eye, appearing as very small white spots covering the body and fins. There are a number of treatment options available for this parasite, but perhaps none more effective than the Formalin and Malachite Green combination found in Ich-X (click on this link for treatment details).\nAlso, 3 pounds of Pond Salt per 100 gallons of pond water (0.3%) can be used to treat Ich, but it probably will not eliminate it. Maintain salt level for a couple weeks monitoring with a Koi Medic Salinity Meter and then do a partial water change to reduce the salt concentration.\nProbably the best treatment option is applying Ich-X followed by Pond Salt after the final water change, maintaining it at 0.3 to 0.5% for a few weeks. This will theoretically kill the parasite and all its life stages. However, Ich is a real bugger and follow-up treatments are commonly required if conditions that initially caused the outbreak are not corrected.\nWhen treating for Ich, always watch the fish carefully and be prepared to flush the pond quickly if the fish appear stressed. Also, be sure to aerate heavily with any of these treatments, remove as much organic debris as is practicable and treat the make-up water with a Water Conditioner. Finally, Ich-X should not harm plants or biofilters if applied as directed, but salt treatments could. To limit the effect of this on the biofilter, add 1 pound of salt per 100 gallons, wait 12 to 24 hours and add another 1 pound per 100 gallons, wait 12-24 hours and add the final 1 pound per 100 gallons. Most (not all) plants will tolerate 1-1/2 pounds of salt per 100 gallons (0.15%), but 3 pounds per 100 gallons may harm them.\nOther Common Freshwater Protozoan Fish Parasites\nCostia (Itchthyobodo necatrix), Chilodonella and Trichodina are all motile protozoans that commonly occur on Goldfish and Koi. All of them are too small to be seen with the human eye, but they should be suspected if the fish appear depressed, show respiratory distress, have clamped fins, and/or have excessive mucus production, which causes a white film over the surface of the body. The same treatments outlined for Ich can be used against these parasites, but the salt treatment alone may not be entirely effective for some of them, especially Costia.\nFlukes (Synonyms: Dactylogyridiasis, Gill Flukes, Gyrodactylidiasis, Skin Flukes)\nFlukes are microscopic Monogenetic Trematodes that commonly occur in ponds. Gyrodactylids usually occur on the skin and fins and Dactylogyrids usually occur on the gills, but either could be found anywhere on the external surfaces of the fish. Mortality is usually associated with outbreaks under crowded conditions, but fish with small amounts of these parasites can lack any symptoms but still suffer damage. The Flukes attach themselves to the fish with large hooks and feed on their blood or epithelial cells. Strains of bacteria that cause Ulcer Disease have been isolated from the mouths of Flukes, so their feeding behavior may not directly kill the fish but it can, and often does, trigger bacterial infections.\nPerhaps the safest and most effective treatment for Flukes is Praziquantel. In fact, there is not a Koi or Goldfish that is up for sale at Keystone Hatcheries that has not been through a Praziquantel treatment. It is probably the safest treatment that you will ever find for ponds. Simply remove your activated carbon (if you have any) and dose the pond – this treatment will not affect your biofilter or plants!\nActually a crustacean, not a worm, Lernaea (AKA Anchor Worms) is a copepod that can be found on some freshwater pond fish. They appear as small (typically less than an inch) cream-colored threads hanging off the side of the fish. The major threat from these parasites is the wound that they leave, which is very susceptible to Ulcer Disease. Some people choose to remove these parasites with tweezers while the fish is anesthetized. This is a good idea, but probably not for less-equipped typical pond owners.\nProbably the most common treatment for this parasite is the active ingredient Diflubenzuron. However, products with that active ingredient are no longer available because of government restrictions. Currently, we are recommending treatment with the product called CyroPro. This product is very effective, but it takes awhile to see results because it kills the juvenile stages of the parasite, not the adult stages. After 3 weeks of treatment as directed, the fish should be cleared of the disease.\nThese pesky parasites called Argulus have prominent eyes and a sucking disc and flat disc-shaped body ¼” to ½” in diameter, making them easily visible with the naked eye. Treatments outlined above for Anchor Worms will work for these buggers too.\nIf you suspect parasites, but you do not know which one(s), or if you want to do a prophylactic treatment when adding new fish, you can use the following treatment regime:\n1. Apply one ounce of Ich-X per 120 gallons of pond water.\n2. Wait 8 to 24 hours (not less nor more), do a 33% water change, treat makeup water with a Water Conditioner (if necessary) and repeat #1.\n3. Wait another 8 to 24 hours (not less nor more) repeat #2.\n5. Seven AND 14 days after initial CyroPro treatment, re-apply as directed.\nNote: Aerate vigorously throughout treatment period, especially during the 3 Ich-X treatments. Monitor water quality throughout treatment period and be prepared to perform a major water change at any time if problems arise. Please note that any time you do a major water change, you should be careful not to change the water temperature by more than 5F in a day. Greater temperature changes can seriously stress your fish.\nAlso, if you do not have plants, you can enhance the treatment with the use of Pond Salt. To do so, when you add the Praziquantel and first CyroPro treatment, also add 1 pound of salt per 100 gallons of water. Then 24 and 48 hours later, add an additional pound of salt per 100 gallons of water. This will give you a total of 3 pounds of Pond Salt per 100 gallons of water. The spacing out of salt additions prevents shocking (killing) the beneficial bacteria in your pond.\nThere are two viruses that are a major health threat to Koi in the United States. Both are contagious and can kill healthy fish. Since there are no real treatments for Koi Viral Diseases, your entire focus should be on avoiding ever contracting the virus in the first place. By being sure that your Koi are coming from a source that is free of Koi Herpes Virus and Spring Viremia of Carp you can avoid a world of problems. All of our Koi are either hatched and raised at Keystone Hatcheries or one other wholesale-only Koi farm that does not import. Neither location has ever had a disease episode with these viruses, and both facilities have active annual virus testing programs in place. On top of that, we do not bring anyone else’s Koi onto our farm for any reason, such as over-wintering, spawning or resale. We feel that these safeguards provide a level of protection from the viruses. Ask your Koi supplier what measures they take.\nSpring Viremia of Carp (Synonyms: SVC, Infectious Dropsy, Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia)\nThis disease has caused problems in Europe and the Middle East for years and years, but has only recently been diagnosed in North America. First, following a positive test result for the virus, a major Koi Farm in the United States was quarantined by the federal government and all their fish were destroyed. Then, following a large Carp die-off in a northern Wisconsin lake, SVC was diagnosed in the wild in North America for the first time. The virus is very difficult to diagnose, and many businesses that sell Koi avoid testing to prevent being shut down by the government, so it is very possible that this virus has been around for quite awhile.\nAs the name suggests, SVC typically occurs in Koi as they come out of winter in water temperatures between 52 and 65F. Symptoms can be confusing because Ulcer Disease commonly occurs at the same time. However, infected fish commonly appear dark, have pop-eye and a swollen abdomen. They are often lethargic and can display a loss of equilibrium with occasional erratic swimming.\nIf your pond water temperature is in the 52-65F range and your fish are exhibiting the symptoms listed above, there are two things that you can do: first, treat the fish for Ulcer Disease in case that is the problem. Second, consider installing a Pond Heater to get the water temperature above 70F, at which temperature the Koi are able to mount an immune response and fight the virus.\nKoi Herpes Virus (Synonyms: KHV, Koi Pox, CyHV-3)\nThis virus is genetically very similar to the more benign Carp Pox, but it is by far more deadly. It has emerged in recent years, causing mortality rates of up to 90%. There is a great deal that is still unknown about this virus, such as exactly how it spreads and if surviving fish carry it, but it is known that the virus is highly contagious and typically causes disease outbreaks, especially in young Koi, when water temperatures are between 72 and 81F.\nSigns of KHV are often non-specific and mortality can begin before symptoms are apparent. However, signs can include white blotches on the gills, bleeding gills, sunken eyes and blotchy patches on the skin.\nIf your pond water temperature is between 72 and 81F and the fish are exhibiting the signs described above, you have two choices, and we are not endorsing either option. The first is to destroy your fish and bleach anything that was exposed to the fish or pond water at 200 ppm Chlorine for at least an hour. The second option is to raise the water temperature to 86F, at which temperature the fish develop a natural resistance to the virus. However, there is a potential problem with option #2. That is, it may be the case that fish that survived exposure to the virus become carriers, which could easily re-infect any new fish."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:71d1ca9e-b2b6-4c7f-a3f9-b5fe57a1939b>","<urn:uuid:995d61bf-6b04-46d8-8e6f-c2d44d5cc3ab>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the essential components for maintaining pond water quality without a filter, and how does aeration impact the pond ecosystem?","answer":"To maintain pond water quality without a filter, several components are essential: using natural filter plants, conducting regular water changes to prevent toxic substance buildup, and adding beneficial bacteria to break down waste. Aeration plays a crucial role by increasing oxygen levels, which promotes beneficial bacterial growth and helps break down waste. An aerator disturbs the water surface, preventing algae growth and mosquito breeding. Additionally, maintaining proper plant coverage (50-66% of surface) helps reduce sunlight penetration and nutrient levels, while also providing substrate for beneficial micro-organisms. These methods work best when combined rather than used individually.","context":["A pond makes a great addition to any garden, and they can attract all sorts of wonderful species.\nMany people build ponds for decoration, and some people will even fill them with goldfish or Koi to make them even more beautiful.\nThis brings an almost enchanting aspect to any garden, but be warned that ponds require regular maintenance.\nSince most ponds will be a stationary pool of water, they can quickly become stagnant if left unattended.\nThis will cause your water to become saturated with debris and invasive species that may kill any fish you have introduced.\nPond filters are an automatic solution to this problem that can regularly cycle your water to remove debris or other contaminants. These filters are a good option, but they aren’t the only way to keep your pond clean.\nIf you don’t think you can afford to buy and run a pond filter (see also ‘ Best Pond Filter’ ), then don’t worry.\nThere are several other methods that you can use to remove accumulated grime and detritus from your pond. Some of these methods will work better than others, depending on the size of your pond and any wildlife inhabiting it.\nIn this article, we will take you through 5 methods you can use to keep your pond clean, without using a filter.\nTable of Contents\nIs A Pond Filter Completely Necessary?\nBefore we get into our solutions for cleaning your pond without a pond filter, we thought we would look into why these devices are so popular in the first place.\nPond filters are far from essential, but they are commonly bought because they make cleaning your pond quick and convenient.\nIf you don’t have a lot of fish in your pond, and it doesn’t accumulate a lot of muck and grime, then you will be able to get by perfectly fine without a filter.\nHowever, for ponds that contain more fish, excrement and other types of waste can build up fast.\nYou can still clean these larger, more heavily populated ponds using hands-on methods, but it will take considerably more time and effort to do so.\nAs such, if you own a large pond with a lot of fish, you may want to consider buying a filter rather than trying to clean it without one.\nThat said, there are very few ponds that absolutely need a filter, so without further ado, let’s look at some methods for cleaning your pond without one.\nMethod 1: Use Natural Filter Plants\nIf you want to keep things natural and avoid using chemicals, then why not consider populating your pond with filter plants.\nCertain species of plants are great for cleaning your water by absorbing excess nutrients and removing waste products in the water.\nSpecies such as duck potato, American pondweed, hornwort and Hyacinths are all great at acting as natural pond filters.\nThese plants clean your pond in two different ways to ensure your water is free from excess detritus.\nFirstly, many of them grow underwater, which means they can oxygenate (see also ‘How To Oxygenate A Pond Without Electrical Pumps‘) your pond water to make it better for your fish.\nSome species will rest on the top of the pond, providing shelter for fish and blocking sunlight from hitting your water.\nThis is very important as reducing the amount of sunlight that hits your pond will go a long way towards reducing algae and pond weeds.\nSecondly, these species can eat excess nutrients left behind by your fish. Some of them can also break down waste products left behind by fish as well, minimizing the amount of potential food for algae or other unwanted species.\nHornwort is a popular filter plant that is great at oxygenating your water and removing excess nutrients from your pond water.\nThis product comes with a bunch of hornwort that you simply need to drop into your pond, so it can start doing its work.\nYou can leave it to float naturally or hold it on the bottom of the pond with the small leather strips provided.\nNot only will it help with cleaning your water and combating algae growth, but this plant also provides cover for your fish from predators.\nHornwort is a robust plant that can survive most temperature fluctuations, however it shouldn’t be planted in freezing conditions below 20 °F.\nWhen buying live plants, there is always the risk of introducing snails to your pond. If you want to avoid this, then you may want to be cautious when buying this product.\n- Comes with leather strips to tether your plants to the bottom of the pond.\n- Grows fast.\n- Provides cover for fish as well as oxygenating your pond and removing excess nutrients.\n- Can’t be planted in extremely cold climates.\nThis is just one of the many species of filter plants that you can buy online.\nFor the best results it will help to buy multiple species including ones that grow underwater as well as those that simplest rest on the surface of your pond (see lights).\nAlso, as a small sidenote, don’t worry too much about snails. While they may not look pretty, underwater snails are a great species for cleaning up excess waste left behind by your fish.\nObviously, if you are cultivating certain species of fish that don’t get along with snails, then you should avoid them. However, if this isn’t the case, having a few in your pond will definitely help to keep it clean.\nMethod 2: Buy A Pond Aerator\nAn aerator is a special device attached to a compressor that pumps air through the water of your pond. They help to increase the amount of oxygen in your water, which will be very beneficial for any fish.\nThe extra oxygen will also promote the growth of beneficial bacteria, which can help to break down waste and other muck that has built up in your pond.\nNot only are they beneficial for aquatic lifeforms, but aerators can also vastly improve the quality of water in your pond (see also our guide on water wheels for ponds). These devices disturb the surface of the water, so it is regularly moving.\nThis prevents the build up of algae, which can only really thrive in stagnant bodies of water.\nDisturbing the pond’s surface will also prevent mosquitoes from breeding nearby. These creatures often lay their eggs on the surface of water.\nAerating your pond will prevent them from landing and being able to lay these eggs, which will prevent your pond becoming a haven for pests.\nThe HQUA PAS10 is suitable for ponds and lakes up to 1 acre in size. As such, it should be perfectly suitable for your pond unless it is extremely large.\nThis model comes with a ½ horsepower compressor, which is more than enough for aerating the water in your pond.\nIt is easy to install as well and all you need to do is attach the rotating plate to the compressor with the hose provided.\nThe motor only draws about 4.8 amps of power, which is less than many pond filters will require.\nHowever, you will need to run it 24/7 to get the best results from using this device. Thankfully, the hose that comes with it is 100in long, so you may be able to keep the compressor in your garage where it is safe from the elements.\nThe motor is also reasonably quiet, so it won’t disturb the tranquility of your garden.\n- The motor is efficient yet quiet.\n- Disturbs the surface of the water to prevent algae blooms and mosquito infestations.\n- Increase the oxygen content of your water for healthier fish and more beneficial bacteria.\n- Needs to be run 24/7 for the best results.\nMethod 3: Pond Vacuums And Nets\nAnother way to keep the water in your pond clean is to remove accumulated muck and debris by hand.\nNo, we don’t mean fishing it out with your bare hands, but rather by using a net or dedicated pond vacuum. This allows you to fish out specific objects that you don’t want to contaminate your pond.\nPond vacuums are easy to use and allow you to suck up any sludge that has built up on the bottom of your pond. A little sludge isn’t a bad thing, and can in fact be beneficial for the health of a pond.\nHowever, when left to accumulate, sludge can become a big problem and as such it should be removed regularly.\nIf you can’t afford a proper pond vacuum, then you choose to buy a net instead.\nThese are much cheaper, don’t require electricity to use, and allow you to be even more selective about what you remove. Pond rakes are also very useful tools, although not as good at scooping up sludge.\nThese implements can be used to remove species of plant that you don’t want growing on the bottom of your pond. Be careful, though, as the tines may puncture the lining of your pond.\nThis is a powerful and efficient pond vacuum that is a great choice if you want to manually clean your pond.\nIt comes with two hoses, both of which are extra long, and the discharge hose will allow you to regularly drain the water from your pond.\nThe OASE Pondovac has a suction power of 2100 gallons per hour (GPH) and as such is the perfect tool for sucking debris out of your pond.\nIt comes with five different attachments, so you can reach and clean all the different areas of your water garden.\nAll of these attachments are made from plastic, which means they are unlikely to damage your pond lining.\n- Comes with five different attachments for cleaning all the different areas in your pond.\n- Extra large suction and discharge hoses.\n- Can be used to drain the water from your pond when necessary.\n- Expensive and very heavy to carry.\nAlso available at: AZPonds\nIf you think a pond net would be more your speed, then this product is definitely worth considering. The Aquascape heavy-duty pond net comes with a rubber sheath over the top of the metal frame.\nThis protects both the net and your pond liner from damage when scooping sludge off the bottom of your pond.\nThe mesh used for the net itself is very fine and won’t damage the scales on even delicate fish when scooping them out of the water.\nThe handle is made from durable metal and plastic components that allow it to extend up to 69in long.\n- Extra large net.\n- Rubber tip protects your pond liner (see also ‘How To Repair Pond Liner That Is Leaking‘) and the net from damage.\n- The soft mesh used for the net won’t harm fish.\n- Can’t be used to scoop heavy materials when at full extension.\nAlso available at: EspenShades\nMethod 4: Carry Out Regular Water Changes\nIf you have fish living in your pond, then it is important to regularly change the water. Doing so will help prevent the build up of toxic substances such as ammonia, which could kill your fish and any plants.\nThe simplest way to do this is with a good pump that can be used to drain the water out of your pond, so you can clean the liner and refill it with fresh water.\nIf you are using tap water for the refill, then you will also need to buy a water conditioner or dechlorinator (see also ‘Dechlorinator For Fish Systems: What, Why And How?‘).\nThis product removes chlorine from your water to make it much more suitable for fish and other forms of aquatic life.\nNot only will regular water change improve the quality of your water, but they will also prevent algae blooms from growing out of control.\nThis hand pump is lightweight, effective and very simple to use. It comes with a steel shaft to provide great strength and suction power when draining the water out of your pond.\nThe 36in hose pipe that comes with it makes it easy to siphon the water you are draining somewhere else, so you don’t flood your garden.\nThis is a great tool for small to medium-sized ponds, however for a larger one you may need something a little stronger. If your pond is over an acre in size, we would recommend buying an electric pump instead.\n- Made from durable materials.\n- Much cheaper than electric pumps or pond filters.\n- Simple and easy to use.\n- Won’t be suitable for larger ponds.\nWhen you are refilling your pond, make sure to add a little bit of this pond conditioner. SeaChem Pond Prime will remove unwanted chlorine, as well as other chemicals that would affect the health of your fish or pond.\nThis is especially important if you are refilling your pond with water from the taps in your home.\nYou can also use this product to remove excess nitrate or ammonia that has accumulated in your water.\nThis may allow you to avoid changing the water as regularly, and can be very helpful in any situation when you need to quickly reduce the nitrite concentration of your water.\n- Can be used when setting up a new pond or changing the water in an existing one.\n- 5x more concentrated than other brands.\n- Detoxifies ammonia, nitrates and nitrites in your pond water.\n- May require a double dose to remove 100% of the chlorine in your water.\nMethod 5: Add Beneficial Bacteria\nNot all bacteria are harmful to the health of your pond, and some are actually incredibly beneficial.\nThese cultures of bacteria are great at breaking down waste and detritus to prevent it from building up in your pond.\nThey work by breaking down ammonia and toxic nitrites into nitrates that can be absorbed by the plants in your pond.\nBuying bacterial cultures will work best if you combine them with the other methods in this article. Having plenty of filter plant species will help your bacteria to thrive.\nSimilarly, aerating your pond will provide the bacteria with enough oxygen to do their job as effectively as possible.\nThis product contains all the necessary bacteria for cleaning the water in your pond. It is specially formulated for fishponds and water gardens, meaning it won’t harm the fish in your pond.\nThe bacteria in this culture will break down harmful waste products, remove foul odors coming from your water, and help to combat insect larva.\nAfter using it, you are sure to notice a difference in the quality and clarity of your water. If you want to avoid using a filter, then this is one of the best natural solutions for cleaning your pond.\n- Improves the clarity of your water.\n- Breaks down harmful waste products left behind by fish.\n- Combats the growth of algae and insect larva\n- Won’t be very effective when used on its own.\nAlso available at: Walmart\nAll of the above measures will help to keep the water in your pond crystal clean and clear without the need for a filter.\nIt bears remembering that all of these methods will work best when combined with other methods as well.\nHaving a pond aerator is great, but using it alongside a bacterial culture and a pond net will make it much more effective at its job.\nSo why not try a combination of the above methods and see what kind of difference they can make for your pond or water garden (see also our article on the best pond spitters).\nIf they work, they may save you a fair bit of money that would otherwise have to be spent on buying and running a pond filter.","A pond pump is the heart of a man-made pond. A pond pump circulates and aerates the water which helps to maintain a healthy pond environment. There are two basic types, a submersible and an external pump. But, not all ponds need a pond pump as we will go on to explain.\nThe closed ecosystem of a garden pond needs to be carefully managed. A pump creates water movement and splashing sounds most people associate with having a pond. But, there are ponds that can thrive without a pump and still be healthy.\nHow natural ponds thrive without a pond pump\nWildlife and natural ponds can be home to amphibians, insects and micro-organisms (invertebrates) all living together harmoniously. With life they all excrete waste into the water adding nutrients to the system. High nutrient levels along with sunlight encourage algae growth. The presence of algae in a pond can start to choke out pond inhabitants affecting the natural ecosystem. It is therefore in the interest of a pond owner to ensure such conditions don’t happen. In a wildlife pond clean, oxygenated water is possible without the presence of a pond pump. It’s own environment becomes the filter. In a man-made pond, particularly those home to Koi, it is almost impossible to prevent algae from flourishing without the presence of a pond pump and filter system.\nIn a garden pond – whether a preformed mould or pond liner is used in the build, there aren’t the natural substrates for micro-organisms to thrive on and so a filter system is needed. It provides a type of surface for micro-organisms to attach to and eat plant and animal matter floating around in the water.\nFilter and pump system are only really essential if you want to keep Koi fish. They work to control algae levels.\nA solar fountain can be enough to keep the water moving and sufficiently oxygenated on hot days.\nPond maintenance without a pond pump\nIn a natural pond micro-organisms are present in high abundance. They exist in the soil and on plants. They function as a ponds ‘vacuum cleaner’ living off plant and animal organic matter found in the water and turn it into nutrients that aquatic plants need to thrive. Micro-organisms play a vital role in keeping the system in healthy equilibrium.\nIn garden ponds built using a protective underlay and pond liner the presence of micro-organisms is greatly reduced. Pond liners are necessary for the containment of water but intervention needs to be put in place to ensure that the quality of water is maintained in the absence of those microbes. Dead animal and plant matter is removed from the water by a pond filter and pump before it decomposes. Decaying matter will increase the nutrient levels beyond what is needed.\nSteps to managing healthy pond water quality\nThere are a number of steps pond owners can put in place to reduce nutrient levels.\n- Maintain a healthy balance of fish to pond volume – Koi fish excrete far more waste than goldfish. Too many Koi in an average garden pond will increase nutrient levels\n- Feed fish no more than they actually need and take particular note to the seasons as fish are less active in autumn and winter therefore eat less\n- Include sufficient aquatic plants to cover at least a half to two-thirds of your pond surface. This will reduce the amount of sunlight entering the water and will use-up nutrients in the water leaving less for algae to thrive on. Plants also offer a substrate for micro-organisms to live off. Plants take-up nutrients in the water leaving little for algae to thrive on.\n- Aeration is necessary to prevent an increase in anaerobic bacteria\nThe correct size pond pump is one that will circulate at least half the volume of water through the filter every hour (gallons/hour). So, a 1500 gallon pond would need a pump that can filter 750 gallons per hour for sufficient oxygen supply to plants and fish. A koi pond needs a pond pump that will cope with the amount of waste excreted daily. Pumps work off mains electricity supply drawing in water and pushing it out again by means of an impeller driven by a motor. A submersible pump is suitable for fountains, waterfalls and filter systems. They require regular maintenance to avoid debris build-up in the filter which could cause the motor to burn-out from over use."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ae553f22-c151-45e3-9347-0a27ee6d39a1>","<urn:uuid:bdc712a3-b583-4d55-afdf-bdf977e5dfe5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the relationship between adaptive material technology and cyber defense systems in terms of their response to external triggers?","answer":"Both adaptive materials and cyber defense systems show sophisticated responses to external triggers, but in different ways. The new polymer material responds to light as an environmental trigger, becoming firm under green LED light and soft in darkness, with the ability to fine-tune its properties through light dimming. Similarly, cyber defense systems must respond to external threats, with organizations continuously strengthening their defenses against evolving triggers like DDoS attacks and data breaches. However, while the material's responses are predictable and controllable, cyber defense systems face increasingly unpredictable challenges, particularly with the emergence of AI-generated threats that could increase phishing success rates from 0.1% to potentially 20%.","context":["Dynamic, reprogrammable material goes hard under light and soft in the dark\nMaterials that change their properties in response to different environmental triggers promise all kinds of versatility for all kinds of applications, and an international team of scientists has just come up with a particularly inventive one. With an ability to stiffen up under a certain type of light and go soft in the dark, the new material shows particular promise for the world of 3D printing, where it could be used as a temporary support for complex structures that melts away when the job is done.\nThe new material is the handiwork of scientists from Australia's Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Belgium's Ghent University and Germany's Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and consists of a polymer structure that can change its structure in response to light, and then revert back again.\nKey to its changeable properties are the inexpensive chemical compounds the team has worked into the material. Among these are coupling molecules called triazolinediones and an ingredient common in moth repellent called napthalene.\nTogether, these enable the material to stay solid and firm so long as it is exposed to green LED light. But when the researchers switch the light off and the material is left in the dark for a little while, these chemical bonds begin to break up and cause it to become a soft, runny mess. Switching the light back on then sees it harden up once again.\nFurther, dimming the light rather than shutting it off enabled them to tweak the material's mechanical properties to somewhere in between. These capabilities are unique when it comes to materials, the researchers say, and run counter to today's common understanding of chemistry.\n\"Typically, you use different wavelengths of light or additional heat or harsh chemicals to break up the polymer molecule chains that form a network structure,\" the researchers say. \"However, in this case, we used green LED light to stabilize the network. The trigger to break up the network, make it collapse and flow away is actually the mildest one of all: darkness. Switch the light back on and the material re-hardens and retains its strength and stability.\"\nThe team calls its new structure a \"light-stabilized dynamic material,\" and hopes that it can give rise to a new class of materials that respond to light in novel and useful ways. It is eyeing applications in 3D printing, where creating structures such bridges or staircases with overhanging features is inherently tricky, as 3D printing typically works by building one layer on top of another from the ground up.\n\"What you need to 3D print something like a bridge is a support scaffold, a second ink that provides that scaffold during printing of the design, but which you can later remove when it is no longer needed,\" says Professor Christopher Barner-Kowollik, a macromolecular chemist at QUT. \"With a light-stabilized dynamic ink used as a scaffold you could 3D print under light, then switch the light off to let the scaffold ink flow away.\"\nThe research was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, while the video below shows the material's transformative abilities in action.","One of the most surprising findings from this year’s Nash Squared Digital Leadership Report is that the number of major cyberattacks reported is falling.\nIn its 25th year of publication, the report found that across more than 2,100 technology/digital leaders surveyed globally, the proportion experiencing a major cyberattack in the last two years has fallen to 23% – down from 28% in 2022. A higher proportion – 44% – of large organisations reported a major incident this year, down 56% last year.\nOur perspectives on cyberattacks are changing. There are so many attacks now that cyber and technology professionals have become hardened to them, and what they class as ‘major’ has changed. A few years ago, a short DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) or small data breach might have sparked a midnight call to the CEO, now it’s seen as ‘routine’.\nMore organisations are strengthening their cyber defences. Some sectors like financial services and central government continue to raise their game, investing in sophisticated protection systems, threat detection and response capabilities, and continually reminding the whole workforce of the importance of good cybersecurity protocols. We can’t say that businesses are ‘winning’ the cyber battle. It’s more nuanced and complicated than that.\nRaising the stakes: new threats from generative AI\nNew threats are coming that could dwarf anything we have seen to date. Generative AI has become today’s hot ticket. But while generative AI holds enormous positive potential, it could also be a gift to the cyber criminals. A communique signed by attendees in advance of the UK government’s AI summit of world leaders warned that AI systems could be used to launch cyberattacks and create bioweapons, and that it is “especially urgent” to address the risks.\nThe success of cyberattacks is often dependent on their ability to scale – swamping and overwhelming an organisation’s defences – and their ability to mimic real humans (as in a phishing campaign). We are already seeing instances of incredibly convincing, tailored phishing emails that appear to have been generated with AI. In time, some predict that the success rate of phishing campaigns could leap exponentially, from the present level of about 0.1% to anywhere around 20%.\nPhishing would only be the start. Cyber criminals are also engaging in what’s been termed as ‘AI poisoning’, infecting the content that is subsumed into the learning process of an AI algorithm so that it becomes untrue, biased or downright malicious. This could then be replicated and multiplied across systems and networks with terrible consequences.\nThere is also malware. So far, generative AI’s coding abilities have been relatively basic. But AI is improving at exponential rates – much faster than a human can learn. It may not be long before generative AI can develop malicious code that is almost impossible to block. Malware potency could hit new levels, and the cyber industry will need all its skill and investment (and some help from ‘good’ AI) to combat it.\nThe quantum risk\nWe are already beginning to see Quantum as a Service (QaaS) being offered where quantum mainframes are made available to users. It may not be long before the networking challenges of quantum being solved so that quantum computing becomes available on a mass scale. Users, including cyber criminals, could have access to thousands if not tens of thousands of qubits. This will put almost unimaginable computing and processing power into peoples’ hands.\nQuantum computing poses a risk to encryption. Customers’ secure transactions to their bank or all the data transmitted over a VPN may no longer be protected. Adversaries may be able to go back and decrypt historic financial communications. The underlying basis of blockchain could be undermined, permitting the ability to rewrite financial records.\nThat kind of quantum scenario may be a little way off – and hopefully defences and mitigations would be invented at the same kind of speed.\nThere is no doubt that, with the new and emerging technologies that are coming, the cyber challenge could be massively amplified.\nThat’s why organisations have to keep on investing in their defences and get used to the thought that the battle is never over, and never won.\nJim Tiller is CISO, Nash Squared.
