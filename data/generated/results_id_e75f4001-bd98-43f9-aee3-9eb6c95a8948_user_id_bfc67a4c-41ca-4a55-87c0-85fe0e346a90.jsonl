{"question":"Can someone explain what's main goal in free improvisation vs jam session?","answer":"The main goals of these two types of improvisation are quite distinct. Free improvisation aims for pure collective expression and liberation from musical constraints - its goal is to transcend individual egos and achieve a group consciousness or 'flow' state through spontaneous creation, while deliberately avoiding traditional musical structures and commodification. In contrast, jam sessions have more practical goals: they focus on improving players' skills, practicing rhythm and soloing within established song structures, and learning to play effectively with other musicians. Jam sessions emphasize cooperation, following protocols, and developing specific musical abilities like keeping tempo and playing appropriate solos within chord progressions.","context":["Five strategies for free improvisation\nWritten by Pete Armitage\nDerived from the latin word ‘improvisus’, the word ‘improvisation’ can be translated as ‘unforeseen’ or ‘not seen ahead’. Ernst Ferrand, one of the first academics to tackle the topic of improvisation, defined it quite simply as ‘...the creation of music in the course of performance.’\nEven to the practicing musician though, the examination of its essence is difficult; what constitutes improvisation, and what does not?\nIndeed, the practice of improvisation and the neural mechanisms employed by improvising musicians seem to further elude investigation; ‘the precise nature of the processes that enable a performer to invent melodic material in real-time remain “shrouded in mystery’ (Ashley, 2009).\nAs suggested by Bruno Nettl and Gabriel Solis in the introduction to their volume Musical Improvisation: Art, Education, and Society, the sheer breadth and scope of the term’s application across ‘cultures, centuries and continents’ renders any definition reductive and indeed limiting to the idea itself.\nIn order to truly assess its nature, let us compare it to composition and performance as kindred musical practices. Accordingly, we might ask - when does improvisation become composition? How are the terms mutually exclusive? Peter Elsdon quoting Ellis-Benson discusses his categorisation of different forms of improvisation; ‘ornamentation’ vs ‘complex transformations of material’, postulating that it exists somewhere ‘between composition and performance.’ Indeed, the conundrum tackled by Ellis-Benson lies in the difficulties of categorising a practice which arguably exists in both composition and performance, whilst remaining very much distinct as a process.\nFor the sake of investigation, let’s discuss the two basic varieties posited by Bailey; ‘idiomatic improvisation’ and ‘non-idiomatic improvisation.’ The former presupposes that the performer abides by the basic syntactic norms of a given musical tradition whilst engaging in the improvisational process, e.g. jazz. (6) On the other hand, non-idiomatic improvisation is an altogether more off-piste variant; disregarding scholastic prescription and presenting as a more sincere homage to the non-conformism the casual observer might glean from an instance of musical improvisation.\nLet us ponder upon this latter conception in order to demystify and strategise its effective execution. We can consider the scenario of improvising jazz musicians in a smoky New York winebar. The musicians have an intimate understanding of their instruments, the aesthetic sensibilities of the genre and the musical tradition that precedes them.\nWhat strategies might they be employing to enrich their improvisatory process?\nIn contrast to the performance of written material, non-idiomatic improvisation relies on the spontaneous creativity of musicians. The restraints of composition and performance are disregarded alongside the traditions and ethics of playing passages ‘right’ or ‘wrong’; there is no musical context. All that exists is the ‘...the sheer magical energy of the physical person/s making the music - for it is they who are momentarily but fully responsible for the sounds they make.’ [Alvin Curran, in response to Sabine Feisst]\nFree improvisation by nature disregards musical rules. The only rule is that there are no rules. Participants ought to strive to disregard their allegiances to prescribed musical idioms and stylistic prescriptions. However by admission of this sentiment whatever comes out, comes out; ‘...Any technique or resource can be used at any moment’ (Tuominen, 1998; in Stenström, 2009: 106) No procedure or approach ought to be favoured, as the free improviser ‘refuses to make any binding choices concerning idioms’ (Munthe, 1992 cited in Stenström, 2009: 147)\nThe magic of free improvisation lies in its celebration of liberty, the collective abolition of tradition and judgment. The forming of a unified, momentary voice. The compounded unpredictability of individuals within a group increases the variability of the ensemble and contributed ideas manifest in call-and-response among members. This calls for a disposal of intra-group scrutiny. The lack of scores, bandleaders or rules calls for mutual trust and respect so as to preserve the purity of the collective expression untainted by our socially conditioned perceptions.\nWhen we contemplate the desired outcomes of improvisation, the unshackling of ego is paramount. We ought to revel in the alchemy of momentary expression, dismissing our programmed intentions of self-actualization and narcissism. Let the creation be unselfconscious and pure - the end product of the group will transcend the sum of its individual parts. Csikszentmihalyi’s (1990) flow theory suggests that the state of flow ought not only to be an individual state of consciousness but also a group experience - group flow. Synchronicity between individuals members of the improvising group allows collective transcendence, and liberation from the bondages of our post-industrial society.\nIn order to immerse oneself in the collective bliss of stream-of-consciousness musicality, let’s remind ourselves that free improvisation exists outside the boundaries of functionality. What is it free from? It is free from hierarchy. It is untamed, unorganised, unconscious. Everyone is equal. It’s political in being apolitical. Let us collectively embrace the decoupling of music from music as a commodity. Music as a verb not a noun.\n- Richard Ashley (2008) ‘Musical Improvisation’ The Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology\n- Peter Elsdon (2013) ‘Re-imagining Improvisation: Listening, Discourse and Aesthetics’\n- Gary Peters (2009) ‘The Philosophy of Improvisation’ Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press\n- Bruce Ellis-Benson (2003) ‘The Improvisation of Musical Dialogue’\n- Alvin Curran (2006) ‘On Spontaneous Music’ Contemporary Music Review Vol. 25, No. 5, pp. 485 – 492.\n- Sawyer, R.

However, the prospect of a jam session can feel imposing to many players.\nFrom calling tunes to comping over other players’ songs and improvising solos, jam sessions are complex endeavors. Beginners may struggle to take everything in at first — or worse, feel left out and give up on the session entirely. This guide aims to explain everything you’ll need to know to shorten your learning curve and help you take full advantage of your next jam.\nNo matter the genre or style, many jam sessions involve long rhythmic vamps, individual solos, and collective, “traded solos” throughout the course of a tune.\nBasics of Jam Sessions\nFirst and foremost, no two jam sessions are the same. A variety of factors can influence the character of any particular jam, from the time and place to the genre of music and regular crowd of musicians. Even two different dates of a periodic organized jam may be significantly different.\nThe first takeaway from this is that you shouldn’t get easily discouraged by a bad jam. The next jam may be better. If it isn’t, chances are you can find other jam sessions around that may offer a much more enjoyable experience.\nWith that being said, most jams do tend to follow a similar structure, especially those at clubs, bars, or other music venues. Players will rotate on and off stage, and each one will generally get a chance to call a song to play.\nDepending on the format, that song may be a popular hit, a jazz standard, a basic blues progression, or anything in between. While tune-callers are generally expected to give some tips on the basics of their song for those who don’t know, you may often need to keep rhythm off of their instructions alone, or play along with changes from a sheet in real time.\nSoloing is an essential part of jamming — after all, part of the fun of playing with other people is showing off your skills! Protocol for soloing may vary from jam to jam; the size of the session or skill of those involved can dictate the soloists and order of solos. Most jams will structure the songs to allow multiple solos from those on the bandstand.\nA good rule of thumb is that if you call a tune, you’ll be given space for a solo. If the jam rotates guitarists (as most do), you may be able to solo for each tune when you’re on stage. However, you’ll probably only get to play for two or three songs at a time, so it’s a definite trade-off!\nMost jams tend to be inviting for newer and shyer players. If you would prefer to just play rhythm, you can let the other players know. Don’t be surprised, though, if they gently push you to give soloing a shot. Jams are a great way to improve your skills, and friendly encouragement is often the way to push a bit beyond your comfort zone.\nMany guitarists find jam sessions through other local musicians or online musician’s groups.\nHow To Find Jam Sessions\nBefore you can play at a jam session, you’ve got to find one first! The easiest way is to do a quick Google search for jam sessions in your local area. Many bars or clubs may host weekly or semi-weekly jam nights in a variety of genres.\nLocal musicians are another great avenue to find jams. Check for any online groups (especially on Facebook). If you don’t see any, don’t be afraid to ask any musician friends or even take a trip to a local guitar store. Odds are any staff or musicians there will be happy to tell you if they know of any jams in the area.\nThankfully, your first jam session won’t involve an audience like this.\nHow to Prepare for a Jam Session\nBefore you go to a jam session, take a bit of time to prepare so you’re as relaxed as possible at the event.\nDo some online research: look up the venue’s website, see if they have a dedicated page for jam information, get a feel for the style and character of the place. If there’s no information for the jam, you can try some musician’s forums or give the venue a call to ask a few questions.\nSome jams will provide a backline for guitarists, meaning you only need to bring your instrument and plug into their amps, while others expect you to bring your own amplification as well. A quick Google search or phone call can save you from ending up with no amp to play through, so don’t forget this step!\nYou should also have a fair idea of the musical style before you show up to the jam session. If the website or sign-up page (if there is one) doesn’t give enough detail, do some more research! Videos from past jams or information from other players who attend could be helpful.\nWhile you don’t need to show up with a full setlist in mind, it’s always a good idea to think of a few songs that you enjoy and can play, are simple to explain, and offer opportunities to solo.\nDepending on the theme of the jam you could find a few jazz guitar standards or popular rock songs to suggest. Try to be original with your choices — no, “Smoke On The Water” or “Smells Like Teen Spirit” don’t count.\nIn any situation, a blues is a great backup plan. Whether you’re at a blues-focused session or someone just stole your song idea, calling a blues form is a simple and entertaining way to please everyone else on the bandstand. Switch up the key or move to a 16-bar form (rather than the standard 12) to keep things interesting, and avoid overplayed keys like E and A in particular.\nMake sure that you can play smooth rhythm guitar without slowing others down! Before jamming, practice playing songs with just a chord sheet in front of you. Knowing your different chord shapes is essential for this skill.\nIf you have no idea of a song at the jam, you can always ask the person who called it for a quick explanation, but your goal should be to play through the session without stumbling or holding the whole band up. Thankfully, most songs will be popular enough or simple enough you should be able to “comp” (play rhythm) as you go without serious issues.\n- Think of 3-5 potential songs to call\n- Work on your rhythm playing\n- Practice soloing over backing tracks\n- Research the venue to determine the required equipment\nA great example of communicating with other players while up on the bandstand.\nWhat to Do At a Jam Session\nWhen you arrive at the venue, take a few minutes to check in and talk with the other musicians there. It’s always helpful to get there early, as it gives you a bit of extra time to settle in, calm any nerves, and get ready to play when the jam begins.\nIf there’s a dedicated MC or organizer, don’t be afraid to introduce yourself. A little introduction will help him or her pair you on the bandstand with other musicians who share your skill level and interests.\nPlaying Tips For Jam Sessions\nOnce the jam session gets underway, the organizer or MC will typically direct traffic. At some sessions, there may be a house backing band that plays a distinct set then invites jammers up to join, or the jam may start out of the gate.\nAt some point during your time on stage, you will be expected to call a song for everyone to play. If you’ve thought through some ideas before the jam, this shouldn’t be too difficult. Just make sure to explain the changes for everyone, and specify any tips about the structure or melody of the tune. If for example you just want to play the verses while people solo, remember to tell people when you call out the tune.\nMake sure everyone is clear before you begin playing! Usually all it takes is a quick glance at each player for a thumbs-up or similar sign of approval, but be prepared to clarify any questions other players might have. Once you’re sure everyone’s ready to go, you can count in the song and get playing!\nRhythm playing is just as important as soloing at a jam. Finding partial chords higher on the neck is a great way to differentiate yourself from other guitarists also playing rhythm at the same time and add some character to any tune.\nPlaying Rhythm At a Jam\nThe fastest way to ingratiate yourself to other players at a jam session is to keep great rhythm. If that’s not reason enough to practice your rhythm guitar, nine times out of ten you’ll spend the majority of the jam playing rhythm anyway, so it’s something you might as well get used to beforehand.\nIn all seriousness, rhythm playing is an essential guitar skill to master. A steady, accurate rhythm part fuels a song and anchors the groove for soloists and other instrumental players.\nIt’s the tune caller’s responsibility to make sure you know the form and general chords to the song they call. If you’ve never heard the song or their explanation makes no sense, try to find a chord sheet to play from, or pick up the chords by ear as the tune progresses. If you really feel lost, you can always choose to take a rest for the tune — if you’re not confident you can make it through the form, this can be a great way to tune up your guitar, enjoy a quick drink, and simply take in the atmosphere before the next song.\nWhen playing rhythm, the most important thing is keeping the initial tempo and locking down a steady pattern. As a guitar player, it can be especially hard to resist the urge to speed up or to over-embellish! Instead, follow the lead of the other musicians and keep things relaxed. Turn down your volume a bit when playing rhythm to give the soloists some space to shine.\nOnce you’ve locked into the groove and feel comfortable playing with the chord structure, don’t be afraid to add a few timely accents to liven up the beat. If multiple guitarists are playing rhythm parts, you can also find different chord voicings or play partial chords. A bit of creativity and coordination can take a tune from mediocre to rock-solid.\nJust make sure you don’t overdo the accents, or sacrifice the groove to make your part busier. Jam sessions are all about cooperation. Be a team player and take extra care not to hog the limelight or ignore your job when you’re not soloing.\nJam Session Rhythm Tips:\n- Focus on the groove, not the accents\n- Stay on tempo\n- Don’t step on other players’ toes (play different voicings)\n- Make the soloist sound as good as possible!\nDoing this during your solo may be the quickest way to not be invited back to the next jam.\nSoloing is the essence of any jam session. And while it may seem imposing for new players, with a few simple guidelines you should be able to deliver effective solos and keep up at any jam session.\nIf you’ve never practiced improvising a solo or wouldn’t feel comfortable soloing in any case at a jam session, don’t go just yet. Practice your scales (major, minor, pentatonic, modes, and arpeggios) through the circle of fifths and improvise some solos over backing tracks or with a looper pedal. Listen to some of your favorite solos and note what licks and techniques the players use to guide you. You can also check out our article on essential guitar improvisation techniques to help focus your practice in this area.\nIf you’re a more intermediate player with some soloing experience, keep practicing! Pentatonic soloing should work well for most jam-session songs. If it’s not a standard blues form, you can use major pentatonic to play over the chords of a given form. If the changes come fast in a particular section, focus on outlining the chords — that is, use the notes from the chord shape you played for rhythm to guide your improvisation.\nFor advanced players, focus on developing your improvisational vocabulary and delivering focused, articulate solos. Stay away from tapping and shredding (nobody likes a show-off) and strive for clear, tasty licks with feel. Your goal should be to improve your own playing and work on improvisational methods you’ve never used before, rather than showing up every other player at the jam. That advice is especially important if you want to be invited back to the next session.\nNo matter your skill level, you’ll need to keep a few logistical tips in mind when soloing. If you’ve called the tune, you’ll be expected to take the first solo, so be prepared! When going into your solo, turn your volume up a tad so you can be heard over the mix. Just don’t drown out the rhythm section and remember to turn back down when you’re finished.\nA rule of thumb regarding solo length: every solo gets one chorus, a good one earns two, and only great ones get three choruses or more. In a jam session environment, everyone deserves an opportunity, but nobody should dominate. Keep your solos short and sweet! As you near the end of each chorus, look around the stage and communicate with the other musicians; if they encourage you to keep soloing, go for it! Otherwise, get ready to pass it off to the next soloist.\nJazz Session Soloing Tips:\n- Prioritize feel and ideas over speed\n- Outline chords over more difficult changes\n- Keep your solos focused and communicate with other players\nRemember to turn down your amp when trading fours so you don’t overpower the other guitarists!\nOn certain tunes (especially at jazz jams), players will “trade fours” after each person has taken a solo. This means that multiple players will take turns delivering a four-bar lick and building off each other. The trade-off can go for one chorus or many, but the general idea remains the same.\nThe order of players will usually go based on the solo order from earlier in the song. Remember your place in line and the rest is pretty simple. Once again, just be considerate of other players — don’t cut in early or let your licks run a bar long — and you should be fine.\nIf you’ve never jammed before, jam sessions can feel imposing or out of your league. It’s easy to convince yourself that you’ll never understand the process or keep up with the musicians.\nBut with some common etiquette and a bit of practice, jam sessions can become a unique opportunity to improve your chops and enjoy making music with other people. We hope this guide has been helpful and given you all the tools you need to take advantage of your next local session. Enjoy the jam!\nJazz is one of the more popular genres at many jam sessions.

{"question":"As a marketing manager, I need to understand: what makes customer feedback valuable for business growth, and what reputational risks can arise from negative customer feedback on social media?","answer":"Customer feedback is valuable for business growth in several ways: it helps identify product improvements, makes customers feel appreciated, generates personal recommendations, and increases customer retention. Organizations that listen to their customers grow faster, with 88% of consumers trusting online reviews. However, negative feedback on social media poses significant reputational risks that can spread globally within hours. These risks can damage brand reputation, affect financial performance through reduced borrowing capacity and share prices, impact operations through reduced influence with stakeholders, hurt HR by damaging the employer brand, and decrease sales profitability. The real danger comes when issues like poor quality or unethical practices get amplified by mass media.","context":["Customer feedback is essential. Organizations that listen to their customers grow faster.Customer feedback is a powerful guide that provides you with critical insights. You can use the feedback to improve your products, revise your service delivery strategy, and optimize customer satisfaction.\nWhat is Customer Feedback?Customer feedback is a summary of how your products and services help the customer and whether they meet their requirements. Customer feedback is helpful information or criticism that pertains to your products. Collecting customer feedback involves acquiring the customer's opinion about your company, products, or services. The best way to develop a better customer experience is to act on customer feedback. Even though companies that listen to their consumers grow faster, collecting customer feedback is not a short-term growth hack. Acting on customer feedback will take your business to a whole new level.\nWhy is Customer Feedback so Important?\n1. Highlights the Aspects of Your Product that Need ImprovementLike any other product developer, you know your products by heart. You understand every feature and application. It may be hard for you to identify the imperfections of a product. This is where the customer comes in. Customers know whether a product suits them or not. They can tell you their least favorite feature and why. Once customers realize that you truly listen to them, they will give you a second chance to improve. In this way, you can delay and mitigate churn.\n2. Collecting Feedback Makes the Customer Feel AppreciatedFew things make that customer feel important. Asking for customer opinion and acting accordingly is one of those things. Collecting feedback makes the customer feel valued as part of the product creation phase. Customers who feel listened to develop a positive connotation towards your brand. They will always direct their experience back to you. This positive relationship between your company and the consumer can encourage more sales.\n3. Positive Customer Feedback Generates Personal RecommendationsWord of mouth advertising is a powerful marketing tool. Referrals are the cheapest and most effective form of marketing. A study by Kellerfay revealed that personal recommendations are the top motivators for purchasing decisions. Referrals don't just affect the finalization of the sale, but also every step of the purchase cycle. Face-to-face interactions are responsible for eight out of ten recommended purchases. About 2% of people that turn to your website from recommendations are acting on what they read about your company from social media. A customer who delivers positive feedback will probably recommend your products or services to colleagues, friends, and service. Give your customers a listening ear, and they will deliver positive feedback.\n4. Feedback Interactions Encourage Customers RetentionYou can sell products to customers, but that does not guarantee that they will come back. Information from the market or competition can help you polish aspects like quality, price, and advertising. However, there are certain aspects that only the users of your products can point out. Insight from your customers will reveal the factors that you did not consider—for example, shipping costs, customer consultancy services, and safe packing. At the start, you may get positive reviews. Pay attention to the unique customer insight. It may help you grasp the concept of the customer's desired approach. Act on the feedback, and you will earn happy repeat customers.\n5. Feedback Can Push SalesIn the SaaS industry, competition is only two clicks away. It does not take much for a customer to deviate. You want to tackle any misunderstanding or problems immediately. The unhappy customers who express themselves through feedback are opportunities for a second chance. There are dire consequences for failing to address their frustrations. The unhappy customer can leave a negative review on your social media page or post an anonymous comment on one of your forums. The feedback form is the only appropriate place for negative reviews. Here, you control who sees the comments, and you have an opportunity to act accordingly. You must develop an action plan to address unhappy customers. An effective strategy involves contacting the customer, addressing the issue, and setting a date for following up. If the problem is severe, you can work on a reasonable form of compensation.\n6. Feedback Help in Customer AcquisitionI am sure that you've been in a situation where you had to make a purchasing decision. One of the first things you do is check online reviews pertaining to the product that interests you. A study by Invesp revealed that about 90% of consumers read online reviews before logging onto a business website. About 88% of consumers trust online reviews. Quality customer feedback can win you some new users. Keep your finger on the pulse. Ask your consumers about their opinions. Act on the feedback accordingly. A satisfied customer is happy to recommend your services for free.\n7. Customer Feedback Can Help Build Brand LoyaltyCollecting feedback and acting on it helps build a positive relationship with the customer. The consumer will perceive your organization as a friendly establishment that cares about its customers. This relationship can evolve to inspire brand loyalty.\nWhen and How to Seek Out Customer FeedbackTo get the most accurate feedback, you need to know ho to seek out customer feedback at the right time. Ask the wrong questions, and the respondents will ignore the questionnaire. Place the survey form in the wrong place, and nobody will bother to respond. There are different methods of collecting customer feedback. These techniques include:\n- User Experience Tests\n- Customer Calls\n- Customer Support Chats\nHow to Create an Effective Feedback Form\n1. Define Your GoalsFor a survey to be effective, you must have clear objectives. Think about what you want this exercise to accomplish. Write down the kind of information that you are hoping to extract from your customers.\n2. Ask Less and Clear QuestionsEvery question you draft should help you accomplish a goal. Here's a tip for you, ask less and straightforward questions. To avoid confusion, select one field and ask questions related to this discipline. Avoid questions that require a lot of texting. You can provide multiple choices or use graphical tools like emojis. Below is an appropriate example:\n3. Keep Things ShortThe ideal survey should have five to ten questions. The customer has a short attention span. Bombard them with a lot of questions, and you risk losing them. To keep things short, avoid redundancies. Do not ask for answers that you already know. Below is an example of redundancies in McDonald's feedback form. The receipt already has the information on the date, time, and restaurant number. There is no need for the fast-food giant to ask for the information again.\n3. Incentivise the ProcessOffering incentives is an effective way of increasing survey engagement and gain more responses. Incentives can come in the form of discounts, gift vouchers, or redeemable points. About 85% of customers say that they would spend more time on apps and software if they offered gamification elements. Gamification can make feedback collection a fun activity. In this way, you are increasing your response rate and providing value to the customer.\n4. Test Your Feedback FormBefore you can deploy your feedback form, you must test it. Proofread to ensure that the document if free from errors. Test your material on multiple devices.\nUses of Customer FeedbackShowing the customers that you care about their opinion is one part of the job. To retain these dissatisfied consumers, you must act on their complaints and suggestions. The whole purpose of collecting feedback is to improve how you conduct your business. Respond to the feedback through your actions. Customer feedback is perhaps the most neglected service among SaaS businesses. Only 52% of customers are confident that brands will act on their feedback. Acting on customer feedback could be your way of edging ahead of the competition. With the right strategy, you can transform dissatisfied customers into your best consumers.\nCustomer Feedback is ImportantCollecting, analyzing, and acting on customer feedback is essential. Not only does this process help you understand your customers, but it also boosts customer loyalty and engagement. Positive customer reviews can help you attract organic traffic to your website. It is time that you expressed how much you care about your customer's input. Your efforts will ultimately contribute to building a stronger brand. Always remember that your customers are your advocates. By being proactive in listening to customer opinions, you can significantly improve your business in the long run. There you have it, customer feedback, and why you need it. Go out and collect some feedback. Do not forget to act on the insights you get.","A good reputation is the lifeblood of any organisation. And managing reputation in a world where social media plays an increasing part is hard. After all, no organisation can stop consumers criticising them if they choose too. In the past it might not have mattered much if one or two unhappy consumers complained to their friends. But now, a bad review (whether fair or not) can spread around the globe in hours.\nSocial media risk is the risk that the use of social media by an organisation, or by third parties including the general public, causes loss or damage to that organisation. The risk can be divided into five basic types:\n- reputational risk\n- operational risk\n- compliance risk\n- legal risk\n- asset risk\nReputational risk is the most common form of social media risk, and certainly the most well known. This is in part because much reputational risk is a consequence of other risk factors. In other words, most social media risk factors can lead to reputational damage.\nThe risks can involve damage to an organisation’s reputation, or to the reputation of brands and products it owns and the services it provides.\nThese risks vary in importance but they can be found right across most organisations, in finance, operations, HR, marketing, sales and general management.\nThere can be a wide variety of causes including:\n- Unethical employee behaviour online or offline such as inappropriate tweets or the uncovering of unethical manufacturing practices by an organisation\n- Consumer reactions to poor quality products and services or inadequate after sales service, especially where these are amplified by the media\n- Impersonation of prominent people associated with the organisation who are then apparently heard saying inappropriate things; or the takeover and altering of corporate social media assets so that they are no longer “on-brand”\n- Inappropriate use of social media by employees such as bullying behaviour or simply the posting of unwise content\n- Poor marketing activity including allowing consumers to discover and respond to obsolete marketing campaigns\n- Unflattering comments by third parties on social media platforms (e.g. poor reviews, aspersions made against directors, negative analysis of financial performance)\n- Unwise comments by executives that are amplified by the media (the “Gerald Ratner syndrome”) with disastrous results\nMany instances of reputational damage are not particularly important. There is often a lot of fluttering by social media commentators but if the damaging issue isn’t seen by mainstream consumers the main outcome can be red faces in the marketing department! In these cases it is important not to over react.\nThe real danger is that a particular issue – low quality, unethical practices, inappropriate public comments by senior executives – gets taken up by the mass media and “amplified”.\nOrganisations often place their social media risk management processes within PR or marketing. However, reputational damage is not just a concern for marketing departments. A damaged reputation can affect many things adversely, including:\n- Finance: The ability of an organisation to borrow at the best rate of interest; the ability to attract investment can also be damaged and this can result in damage to the share price\n- Operations: The image of the organisation as a “corporate good citizen”, which in turn may reduce influence with external stakeholders such as regulators or suppliers, ultimately resulting in less efficient operations\n- HR: The organisation’s “employer brand” which if damaged can result in difficulties recruiting the best talent\n- Sales: The sales a company makes; in addition the profitability of those sales can be reduced due to increased costs (less influence with suppliers) or by the inability to charge higher prices (less credibility with consumers)\nBecause the potential effect of reputational risk extends across organisations, it is sensible to monitor the risks outside PR and marketing departments. The ideal organisational structure will allow for social media risk management to be a separate and stand alone function which can work with the relevant business function to manage any difficulty.\nAs with other social media risks, the simple ALP management process should be applied:\n- Audit: Identify potential risks using scenarios or knowledge of previous social media “fails\n- Listen: Listen out for potential problems\n- Prepare: Prepare for potential problems by:\n- Developing an appropriate social media policy and training all employees in its meaning and use (this includes Board members)\n- Agreeing management processes to handle likely risks including escalation processes and generic position statements\n- Simulating problems and practising the response\nAs we said at the start of this post, reputational risk isn’t the only risk area to stem from social media. More on the other social media risk areas next week."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:93a1a088-7f52-4474-90b4-dcb63aa6bcd6>","<urn:uuid:c5751c76-5911-433c-a79c-809b68a522a5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"For my research on military careers, what roles did Dozier and Bartlett hold after their initial enlistments?","answer":"Dozier progressed from first lieutenant in the 118th Infantry to brigadier general and Adjutant General of South Carolina, serving in that role from 1926 to 1959, during which he expanded the National Guard to over 10,000 men. Bartlett advanced from Captain in the Massachusetts 20th Infantry through multiple colonelcies of different regiments (49th, 57th), was promoted to Brigadier General at age 24 in 1864, and eventually commanded the Ninth Corps, before being mustered out of the Army in 1866.","context":["Dozier was one of six of its members to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for “Conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty” in action near Montbrehain, France, October 8, 1918.\nSoldier, Medal of Honor recipient. Dozier was born on February 17, 1885, in Galivants Ferry, the son of James Henry Dozier and Julie Marie Best. He moved with his family to Rock Hill and later enrolled at Wofford College in Spartanburg. Dozier began his military career at age nineteen, when he enlisted in the First Infantry Regiment at Rock Hill, which the federal government mobilized into service in 1916 and sent to the Mexican border. By 1917 Dozier had been promoted to first lieutenant and his unit redesignated as the 118th Infantry, Thirtieth Division. During World War I this unit became the U.S. Army’s most decorated division. Dozier was one of six of its members to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for “Conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty” in action near Montbrehain, France, October 8, 1918. In command of two platoons, Dozier was painfully wounded in the shoulder but continued to lead his men. When his command was held up by heavy machine gun fire, he deployed his men in the best cover available and with another soldier continued forward to attack a machine gun nest, killing the entire crew and later capturing Germans who had taken refuge in a nearby dugout.\nFollowing World War I, Dozier wed Tallulah Little of Laurens on June 10, 1920, settled in Columbia, and continued his service in the military by reorganizing Company I of the 118th Infantry. Following the death in office of Adjutant General Robert E. Craig, Dozier–then a major–was appointed to fill the unexpired term on January 22, 1926. Promoted to the rank of brigadier general, Dozier took command of the South Carolina National Guard, which consisted of more than two thousand officers and men. In addition, he was asked by the War Department to take over custody of Camp Jackson, which he maintained as a training site for National Guard and Reserve units until the beginning of World War II. He was elected adjutant general by the people of South Carolina in 1926 and remained in office until retiring in 1959.\nDuring the thirty-three years that Dozier served as adjutant general, the South Carolina National Guard grew to more than ten thousand officers and enlisted men, scores of new armories and facilities were built, Congaree Air Base (now McEntire Air National Guard Station) was acquired, and a new state headquarters was constructed. Under his leadership, the South Carolina National Guard evolved from a small, low-visibility institution–to which an individual was invited to join–to a modern fighting force of citizen soldiers ready to respond to state or national emergencies.\nDozier died on October 24, 1974, at his home in Columbia and was buried in Elmwood Cemetery. Both Fort Jackson and the S.C. National Guard have named buildings in his honor.\n“Former Adjutant General Dozier Dies at Age 89.” Columbia State, October 25, 1974, pp. A1, A13.\nHunter, Jim. “Columbia Man Reflects on Act Which Led to Medal of Honor.” Columbia State, October 11, 1962, p.

Bartlet, by his daring in the late inter State war, would have redeemed them all. A student in Harvard when the bugle sounded, summoning the citizens to defend the Union and its flag, he at once enlisted and became a captain in the Twentieth Massachusetts Regiment.\nBefore Yorktown, Va., a rifle-shot required the amputation of one leg.\nSix months later he was again in the field, colonel of the Fifty-ninth Regiment, and at Port Hudson, leading the assault, the only man on horseback, and there ore in the most hazardous position, he was again disabled by a shot in the wrist.\nA truce being declared to bury the dead, the first inquiry of the Confederate officer was, \"Who was that man on horseback ? \" Being told, he said, \" He is a gallant fellow; a brave man, the bravest and most daring we have met during the war. We thought him too brave to die, and ordered our men not to fire at him! \"\nRecovering from his wound, he was again in the field, colonel of the Fifty- second Regiment; was promoted to a brigadier-general; captured in assaulting the enemy's works at Petersburg; shut up in Libby Prison three months, and at the close of the war found him in command of the Ninth Corps, in Virginia.\nHe was a soldier, a scholar and an orator; magnetic in word and action.\nWilliam Francis Bartlett was born in Haverhill in 1840, the next generation in a proud New England family. His ancestor, Bailey Bartlett took part in the country’s early struggle for Independence, and aptitude for military life was a strong family trait. Bartlett was educated at Phillips Academy, before entering the class of 1862 at Harvard. His college career was interrupted in his junior year, when war broke out between the North and the South. He joined the Twentieth Massachusetts Militia and was commissioned a Captain. In October 1861, he saw his first engagement at the Battle of Ball’s Bluff near Leesburg, Virginia, in what turned out to be a debacle for the Union Army. Colonel Baker, the officer in charge of the reconnaissance mission, miscalculated the Confederates’ position and strength and was killed as his troops were overrun by the 8th Virginia regiment at a bluff above the Potomac River. Bartlett, who led a detachment of the Massachusetts men, was in the thick of it, but he succeeded in rescuing all of his command, as well as many others as the Rebels fired from the cover of woods.\n\"Musket balls then flew like hail.\" Bartlett later wrote, \"I felt that if I was going to be hit, I should be, whether I stood up or lay down, so I stood up and walked around, among the men, stepping over them and talking to them in a joking way, to take away their thoughts from the bullets, and keep them more self-possessed. I was surprised at my own coolness. I never felt better, although I expected of course that I should feel the lead every second, and I was wondering where it would take me.\"\nSix months later, Bartlett did feel the lead as he was badly wounded at the Battle of Yorktown. He was kneeling to get a better view of the enemy through his spyglasses when a sharpshooter’s “minnie” ball struck him in the knee, shattering his leg all the way to the ankle. He was removed to the rear, where a field physician amputated his leg four inches above the knee. Afterwards, his only complaint to his commanding officer Colonel Francis Palfrey was: “it’s rough isn’t it Frank.”\nBartlett returned home and received his degree from Harvard while recuperating from his injury and, by 1862, was offered the command of the 49th regiment stationed at Camp Briggs in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. In some military quarters, the right of the election of officers was recognized, and at Camp Briggs, Bartlett was so admired and respected that he was unanimously elected Colonel. Injuries notwithstanding, he made his first appearance with an artificial leg in full dress parade and on horseback along with his regiment on Broadway in New York City.\nColonel Bartlett could have retired from the battlefront to bask in the glow of military distinction. Instead he volunteered to command a Louisiana campaign to New Orleans. On May 27, 1863, he guided the 49th in a mad dash across open ground in an assault on the entrenchments at Port Hudson. The terrain there was too rugged for Bartlett’s amputated leg, so he led the charge on horseback, an easy target for Rebel sharpshooters. He was wounded in the joint of his wrist, and his right ankle was hit by buckshot before Confederate officers, whose admiration for valor and manhood was ingrained in their southern culture, gave orders not to shoot the one-legged Yankee officer in command of the enemy regiment.\nBartlett survived and returned to Pittsfield riding at the head of his regiment, his arm in a sling. At the age of 23, he was offered and accepted the Colonelcy of the Fifty-seventh Regiment. He also became engaged to Agnes Pomeroy, whom he had met during his first assignment in Pittsfield. At one point, after being badly wounded, he wrote to offer to free her from any promises. Her response came swiftly: “As long as there is enough of your body to hold your soul, I want you.”\nIn April 1864, Bartlett led the 57th from Worcester to Rappahannock Station, and in May the order was given for the advance of the Army of the Potomac on the Wilderness Campaign. In his journal Bartlett wrote: “We shall fight tomorrow. I hope I may get through, but hardly expect it. His will be done.”\nThe next morning, the entire division was engaged in a fierce battle in which Bartlett led his troops. Around 11:00 a.m., he was wounded in the head and carried to the rear where he lay among the dead and dying. He survived and was transported in stages back to New York, where he was met by his mother and father and was cheered by appreciative New Yorkers at his hotel. Home in Massachusetts for barely three months, he returned to Washington intending to go back to the front. Because of the extent of his battle injuries, however, his superiors would not permit his return until his recovery was assured.\nOn June 20, 1864 at the age of 24, Bartlett was promoted to Brigadier General. His recovery, he assured his superiors, was sufficient enough to take command of Ledlie’s First division Army Corps at Petersburg, Virginia. The ensuing assault amidst land mines at the front line was among the bloodiest engagements of the war. Bartlett later wrote in his journal: “They threw bayonets and bottles on us, and we returned, for we got out of ammunition. At last, to save further slaughter, there being no hope of our being rescued, we gave it up. That crater during that day I shall never forget. A shell knocked down a boulder of clay onto my wooden leg and crushed it to pieces, killing the man next to me. I surrendered to General Mahone.”\nHe spent the next two months in a military prison suffering from sickness, filth and heat before being released in a prisoner exchange. Only his devotion to Agnes had kept him alive. He later took command of the Ninth Corps at Teneallytown near Washington but was eventually granted a leave by War Secretary Edwin Stanton for reasons of health. He was mustered out of the Army in July 1866.\nHe married Agnes in the same year, and they traveled in Europe before returning for the birth of their first child. He tried his hand at business but never regained the strength and resolve that had fueled his military career. In June 1874, the magnificent Memorial Hall in Cambridge was dedicated to commemorate the sons of Harvard who had fallen in the war. Invited to speak, General Bartlett gave a moving appeal for reconciliation that resounded throughout the audience at a time when such public sentiments were still rare.\nBurdened with never-ending physical sufferings after the war, General William Francis Bartlett was never able to regain his health completely, yet without remorse. He passed away on December 17, 1876 at his home in Pittsfield.\nThe Siege of Port Hudson, Louisiana (May 22 – July 9, 1863), was the final engagement in the Union campaign to recapture the Mississippi in the American Civil War.\nWhile Union General Ulysses Grant was besieging Vicksburg upriver, General Nathaniel Banks was ordered to capture the Confederate stronghold of Port Hudson, in order to go to Grant's aid. When his assault failed, Banks settled into a 48-day siege, the longest in US military history. A second attack also failed, and it was only after the fall of Vicksburg that the Confederate commander, General Franklin Gardner surrendered the port. This left the Mississippi open to Union navigation from its source to the Gulf of Mexico.\nInventory Number: MIS 030"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1b416d88-3c5f-4d1f-87b3-53f1df5cafe1>","<urn:uuid:bf3d18e9-a6b8-4f42-9ddf-8c54aeffabc7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do fishing techniques compare between deep-water crappie fishing and canal trout fishing when targeting suspended fish?","answer":"In crappie fishing, anglers use simple setups like a plain gold Aberdeen hook with a larger fathead minnow, or a colored jig head and minnow, keeping them perfectly still as the minnow's natural movement provides sufficient action. For monitoring fish, they use depth finders like the Marcum LX3 to track bait and fish movement. In contrast, canal fishing for trout requires more specialized techniques due to depths up to 36 feet and fast currents. Anglers use heavy equipment including 3gm or 6mm tungsten nymphs to reach the bottom, often employing Czech Nymphing techniques. The setup typically includes a heavy bomb with an egg, creeper or worm fly, or a single egg to avoid complications with multiple hooks. A 6wt or 7wt 10ft rod is recommended, and the approach involves either using a 20ft leader with a massive indicator or Czech Nymphing in rocky sections where water is 9ft deep and fast.","context":["Our good friend Ron Anlauf shares a few key points on icing late winter crappies.\nThis is no time to give up, not when the best is yet to come. If it was over it would certainly be understandable, but it isn?t. And it isn?t over till it?s over. What isn?t over Ron Anlauf icing crappiesis the last of the hard water crappie action, and what?s left is the icing on the cake.\nIt?s hard to imagine that anything under a thick sheet of ice and snow can get better as time goes by, but it sure can. The last month or so of the season can produce incredible action, especially when you get down to the last couple of weeks.\nCrappies are almost always vulnerable because they seem to be constantly feeding, at least to some extent. If you can find them you can generally catch them. If that?s true you start to realize that the most important part of actually catching a few slabs is being in the right place. It probably isn?t all that easy as you still have to find the right place, and you still have to be there at the right time, and you still need to be using the right bait.\nEven so if you can put it all together the rewards can be well worth the effort and with a little information you can get a head start on all of the fun.\nFinding the right place will vary depending on where you are and what happens to be available. Professional Angler Rick Olson of Mina, South Dakota targets big slabs on his home lake which is a small reservoir. He says: “I look for crappies to hold over deep water near the edge of the main channel. One of my hotspots is right out my back door and I?ll get set up late in the evening and wait for schools of big slabs to move through.\nThe best action usually occurs long after the sun goes down and you have to stay late or you could completely miss out.” When it comes to putting them on ice Rick likes to keep things simple and does it without a lot of commotion. “Most of the time I?ll use a plain gold Aberdeen hook and a larger fathead minnow on one line, and a colored jig head and minnow on another, and let them both sit perfectly still. The minnow will swim and kick and give the presentation all the action you need. More often than not the still bait will get hit while a jigged bait gets rejected.”\nJohn Janousek of Nisswa, Minnesota targets late ice and crappies and starts his search in deeper water and moves shallow by the very end of the season. “You can usually find crappies holding in deeper water near a drop off and they are almost always suspended.\nRegardless if they?re in twenty feet or forty feet of water they?re usually holding off the Bottom, and most often that?s about eight feet up. Timing is important and will vary depending on the lake you?re fishing as some are good daytime producers and others turn on only after dark”\nHis bag of after dark tricks for icing slabs includes using tiny light sticks and glow baits tipped with minnows. “I?ll fasten a green or red Northland Tackle Fire-light Glow Stick about six or eight inches above a glow lure like a Northland Forage Minnow Fry and tip it with a small minnow. It pays to keep the bait lit up and it needs to be charged with light to get the most out of it. You can fully charge a glow lure in a few seconds with a Northland Glow Buster and you?ll want to charge your bait every five or ten minutes for best results. It seems like every time you charge it up and put it back down the hole that something comes in to at least take a look.”\nYou can watch your bait and see what?s happening down below by using a good depth finder like the Marcum LX3. The LX3 will show your bait, your split shot, and any fish that comes through either up high or belly to the bottom. By watching the depth finder you?ll know if what you?re using is doing the trick, or if you need to try something else.\nBy the very end of the season crappies will often make moves into shallow water, even though there is enough safe ice left for someone to walk on. Janousek has found that crappies will often move into shallow mud bottom bays where there are clumps of lily pad roots late in the season. Others have found that active fish will move into old stands of reed beds, all of which can make for some exciting angling especially when you set the hook on a giant slab in four or five feet of water!\nAll of the above hinges on the amount of safe ice that you have left and safety always trumps a hot bite, no matter how good it is. There is no fish that swims that is worth losing a life over, so play it safe.\nOn the other hand there are those that miss out on the best of the best because they are uninformed about safe ice conditions. The general consensus is that daytime temps pushing into the forties and even fifties immediately creates unsafe conditions and this\nsimply isn?t true. Those warm temperatures are usually only reached for a short period of time late in the afternoon, and will cool down quickly as the sun goes down. The damage early on is minimal and safe ice can continue to exist for a month or more, even after you?ve hit the first daytime high in the fifties. See you on the ice, one last time.","You’ve seen ‘em on Instagram. You’ve wondered what Photoshop wizardry was involved. And then you’ve realized they’re real. Gerhard Uys looks at how nature and unique growing conditions conspire to create the 20lb-30lb rainbow trout in the hydro canals of the New Zealand South Island.\nWhat and Where is the Tekapo Canal?\nThe Tekapo Canal is part of the Waitaki hydro electricity scheme on New Zealand’s South Island. It is a network of lakes and canals that feed glacial water to eight power stations.\nThe scheme was initiated in the early 1900s when existing power generators could not provide enough for the New Zealand South Island. It now provides electricity to well over 800,000 average New Zealand households. With a population of only about 5 million people in entire New Zealand and the most staying in the North Island, this is massive.\nAccording to a 2014/15 National Angler Survey (NAS) this network of lakes and canals is collectively the most popular freshwater sports fishery in New Zealand. The popularity of this fishery has exploded in the past 15 years, with a over a 16- fold increase in angler use measured between 1994/1995 and 2014/2015. A study showed that between June to October 2019 there were over 4000 recorded angler days on the Tekapo Canal alone. The Tekapo Canal is where most of the monsters are caught, and it draws a quarter of all canal activity during winter season, according to the NAS survey.\nThe Monster Rainbow Trout:\nThe canals connecting the lakes sets the scene for the growth of massive fish.\nAs the water is glacier fed and ultra-clean, salmon farms cages now line the canals. According to salmon.org New Zealand farmed over 14,000 tons of King salmon (Chinook) in 2018 with almost 5000 tons exported to over 20 countries.\nThe primary reason for the large trout is that excess feed from salmon cages sift into the canals and large schools of wild trout simply hang around and gorge themselves on this feed.\nA recent report by The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research found that it is not just excess food that finds its way through salmon cages into the canal that leads to such large specimens, but also the prevalence of native prey fish and snails as a food source.\nAccording to Ben Boothy, who guides almost exclusively on the canals, there are other factors that contribute to the excessive sizes of canal fish, even if they don’t feed near salmon cages.\n“A client of mine caught a 23lb rainbow. Its stomach was packed full of freshwater snails. There’s a massive population of freshwater snails in the canals. One snail is about the size of half a thumb,” Ben says.\nWhether it’s eating snails or excess food from the salmon farm, the trout and occasional salmon in the canal are supercharged.\n“I find that anything that has a constant food source is always fully charged up. You will get a wee two to three pounder on the line and it will put up a huge fight. These fish have balls! Because of the constant food source these fish are almost in the same condition than other fish are in when they prepare for spawning. In other places, this only happens at a certain time of year, but here it is constant. ,” Ben says.\n“There’s a certain population that lives around the cages and grows fat. However, there’s also a population that doesn’t live anywhere near the cages and are still really big. I believe it’s because the canal system has created a tailwater type fishery. The lakes in the area all drain into the canals. This channels a constant source of food from the lakes to the canal connections, and fish simply sit below these sections and hoover up food. There are big populations at the top of canals that never move from the tailwater and they are large. I have found pods of over 100 fish in some areas,” Ben says.\nFish feeding in different areas will vary in size and look.\n“Fish that feed close to salmon cages may look like fat ‘blubberballs’, but big rainbow or browns that feed near dam inlets may be 25lb and look like a backcountry fish.\nFly Fishing Techiques at Tekapo Canal:\nAccording to Ben, “As the canals can be as deep as 36ft and 196ft at its’ widest, fishing it isn’t easy. (The canals are long. With Tekapo Canal alone stretching for about 16 miles).”\n“The trick is getting flies down as fish sit at the bottom of the canal to get out of the current. The water velocity is fast and a 3gm or 6mm tungsten nymph is key, there’s no way around it. I would rather use a heavy nymph than split shot,” Ben says.\nBen recommends a setup with a massive bomb on the sharp end of the line plus an egg, creeper or worm fly.\nHowever one can also use a single egg.\n“A dropper type system can create problems as some fish are so large that any second hook often attaches itself to a fishes’ body when you are fighting it. Lines and hooks then snap during a fight as angles of lines then become ‘all wrong’.\n“Using one egg limits things that can go wrong,” Ben says.\nFocusing on areas where lakes feed into canals is the most sure way to catch fish on the fly as that is where fish congregate for food sources.\n“Focusing on these areas meant we have had massive success. Just prospecting along the canal isn’t as efficient,” he says.\nWith the canal depths and speed fluctuating drastically between times of high and low electricity needs, one’s approach needs to be adjusted to conditions.\n“With low flow, there is more ‘access’ to fish, but because they see so much gear (especially spin gear) they are so much harder to catch. I like high flow, it gives fishless time to think and they just react and eat”.\nThe Czech Nymphing Approach:\nIn deeper sections a traditional fly approach can be effective, with a long 20ft leader and a massive indicator. In rocky sections where water is 9ft deep and very fast a Czech Nymphing approach may be better.\nHe recommends a heavyweight rod, as a light rod will extend a fight and hampers the chances of fish surviving.\n“Because the canal is mostly uniform we cast upstream and drift/walk down.”\nBen says one of the biggest mistakes he sees when someone tries to land a fish is when they get lead feet.\n“People stand still while they are trying to pull a fish. With a 25lb rainbow it’s impossible. You should fast walk down the canal while you fight. Like when chasing Tarpon or anything big, try and pull the head towards the tail and you will win.”\nWith the depth of the canals, sight fishing is not practical.\n“If you are sight fishing it means you are catching fish off the edges, which means you are probably pulling them off their spawning redds. Such fish are already tired and need to be brought in hard and fast, and released, otherwise you will often see them drifting belly up a few seconds after being released”.\nYoshi Nagawa’s Fly Fishing Techniques:\nYoshi Nagawa, Auckland based photographer and fly fishing guide says with talk of so many fishermen using spinning in the canals he needed to find out if fly fishing is possible there. Yoshi Czech Nymphs most of the time and believes this is also effective in the canals.\n“The canals are no different from normal rivers. You just have to adjust your mentality when you are there and find the right sections to fish,” Yoshi says.\n“Look for bends in the canal where you can see a current line. Target that. Any structure is also good, even a weed bed, fish will congregate there. Where lakes flow into the canals are also good. I don’t think in times of low flow it is effective to fish as you cannot get the fly moving. ” he says.\nYoshi fished edges where it isn’t too deep.\n“Target areas where the canals are no deeper than 6ft – 9ft. This means you can easily stay in contact with the bottom on Czech Nymph.\nHe says the takes in the canal are really subtle with no real ‘bang’, and he believes Czech Nymphing is ideal as one can feel the take and stay in contact with the bottom.\n“I suggest a tap tap tap (on the bottom) and lift. If you are not hitting bottom you are not fishing.”\nHe suggests an eye drop sinker or split shot that will get the fly down to the bottom where fish lie. He then uses either a natural and an egg, or two eggs.\n“It is important is to get the flies away from the sinker or split shot.”\n“A sinker or split shot on the bottom is actually quite noisy and fish seem to get annoyed by it. I also snapped my leader a few times when the fly was too close to the sinker. The first fly needs to be at least 3ft from the sinker/split shot, and the second fly at least 1ft away from the first fly. You could do hair and copper and an egg for example, but the water is somewhat murky and I don’t think the type of fly makes such a difference. Especially in the winter season spawning fish are very opportunistic and if they can see it they will eat it”.\nYoshi suggests a 6wt or 7wt 10ft rod. He managed to land a 24lb trout on a 5wt but says it was real ‘shitty’.\n“One doesn’t have control with smaller rods. Once fish take off and go to the other side of the canal you are screwed. They just sit at the bottom and you cannot get them up. For a tippet a 6lb or maybe 8lb is fine. For an expert a 6lb tippet is fine. The water is very mirky so fish won’t see the line”\nNymphing any deeper than 10ft means line management becomes difficult, Yoshi says.\n“Short to medium casts work. With too ‘long cast it’s a struggle to keep the line up.”\nSpin fisherman walk down the canals with the current but Kyoshi says he would mostly stay put in one place, cast a few times, and then move on and repeat.\n“The next thing I want to do is hit it in summer and sight fish with dry flies,” Yoshi says.\nIt’s a common misconception that the canals are for wintertime fishing only.\nWhen to Fish the Canals:\n“The best fishing is early in January when there are warmer temperatures.”\nBen believes early mornings are the best time to fish the canals.\n“It’s all driven by the electricity requirements. In the morning when everyone is getting out of bed you’ll find the toaster and kettle getting turned on, and at about 7:30 am the canal speeds up. The faster the water the better it is to fish. Fish have less time to think.”\nRegulations on the Tekapo Canal:\nAs of late the Tekapo Canal is open year-round, except for closure of spawning areas. Bag limit is 4 sportfish. Only two can be trout. All salmon must be over 11 inches long and only two salmon may be larger than 19 inches.\nThe scheme is not without some controversy. After the 2019 study, the CSI will close the upper half of the Tekapo Canal Fishery between 1 June to 31 August 2021. (Besides this closure the canals are open year-round). This is after concerns that fishing in the canals is not sustainable because of the large number of anglers.\nAccommodations and Travel:\nWhen it comes to accommodation when fishing the canal you have two one-horse towns to choose from. Twizel and Lake Tekapo. Lake Tekapo is closest but may be fully booked in season. Twizel is a 40 minute drive away. Both towns offer access to backcountry fly fishing, hiking and hunting. Queenstown airport is the closest airport. Have a look at road conditions for winter as it can snow heavily. I have had the most luck with AirBnB, as opposed to motel accommodation.\nArticle from Gerhard Uys be sure to follow along with his adventures at @lets_hope_the_weather_holds\nPhotos from Kiyoshi Nakagawa who hails from Japan but resides in Auckland, New Zealand these days.

{"question":"How do the organizational principles of Faustian agreements and cellular membranes compare in controlling exchanges?","answer":"Faustian agreements control exchanges by establishing specific terms where someone gives up something moral to receive a desired benefit, creating a structured transaction. Similarly, cellular membranes control exchanges through specific organizational principles - they regulate transport, detect signals, and enable cell-cell communication through carefully controlled membrane proteins and transport mechanisms. Both systems involve regulated exchanges, though membranes do so for biological purposes while Faustian deals do so for moral compromises.","context":["Something Faustian reminds you of Johann Faust, the real guy (and later, the guy from stories) who sold his soul to the devil.

Right before a noun, as in “a Faustian bargain.”\n2. After a linking verb, as in “The bargain was Faustian.”)\nHow to use it:\nWe almost always stick to a phrase like \"Faustian bargain,\" \"Faustian deal,\" \"Faustian exchange,\" \"Faustian pact,\" or \"Faustian agreement.\" Of course, they all basically mean the same thing: a bargain in which someone lowered their standards, compromised their morals, turned their back on their beliefs, broke their promises, or did something else equally terrible in order to get something really good, like success, recognition, or money.\nBut feel free to venture away from these phrases and talk about a Faustian situation or scenario, someone's Faustian journey, a Faustian dilemma or conflict, and so on.\nI strongly suspect that a Faustian bargain was struck between this company and the \"independent\" research team singing the praises of its products.\nThey finally escaped that Faustian nightmare; they'd been earning huge paychecks but were working themselves to death.\nLook away from the screen to explain the definition in your own words. You’ll know you understand what \"Faustian\" means when you can explain it without saying \"selling your soul\" or \"deal with the devil.\"\nThink of something immoral you would never do, even if it would bring you wealth or some type of success, and fill in the blanks: \"I would resist a Faustian urge to get (some type of reward) in exchange for (doing something bad.)\"\nExample: \"I would resist a Faustian urge to earn store credit in exchange for giving out my friends' contact information.\"\nSpend at least 20 seconds occupying your mind with the game and quote below.

{"question":"What are the similarities between how early news magazines used artistic direction and how current art courses teach color usage for marketing and design?","answer":"Early news magazines relied heavily on art directors to incorporate images into magazine layouts and craft unique visual styles for their publications, playing a critical role in the construction of visual news. Similarly, modern art courses like Color Image, Marketing and Design focus on understanding the effective use of colors for marketing and design purposes, recognizing how colors' physical and emotional aspects influence humans, often unconsciously.","context":["A History of Photography in the Press\nBy Thierry Gervais, Gaëlle Morel\nThe Making of Visual News sets out to show how photography has changed the way we read, report and sell the news. It investigates how photographs first became news images at the end of the nineteenth century and how magazines in the USA, the UK, France and Germany have put them to use ever since. Drawing on a wide selection of images, author Thierry Gervais (in collaboration with Gaëlle Morel) analyses news photographs in the context of their original presentation in print. Highly illustrated, the book contains 85 full colour magazine layouts and spreads, offering the reader a view of how photographs were and are used in print publications, including Life, Picture Post, the Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung and VU. It examines how photographs were employed to attract new readers throughout the twentieth century, arguing that photography was the main tool by which news editors sought to communicate the news and attract a broader readership. Looking beyond the roles of photographer and journalist, this study also highlights the contributions of picture editors and artistic directors; by commissioning photographs and incorporating images into magazine layouts, these figures played critical but often overlooked roles in the construction of visual news, even as they crafted unique styles for their publications. Charting changes in technology and reportage, as well as broader social and political histories, The Making of Visual News offers new insight into the history of photojournalism, making this an essential resource for students and scholars of photojournalism and the history of photography, media and culture.\nTable of Contents\nThe invention of the magazine (1843-1918)\nFrom a photograph\nThe halftone age\nThe role of the art director\nReflections of the war\nGeneral news magazines: European know-how (1919-1936)\nBerliner Illustrirte Zeitung before the war\nThe postwar German press: a competitive market\nPropagandist visual strategies\nA style for news magazines\nAn aesthetics of transparency\nVU: a photographic workshop\nNarrating the news\nThe Life model and the standardization of news magazines (1936-1976)\nFrom idea to actuality: the beginnings of Life\nDramatizing the news\nFrom the photographic essay to the pictorial essay\nChallenges to authority\nThierry Gervais is Assistant Professor at Ryerson University and Head of Research at the Ryerson Image Centre (RIC), Toronto, Canada.

Humans are surrounded by uncountable numbers of colors and influenced by those colors, often unconsciously. This course is designed to help students understand the diverse dimensions of color that are derived from color’s physical and emotional aspects. This course also investigates the effective use of colors for marketing and design, as well as for works of art. Fee: $150. Y. Ahn. 8:30 a.m. to noon.\nART W40 Artist Book Production . This course will introduce the design, production, and publication of Artist Books, concentrating on the book as an aesthetic object and a medium for content. Physical and conceptual elements of the artist book unfold through time and space. Aesthetic problem solving in bookmaking involves organizing conceptual, visual, physical, kinetic, and chronological transitions. Students will engage in developing content, three-dimensional construction and the integration of image and text. Course problems and solutions will result in the production of visually effective Artist Books. The study of hand made books from illustrated manuscripts to contemporary book art will introduce students to both traditional as well as innovative materials and binding techniques. Students will investigate both high and low technologies of reproducing imagery for the purpose of execution and publication. Bookmaking will occur both individually and collaboratively. The class will produce several limited edition publications. The majority of class time is spent in studio activity generating a minimum of eight artist books. Teaching methodology includes illustrated lectures, demonstrating materials and techniques, readings, critiques and field trips. An exhibition of works completed is anticipated. This course may fulfill an advance studio art course for Studio Art, BFA, & Art Education majors. This course may fulfill an elective for Art & Art History minors.

Art and Fashion explores the points of overlap between the history of art and the history of fashion from the Renaissance to the present. Class readings and discussions will be centered around five major themes: the mediation of the body, gender representations, style, the history of taste, and performance. This course may fulfill an elective for the Art History program. C. Hanson. 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.\nART W42 African American Art. This course surveys the history of African American art. While this history is too broad and rich to be treated conclusively during Interim, we will cover four main historical periods: Slavery/Reconstruction; The Harlem Renaissance; the Evolution of a Modern Black Aesthetic in the 1960s and 70s; and Contemporary Concerns. Beginning with the arrival of Africans in the Americas through the trans-Atlantic Slave Trade and continuing to the present, we will examine the intersection of folk and fine art traditions, continuities from Africa, appropriations of new materials, techniques, and forms, and the influence of events and movements like the Great Migration, the Civil Rights movement, and Pan-African Independence. Above all the course engages the role of the visual arts in constructing a vital, although by no means homogenous, cultural and politically resistant, voice and identity. This course may fulfill an elective in the Art History major. Fee: $20. E. Van Arragon. 8:30 a.m. to noon.\nART W60 Photography in New York . As an international center for contemporary art, New York City offers a unique educational opportunity to study visual art. Through discussions and visits with contemporary photographers, museum curators, collectors, and critics, students will learn about the production, display, collection, and promotion of contemporary photography. This course will focus on photography as an art commodity in contemporary culture. For ten days, students will visit various photography professionals. The class will visit the studios of working photographers in the city and have the privilege of touring facilities and observing work in progress. Talks with photography critics such as A. D. Coleman and museum curators at the International Center for Photography and the Museum of Modern Art will complement the photographer studio visits. Meetings will also be arranged with galleries specializing in photography and photography collectors. Students will be required to read selected writings from curators and critics and keep a journal of their experiences. Students will also study photographers who have focused on New York as their subject matter. New York City has inspired and fascinated many artists, and students will have ample opportunity to explore, discover and study this great American city. In addition to providing a tour of the city, students will tour historical and contemporary New York via the wonderful collection of photographic imagery from various photographers at the Museum of the City of New York. In response to their New York experience, students will produce a body of photographic images. The instructor will provide individual critiques of both artwork and journal.

The task of all creative visual communications is to interpret problems in a personal way while meeting the needs of other people. Using Adobe Illustrator's vector graphics in the classroom, innovative problems that dictate challenging solutions help students achieve this goal. Problems & Solutions consists of original visual communication problems which emphasize developing a conceptual approach to problem solving. The problems in this course encourage students to carefully examine the transition from conceptualization to execution. Emphasis will be on concept rather than on software dexterity with the intent of developing genuine interest in one’s craft. These problems also encourage students to believe in their ability to successfully communicate with images in a rapidly changing technological context. Problems represent opportunities that allow for growth. Solutions represent an interpretation of a problem from an individual point of view at a particular stage of one’s development. Focus will be on the integration of online resources, framal reference, positive/negative relationships and cropping techniques in order to engender innovative visual communication skills.

{"question":"When was acrylic paint first developed and who created it?","answer":"Acrylic paint was first developed in 1934 by the chemical company BASF in Germany, who created the first usable acrylic dispersion. Between 1946-1949, Sam Golden and Leonard Bocour developed 'Magna Paints', which were Mineral Spirit Acrylic paints. In 1953, Otto Rohm developed an improved acrylic resin, and subsequently, the first two ranges of acrylic emulsion artist paints were created by Jose L. Gutierrez (Politec Artist Acrylics) and Henry Levinson (Liquitex paints).","context":["This Acrylic Painting Guide aims to give a broad overview of some useful and interesting information about working in this medium.\nList of Contents\nWhat Makes Acrylic Paint so Special?\nFor reliability and versatility, it’s hard to beat acrylic. No other kind of paint offers as much variety of texture or room for customisation – there’s a formula for every application, and no end to the mediums available. Bright, consistent and smooth, it’s the colour of choice for artists such as Lichtenstein and Hockney, and should be considered by any artist wanting to produce equally vibrant work. It’s great for mixed media artists, with a water-mixable formula that adheres to many surfaces and creates a stable ground for almost all wet and dry media. Plus, with no solvents required for painting or clean-up, it’s a convenient choice for those painting at home.\nWhat Is the Difference Between All the Different Types of Acrylic Paint Available?\nThe thickness of acrylic is often referred to as ‘body’. Professional and artist grade paints often come in several different formulas with different applications. Consistency is no indication of quality – the difference arises from the formulation of the binder, not the amount of pigment in the paint. The type of acrylic paint that’s best for you will be determined by the techniques and surfaces you plan on using.\nHeavy Body paints, as the name suggests, are the thickest and heaviest of the lot – they’re also the most popular. With a texture similar to soft butter, they’re the closest to oil paints in handling and retain brush marks and gestures well. They also hold their own on rougher canvases.\nSoft Body paints are smoother, resembling yoghurt in consistency. This makes them ideal for mixing with mediums, while retaining enough thickness to paint smoothly and responsively on their own.\nFluid paints have a texture like double cream. Supplied in a bottle, they are perfect for smooth brushing or staining effects and are great for glazes and finely detailed work.\nAcrylic Ink is the most fluid of the acrylic paints. It is made of super fine pigments suspended in a state of the art acrylic emulsion that is as fluid as water. Acrylic Ink is intensely coloured and dries with a soft gloss finish. It can be applied using airbrush, pen or brush. This is the consistency of acrylic used to fill empty marker pens. Airbrush Acrylics are very similar to Acrylic ink, but are less likely to clog or impair the flow within airbrush equipment.\nOpen paints are formulated to dry very slowly, making it easy to paint wet-into-wet and blend colour on the surface of your painting. They’re a great solution for painters who want to incorporate techniques usually only possible with oils.\nInteractive acrylics are a regular fast drying artist quality acrylic, however, within the range is a truly unique ‘unlocking formula’, a liquid that re-wets dried interactive acrylic and slows drying if a few drops are added to the paint while still wet. When work is completely finished the Fast Medium/Fixer will seal the layer of paint – once this is done the paint is no longer unlockable.\nAcrylic Gouache is creamy with a velvety matt finish. The paint levels brush marks and is particularly popular among illustrators. If you’re looking to paint blocks of flat colour then gouache might be worth a try. Most acrylic gouache isn’t rewettable once it’s dry (although the Lascaux acrylic gouache is rewettable if you let the water sit for a little while). Not to be confused with regular gouache, which is easily rewettable, watersoluble and is essentially an opaque watercolour.\nAcrylic Markers are bright, bold, acrylic paint marker pens, perfect for those wishing to combine painting and drawing techniques. Acrylic markers are designed to be high covering, fast drying, water and abrasion proof. They’ll make their mark even on already brightly coloured or painted surfaces and will adhere to most surfaces, from metal to paper.\nAcrylic Spray paint allows you to apply thin layers of bold colour onto a multitude of surfaces. Some acrylic sprays contain solvent – for these it is advisable to wear a fume mask or spray in well ventilated spaces. Some other sprays are water based and do not emit heady fumes, so are safe to use indoors. The low pressure handling system offered by some of the ranges allows you to control your applications of colour more carefully – it’s possible to draw fine lines as well as broad splodges of colour with the right amount of pressure. Exciting to use on their own or alongside other acrylics such as markers and regular paint.\nAll brands and formulas are intermixable, so if something unusual catches your eye there’s nothing stopping you giving it a try!\nReturn to top of page\nIs it Worth Paying More for Professional Grade Paints?\nThe great thing about all the different types of acrylic paint available is that you can mix heavy body with soft body paint to create a consistency that falls between the two, or Open Acrylic with something faster drying to create a paint that dries just a little slower than regular acrylic. You are in full control of the sheen, drying times and fluidity of your paint, and then when you start to think about adding mediums into the mix you’ll realise that the possibilities are almost limitless.\nPaints are graded according to their quality:\nProfessional are the best quality grade. Characterised by the use of the highest quality pigments and resins, tubes will contain less binder than in other grades. This makes for bright, clean colour with characteristics defined by the pigments used – qualities such as texture, drying times, opacity and staining capacity vary from colour to colour. For experienced painters or limited palettes they’re an exciting experience, but for those new to painting the variations in handling can prove challenging.\nArtist grade often use the same pigments as professional paints, but in more affordable proportions. This is normally achieved by increasing the amount of binder in each colour, which makes for good quality paints whose properties are more uniform from colour to colour than is true in professional paints. The characteristics of the pigments in each paint are muted a little (factors such as transparency, natural sheen, drying times, staining capacity etc) as the greater amounts of other ingredients (fillers and binders) mask them.\nStudent grade have the lowest pigment to binder ratio, and a uniformity of fluidity and gloss within each range. Fillers and mediums are used to extend the pigments and add bulk, which means student equivalents of professional colours often display increased transparency or lower saturation. Opaque colours often appear chalkier than higher grade equivalents because of the fillers that are added. However, if you’re sticking to a budget, you can still make some great work with student paints.\nWithin higher grade ranges of paint there are usually a number of price bands (known as ‘series’) that reflect the cost of manufacture (some pigments are more expensive than others). The lower grade ranges of paint tends to have fewer price bands.\nA Brief History of Acrylic Paint\nThe acrylic paint story dates back to 1934 when the chemical Company BASF in Germany developed the first usable acrylic dispersion (a formula of acrylic resin, pigment particles and water). Combining the qualities of both oil and watercolour, the discovery of how to make a rich paint that could be thinned with water was a groundbreaking advancement in the world of fine art materials. Between 1946-1949, American Paint-maker Sam Golden (who 30 years later would become the founder of Golden Artist Paints) and his uncle the artist Leonard Bocour developed ‘Magna Paints’. These were Mineral Spirit Acrylic paints; pigment ground into acrylic resin that is diluted in solvent. So while the binder is acrylic based the paints still require thinning in solvent (just as with Mineral Spirit Acrylic Varnish). MSA paint possesses impressive vibrancy and a much glossier finish to modern acrylic paints, and when they were first made were popular among artists such as Morris Louis, Barnett Newman and Roy Lichtenstein.\nIn 1953 Otto Rohm of the German Chemical Company Rohm and Haas developed an acrylic resin especially well suited to paint manufacture. The amalgamation of compounds including acrylic and methacrylic acids ensured a number of beneficial characteristics, such as better staining protection, greater water resistance when dry, better adhesion to surfaces, better resistance to cracking and blistering in abrasive weather conditions as well as resistance to yellowing when exposed to sunlight. Later in the same year the production of 2 brand new acrylic paint ranges began; In Mexico Jose L. Gutierrez began producing ‘Politec Artist Acrylics’ while in the United States Henry Levinson of the Permanent Pigments Co. started the manufacture of Liquitex paints – these are the very first 2 ranges of acrylic emulsion artists paints to have come into existence!\nAt the very beginning these water-based acrylic paints were sold as latex house paints, but very soon afterwards artists and fine art paint-makers wanted in on the act and began to explore the potential of acrylic binders and their most attractive feature -that they could be formulated to pretty much any degree of viscosity.\nHow are Acrylic Paints Made?\nPigments are less dense than water, and if you try to mix them together it doesn’t usually work; the pigment sits on the surface of the water and can stick together in lumps. In order to begin the process of making acrylic paint an acrylic dispersant is added and the mixture is blended together – the even consistency means the colour is uniform and more vibrant. Once the mix is perfectly blended the following additives are added to the paint:\nInitiators to initiate the polymerisation process (the joining together of all the acrylic particles in the paint to make a continuous film – in other words, the drying process), even at room temperature.\nBuffers such as ammonia which help to maintain a pH balance of between 8-10 which is essential for the stability of the paint (and therefore its long term durability).\nSurfactants and protective colloids provide long term particle stabilisation and particle formation (these help with the drying process).\nDefoamers counterbalance the foaming properties of the surfactants.\nPreservatives to protect against the growth of microorganisms (necessary for long term durability of the paint).\nThickeners and rheology modifiers are added to achieve the desired thickness and flow properties.\nStabilisers to prevent the freezing of a waterborne paint; if paint froze its dispersion would be impaired and the structure of the paint damaged.\nHow Acrylic Paints Dry\nAcrylic emulsions are made from all the ingredients listed above, blended with pigment and water. During the drying process, the water evaporates and as it does so the spherical polymer particles are drawn closer together. Eventually, the particles meld together to form a honeycomb structure. A coalescing solvent additive ensure that the polymer particles remain malleable during and after the drying process, which makes the best possible compaction of particles possible even after all the water has evaporated. Once all the water has evaporated and the film feels solid and dry it is said to be ‘continuous’, however when looked at under a microscope it is likely to still possess some porosity. Porosity increases when paint dries in very cold conditions as the slower rate of drying and the deficit of energy prevents the particles from drawing sufficiently close to one another. Another cause of a greater degree of porosity is if foaming occurs in the paint. Pores will often trap conservation cleaning agents which may cause long term damage to a painting over time. A layer of varnish can help prevent these issues from occurring.\nWhile you’re trying out your new colours, it’s good to be aware of the mediums that are available to you. A medium is something added to a paint to change its properties – to thicken or thin it, to change the rate it dries at, to add texture, and plenty more besides. If your paint isn’t behaving quite as you want it to there’ll be a medium out there to help.\nAltering body is normally done with gels, pastes, flow enhancers or fluid mediums. If you just need to thin your paint a little you can use water, but if you use too much it may break down the structure of your paint too much making it brittle when dry. Drastic changes of consistency are best achieved with flow enhancers or fluid mediums, which maintain the paint’s ability to form a sturdy film when drying. Gels and pastes increase the body of paint in slightly different ways – pastes tend to add bulk and are often opaque, whereas gels are viscous and clear. Regular gel is the same consistency as heavy body acrylic paint and will extend colour without thinning the body while heavy gel and extra heavy gel will add bulk.\nAltering drying time is a handy trick to be aware of, particularly if you’re just starting out and aren’t so confident with your mark making. Adding a little retarder to your paint will give you more time to work with it, increasing what is called its ‘open’ time. Golden Open Acrylics are designed to be workable for longer without adding retarder (and it has a consistency that falls somewhere between heavy body and fluid paints).\nAltering the texture of your paint can really spark creativity – from a stringy gel and expressive drips to a sandy grit that’ll let you use pastels on top of your work, there’s no end to the textures possible with acrylic paint. Available in wet or dry formats, there are simply too many options available to mention them all here!\nFor an in-depth look at acrylic mediums, read our comparison of Golden’s extensive range of acrylic mediums and additives.\nVarnishing Acrylic Paintings\nMany painters see varnishing their work as part of the painting process, rather than just the ‘finishing touch’. Varnishes are available in gloss, matt and satin (satin can also be made by mixing gloss and matt varnishes).\nWhat varnish can I use?\nVarnish will protect your painting as well as unify the sheen. All fine art varnishes are suitable for varnishing your acrylic painting. Acrylic varnishes are made of polymer resins dissolved in acrylic emulsion and are the fastest drying of the lot. Solvent-based varnishes are slow drying and made of natural resins dissolved in solvent – the matt versions have an added matting agent. Mineral Spirit Acrylic varnish is made from synthetic resins dissolved in mineral spirit. The synthetic resin used in MSA varnish has been specially developed to ensure that it does not yellow over time – something that natural resins like dammar can be prone to do.\nHow should I varnish my acrylic painting?\nA much more informative resumé of things to keep in mind when varnishing an acrylic painting can be found in our Varnishing Acrylic Paintings post, however below is a brief summary:\nYour painting needs to be clean and completely dry before you varnish it. An isolation coat made of 2 parts soft gel and one part water will allow you to remove and reapply layers of varnish in the future without damaging the painting. Keep the work in a dust-free environment; you may want to wipe it with a damp clean rag and allow it to dry just before you varnish to get rid of any possible dust or dirt on the surface. Use a clean soft varnishing brush and apply your varnish in thin even layers. It’s worth adopting a technique to ensure that you don’t go over already varnished areas (raking light can help you see where is shiny and where isn’t). Once the varnish has reached the ‘tacky’ stage of the drying process you’ll be able to lean your painting against a wall, painting side inwards, to prevent dust settling on the wet varnish, without the varnish from running (so long as it’s been applied thinly). Once the layer has dried you’ll be able to apply another layer. As ever, several thin even layers always produces better results than one thick layer.\nReturn to top of page\nLinks to materials at Jackson’s\n- The Four Viscosities of Acrylic Paint\n- Painting with Acrylic on Top of Gold Leaf\n- Acrylic Painting Surfaces for Experimentation\nThis is an updated version of an original post published on 21st September 2017"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:48adb8b1-ac90-45c4-bfd1-9c44ab044495>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the causes of muscle atrophy, and what electrical stimulation treatments can be used to address it?","answer":"Muscle atrophy has several causes, including disuse of muscles from a lazy lifestyle, cachexia (body wasting syndrome) common in cancer and AIDS patients, and neurogenic causes from nerve damage due to conditions like strokes, diabetic neuropathy, and Lou Gehrig's disease. For treatment, two types of electrical stimulation are used: Electromuscular Stimulation (EMS) of low voltage for denervated muscles with peripheral nerve damage, and Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) therapy, which is non-invasive and helps reduce pain while stimulating muscles. TENS works by sending tiny electrical impulses through the skin to modify pain perception, while EMS sends low-frequency electric pulses that cause gentle muscle contractions to passively exercise the muscles and increase blood flow.","context":["Muscle atrophy, also commonly referred to as muscle loss or muscle wasting. It is a condition characterized by a gradual loss of one’s muscle mass in the body. This loss always leads to the infected exhibiting severe weakness due to their poor muscle condition. The appearance also changes as the body shrinks in and they seem to be wasted.\n- 1 Muscle atrophy causes\n- 2 Muscle atrophy Treatment – Procedures\nMuscle atrophy causes\nThere are several causes for muscle atrophy most of which are related to poor lifestyles. However, of its many causes, disuse of muscles is the main cause. By living a lazy lifestyle whereby one does not use their muscles on a regular basis, the muscle mass tends to reduce gradually. As a matter of fact, most of the people suffering from atrophy have been found to live a dormant life. Astronauts are also known to be highly prone to muscle loss due to the lack of gravity in space which means their muscles are more of inactive. Zero gravity means the body does not strain at all hence laxity of the muscles.\nThe body wasting syndrome, commonly referred to as cachexia, is another popular cause of muscle atrophy. It is quite common among people suffering from conditions such as cancer, AIDS or any other sort of chronic disease. In such cases, the medications given for the diseases tend to weaken the body leading to muscle loss. The condition in itself is another agent of atrophy considering its several negative effects on the patient’s body.\nMuscle atrophy can be defined as the deterioration or loss of muscle tissue. It is a common human condition yet little is known about the causes. In order to understand the causes of muscle atrophy, it is important to first understand the physiology of the loss of muscle. Recently researchers from the University of Iowa determined that a single protein called GAdd45a is responsible for about 40% of genetic activity that causes skeletal muscle atrophy by reprogramming genetic content of the muscle cells leading to change in the shape of the nucleus.\nMuscle Atrophic changes have recently been differentiated into three categories: Muscle wasting, cachexia and sarcopenia. Muscle Wasting is the unintentional weight loss, including fat and fat-free components. Wasting occurs mostly due to inadequacies in ones diet. Cachexia refers to loss of the fat-free mass especially the body cell mass. This occurs with little or no weight loss and is commonly associated with hyper metabolism. Sarcopenia on the other hand refers to loss of muscle mass specifically, and seems to be an intrinsic, age related condition. It may occur due to gradual failure of cells that aid regeneration of muscle fibers \nDifference between Neurogenic Muscle atrophy and Disuse Muscle atrophy\nMuscle atrophy occurs in two forms; neurogenic atrophy, which is the most severe, is caused by an injury or disease to the nerve that sends impulses to the muscle. Neurogenic atrophy is normally sudden. Another type of atrophy, disuse atrophy is due to lack of physical activity. Inactivity of one’s limbs may eventually result into loss of muscle tone. For instance, extended bed rest due to an illness or a sedentary lifestyle could result in very little use of the muscle. This type of atrophy can is reversible if a patient takes up better exercise and nutrition\nMuscle atrophy can result from these common diseases\n- Muscle atrophy Disease conditions ranging from cancer AIDs congestive heart failure renal failure, severe burns.\n- Inadequate dietary intake or malnutrition which causes progressive weakening resulting in inability to use the muscles.\n- Aging: Elderly people normally lose their ability to maintain muscle function and mass.\n- Injury, such as a broken arm or leg that must be immobilized\n- Dermatomyositis which is a skin condition characterized by inflammation of the skin and muscle.\n- Muscular dystrophy which includes a group of muscle weakening disorders causing progressive loss of muscle and muscle weakness due to deterioration of muscle cells and death of muscle tissue.\n- Arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are known to cause joint inflammation making mobility difficult. Pain associated with arthritis may cause patients to become sedentary leading to muscle wasting.\n- Multiple sclerosis may also cause disuse atrophy due to weakness of certain limbs and inability to use them.\n- Autoimmune diseases e.g. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis(ALS) also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, Guillain -Barre syndrome, are diseases affecting the brain impulses from the muscle.\n- Injuries, particularly neck and spinal cord injuries may cause compression of the nerves supplying certain thus interrupting nerve function. Examples include herniated disc or carpal tunnel syndrome.\n- Diabetic Neuropathy, a common complication of diabetes causes nerve damage due to high blood sugar levels.\n- Alcohol myopathies: Alcohol misuse may cause malfunction of muscle fibres leading to atrophy.\n- Multiple sclerosis is a degenerative disease affecting the brain and spinal cord causing weakness in coordination may cause brain and cerebral atrophy due to demyelization and destruction of nerve cells.\n- Stroke: Atrophy may occur in stroke due to a combination of nerve damage, disuse and inflammation of the affected muscle.\nUpon diagnosis of the underlying cause of muscle atrophy, initiation of a treatment plan is necessary to reverse the atrophy, as well as reduce th\nThere is also what medical practitioners refer to as neurogenic muscle atrophy. This kind of atrophy is that which is caused by damage to the nervous system. There are several conditions that can lead to this kind of atrophy. Some of the popular ones include the likes of strokes, diabetic neuropathy, Lou Gehrig’s condition and the all too popular osteoarthritis. Muscle atrophy is actually a symptom of these conditions. Since most of the individuals suffering from these conditions cannot work out, the only viable remedy is stimulation of nerves using electrical means. This is done to the affected regions of the body once in a while. Electrical nerve stimulation is also commonly used on people who are stuck in wheel chairs to maintain the muscle tone in good shape.\nMuscle atrophy prognosis\nThough rare, there are cases where atrophy of the muscles comes abruptly without any cause. If this happens, the best thing to do is visit your doctor at the soonest possible. A course of treatment can be established in order to build back your muscles. The bottom line either way is that muscle atrophy is caused by two main factors:\n- An inactive lifestyle\n- Serious body problems\nIf not dealt at the earliest, muscle atrophy worsens and in very severe cases might even lead to death. It is therefore vital that one seeks medical help urgently for proper treatment. Muscle atrophy tends to render its victims susceptible to other body conditions to the weak state it leaves the body in. Most of the patients end up bedridden. Prevention is always better than cure either way. Maintain a quality lifestyle and avoid such a condition.\nMuscle atrophy Treatment – Procedures\nMuscle atrophy Treatment may vary significantly and is dependent on the type of muscle atrophy one is suffering from\nThe quality of life of patients with muscle atrophy decreases as they are unable to perform many normal tasks that are mandatory for daily living. Their risks for accidental injury is even higher when they perform certain tasks.\nOther factors affecting the choice of treatment may include length of time on has suffered, the presence of other accompanying symptoms. Muscle atrophy may be reversible. Various treatment plans available are:\n- Physical therapy programs\n- Electrical Stimulation\nMuscle atrophy treatment with Physical therapy\nDisuse atrophy is normally corrected with physical exercise programs. Exercise is aimed at strengthening the affected muscles and restoring as much normal function as possible .The key is to use the affected muscles as frequently as possible to avoid wasting.\nThe physical therapy program employed may depend on the underlying cause of atrophy, extent of atrophy and location of the atrophied muscle. It involves increasing the range of motion for the affected joint and improving the stability of the joint. Routine progressive exercises are done with the assistance of a physical therapist. As the patient improves, more challenging resistive exercises are added.\nMusculoskeletal manipulations are done in case of neurogenic atrophy to reduce nerve compression .This procedure normally done by a chiropractor, involves stretching the spinal column to relieve pressure on compressed nerves.\nWith proper physical exercise as muscle atrophy treatment, muscle atrophy from disuse may recover within 12 weeks. Severely bed ridden patients may fail to completely reverse the effects of the atrophy.\nMuscle atrophy treatment medication\nIn order to reduce inflammation and compression of affected nerves, doctors may give a course of anti inflammatory medication to patients with neurogenic atrophy particularly for patients with autoimmune disorders. Anabolic steroids are commonly administered to patients for treatment of severe muscle atrophy.\nMuscle wasting that occurs due to inadequacies in protein diet or absence of certain muscle building amino acid s may be treated by amino acid therapy. Amino acid therapy may facilitate the regeneration of damaged tissue.\nResearch is ongoing about use of a class of drugs referred to as Selective Adrenergic Receptor modulators (SARM) to enhance muscle and tissue growth in patients with muscle atrophy .\nMuscle atrophy treatment – Is Surgery helpful ?\nWhen atrophy occurs as a result of contractures caused by severe burns, surgery is performed to correct the contractures. This may be followed by extensive rehabilitation involving physical therapy. Conditions such as herniated discs also require surgical intervention.\nMuscle atrophy treatment – Electrical Stimulation\nElectro muscular stimulation (EMS) of low voltage has been used to stimulate denervated muscles where nerve damage is peripheral \nTranscutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) therapy is another non invasive technique used for muscle atrophy treatment for patients who have pain along with the atrophy. It is placed on ones skin over the affected muscle and it elicits a sensory effect of decreased pain or a muscular effect through changes of intensity, frequency and pulse of the current .\nTreatment options may be limited for incurable and progressive diseases but pain management and mechanical aids to make activities of daily living easier are part of the current advancements in medicine.\nMuscle Atrophy Treatment with exercises\nFor many years exercise therapy has been effectively used as a treatment for patients with muscle atrophy .Recovering muscle after atrophy is possible and requires the guidance of a physical therapist. It is important to consider the underlying reason for the atrophy. There are no standard exercises that have been developed for muscle atrophy treatment and prescribed exercises are normally customized to the patient.\nBefore starting an exercise regime, it is important to carry out a thorough assessment of the patient’s capabilities, perform certain investigations in order to determine the kind of therapy required. These may include:\n- Measures of motor function\n- Head to toe physical exam\n- Exercise capacity tests which may involve riding a stationary bicycle or walking in the fastest way possible within a specified period of time.\nThe aim of physical activity in muscle atrophy treatment is both preventive and curative. Disuse atrophy which occurs in persons with sedentary lifestyles may affect those sitting in offices for long periods of time. With this in mind, Many exercises have been developed that can be performed in a sitting position. Systems have been developed such as the use of fitness balls to replace office chairs in the office setting. It is believed that Fitness balls automatically tone the muscles in the back, hips, shoulders and abdomen. A study conducted in 2012 in the USA (2) revealed that office workers who used fitness balls instead of office chairs had improved muscle activity in the leg muscles.\nThe following are examples of simple exercise to help in preventing muscle for people who have to sit for long hours :\n- Knee extensions that target the thigh muscles and the calf muscles. They involve repeatedly extending legs slowly in a sitting position.\n- Contractions of the quadriceps: This is another exercise targeting the front thigh muscles. This is performed by sitting with legs extended and the knees straightened while heels touching the floor. The quadriceps are then tightened and held for about ten seconds.\n- Shin strengtheners are also performed while sitting. These are done by flexing ones toes while pointed upwards. This movement is repeated about 10 times. Some weight may be placed on top of the feet as it is done.\n- Another exercise, the inner thigh squeeze, which is performed by placing a small ball between one’s knees and pressing them together for a few seconds. Resistance is felt in the inner thighs.\nFor elderly persons, certain simple exercises such as the ones below are often prescribed:\n- Squeezing of a tennis balls with one’s hand may help to increase and strengthen grip\n- Use of small dumbbells to perform chest presses\n- Walking: A simple walking program may reverse the effects of atrophy in elderly patients. It is recommended that one takes 30 minutes walk three times a week.\n- Aquatic therapy has been used for a number of years now. The use of water reduces the effects of gravity and makes exercises easier.\nPatients with Spinal Muscle atrophy may benefit from assistive devices that may help them perform functional tasks. Exercises that cause excessive fatigue should be avoided, particularly in patients whose respiratory function is compromised. Close monitoring and use of oximetry is necessary.\nIn order to maximize the effects of exercises for Muscle atrophy treatment and regain muscle, a multi disciplinary approach is necessary. Nutritional needs of a patient are important and should be met. An increase protein intake aids the rebuilding of muscle.\nMuscle atrophy treatment recommended diet\nDiet after muscle atrophy should focus primarily on muscle rebuilding and preventing further muscle atrophy. The most popular consensus is –“rebuilding a muscle requires predominantly protein diet”. This statement is partially true and shows only half the nutritional aspect that you need to incorporate in your diet as muscle also require carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins and fat for its survival. So the diet in muscular atrophy should be balanced with increased intake to protein to assist muscle growth.\nYour diet must include lean proteins and complex carbohydrates in addition to other vitamins, minerals and fats necessary for muscle build-up. For lean protein Fish is the best source for muscle atrophy treatment as this is lower in saturated fat and has high amount of omega-3-fatty acids, a type of fat that is beneficial to your health. Other sources of Lean protein include Chicken, Turkey, Beef, Eggs, Beans, Peas, Lentils and Low fat dairy products (Saturated fats have been removed from low fat dairy products and they are a good source of Calcium and Vitamin D).\nComplex carbohydrates are like necklace of simple sugar molecules; they digest slowly and maintain sugar level stable for longer duration. For complex carbohydrates look forward to including vegetables in your diet. Good source of complex carbohydrate vegetables are Spinach (and other green vegetables), Asparagus, Kale and rough mushrooms. These vegetables are also a good source of other vitamins and minerals and their high fiber content create a sense of fullness of stomach. Other good sources of complex carbs are Whole grains and Fruits. Like vegetables, fruits are also a good source for a variety of minerals and vitamins and variety of fruits consumed is more important than quantity. Whole grain foods include Pasta, Oatmeal and whole grain breads.\nVitamins needed to reverse muscle atrophy primarily include Vitamin E and Vitamin D. Vitamin E has antioxidant property and prevents the muscle against oxidative damage and correcting its deficiency can correct muscle atrophy in certain cases. Good source of Vitamin E for muscle atrophy treatment include Wheat germ oil, Sunflower oil, Safflower oil, Almonds, Spinach and lesser amounts are also found in Mangoes, Papayas and Tomatoes. As for Vitamin D, it plays a significant role in muscle build up and maintaining muscle strength and its supplementation in diet can be very helpful in reversing the effects of muscle atrophy. The best sources of vitamin D are Sunlight, Salmon, Tuna, Milk, Cereal, Pork, Eggs, Mushrooms, Beef liver and Ricotta cheese.\nMineral needed to be supplemented in diet after muscle atrophy predominately should include Selenium and Copper apart from others that are a part of balanced diet for complete growth. Selenium plays role in activating a range of enzymes and maintaining healthy muscles. Good source of Selenium include Nuts (esp. Brazil Nuts), Shellfish, Liver, Sunflower oil, Wheat, Rice, Oat, Lobsters, Crabs and Shrimps.\nChronic failure to include copper in diet can affect the muscular system and its supplementation in diet can help muscle build up after muscular atrophy. Good sources of copper include Liver, Oysters, Sesame seeds, Cocoa powder and chocolates, Sunflower oil, Calamari, lobsters, Sun dried tomatoes and dried herbs.\nYou may also be interested in reading:\n1.

{"question":"What are the specific rules around quoting copyrighted work? How can someone legally use portions of copyrighted material?","answer":"Others can quote copyrighted work as long as they give full credit to the original author. The quoted passage should appear offset in quotation marks to clearly show which words belong to someone other than the current author. This is referred to as a 'reference' or 'citation.' However, it's important to be careful about who you let read or receive copies of your text, as not everyone follows citation rules as carefully as they should, and copyright enforcement isn't comprehensive.","context":["Things you might like to know about copyright\nYou may be under the false impression that before you can get your text published, you must “get the copyright” to your own written material. You might also think that in order to get the copyright, you must “apply” for it. This is just not so. In the following few paragraphs, I’ll give you some simple facts about copyrights that may help you in your quest to get published.\nFirst, it is important to understand that you cannot “copyright” an idea; you can only copyright what you have written. That is, you might have just written the greatest self-help manual on how to breed guppies. And you did, indeed, file for your copyright with the Library of Congress. Three weeks after completing the formal copyrighting process, you find out that the manager of your neighborhood pet store (where you’ve been buying your guppies) has just sold the TV rights to a new hit show “Breeding Guppies” and he is using many of the same principles that you’ve outlined in your manual on how to go about guppy breeding.\nSo, naturally, since this is the 21st Century and you live in America, you want to sue the guy. You think you have a sure thing, and you are dreaming of the million-dollar award that the jury is sure to give you. But you’d better not put a down payment on that Guppy Farm in Iowa just yet.\nThe manual you wrote, the exact words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and chapters that you wrote, belong to you. It is illegal for anyone to reproduce or use any of that text, in part or in whole, for profit without your permission. However, you must be able to prove that your exact words have been stolen before you can get an award for copyright infringement. So, you know that guy with his hit TV series? Well, unless he’s reading from your manual word-for-word, or attempting to sell your manual as a supplemental text that he’s written, then he’s probably doing nothing illegal. He’s just using the idea of breeding guppies.\nYou do “own” the copyright to your text, all its words and clever phrases. And you don’t even have to file with the Library of Congress in order to have the copyright on your text. The copyright is conferred upon you the minute you write your New York Times Bestseller. All you have to do is be able to prove, beyond any doubt, the date that you wrote the material. For your protection, then, it is wise to print and date your material, and establish with a third party through a written communication that you have just finished your text. At that time, you can legally affix the copyright symbol (the letter c inside a circle) to your work.\nNow here’s where a formal copyright comes in. By filing with the Library of Congress (and paying them their required application fee), you can establish definitively a date of copyright that will stand up in any court of law. Any judge or jury will defer to your date over someone else who can merely claim by word of mouth that his text came before yours. It’s a good idea to formally copyright any text that you are planning to market. So, if you’re convinced that the world population-at-large is in desperate need of “Breeding Guppies, What Every Ichthyologist Needs to Know” and you plan to sell it on Ebay for $19.95, you should apply for a formal copyright.\nJust having the copyright, however, doesn’t mean that other people can’t quote your work. They may do so, as long as you are given full credit for having written it prior to their use. This is called a “reference” or a “citation” and generally, whatever passage is being quoted will appear offset in quotation marks (so that the reader can visualize which words belong to someone other than the author of the text in which the quote appears). Of course, at present the contingent of Copyright Police is not up to tracking down every single instance of copyright infringement, and chances are that not everyone cites original authors as scrupulously as they should, so beware of whom you casually let look at or read your text (or to whom you give a copy).\nCopyrights are not forever. Typically, a copyright lasts for 50 years past the natural life of the original author. Authors’ heirs may sometimes re-apply for copyrights, but generally written texts that are this old are considered “public domain” and may be reproduced without paying the author’s family a royalty fee.\nIn the publishing world, you will find that many publications require that you relinquish your copyrights to the work in return for having your work published. This is a fairly standard procedure – unless your name happens to be Stephen King or Danielle Steele. Once you’ve relinquished your copyright to a given work, you can not sell or submit that text again unless you get express approval from the publisher that now owns the copyright.\nThere are sites on the World Wide Web where you can post your work for others to read or use as they see fit, so-called “free sites.” In cases such as this, there should be a disclaimer that anyone who uses or reproduces your work must give you full credit. Whether this happens all the time is certainly a matter for some speculation, but your safeguard is that you own the copyright and if you find that someone is profiting from your work and that you have not been compensated, you can file a copyright infringement suit against them.\nAll the instructions and necessary forms can be found on U.S. Copyright Office‘s web site. I have copyrighted several texts and advise that you mail your application with a “Return Receipt Requested” from the U.S. Post Office. This is your proof that the Copyright Office has received your copyright application.\nAlso see: What is copyleft?\nBy Jan K., The Proofer, full-time freelance proofreader and copyeditor.

{"question":"What are impacts of temperature changes on manure storage versus crop production?","answer":"In manure storage, higher temperatures, particularly in late summer, increase the rate of carbon conversion into methane gas under anaerobic conditions. For crop production, the impacts of temperature increase are more severe. While warmer temperatures may initially benefit some crops in certain regions, if temperatures exceed a crop's optimal level, yields will likely fall. Beyond 2030, negative impacts on crop productivity will become increasingly severe in all regions. By the 2080s, global agricultural productivity is expected to decline by about 16% without carbon fertilization effects. The impacts are particularly severe in developing countries, which could suffer losses of 21% without carbon fertilization effects, compared to 6% losses in industrial countries.","context":["How do you manage dairy manure storage to reduce methane emissions?\nExpert tip: If you want more information about a specific practice, click the link!\nThe short answer: Your farm can decrease methane emissions by reducing the amount of carbon-rich solids in your manure storage (particularly in summer) and by investing in technologies to capture or inhibit methane generation.\nBreak it down: When dairy manure is stored in a liquid or slurry storage, the oxygen-free (anaerobic) conditions result in the conversion of carbon in the manure into methane gas. The rate of this conversion is highest in late summer when manure temperatures are at their hottest. So, consider these strategies to reduce the amount of carbon-rich solids in your manure storage.\n- Get more manure out: Work with a certified nutrient management specialist to maximize the way you utilize your manure resources.\n- Separate manure solids before storage: Solid-liquid separation systems, particularly high efficiency systems that can remove more than 50% of the total solids from manure, can reduce greenhouse emissions by upwards of 60%. Additionally, well-managed solid-liquid separators generate dry manure fibers that many farms use successfully for cattle bedding.\n- Minimize the input of excess liquids: Manage barnyard drainage, bunk leachate, and put gutters on your barns to keep excess liquids out of manure storages.\n- Utilize solid manure storage systems: Stockpiles and composting can reduce greenhouse emissions by 20-40%. So, keep those packs separate and keep your high solids manure piled high and dry.\n- Collect less manure: Recent research suggests that heifers raised on well-managed pasture have higher feed intake and milk production through first lactation. There are health and public perception benefits as well. Consider getting your non-lactation animals out on pasture so you have less manure to store.\nScrew-press separators are used by many dairy farms to extract solids (called “separated solids”) from a manure slurry to improve handling and management of manure constituents. Image modified from Larson et al. 2021. Screw Press Separation of Manure (A4192-002/AG-919-02).Capturing methane to burn, fuel a boiler, run a generator to produce renewable electricity, or clean and compress to sell into the natural gas grid are all possibilities. These various strategies all have costs but may also provide value to the farm.\n- Anaerobic digestion: Digester reactors are optimized to generate methane from carbon-rich solids so the gas can be utilized as an energy source by the farm. These systems have very high capital and operating costs but can provide the farm value in the form of renewable energy, carbon offsets, and a fertile, low-odor effluent (digestate).\n- Cover and flare: Roofs and covers can reduce methane from manure storage. The most efficient systems are gas tight membranes with a gas collection system and biogas flare. Solid-liquid separation needs to occur before covering a storage system, but with flaring this setup is also eligible for carbon offsetting. Additionally, these covers keep rainwater out of the storage, mitigate odor, and retain more nitrogen in the manure.\nInhibit the methane you can’t prevent or capture. Inevitably, there will be some carbon-rich solids in your liquid or slurry manure storage. If digesters and covers seem out of reach, there are a couple of emerging technologies that inhibit methane generation that are worth keeping an eye on.\n- Oxygenation: Oxygen in manure prevents microbes from making methane. Some manure storages can be equipped with aeration systems to keep manure aerobic and prevent methane emissions, though ammonia emissions may increase.\n- Acidification: Research shows that reducing manure below a pH of 6 using concentrated acids or other means can prevent both methane and ammonia emissions. Work is ongoing to identify affordable strategies for farms to utilize this promising approach.\nThe big picture: You have lots of options now, with more innovations on the way. Even if methane isn’t your biggest concern, less solids in your storage also helps you more easily manage manure storages and retain that precious storage space.","Global Warming and Agriculture: Impact Estimates by Country, W. Cline 2007\nThe 2007 Cline food security assessment was based on a global temperature increase of 3.3ºC. We are currently on track for a 3C rise by 2050. We are looking at the world that today's children will see.\nThe climate models used in Cline's study predicted that under the IPCC's scenario A2 scenario (a high scenario as the world is on), that global mean temperature would rise by 3.3ºC, so these results are a for a global temperature of 3.3C. This is the increase that we are committed to by today's policy being the result if all national proposals were carried out (Climate Tracker).\nBecause of the uncertainty of the potential carbon fertilization benefits to some crops in some regions Cline gave results for crop yield changes with and without fertilization benefits.\nRisk management demands that changes without fertilization would be the basis of food security security assessment, but instead the IPCC assesses based on the assumption of large CO2 fertilization benefits based on crop experiments of doubtful validity in the real world.\nClimateChange and FoodSecurity\nLand areas would warm more than oceans, with the average surface temperature increasing by 5.0ºC weighting by land area and 4.4ºC weighting by farming area. By the 2080s, global agricultural productivity would decline by about 3% with carbon fertilization effect and by about 16% if the carbon fertilization effect did not materialize.\nThese losses would be disproportionately concentrated in developing countries, which would suffer losses of 9% with carbon fertilization effect and 21% without carbon fertilization effect, in contrast to an 8% gain (with carbon fertilization effect) and 6% loss (without carbon fertilization effect) in industrial countries. The detailed estimates by country and region reported in Table 2 indicate that South Asia and Africa would be the two regions most harmed by climate change. In Southeast Asia, the damages of climate change to agriculture would also be severe, ranking from 15.1% for Viet Nam to 26.2% for Thailand if carbon fertilization effect did not materialize..\nNumerical table of results\nClick for presentation\nCline is an agricultural economist.

Growing crops much closer to real conditions has shown that increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will have roughly half the beneficial effects that were previously hoped for in the event of climate change. In addition, ground-level ozone, which is also predicted to rise but has not been extensively studied before, has been shown to result in a loss of photosynthesis and 20% yield loss.: Both these results show that we need to seriously re-examine our predictions for future global food production as they are likely to be far lower than previously estimated.\n2015 USA Climate Change, Global Food Security, and the U.S. Food System.Food security for the world will largely depend on the effects of global climate change on US agriculture.

Dealing with drought could become a major challenge in areas where average temperatures are projected to increase and precipitation is projected to decrease.

{"question":"I'm wondering about relationships before marriage. How do the risks of short courtships compare to living together before marriage in terms of marital success?","answer":"Both short courtships and premarital cohabitation are associated with increased risks for marriage, but in different ways. Short or accelerated courtships make it difficult for couples to truly know each other and gauge long-term compatibility, often leading to poor marital outcomes including divorce. Meanwhile, living together before marriage is associated with lower divorce risk only in the first year of marriage (due to couples being used to living together), but shows increased divorce risk in all subsequent years. This higher risk persists even as cohabitation has become more socially acceptable, with studies showing the association between premarital cohabitation and marital dissolution has remained stable over time.","context":["Living Together Before Marriage May Raise Risk of Divorce\nIs living together before marriage associated with risk in marriage or not?\nPosted Nov 03, 2018\nby Scott M. Stanley and Galena K. Rhoades\nOne of the most perplexing findings in the history of the study of marriage is that living together beforehand is associated with greater, not lesser, odds of struggling in marriage. This association had been clear in study after study up to around 2007, and then a number of studies and social scientists declared that the association between living together before marriage and difficulties in marriage had disappeared.\nTo be clear, we never thought the association had disappeared. While we believe the association got weaker, we have long believed that the understanding of it mostly became better understood. For example, we predicted and found — repeatedly, and in numerous samples — that an important part of the story had to do with whether or not a couple started living together before or after having come to a clear commitment to marry. Those who cohabited only after engagement (or marriage, of course) have an edge in odds for doing well in marriage compared to those who started living together before clarifying the big question about the future. We will explain that more below.\nAmong some scholars in family science, the belief had been settled that there simply is no risk for worse outcomes in marriage associated with living together beforehand. Well, that no-risk story just received a jolt. A new study published in the Journal of Marriage and Family finds that the “premarital cohabitation effect” lives on, despite earlier claims to the contrary. The premarital cohabitation effect is what this is all about: the finding (over many studies, over decades of time) that those who live together prior to marriage are more likely, not less, to struggle in marriage. Here, we are going to take you through a fairly deep dive into what the hubbub is all about.\nThe new study is by Michael Rosenfeld and Katharina Roesler. Their findings suggest that there remains an increased risk for divorce for those living together prior to marriage and that prior studies suggesting the effect went away had a bias toward analyzing shorter versus longer-term effects. They found that living together before marriage was associated with lower odds of divorce in the first year of marriage, but increased odds of divorce in all other years tested, and this finding held across decades of data.\nNumerous Recent Studies Reported No Impact of Premarital Cohabitation\nA number of relatively recent studies suggested that the premarital cohabitation effect had gone away for those marrying in the past 10 or 15 years. Rosenfeld and Roesler pay particular attention to a report from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) by Copen, Daniels, Vespa, and Mosher in 2012, which suggested there was no increased risk associated with premarital cohabitation in the most recent (at the time) cohort of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG; 2006-2010). The NSFG is a large, ongoing sampling of those living in the U.S. with regard to many aspects of family formation, cohabitation, and marriage. Other researchers, such as Manning and Cohen, reached the same conclusion as the authors of the NCHS in 2012, incorporating data from as late as the 2006 to 2008 cohort of the NSFG.[i]\nWhile all of these studies used the same large sampling effort, Rosenfeld and Roesler had longer-term data for the most recent cohort they studied (up to 2015). Contrary to these prior conclusions, they found that there remains a clear link between premarital cohabitation and increased odds of divorce regardless of the year or cohort studied. (In all these studies, the focus is on first marriages.)\nMany experts believed that the cohabitation effect, well understood since the 1980s, would go away as living together became more the thing to do — that it would no longer be associated with negative outcomes in marriage. This hypothesis is based on the idea that the prior stigma among friends and family about living together before marriage was a cause of the increased risk. And, clearly, there is not much, if any, stigma now. (We wrote about trends in cohabitation in the U.S. in great detail here earlier this year.) The other reason for expecting the cohabitation effect to go away is a little more arcane, having to do with the fact that as it became common (at least 70 percent of couples live together before marriage now), those who chose to do so are no longer more select for being at greater risk than others.\nBased on a different line of reasoning than the other studies suggesting no risk, another prominent study had also concluded that there was no longer an added risk for divorce associated with premarital cohabitation. However, in that study, Kuperberg (2014) concluded the risk was more about moving in together at a young age (before the middle 20s) than moving in together before marriage, per se. That’s one among many potentially important nuances in this complex literature.[ii]\nPumping the Brakes on the Conclusions of No Added Risk\nCohabitation is the gift that keeps on giving to family science, providing generations of scholars with the opportunity to say, “Look here, wow, this is strange.” And people remain interested. We have seen major stories on cohabitation break across the media for over 20 years because it’s interesting. In fact, here is a recent story in The Atlantic about this very thing, and it includes numerous quotes from the second author here, Galena Rhoades, based on our work. We think this subject keeps getting lots of ink because the findings have tended to be so counterintuitive. Most people believe that living together before marriage should improve the odds of doing well in marriage. However, whatever else is true, there is very scant evidence to support this belief in a positive effect (more on that can be found in this piece).\nBy the way, we’re not trying to change your views of whether or not a couple should live together before marriage. Our own views are complex and nuanced. However, we may convince you that there is something to learn from the research that bears on what pathways may be wiser than others for the average person. So, let’s get back to the new study that is getting a lot of buzz.\nRosenfeld and Roesler’s study is quite complex statistically, but their insight boils down to two things easily explained. First, they believe studies that suggested that the premarital cohabitation effect has disappeared simply did not have outcomes for divorce far enough out for those who had married in the recent cohorts that they examined. Second, they show that premarital cohabitation is associated with a lower risk for divorce, but only very early in marriage (in the first year); in contrast, the finding flips, with premarital cohabitation being associated with higher risks for divorce in years after that first year. That’s what earlier studies could not address.\nIn particular, Rosenfeld and Roesler suggest that those who live together before marriage have an advantage in the first year because they are already used to all the changes that come with living together. Those who go straight into marriage without living together have a bigger immediate shock to negotiate after marriage, and as a result, have a short-term increased risk that’s greater than those already living together. But that’s the short term, and the risk remains long term.\nHere is a quote from the new paper (Figure 2 below is included here with permission):\nFigure 2 shows that, for the years in which the NSFG has substantial numbers of marriages and breakups, there was no apparent trend over time in the raw or adjusted odds ratios of breakup for premarital cohabitation. Given the enormous changes over time in the prevalence of premarital cohabitation (see Figure 1), Figure 2 shows a surprising stability in the association between premarital cohabitation and marital dissolution over time. (Pgs 7-8)\nTheories of Increased Risk\nThere are three main theories for how living together before marriage could be causally associated with worse outcomes (on average) in marriage. Rosenfeld and Roesler address the first two but did not say anything about the third.[iii]\n1. Selection — This theory is simply that there are many factors associated with who cohabits when and why, and with whom, and that those factors are also associated with how marriages will turn out regardless of cohabiting experience. For example, it’s well known that those who are more economically disadvantaged are more likely: to live together outside of marriage, to live together with more than one partner, to have a child with a cohabiting partner prior to marrying, and to struggle in marriage. Other factors are religiousness, traditionality, and family history (parental divorce, etc.). The selection explanation is that those who cohabit in riskier ways (e.g., before marriage, before engagement, with more than one partner) were already at greater risk. In the strongest view of selection, living together does not add to the risk at all, because it’s all already baked in. There is a lot of evidence for selection playing an important role in this literature, and scholars in this area note this and address it in various ways.\n2. The Experience of Cohabiting Changes Things — In an older line of research that was clever, but needs to be tested again with those marrying in more recent years, Axinn and Barber (1997) showed that cohabiting changes attitudes about marriage and divorce, lowering esteem for marriage and increasing acceptance of divorce. This is consistent with scores of studies in psychology showing that attitudes will cohere to behavior. In other words, you will bring your beliefs around to fit your behavior. Earlier, Thornton, Axinn, and Hill (1992) showed that cohabiting led to people becoming less religious. Rosenfeld and Roesler included a lot on the theory of experience but mostly use it to emphasize the short-term benefit of already experiencing living together when transitioning into marriage.\n3. Inertia — We have argued since the early 2000s for another causal theory in this line of research. Drawing on theories of commitment, we suggested that what nearly everyone misses in understanding the risk associated with cohabitation is pretty simple: Moving in together makes it harder to break up, net of everything else. The added risk is due to how cohabitation substantially increases constraints to remain together prior to a dedication to a future together maturing between two partners. Two key papers on this perspective are here and here.[iv]\nOne primary prediction from the inertia hypothesis is that those who only started living together after being already committed to marriage (e.g., by engagement or actual marriage) should, on average, do better in marriage than those who may have prematurely made it harder to break up by living together before agreeing on marriage. The inertia hypothesis completely embraces selection, suggesting that relationships already at greater risk become harder to exit because of cohabitation. Various predictions from the inertia hypothesis have been supported in ten or more studies, seven of which include tests of the prediction about pre-cohabitation level of commitment to marriage (aka plans for marriage prior to living together) — and this latter finding exists in at least six different samples across a range of outcomes.[v]\nThere is no particular reason to expect that the inertia risk will dissipate with increased acceptance of cohabitation, because the mechanism is about the timing of the development of aspects of commitment, not about societal views and personal attitudes. For living together to lower risk in marriage, the benefit of learning something disqualifying about a partner has to exceed the costs of making it harder to break up that come with sharing a single address. Hence, inertia is another possibility, along with experience, that could explain the persistence of a cohabitation effect, such as that found by Rosenfeld and Roesler.[vi]\nOther Possibilities — Other factors that may be associated with differential outcomes include pacing (Sassler et al.), age at the time of moving in together (Kuperberg), and having children before marriage (Tach & Halpern-Meekin). All such theories suggest that the risks of living together before marriage are greater for some people than others. Rosenfeld and Roesler are not really addressing this issue. However, they did find that the risks associated with premarital cohabitation were lower for African Americans. While that’s a subject far beyond our focus here, it does not surprise us. For most groups, cohabitation is no particular indicator of higher commitment. However, it may well signal higher levels of commitment among groups where marriage has declined a great deal, like African Americans.\nRosenfeld and Roesler also note that the risks of living together before marriage were even greater among those who had lived with more than just their mate prior to marriage. That finding is consistent with many other studies: for example, Teachman (2003).\nThe Effect and the Controversy Lives\nResearch on premarital cohabitation has long been mired in arguments about causality, with the dominant view being that what we describe about selection explains most, if not all, of the added risk when found. However, many studies in the history of this field have controlled for all sorts of variables associated with selection and still found an additional risk. In fairness, it is not possible to control for all aspects of selection in such studies. Without randomly assigning people to walk different pathways before marriage, causality can never be proven. And we think it’s going to be a long time before researchers are allowed to flip a coin about who does what in their love lives so that we can study the phenomena better. Oh, how great that would be, though, for figuring things out. Since we have to live with studying what people end up doing on their own, arguments ensue. Besides, since when does evidence stop arguing anyway when people are passionate about their view on something?\nRosenfeld and Roesler’s new study breathed life into a finding many concluded was dead. Perhaps it was just mostly dead.\nScott M. Stanley and Galena K. Rhoades are research professors in the department of psychology at the University of Denver. A different version of this article appeared on the blog for the Institute of Family Studies on October 17, 2018.\n[i] We are mystified why the new paper does not cite or address the findings by Manning and Cohen. That study seems like it is the most recent major study directly addressing the question Rosenfeld and Roesler examine.\n[ii] Scott wrote about the Kuperberg study at that time, taking far more issue with the media stories about it than the actual study, suggesting there are many ways people could misconstrue to whom those, and other findings of differential risk, applied. Those articles are here and here.\n[iii] This omission does not seem as striking to us as the omission of Manning and Cohen’s paper, since their paper is already complex and they are intent on addressing one moderator of the cohabitation effect: how long after marriage the effect is measured. They do not address at all the growing literature on moderators of the cohabitation effect. Still, inertia is one of the major theories of increased risk, and only selection itself has more publications addressing it.\n[iv] An accessible, word document version of the major theory paper can be found here. A full run down of our theoretical and empirical work in this line is available here. That includes citations and links, mostly to accessible versions of the articles in the literature.\n[v] We have found evidence for inertia whether or not someone has cohabited only with their mate, and in numerous samples of people marrying after 2000 and later.\n[vi] As an interesting side point on the subject of the inertia hypothesis, the commitment to marriage/timing effect exists in the NSFG. It was mentioned in passing in a working paper leading up to the 2010 publication by Reinhold, and it is mentioned prominently in the abstract (and paper) in Manning and Cohen’s 2012 publication.","I’ve been in a relationship for over 5 years. We are both still young and plan to get married eventually in the future. I was wondering if there are any down sides in having long-term relationships. I feel very secure and confident in our relationship, but just as I’ve heard that short relationships (or courtships) can be a bad thing, I’m wondering if it works the same for long lasting relationships? — V.N.\nI am presuming that when you ask about downsides of long-term relationships you are referring to whether or not the length of a premarital relationship (what researchers and your grandparents refer to as “courtship”) affects marital outcomes if and when the couple marries. You have heard correctly. Short, or accelerated, courtships are a risk factor for poor marital outcomes, including divorce (i.e., “the quicker they rise, the harder they fall”).1 The reasons for this association are fairly obvious (except perhaps to those in the quick courtship): it is very hard for two individuals to truly get to know each other and gauge long-term compatibility in a short amount of time, and very often individuals base their relationships on feelings of passion that are highly variable. This isn’t to say that all accelerated courtships are doomed – and there are a lot of other factors that influence marital outcomes – but in many cases getting married after a short courtship is akin to walking on quicksand.\nAs for extended courtships, most of the research out there suggests that longer courtships enhance marital satisfaction and other outcomes2, although there is some evidence that long courtships characterized by a lot of conflict and ambivalence should raise some red flags.3 I think we can borrow some findings from the cohabitation (romantic couples who live together without being married) literature to provide some insight into your question. Couples who cohabit prior to marriage because they want to ‘try things out’ often adopt this approach because they already see some potential problems with long-term compatibility.4 It should come as no surprise then that these types of relationships are less than stable if they transition into a marital relationship (in fact, it’s very likely that this ‘group’ of cohabiters contributes a large degree to the finding that premarital cohabitation is bad for marriage). But, couples who cohabit prior to marriage for practical reasons and plan to someday marry all along fare better (and in some respects may fare better than those that didn’t cohabit), especially because these couples have had practice confronting and working through life and relationship stressors.5 For example, they’ve most likely experienced conflict and had an opportunity to see how they treat each other in such situations.6\nIn many ways, it sounds like your situation is fairly similar – you and your partner plan to marry, but you both realize this isn’t the best time for that step; you’re not putting it off because you’re worried about whether your relationship will last (at least I think that’s what you’re saying). Rather, you’re waiting because you’re both young and there’s a lot of life ahead of you. Your approach is probably a good one if this does indeed describe your relationship. In fact, one of the biggest risk factors for poor marital outcomes is getting married young. Why? Part of the reason is that these folks tend to have short courtships, but it’s also the case that individuals’ identities or self-concepts tend to shift throughout adolescence and emerging adulthood. It’s very hard to know who is a good fit for you when who ‘you’ are is still shaking out. In other words, if the courtship is long because one or more partners is concerned about the long-term stability of the relationship, then long courtships = not so good. But, if the courtship is long because both partners want to wait to marry for practical and well thought out reasons, then long courtship = probably good.\nInterested in learning more about relationships?

{"question":"As a process engineer, I need to understand the current state of AI applications in chemical monitoring. Could you explain how deep learning is being applied to detect toxic materials in industrial waters, and what limitations exist in the interpretability of these models?","answer":"Deep learning is being applied through fluorescence spectroscopy combined with modeling programs that can accurately predict water composition. The system uses a convolutional neural network to process data and map out sample composition, similar to technology used in fingerprint and facial recognition. This approach allows for quick detection of key toxins, including naphthenic acids from petroleum sources. However, there are significant limitations in interpretability. While these deep learning models have good generalization capabilities, they are difficult to interpret - specifically in understanding how decisions are made and which input variables influence the results. This creates challenges in understanding why biased results or incorrect classifications might occur. Additionally, there are technical limitations - not all toxins can be detected, only those that are fluorescent, and the technology still needs to be scaled up for more in-depth testing.","context":["Toxic Materials Detected in Water With Help of Machine Learning\nIdentifying toxic materials in water with machine learning\nNew UBCO research can quickly identify toxins from oil sands and tailing ponds\nUBCO researchers are using fluorescence spectroscopy to quickly detect key toxins in tailing ponds water.\nWaste materials from oil sands extraction, stored in tailings ponds, can pose a risk to the natural habitat and neighbouring communities when they leach into groundwater and surface ecosystems.\nUntil now, the challenge for the oil sands industry is that the proper analysis of toxic waste materials has been difficult to achieve without complex and lengthy testing. And there’s a backlog. For example, in Alberta alone, there are an estimated 1.4 billion cubic metres of fluid tailings, explains Nicolás Peleato, an Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering at UBC Okanagan\nHis team of researchers at UBCO’s School of Engineering has uncovered a new, faster and more reliable, method of analyzing these samples. It’s the first step, says Dr. Peleato, but the results look promising.\n“Current methods require the use of expensive equipment and it can take days or weeks to get results,” he adds. “There is a need for a low-cost method to monitor these waters more frequently as a way to protect public and aquatic ecosystems.”\nAlong with master’s student María Claudia Rincón Remolina, the researchers used fluorescence spectroscopy to quickly detect key toxins in the water. They also ran the results through a modelling program that accurately predicts the composition of the water.\nThe composition can be used as a benchmark for further testing of other samples, Rincón explains. The researchers are using a convolutional neural network that processes data in a grid-like topology, such as an image. It’s similar, she says, to the type of modelling used for classifying hard to identify fingerprints, facial recognition and even self-driving cars.\n“The modelling takes into account variability in the background of the water quality and can separate hard to detect signals, and as a result it can achieve highly accurate results,” says Rincón.\nThe research looked at a mixture of organic compounds that are toxic, including naphthenic acids—which can be found in many petroleum sources. By using high-dimensional fluorescence, the researchers can identify most types of organic matter.\n“The modelling method searches for key materials, and maps out the sample’s composition,” explains Peleato. “The results of the initial sample analysis are then processed through powerful image processing models to accurately determine comprehensive results.”\nWhile results to date are encouraging, both Rincón and Dr. Peleato caution the technique needs to be further evaluated at a larger scale—at which point there may be potential to incorporate screening of additional toxins.\nPeleato explains this potential screening tool is the first step, but it does have some limitations since not all toxins or naphthenic acids can be detected—only those that are fluorescent. And the technology will have to be scaled up for future, more in-depth testing.\nWhile it will not replace current analytical methods that are more accurate, Dr. Peleato says this approach will allow the oil sands industry to accurately screen and treat its waste materials. This is a necessary step to continue to meet the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment standards and guidelines.\nThe research appears in the Journal of Hazardous Materials , and is funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant program.","Application of Deep Learning in Chemical Processes: Explainability, Monitoring and Observability\nMetadataShow full item record\nThe last decade has seen remarkable advances in speech, image, and language recognition tools that have been made available to the public through computer and mobile devices’ applications. Most of these significant improvements were achieved by Artificial Intelligence (AI)/ deep learning (DL) algorithms (Hinton et al., 2006) that generally refers to a set of novel neural network architectures and algorithms such as long-short term memory (LSTM) units, convolutional networks (CNN), autoencoders (AE), t-distributed stochastic embedding (TSNE), etc. Although neural networks are not new, due to a combination of relatively novel improvements in methods for training the networks and the availability of increasingly powerful computers, one can now model much more complex nonlinear dynamic behaviour by using complex structures of neurons, i.e. more layers of neurons, than ever before (Goodfellow et al., 2016). However, it is recognized that the training of neural nets of such complex structures requires a vast amount of data. In this sense manufacturing processes are good candidates for deep learning applications since they utilize computers and information systems for monitoring and control thus generating a massive amount of data. This is especially true in pharmaceutical companies such as Sanofi Pasteur, the industrial collaborator for the current study, where large data sets are routinely stored for monitoring and regulatory purposes. Although novel DL algorithms have been applied with great success in image analysis, speech recognition, and language translation, their applications to chemical processes and pharmaceutical processes, in particular, are scarce. The current work deals with the investigation of deep learning in process systems engineering for three main areas of application: (i) Developing a deep learning classification model for profit-based operating regions. (ii) Developing both supervised and unsupervised process monitoring algorithms. (iii) Observability Analysis It is recognized that most empirical or black-box models, including DL models, have good generalization capabilities but are difficult to interpret. For example, using these methods it is difficult to understand how a particular decision is made, which input variable/feature is greatly influencing the decision made by the DL models etc. This understanding is expected to shed light on why biased results can be obtained or why a wrong class is predicted with a higher probability in classification problems. Hence, a key goal of the current work is on deriving process insights from DL models. To this end, the work proposes both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches to identify regions of process inputs that result in corresponding regions, i.e. ranges of values, of process profit. Furthermore, it will be shown that the ability to better interpret the model by identifying inputs that are most informative can be used to reduce over-fitting. To this end, a neural network (NN) pruning algorithm is developed that provides important physical insights on the system regarding the inputs that have positive and negative effect on profit function and to detect significant changes in process phenomenon. It is shown that pruning of input variables significantly reduces the number of parameters to be estimated and improves the classification test accuracy for both case studies: the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) and an industrial vaccine manufacturing process. The ability to store a large amount of data has permitted the use of deep learning (DL) and optimization algorithms for the process industries. In order to meet high levels of product quality, efficiency, and reliability, a process monitoring system is needed. The two aspects of Statistical Process Control (SPC) are fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). Many multivariate statistical methods like PCA and PLS and their dynamic variants have been extensively used for FD. However, the inherent non-linearities in the process pose challenges while using these linear models. Numerous deep learning FDD approaches have also been developed in the literature. However, the contribution plots for identifying the root cause of the fault have not been derived from Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). To this end, the supervised fault detection problem in the current work is formulated as a binary classification problem while the supervised fault diagnosis problem is formulated as a multi-class classification problem to identify the type of fault. Then, the application of the concept of explainability of DNNs is explored with its particular application in FDD problem. The developed methodology is demonstrated on TEP with non-incipient faults. Incipient faults are faulty conditions where signal to noise ratio is small and have not been widely studied in the literature. To address the same, a hierarchical dynamic deep learning algorithm is developed specifically to address the issue of fault detection and diagnosis of incipient faults. One of the major drawbacks of both the methods described above is the availability of labeled data i.e. normal operation and faulty operation data. From an industrial point of view, most data in an industrial setting, especially for biochemical processes, is obtained during normal operation and faulty data may not be available or may be insufficient. Hence, we also develop an unsupervised DL approach for process monitoring. It involves a novel objective function and a NN architecture that is tailored to detect the faults effectively. The idea is to learn the distribution of normal operation data to differentiate among the fault conditions. In order to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methodology for fault detection, systematic comparisons are conducted with Multiway Principal Component Analysis (MPCA) and Multiway Partial Least Squares (MPLS) on an industrial scale Penicillin Simulator. Past investigations reported that the variability in productivity in the Sanofi's Pertussis Vaccine Manufacturing process may be highly correlated to biological phenomena, i.e. oxidative stresses, that are not routinely monitored by the company. While the company monitors and stores a large amount of fermentation data it may not be sufficiently informative about the underlying phenomena affecting the level of productivity. Furthermore, since the addition of new sensors in pharmaceutical processes requires extensive and expensive validation and certification procedures, it is very important to assess the potential ability of a sensor to observe relevant phenomena before its actual adoption in the manufacturing environment. This motivates the study of the observability of the phenomena from available data. An algorithm is proposed to check the observability for the classification task from the observed data (measurements). The proposed methodology makes use of a Supervised AE to reduce the dimensionality of the inputs. Thereafter, a criterion on the distance between the samples is used to calculate the percentage of overlap between the defined classes. The proposed algorithm is tested on the benchmark Tennessee Eastman process and then applied to the industrial vaccine manufacturing process.\nCite this version of the work\nPiyush Agarwal (2022).

{"question":"What security measures are required for protecting electronic signatures under current legal standards and modern apps?","answer":"Electronic signatures require multiple security measures under both modern apps and legal standards. The E-Sign Act emphasizes the need for reliable certification methods to authenticate e-signatures and reduce fraud risks, including digital identification devices. Modern signature apps implement these requirements through advanced encryption technology, password protection, and tamper-proof features. They also recommend additional security practices such as using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, avoiding public Wi-Fi for signing important documents, and keeping devices and signature apps updated. Both systems allow for electronic storage of records while maintaining security standards.","context":["Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you need to sign a document but don’t have access to a printer, scanner or fax machine? Don’t worry because making an electronic signature is a quick and easy solution to this problem.

The ESign Act makes an\nelectronic signature (esignature) as legally binding as ink-andpaper\nsignatures, and can be used in legal proceedings. An e-signature\nis generally defined as a form of technology, including fingerprint\nreaders, stylus pads and encrypted 'smart cards', used to verify\na party's identity so as to certify contracts that are agreed to\nover the Internet.\nThe Federal Trade Commission is the federal agency responsible for regulating\nthe E-Sign Act. At the direction of Congress, the FTC has issued a report finding\nthat the E-Sign Act is working for both business and consumers, after receiving\ninput from 32 interested groups, ranging from computer companies and financial\ninstitutions to consumer groups and academics. The FTC recommends that no action\nshould be taken by Congress to amend the E-Sign Act.\nGiven that the E-Sign Act is here and there are no plans to amend the law,\nwhat does it mean to the credit professional and the electronic credit department?\nDoes documenting your electronic credit sale allow an e-signature to have the\nsame legal effect as a handwritten signature from your customer on your credit\napplication or P.O.?

{"question":"How is the Danish Queen's Reference Library connected to Scanian archaeological documentation, and what similarities can be drawn with the archaeological documentation at Sutton Hoo?","answer":"The Queen's Reference Library contains valuable archaeological documentation of Scania through Carl Gustav Gottfried Hilfeling's drawings from the 1770s and 1780s. Hilfeling documented historical and archaeological objects predating Scania's transfer to Sweden in 1658, including prehistoric sites from the Bronze Age to the Renaissance. Similarly, Sutton Hoo has undergone extensive archaeological documentation, with recent exhibitions and displays showing both original pieces from recent excavations and replicas of original finds, along with exhibitions exploring the landscape and settlements in the area.","context":["Casper David Friedrich’s drawings\nAmongst the Reference Library’s treasures are three drawings by one of the major figures of the German Romantic movement, Casper David Friedrich. Friedrich was educated at the Art Academy in Copenhagen in the 1790s and maintained the connection to Denmark both through the many Danish painters of the Golden Age who visited him in Dresden, and through the Norwegian painter J. C. Dahl. The drawings are part of the “Green Album”, a folder of drawings which belonged to Prince Christian Frederik, the later Christian VIII. Christian Frederik was for many years the governor of the Art Academy, had himself been instructed in drawing there (at the same time as Friedrich), and was seen as an important patron and support. He several times received gifts from artists, both as prince and king.\nHilfeling’s drawings from Scania\nIn the 1770s and 1780s, the Swedish artist Carl Gustav Gottfried Hilfeling travelled around Scania at the expense of the Danish government and drew historical and archaeological objects which predated Scania becoming Swedish at the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. It was originally to be a collaboration with the Danish historian Jacob Langebek, but he died in 1777. Hilfeling’s drawings are of great documentary value and show a broad cross section of both prehistoric and historic Scanian cultural heritage, from the Bronze Age to the Renaissance. Shown here is the drawing of the largest Bronze Age burial site in Scandinavia, which lies in Kivik in south east Scania.\nThe Queen’s Reference Library affords many possibilities for research into a large number of fields and has over the years formed the basis of a many academic publications. The library includes unique collections within the field of history – in particular the history of the Danish Royal Family – genealogy, the history of architecture and art, literary history, musicology, heraldry, cartography, and the history of books and bookbinding. It is furthermore well stocked with secondary literature about all these subjects. The Reference Library has amongst other things collaborated on the following publications: Erik Pontoppidan, The Danish Atlas, Tomus I-VI, facsimile published by Rosenkilde &Bagger, Copenhagen 1969.

Help finance the project estimated to £1 million by shopping for your Christmas gifts at the Company’s website.\nFor several years, the Sutton Hoo Ship’s Company has worked to establish the models and find the funding for the reconstruction of the famous 7th-century ship from Sutton Hoo. Believed to be the burial place for Raedwald who died ca. 624, the grave was discovered in a mound in 1939. Apart from the magnificent treasures buried with the king, the ghost of a 27m long ship was easily discernible.\nReadwald was king of East Anglia and a member of the Wuffingas dynasty and reigned from 599 to 624. Based on Bede, he is generally acknowledged to have ruled as an overlord or Bretwalda, “Britain-Ruler”. He converted to Christianity while at the same time maintaining a pagan temple.\nThe grave at Sutton Hoo with its extraordinary finds partly mirrors the life-world of Beowulf and the material culture of the early Vendel graves in Sweden. It has recently been speculated that the pagan wife of Raedwald heralded from a Danish royal milieu (perhaps from Lejre or Gudenåen); and that some of the artefacts in the burial chamber aboard the ship were part of royal gifts received by Raedwald together with the poem or a precursor.\nIn 2016, the Ship’s Company was formed with the sole purpose of creating a permanent replica of the ship. The ship will be built in the newly opened shipyard at Longshed in Woodbridge, where visitors will be welcomed at all times.\n“The Ship’s Company intends to be completely open and transparent in the way that they are using research and making decisions. Anything about the research and build process will be shared publicly to generate an extra layer of scrutiny, and any feedback will be gratefully accepted”, the Company writes. Nevertheless, the papers form the scientific symposium held in August 2018 are still under wraps. One of the challenges is to reconstruct the exact proportions of the ship. However, experience from the recent scientifically based reconstruction of the famous Nydam-boat from ca. AD 320 will be invaluable. Another question touches upon how the ship was propelled? By rowing? Or sail? The first reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo ship, which was carried out in half size and set with sails. Whether the new full-scale replica is destined to be fitted out in the same manner remains to be seen.\nThe reconstruction will be carried out in close collaboration with the University of Southampton as well as archaeologists from Scandinavia.\nAlready, the Queen of England has donated twelve oak-trees from the park at Windsor castle. One of these will be used to reconstruct the 18m long keel. Now, the public is invited to shop for their Christmas gifts, lay their hands on replicas of oars, rivets, rib bolts or iron spikes and contribute to the 1 million needed to execute the project.\nSutton Hoo Revamped\nMeanwhile, at Sutton Hoo the National Trust has launched £4 million-worth of new ‘displays, exhibitions and immersive experiences’ to tell the whole archaeological saga.\nAlong with a new route through the landscape, the exhibitions will help visitors to reconnect to the stories and people associated with the ship and its discovery within the Royal Burial Ground itself.\nA 27-metre long sculpture representing the burial ship greets visitors to the Exhibition Hall and Tranmer House. Both of these building have been completely transformed.\nThe enlarged Exhibition Hall presents replicas of the original finds now in the British Museum and original pieces from the more recent excavations in the project initiated by the Society of Antiquaries and the British Museum and directed by Martin Carver. Also, the exhibitions include two special new exhibitions exploring the landscape, the natural history of the river and the settlements in the immediate neighbourhood.\nA 17-metre high observation tower – whose construction was preceded by more excavation last year – will open in the autumn to offer views across the burial ground to the wider landscape.\nThe Sutton Hoo Ship’s Company\nThe Longshed, Tide Mill Way, Woodbridge, Suffolk\nSutton Hoo.

{"question":"What are the essential design considerations for modern control rooms, and what security measures are needed to protect their digital infrastructure?","answer":"Essential design considerations for modern control rooms include three main categories: critical spatial relationships (focusing on layout, workstation placement, and monitor positioning), key design issues (addressing physical security and human-machine interface), and human factors (covering ergonomics, seating, lighting, and operator comfort). For security, buildings must implement strict access control measures, including proper management of contractor access, VPN login requirements, and regular system inventory and assessment. It's crucial to monitor who can access building systems and ensure access credentials expire when employment ends to prevent unauthorized system access.","context":["A great deal has changed in how power plants are run today. Technology has boosted the potential of efficiency and reliability for plant operations, spurring control system upgrades. And with the transition from physical to digital interface controls, the control room upgrade may need as much attention to detail as the system upgrade.\nOptimizing an Operator’s Space\nHow operators interact within their control room workspace is vital to maintain proper management of the overall plant — and the plant’s ability to supply power to its community. Plant managers need to consider and address a wide array of factors to help reduce fatigue, enhance human machine interface and more in this increasingly digital environment.\nWith the dramatic change from an all physical control environment to primarily digital controls within each operator’s workspace, it may be difficult to immediately pinpoint what exactly should be taken into consideration for updating. While some physical controls will always be maintained, an environment with more and more digital content on monitors displaying high performance graphics requires appropriate design, such as overhead lighting concerns, ergonomic height placement, specific seating for long hours and others. Even the color of the room and the graphics onscreen must be considered.\nTo sift through the noise of the wide array of potentially vital factors, it’s best to break down key considerations for control room upgrades into three main categories — critical spatial relationships, key design issues, and human interaction factors.\nCritical spatial relationships stress the importance of the size and layout of the control room, as well as the number of operators who will work in the space and all the necessary workstations, equipment and monitors. This category focuses on considerations for site lines, workstation angles and the proper placement height and reach of monitors, keyboards and computer mice. It even takes into account the location of adjoining and surrounding rooms the operators need outside the control room (see Figure 1).\nKey design issues start with addressing the physical security of the perimeter of the space and progress all the way down to the human machine interface (HMI), situational awareness (SA), alarm management and many more. This category focuses on considerations for how each operator safely functions within the space and in relation to all equipment in a proactive way to provide reliable plant performance, maintaining a smooth operation rather than in a reactionary mode focused on addressing alarms. In this 24/7 environment, it is also important to address procedural aspects of the control room such as lock-out tag-out (loto), permitting, and operator shift crossover to reduce the potential for human error.\nHuman factors get into the nitty-gritty of maintaining the comfort and work health for each operator, such as addressing ergonomics, seating selection and adjustability for different body types, acoustics, lighting levels and more. The considerations within this category are essential to help mitigate fatigue, eye strain and long-term physical issues that can cause absenteeism and human error.\nTo truly optimize an upgraded control room that can manage an upgraded control system, each of these three categories must be considered and addressed fully. After all, an optimized work space will not only safeguard the productivity and health of operators; it will help maintain the steady stream of electricity to consumers.\nUpgrading an aging distributed control system offers enhanced features and mitigated risks. Learn about the benefits of a thorough control system assessment and if it’s the right time to upgrade.","Not only “smart buildings” deal with risk considering the fact that most devices – HVAC, protection entry, and so forth. – now link to the world wide web.

But in fact, most structures are susceptible to these types of cyberattacks, a panel of professionals reported in the course of a webinar last 7 days referred to as “Cybersecurity in the News: What It Means for Business Authentic Estate.”\n“There are about 40 years’ worth of digital technological innovation in our setting up inventory,” reported Fred Gordy, director of cybersecurity at Charlotte, N.C.-dependent consulting organization Smart Buildings, which hosted the webinar. “It’s not just in so-named ‘smart properties.’”\nOperational know-how and facts engineering can be open doorways for cybercriminals, said Lucian Niemeyer, CEO of security organization Making Cyber Security in Bethesda, Md. Most people know what IT suggests – OT is just all of the engineering in a setting up that bodily interacts with the entire world, these as HVAC and electrical programs, parking, access management, and fireplace alarm and suppression programs.\n“Office properties, malls, educational facilities, banking companies, sporting venues – all of these sites have actual physical techniques that are now integrated with IT,” reported Niemeyer. “And all of these locations are susceptible.”\nGordy supplied a actual-earth example involving a single of his shoppers, the owner of a 30-tale workplace tower. A tenant in the building been given a bomb menace from hackers who attained distant obtain to the tenant’s printer and produced a menacing information. The full office making was evacuated. An investigation uncovered that the risk had appear by way of the parking technique, which was run by a 3rd-bash contractor and not by the developing management or owner.\nNonetheless, the building owner’s popularity was at danger mainly because of the incident. “Tenants really do not know who operates what,” Gordy mentioned. “If your title is on the building, then you’ll get the brand name injury.”\nBringing contractors up to speed is an critical phase in shoring up vulnerabilities in professional properties, said John Hester, operator of Hester Consulting, a constructing operations firm in Peachtree Corners, Ga. As quite a few as 3,000 professionals and staffers can interact with the OT units in a huge setting up, Hester stated, and even small- and medium-sized structures can have various contractors getting into on any supplied working day.\n“Contractors generate open up areas for chance,” Hester said. “You have to control them and do your because of diligence. Know what they are undertaking to vet who arrives into your creating.”\nAdministrative methods that manage who can accessibility the building’s other techniques are usually susceptible points, Hester explained. Contractors and setting up administration staff members may possibly be given access that does not expire when their employment finishes. Systems that never need a VPN login are yet another potential weak place. When obtain isn’t thoroughly controlled, Hester mentioned, systems these kinds of as hearth alarms, elevators and stability cameras can become susceptible to cyberattacks.\nMitigating cyberattacks in any building boils down to two techniques that each individual operator can take: inventory and assessment of OT.\n“For stock, you have to know what you’ve bought. For evaluation, you have to know how previous it is and who’s performing on it,” Hester explained.\nWhen the activity of analyzing OT programs may perhaps seem too much to handle, it is really worth the hard work, and entrepreneurs need to remember that it is a process.\n“Don’t consider you have to know it all,” Hester claimed. “A minor time and income put in now can help save you a great deal afterwards.”\nResource: National Association of Realtors® (NAR)\n© 2021 Florida Realtors®"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:512dbd53-e877-4f84-8494-0a26eec426ff>","<urn:uuid:3181a40b-e9b4-4359-85a3-86365f705fe1>"],"error":null}

Scuff marks can be treated with baby oil (left for 5 minutes) or with steel wool type 000 dampened with liquid floor wax. For yellowed floors, use a solution of chlorine bleach in cold water (1:3 ratio) for 30-45 minutes. For industrial safety, floor openings must be properly protected - holes that someone could accidentally walk into must be guarded by either a standard railing with standard toeboard on all exposed sides, or a floor hole cover of standard strength and construction. If the cover is not in place, the floor hole must be constantly attended or protected by removable standard railing. Additionally, permanent aisles and passageways must be appropriately marked, and all places of employment must be kept clean and orderly.","context":["Linoleum Floor Cleaning Methods\nLinoleum floors can easily be cleaned with plain warm water. This method is preferred because many detergents tend to leave a residue on the linoleum surface, which acts like a magnet for dirt. However for thorough cleaning, liquid dish soaps can be employed which can be rinsed quite easily. The grooves present in some linoleum floors should only be scrubbed using a brush with nylon bristles. Bristles of other materials can produce scratches on the linoleum surface.\nAnother method of cleaning a linoleum floor is to pour straight ammonia on the floor and spread it using a dish towel. The straight ammonia is allowed to set for about at least 15 minutes and at the most 30 minutes. A nylon brush is used to scrub the area. Only a small area and not the entire floor should be treated at a time. The ammonia is mopped with a terry towel which is slightly damp. In order to remove the ammonia completely, the water used to rinse the floor should contain vinegar, in a proportion of half cup for every gallon of plain water.\nA linoleum floor can be waxed in order to prevent it from yellowing. Commercial products that claim to perform both waxing and cleaning usually don’t perform any of the functions as effectively as separate products. A linoleum floor can easily be cleaned with a commercial all-purpose cleaner. The cleaner is used after it has been dissolved in warm water. There are a large number of commercial cleaning products available in the market, some of which are designed particularly for cleaning linoleum floors. Examples of these are Armstrong Genuine Floor Cleaner, which has glycol ether as the basic ingredient.\nQuarter cup of this product is dissolved in one gallon of cold water. For regular cleaning, a lightly damped mop is used. For heavy cleaning, a wet mop is used to scrub the floor followed by damp mopping.\nStain and Odor Removal on Linoleum Floors\nIn order to remove heel marks from a linoleum floor, a towel sprayed with a little amount of WD40 is gently rubbed against the marks causing them to fade away without having to scrub. The scuffmarks can be effectively removed with an ordinary pencil eraser. A more efficient method is the application of a few drops of baby oil. Yet another method of removing scuff marks is to rub them with steel wool type 000 damped with floor wax in liquid form.\nThe wax is then wiped off using a piece of damp cloth. The baby oil is allowed to set for about 5 minutes and is then wiped off completely. Spilled water must be wiped off completely to avoid permanent stains. Most of the permanent stains can be removed by scrubbing with a nylon brush followed by cleaning and polishing. Mold and mildew are removed by a solution of vinegar in water.\nIn order to eliminate pet odors, enzyme cleaners should be applied to the linoleum floor. Commercial names of enzyme cleaners are F.O.N and Natural Magic.\nLinoleum Floor Cleaning\nHeavy duty cleaning of linoleum floors include a number of steps, first of which is to vacuum the dust thoroughly using a canister vacuum. A wax stripper and a brush are then used to remove the floor wax. Equal volumes of edible white vinegar and plain water are mixed in equal volumes. Warm water is arranged in a bucket. The solution is sprayed on the floor using a spray bottle. Finally the floor is mopped with the warm water. Vinegar acts as a disinfectant and removes organic growths. It does not leave any residue, film or spots. It frees the linoleum floor from unpleasant odors.\nA shine mop is applied to dry the linoleum floor. It also serves to locate and eliminate any remaining dirt. A shine mop essentially consists of a white towel fitted over a mop head rectangular in shape. It can rotate at an angle of 360 degrees to ensure proper cleaning. It also carries a scrub pad made of cotton or nylon. Hence it perform both the drying and scrubbing operation for a linoleum floor. Air drying can also be opted for instead of using a shine mop.\nTreating Yellowed Linoleum Flooring\nIn order to treat a yellowed floor, a solution of chlorine bleach in cold water is applied on it. One volume of bleach is added to three volumes of water. The solution is allowed to stay on the floor for about 30 to 45 minutes. If the stain seems to lighten, the process is repeated. If it does not seem to work, the floor is covered with the solution once again, and a substance called scouring powder, which contains chlorine bleach, is sprinkled on it.\nThe floor is then scrubbed and rinsed thoroughly with cold water. The floor is then washed with a solution containing equal volumes of vinegar and water in order to neutralize the bleach. The entire process may need to be repeated multiple times to bring about a notable change.\nPrecautionary Measures When Cleaning Linoleum Floors\nStrong alkalis and chemicals with high pH should ordinarily be avoided owing to the fact that they cause yellowing of the floor. Water having extremely high temperature should not be used because it can cause damage to the linoleum floor. Before applying bleach, it must first be applied on a relatively small portion of the floor to see whether it suits the floor or not. If any negative result is observed, the product should be rejected.\nThose products should be preferred as cleaners, which are designed in particular for linoleum floors. Solvent-based cleaners should be avoided because of the fact that they tend to soften and hence damage the linoleum floor. The floor should not be scrubbed too vigorously. Rough scrubbing pads should not be used. Care must be taken while cleaning that the floor is not flooded with water. After cleaning, the floor should be allowed to dry completely and any remaining water spots should be dried manually. Cleaning products should be mixed and applied only as instructed on the label. Cleaning solution should be changed when it gets dirty.\nVIDEO: Linoleum Floor Cleaning Guide","29 CFR 1910 Subpart D\nAccording to the US Department of Labor, over 17% of all disabling occupational injuries results from a fall, making falls one of the most frequently reported workplace incident. In fact, 15% of all accidental deaths that occur in general industry are a result of a slip, trip or fall.\nA slip can be defined as too little friction or traction between feet (footwear) and a walking/working surface, resulting in loss of balance. The typical result of this loss of balance, is a fall.\nOSHA places falls into two separate categories: Fall at the same level, and fall to a lower level. Falls that occur at the same level occur when a worker falls into or against objects above the same surface. Falls to a lower area is when a worker falls below their current walking/working surface.\nSlips may occur because of the following:\nLiquid spills on smooth floors or walking surfaces such as water, grease, mud, oil food, bodily fluids and other wet material is one cause of slips and falls. However, don’t think that just because there are no liquid spills, that the surface is slip-free; dry product spills often contribute to slips as falls as well as wet conditions. For example, smooth walking surfaces where dust, powder, dry granules, wood shavings, plastic wrapping or other dry material connect is likely to create an equally dangerous slip potential. Wet and dusty conditions are not the only reasons for slips; transitioning from one surface to another surface is another often causes slips as well. Be sure to train your workers to be careful when transitioning from carpeted floors to vinyl or other smooth surfaces – especially when they are carrying tools and materials.\nSome other common causes of slips are:\n- Highly polished floors such as granite, marble and ceramic tile.\n- Sloped walking surfaces\n- Loose, unanchored rugs or mats\n- Loose floorboards or shifting tiles\n- Ramps & gang planks without skid or slip-resistant surfaces\n- Metal surfaces\n- Dockboards & dock plates\n- Sidewalk & road covers\n- Mounting & dismounting vehicles & equipment\n- Climbing ladders\n- Loose, irregular surfaces such as gravel\n- Sloped and uneven terrain\n- Tree leaves, pine needles and other natural plant debris\nTrips often occur because of:\n- Uneven walking surfaces\n- Damaged steps\n- Debris accumulation\n- Various waste materials\n- Cables, chords, tools and materials\n- Protruding objects\n- Sidewalk / curb drop\n- Opened drawers / doors\n- Clutter, obstacles in aisles, walkway and work area\n- Sudden changes in elevation\n- Unmarked steps or ramps\n- Rumpled carpets, mats or rugs\n- Carpets with curled edges\n- Irregularities in walking surfaces\n- Missing or uneven brick pavers or floor tiles\nWhat if every one of the previously listed risk factors were non-existent, would the workforce be completely free of slips, trips and fall hazards? NO!\nHuman element is the one, unmeasurable, and unpredictable risk factor that must be considered when developing a training plan. For example, a worker walking on a perfectly even and perfectly stable working surface, who is carrying a generator that weighs 200 pounds, is at greater risk of slipping and falling than if he was walking on the same surface, and carrying nothing.\nHuman Risk Factors Include:\n- Lack of physical fitness\n- Stress or illness\n- Intoxication (alcohol, drugs & prescriptions)\n- Carrying heavy objects or two many\n- Situational Awareness – PAY ATTENTION\n- Poor lighting\n- Rain, sleet, snow and other bad weather\n- Poor housekeeping\n- Improper cleaning methods\n- Inadequate signage\nJust like any tool, or piece of equipment used on worksites, ladders must be inspected frequently for damage or defects – once you are on the ladder, it is too late.

Good housekeeping, shoe selection, walking surface maintenance and employee preparedness all play an important role in slip / fall prevention.\nWe have listed some industry best practices below to help you remain vigilant and free of falls in the workplace; we hope that our advice helps to raise awareness for slips, trips and fall injuries, and we hope that we help to people stay safe.\nSlips, Trips & Falls – Public Enemy No.1\nCompanies who practice good housekeeping have slip and fall injuries than the ones who pay less attention to maintaining a clean and safe walking / working environment.\nYour company can reduce slips and falls by following the following best practices:\n- Clean all spills immediately.\n- Mark spills and wet areas immediately with wet floor signage – block off area with caution tape if necessary.\n- Keep floor free of debris (sweep and mop frequently)\n- Mop floors during low traffic times, or when workers are on break to allow proper drying time.\n- Remove obstacles from walkways\n- Keep walkways free from clutter (including tools and jobsite materials)\n- Rugs & Carpeting – make sure edges that do not lay flat are taped down\n- Cabinets & Doors – keep doors closed at all times\n- Cables that cross walkways must be covered at all times\n- Working areas and walkways must be kept well lit\n- Replace faulty switches and burnt-out light bulbs immediately – improper lighting conditions may contribute to existing hazards and may prevent workers from noticing slip and trip hazards.\nThe most advanced flooring systems and the best non-slip shoes will not prevent slips and falls if good housekeeping practices are not a part of the culture. Maintaining a clean and tidy workplace should become such a routine practice, that cleaning becomes second nature. Every team member must participate in the advancement of good housekeeping.\n- Improperly maintained walking surfaces have the potential to cause slips and falls despite the best housekeeping habits. The following measures can be taken to add an additional level of protection against slips and falls.\n- Recoat or replace flooring\n- Install non-slip mats\n- Install pressure-sensitive abrasive strips or abrasive filled paint-on coating and metal or synthetic decking.\nSome work environments are slippery by nature, so extra care must be taken to prevent slips. For example, work environments that are oily or wet, or where workers spend considerable time outdoors have a reputation for being more slippery.\nThere is no shoe that works best for every scenario, so you should pay close attention to the nature of your specific workplace – and be sure to check the manufacture’s recommendation for what shoe is best for your particular workplace.\nYou can also reduce the risk of slipping on wet floor by:\n- Taking your time while walking\n- Pay attention to where you are going\n- Make wide turns at corners\n- Walk with your feel pointed slightly out\n- Adjust your cadence for the condition.\nYou can reduce the risk of tripping by:\n- Keep walking area free from debris, tools and materials\n- Keep flooring in good condition\n- Make sure the work area is well-lit\n- Be sure not to carry items that are too bulky or too heavy\nDelayed Compliance Dates:\nAlthough the final rule became effective on January 17, 2017, but some parts of the final rule have a delayed, or phased-in, compliance dates.\nMay 17, 2017 – Training workers on fall and equipment hazards\nNovember 20, 2017 – Inspection and certification of permanent building achorages\nNovember 19, 2018 – Installation of fall protection (personal fall arrest systems, ladder safety systems, cages, wells) on existing fixed ladders (over 24 feet) that do not have any fall protection\nNovember 19, 2018 –Installation of ladder safety or personal fall arrest systems on new fixed ladders (over 24 feet) and replacement ladders/ladder sections\nNovember 18, 2036 – Installation of ladder safety systems or personal fall arrest systems on all fixed ladders (over 24 feet)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b011cb09-454e-4788-9db5-2a920390756f>","<urn:uuid:d3167564-4645-4ba5-b18d-c533b3c63242>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do market conditions affect gold prices versus crude oil ETF prices?","answer":"Gold prices are heavily influenced by investor sentiment about economic health - prices rise when the economy appears unstable as investors seek protection from economic crisis or inflation. In contrast, crude oil ETFs like the United States Oil Fund (USO) trade like stocks, with values reflecting daily percentage changes in crude oil prices. While gold serves as a hedge against economic uncertainty, crude oil ETF prices are more directly tied to the underlying commodity's price movements. Trading requirements also differ - crude oil ETF trading requires a minimum $25,000 account balance in the US, while gold trading requirements vary by market maker and transaction type.","context":["How to Start Day Trading Crude Oil\nThe price of crude oil fluctuates each moment as it is publicly traded on an exchange. The price of crude is not only determined by global supply and demand and the fundamental outlook for the physical commodity, but also the outlook and supply of demand from traders. A day traders job is not to assess the \"real\" value of crude oil. Instead, day traders profit from daily fluctuations in the price of crude, attempting to make money whether it rises, falls or its value stays nearly the same.\nHow to Day Trade Crude Oil: Futures Markets\nDay trading crude oil is speculating on its short-term price movements. Physical crude oil isn't handled or taken possession of, rather all the trading transactions take place electronically, and only profits or losses are reflected in the trading account.\nThere are a number of ways to day trade crude oil. The main way is through a futures contract. A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell something—like crude oil, gold, or wheat—at a future date. Day traders close out all contracts (trades) each day and make a profit or loss on each trade based on the difference between the price they bought the contract and the price they sold it.\nCrude oil futures trade through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group). There are several types of crude oil, and contracts, which can be traded. There is a (Light Sweet) Crude Oil Futures Contract (CL) which represents 1,000 barrels of oil, and an E-Mini Crude Oil Futures Contract (QM), which represents 500 barrels of oil.\nOn the futures exchange, the price of oil fluctuates in $0.01 increments on the standard contract and $0.025 increments on the E-mini contract. This increment is called a \"tick\"—it's the smallest movement a futures contract can make. If you buy or sell a futures contract, how many ticks the price moves away from your entry price determines your profit or loss. To calculate your profit or loss (your trading platform shows you, but it is good to understand how it works), you'll first need to know the tick value of the contract you're trading.\n- For a standard crude oil contract (CL) the tick value is $10. This is because the contract represents 1,000 barrels of oil, and 1,000 barrels multiplied by the $0.01 tick size results in $10. That means for each contract, a one tick movement will result in a profit or loss of $10. If it moves 10 ticks, you win or lose $100. If it moves 10 ticks and you're holding 3 contracts, your profit or loss is $300. Note that crude oil can move several dollars a day (hundreds of ticks), resulting in massive profits or losses on a single day trade.\n- For an E-Mini crude oil contract (QM) the tick value is $12.50. This is because the contract represents 500 barrels of crude oil, and 500 barrels multiplied by the $0.025 tick size results in $12.50. That means for each contract, a one tick movement will result in a profit or loss of $12.50. If it moves 10 ticks, you win or lose $125. If it moves 10 ticks and you are holding 3 contracts, your profit or loss is $375.\nThe tick value in QM is not the same as CL, so CL will be more volatile than QM. For example, a $1 price move in crude is 100 ticks in CL, or a potential profit or loss or $1000 on one contract. A $1 move in QM is only 40 ticks ($1/$0.025), or a potential profit or loss of $500 on one contract.\nThe amount you need in your account to day trade a crude oil futures contract depends on your futures broker. NinjaTrader, for example, requires you have $1000 in your account to open a position for one Light Sweet Crude Oil contract. You also need enough in the account to accommodate for potential losses (need much more than $1000).\nTo day trade an E-Mini crude contract (QM), you need $500 in your account, plus additional funds to accommodate losses. The amount required by your broker to open a day trading position is called Intra-day margin; it varies by broker and is subject to change.\nThese figures assume you're day trading and closing out positions before the market closes each day. If you hold positions overnight, you are subject to initial margin and maintenance margin requirements, which will require you have more money in your account.\nHow to Day Trade Crude Oil - ETFs and/or Stock Market\nAnother way to day trade gold is through a fund which trades on a stock exchange, like the United States Oil Fund (USO) or the less popular S&P SGSCI Crude Oil Total Return Index ETN (OIL). If you have a stock trading account, you can trade the price movements in crude oil.\nThe value of the ETF and ETN are reflective of daily percentage price changes in crude oil.\nThe products trade like stocks. The minimum price movement is $0.01, therefore you make or lose $0.01 for each share you own each time the price changes by a penny. Stocks and ETFs are typically traded in 100 share blocks (called \"lots\") so if the price moves a penny and you're holding 100 shares, you make or lose $1. If the price moves $1, from $30 to $31, you make or lose $100 on your 100 share position. If you are holding 500 shares, you make or lose $500 on that same price move.\nThe amount you need in your account to day trade a crude oil ETF depends on the price of the ETF, your leverage, and position size.\nTo day trade stocks or ETFs in the US, you're required to have a $25,000 minimum balance in your account. Depending on how much income you want to generate and your leverage, you may wish to have more than $25,000 available to you. See Minimum Recommended Capital For Day Trading Stocks for guidance on how much capital you should start day trading ETFs and stocks with.","How Is The Live Spot Gold Price Calculated\nEvery precious metals market has a corresponding benchmark price that is set on a daily basis. These benchmarks are used mostly for commercial contracts and producer agreements. These benchmarks are calculated partly from trading activity in the spot market.\nThe spot price is determined from trading activity on Over-The-Counter decentralized markets. An OTC is not a formal exchange and prices are negotiated directly between participants with most of the transaction taking place electronically. Although these arent regulated, financial institutions play an important role, acting as market makers, providing a bid and ask price in the spot market.\nIs The Platinum Price Always Lower Than Gold And Palladium Prices\nNo. Although platinum has recently been trading a discount to its sister metals, that is historically unusual. Platinum rarely finds itself trailing behind both gold and palladium.\nAs recently as 2017, platinum traded at a steady premium to palladium. And as recently as 2014, platinum commanded a higher per-ounce price than gold.\nA case can be made that platinum is undervalued. It would certainly outperform the other metals if it begins to narrow the gaps and finally, perhaps, regain its old title as the priciest precious metal.\nWhat Makes Gold Prices To Fluctuate\nGold prices show the real state of a country’s economic health. When the prices for gold go up, it signals an unhealthy economy. This is because investors tend to buy more gold, to protect their wealth from an economic crisis or inflation. And as demand increases, so does the price. On the other hand, when the prices are low, the economy is in perfect health. This makes real estate, bonds, and stocks more profitable investments. Hence the demand for gold is low. The key takeaways are that gold prices reflect the thoughts and beliefs of commodity traders. For example, if the general perception of the economy is poor, they will buy more gold. If investors think that the economy is great, they buy less.\nAlso Check: Selling Rs3 Gold\nWill Gold Price Go Up In 2021 Depends On These Factors\nThe historic case for gold prices to move higher is its usefulness as a hedge against inflation. If the cost of living rises, the price of gold usually follows suit. However, inflation hasnt been much of a concern in 2020 as developed economies showed relatively low and stable levels of inflation.\nMost notably, the US Federal Reserve hinted throughout the months that inflation rates are the least of its concerns. But some experts and analysts believe that inflation rates are due for a rebound and investors are more optimistic that a bullish answer to will gold go upis the correct position.\nStock prices are also a factor in determining if a gold price increase in 2021 is likely. Major US stock indices soared to all-time highs and equity valuations certainly play a role in any gold price analysis. If investors believe that the gold price 2021 offers a better value versus some stocks that are up hundreds of percentage points then a rotation towards the commodity could be seen.\nPerhaps most important, the relationship between gold and the US dollar is a key determinant for future gold price expectation. The two asset classes have shown historically an inverse relationship so when the greenback rises in value, gold prices fall and vice versa.\nCrypto Price Prediction: $100000 Bitcoin Could Come Even Sooner Than You Think With Ethereum Leading The Way\nGold prices are also influenced by fear and uncertainty in the market. In 2009, at the height of the Great Recession, the Producer Price Index for gold rose 12.8%. Between 2008 and 2012, the PPI increased 101%, more than doubling in a span of only four years.\nTo fight the contractionary effects of a recession, central banks inject liquidity into the financial system. Inflation is a necessary side effect of pumping an economy with cash, which lowers the value of each dollar. Periods of monetary easing diminish investor confidence in the strength of the dollar and increase the demand for gold and silver, which are safe-haven alternatives to currencies and traditionally hold their value in weak economic environments.\nDuring the pandemic, investors have flocked to gold and silver bullion, gold stocks and exchange-traded funds to protect their wealth as trillions of dollars have flooded the U.S. economy in the form of quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus.\nIn April, Bank of America revised its initial 18-month gold price forecast from $2,000 to $3,000 per ounce. Analysts at the institution foresee long periods of inflation and sharp economic contractions combining to pump the value of gold and diminish the value of the U.S. dollar.\nAlthough nobody has a crystal ball to foresee the future price of an asset, signs currently point toward gold nearing or eclipsing the $2,500 resistance point sometime in 2020 or 2021.\nThe Downside Risk\nThe Bottom Line\nYou May Like: Buy Wow Gold Banned\nWhat Can Cause The Spot Gold Price To Change\nAny change or disruption to either the supply or demand for gold will move the spot price.\nIf a large gold deposit is discovered, the increased supply will cause the spot price to fall. The reverse is true if the gold supply decreases.\nAn increase in gold demand will also drive the spot price higher. Perhaps the demand is due to accelerating inflation or extreme economic uncertainty.\nSupply and demand are affected on a daily basis, meaning the gold spot price is constantly in flux.\nWhat Is Quantitative Easing\nQuantitative easing is a monetary policy tool used by central bankers in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The tool was first used in Japan but became a widely used term punned QE after former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke introduced the concept in the U.S. in response to the fall of major investment bank Lehman Brothers. Bernanke purchased bad debt off other major commercial banks in order to prevent them from defaulting, while simultaneously increasing the money supply. Since then, other central banks have implemented this tool including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.\nQE has risks including increasing inflation if too much money is created to purchase assets, or can fail if the money provided by central bankers to commercial banks doesnt trickle down to businesses or the average consumer.\nDon’t Miss: Gold In Grams\nWhat Is The Difference Between An Ounce And A Troy Ounce When Looking At A Gold Chart\nA troy ounce is used specifically in the weighing and pricing of precious metals and its use dates back to the Roman Empire when currencies were valued in weight. The process was carried over to the British Empire where one pound sterling was worth one troy pound of silver. The U.S. Mint adopted the troy ounce system in 1828.\nA troy ounce is about slightly heavier than an imperial ounce by about 10%. An imperial ounce equals 28.35 grams, while a troy ounce is equal to 31.1 grams.\nHow Gold Prices Are Determined Today\nSome people are not familiar with the notion that precious metal spot prices prices are largely determined by trading on the futures market. Because gold is a precious commodity, this trading takes places on the COMEX, the commodities exchange run by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group through the New York Mercantile Exchange . As hedgers and speculators enter into futures contracts, the balance of long and short positions moves the price of these contracts. This is why you often hear the net-long or net-short position of futures in the financial news this data is provided by the Commitment of Traders reports each week. The fluctuations of the price of gold futures contracts directly affects the spot price of gold that you see going up or down during the trading session.\n- The difference between a dealer’s Bid and Ask price.\n- Melt Value\n- The value of the metal content of a precious metal object, regardless of workmanship or rarity. The raw value of an object if it were melted down. Metal value is usually only calculated on the precious metal content of an item. For example, the melt value of a sterling silver coin only takes into account the 92.5% silver content of the coin, and ignores the 7.5% copper content.\nDon’t Miss: Golden Eagle Rdr2\nWhat Is The Ounce Of Gold Price\nThe gold spot price is typically reflecting a troy ounce of gold.\nThe spot price is the value of one troy ounce of gold on the over the counter market. However, understand that gold is not always sold by the ounce, although that is one of the most common methods. Gold can also be sold by the gram and by the kilo . So, by knowing the gold price per ounce, you know the baseline of what youll typically pay for one troy ounce of .999 fine gold from a bullion dealer .\nInvestors Use Gold Futures To Hedge Against Risk\nInvestors often use gold futures to hedge against risk. Provided that the price of gold remains relatively stable in its appreciation, gold futures can be a fantastic way to offset riskier investments, particularly those in the stock or cryptocurrency markets. Popular trading organizations often include gold futures as an example of one way investors can diversify their portfolios with a variety of exposure levels.\nThe current spot gold price on COMEX is $1845 as of 2/8/21. The exchange updates its spot gold price consistently. It is especially important that gold futures traders remain up-to-date on the latest spot gold price.\nRecommended Reading: Can You Get Banned For Buying Gold Osrs\nIs Gold Traded 24 Hours A Day\nYes. Gold trades on exchanges located around the world. Even when one exchange is closed for the night, there is another somewhere else that is active.\nElectronic trading of gold goes on continuously. This is reflected in the Globex gold price overseen by the CME Group. Globex prices are updated moment to moment based on futures trading.\n24-hour gold trading means that gold product prices always fluctuate.\nWhy Invest In Gold Bullion\nThere are a number of reasons why investors choose to put their money on gold bullion. One of the most popular uses of gold in the average portfolio is to hedge against risk. Over the past couple decades, the price of gold has risen relatively steadily. Gold is considered a low volatility asset, and its consistent rise in value is a massive tool for investors who want to mitigate the effects of fiat currency inflation. While the United States Dollar, the Great British Pound, and other currencies are likely to lose purchasing power over time due to inflation, gold experiences no such problem. Holding part of your portfolio in gold has long been recommended as a way to counter risk.\nAlso Check: War Thunder Unlimited Golden Eagles Hack Tool\nAdvantages To Buying Gold Futures Contracts\nOne big advantage to buying gold futures is that it allows investors to profit from quite a bit more gold than they could otherwise afford. Although it varies from exchange to exchange, traders often pay just two percent of the price of the gold theyre purchasing upfront through a downpayment. The disadvantage comes from the natural volatility of gold as a commodity. Gold futures allow investors to make significant profit with little upfront payment, but they also allow for massive losses.\nWhy Is Gold Mostly Quoted In Us Dollars\nWhile you can buy gold in any currency in the world, it is important to realize that ultimately everything is based on the value of the U.S. dollar. Given that the U.S. is the worlds biggest economy and one of the most stable, the dollar has become a reserve currency, meaning that it is held in significant quantities by other governments and major institutions. Reserve currencies are used to settle international transactions. Since the start of the 20th century, the U.S. dollar has been the dominant reserve currency around the world.\nDon’t Miss: Dial Gold Bar Soap For Tattoo\nAdvantages To Buying Gold Bars\nOne downside of buying gold coins is that they often come with a relatively high premium over the spot gold price. Gold bars, on the other hand, are often minted with simple designs and sold at a price very close to spot. If youre wondering what types of gold bullion products have the lowest premium or dollar amount over the spot price of gold, the answer is probably gold bars. This means that investors who want to maximize the amount of gold for their money should generally consider investing in gold bars instead of coins.\nThe main advantages of buying gold bars:\n- Low premium. Because the cost to produce and design gold bars is considerably lower than coins, most gold exchanges are able to bring you gold bars at a price commiserate with the current spot gold price. This means that the best value when investing in gold typically comes from gold bar purchases.\n- Weight variety.Gold bars come in a variety of different sizes. Years ago, gold bars were only sold in large, industrial sizes to institutional investors. Today, retail investors can purchase gold bars in hundred ounce, ten ounce, one ounce, and even 1/10 ounce denominations! This provides investors with greater liquidity and control over their investments.\nQ: How Much Money Do I Need To Buy Gold\nA: This depends on a few different factors. The type of gold investment youre making, the quantity, and your method of payment all factor into the total cost for a gold purchase. You can actually buy fractional denominations of gold at an extremely low cost. Gold ETFs can also be purchased with relatively low upfront cost.\nRecommended Reading: How To Safely Buy Wow Gold\nStock Picks And Investing Trends From Cnbc Pro:\n“We should be running into what is typically the strongest period for gold demand in terms of jewelry in the year for the next five to six months and I think that’s part of the reason why gold is where it is today, comfortably above that $1,800 level, which it’s found very difficult to surmount during the summer and into the fall,” Milling-Stanley said. “But here we are, wintertime. Gold’s doing very, very well.”\nGraniteShares founder and CEO Will Rhind saw even more runway ahead.\nHis firm is behind the GraniteShares Gold Trust , the fifth-largest gold ETF on the market by assets under management, according to ETF Database.\n“I’m very positive on the outlook for gold for next year and the reason is because of what’s going on with the macro environment, particularly inflation,” Rhind said, also highlighting the $1,800 level.\n“We obviously had the tapering announcement last week and those that expected the gold price to fall were surprised when it actually mounted a fairly significant rally and I think that’s in a way due to, still, the dovishness coming out of central banks” in the U.S. and U.K., he said.\nCombine rate hike-resistant central banks with a supply chain crunch and inflation that may not be as transitory as expected, and it could attract even more buyers, Rhind said.\nHow Often Does The Spot Gold Price Change\nIf youve done any research on the spot gold price you might be wondering how often the spot price of gold changes? The answer is very often. Gold is shifting in price constantly, with most exchanges updating their spot gold prices multiple times throughout each day. Always check here before buying any new gold item for the latest updates on the spot price of gold today. Big world events and political decisions almost always have some sort of an impact on the spot gold price, so its important to be aware of whats going on in the bullion market in order to make an informed purchasing decision.\nDon’t Miss: Buy Oz Of Gold\nWhen Is The Gold Price The Strongest\nIt can be difficult to predict the next major rally in gold as it is strongly driven by sentiment. Gold does well in period of high uncertainty, a shifting inflationary environment and during periods of currency debasement however, historically, there have been high and low seasonal period in the gold market. Historically, September is golds strongest month. Many western jeweler start to build their gold inventories during this time to prepare for the holiday season. The next strongest month is January, which traditionally sees strong buying among Eastern nations ahead of the Lunar New Year. The worst month has historically been March, April and then June.\nDo Gold And Silver Prices Move Together\nYes, in general, the prices of gold and silver tend to trend in the same direction. Silver is the more volatile of the two metals and therefore tends to amplify golds moves on both the upside and the downside.\nThat said, there are periods when silver may decouple from gold. For example, a physical shortage particular to the silver market could cause silver prices to skyrocket independent of gold. And in the event of a financial crisis, gold may benefit from its safe-haven status while silver suffers from a hit to industrial demand.\nDon’t Miss: Kay Jewelers $19.99\nHow Is The Spot Gold Price Determined\nMultiple factors are taken into account in determining the current spot gold price. Market speculation plays a huge role, but golds value has also been historically linked to uncertainty in the traditional stock market.

{"question":"Why does a furnace make banging sounds when starting, and what heating safety measures are critical during winter?","answer":"A banging or loud pop when a furnace starts can indicate dirty burners causing an ignition delay, which leads to gas buildup and small explosions that could crack the heat exchanger - this requires immediate professional attention. For heating safety during winter, it's essential to ensure proper ventilation when using alternative heating sources like emergency generators, fireplaces, wood stoves, or space heaters. These devices must be properly ventilated and generators operated outdoors to prevent dangerous carbon monoxide buildup. Additionally, having sufficient heating fuel and proper maintenance of heating equipment is crucial for safe operation during cold weather.","context":["Whether winter is gearing up or winding down, nobody wants to be pulled from a peaceful evening binge watching Netflix to deal with the sudden demonstrations of an ailing or aging furnace. A furnace that’s leaking, whistling, banging or just not keeping you warm is enough to ruin anyone’s mood.\nYou can avoid a lot of unexpected winter mishaps with a regular maintenance program. But what if you haven’t exactly been diligent about it? Or what if you know that your furnace is on the way out but have been trying to squeeze whatever juice is left before replacing it?\nThese are some common furnace problems that will make themselves obvious and require attention. We’ve included some possible culprits and a few dire warnings for when you should stop and call a professional for help immediately.\n1. Why Is My Furnace Leaking?\nA puddle of water under any appliance usually isn’t a good sign, but it’s not necessarily the end of the world. You can expect a certain amount of condensation from high-efficiency gas furnaces. This condensations is channeled into a floor drain so a clogged drain may be the cause of your “leak”. Fixing the leak is a simple matter of cleaning the drain. Clogged condensation tubing or even a break in the line are other common causes.\nA faulty secondary heat exchanger can also result in leaking. If that’s the case, and especially if your furnace is starting to show its age, then replacing the furnace is likely to be far more cost-effective than repairing the heat exchanger.\nIf your air conditioner and furnace share an internal drain, a clog in that drain could be the cause of water buildup as well.\nOr the leak might have nothing to do with your furnace at all. If you have a humidifier, the leak could be coming from a clog or damaged line in that unit. A professional will know what to look for and be able to remedy the problem quickly.\n2. Why Is My Furnace Making That Noise?\nIt could be a whistling, buzzing or vibrating noise. Or your furnace could just be louder than usual, gone past “white noise” into “red rage” as you grab an aspirin for your headache.\nStrange noises could have any number of causes, from the simple to the dangerous. Once you identify the noise, be cautious about how you proceed, and when in doubt always call a professional.\nWhistling – especially coming from vents – could simply mean that there are gaps around them where air is getting sucked through. Tighten the screws or replace the grate if it’s damaged or bent.\nWhistling can also be caused by dirty filters, as your furnace tries to pull air in through any tiny hole that isn’t clogged. Change your filters to see if that alleviates the problem. Your health will thank you!\nA rattling or vibrating sound can mean that something is loose. Loose ducts or pipes, or even the furnace itself rattling against the floor can be the culprit. Even the motor bearings may be to blame. As they wear out with age, the motor may “bounce” as it runs, causing a rattling sound.\nA gap between the duct and the furnace can be easily solved with a bit of duct tape. Screws around the ducts can be tightened to stop rattling. If motor bearings are the problem, you’ll probably need a professional to replace them.\n3. Why Does My Furnace Make a “Bang” When It Turns On?\nA bang is definitely a noise, but we gave this its own category because unlike annoying but generally harmless rattles, whistles and buzzes, this sound can be potentially dangerous.\nA bang or loud “pop” coming from your furnace can mean that the furnace burners are dirty. The dirt causes an ignition delay, which in turn causes a buildup of excess gas. The bang is a result of the gas finally igniting in what amounts to a small explosion. This can actually crack your heat exchanger, which is an expensive repair – not to mention the danger of hosting a mini-explosion every time your furnace fires up.\nIf you hear a bang, don’t mess around. Turn the furnace off and get a professional in to look at it.\n4. Why Won’t My Furnace Turn On?\nFew things make your heart – or home – run as cold as turning on the furnace to the sound of… absolutely nothing. If this happens to you, start by checking some of the obvious problem spots.\nFirst, be sure your thermostat is set to “heat”. You’d be surprised how many times this simple mistake can cause panic! Then try raising the temperature to see if it kicks on eventually. If that happens, the problem is likely the thermostat sensor and not the furnace.\nNext, check for a tripped circuit breaker, which can happen especially after a storm or power outage. If it’s early in the season and you’re turning the furnace on for the first time, check to be sure that your friendly neighborhood rodent hasn’t chewed through any of the wires. Double check that none have become corroded in summer humidity.\nYou can also check to see if the pilot light is on. It’s not uncommon for them to blow out, and you can relight yours with a match if necessary.\nOf course, the issue could also be with a malfunctioning motor, transformer, control board or other component. Call in a professional if you can’t identify and resolve an obvious problem.\n5. Why Is My Furnace Blowing Cold Air?\nA furnace that turns on but won’t blow hot air is just as aggravating as one that won’t turn on at all.\nIf the air is warm but not hot, the problem could be the filters again. Clogged filters can cause a host of problems, from poor efficiency to damaged components. If it’s been a while and yours are looking worse for the wear, swap them out for high quality new filters and see if that helps.\nA dirty burner assembly could be another cause of the problem, especially if you aren’t taking regular care of your system. Carbon particles build up over time, eventually preventing the jets from igniting. Have a professional clean the assembly before it becomes so clogged that the furnace stops blowing any warm air at all.\nOther component failures – like a bad air handler – can also be to blame. That can lead to all sorts of other breakdowns, so don’t delay in having a professional clean and inspect your system.\n6. Why Won’t My Furnace Turn Off?\nIt’s one thing when your furnace won’t turn on, leaving you in the cold. It’s another entirely when it won’t turn off, leaving you to lament your next energy bill.\nBefore you panic, start with the most common and obvious causes. First, check the thermostat to see if your system fan is set to “on.” It’s an easy thing to miss, but if your fan is set to “on” then it’s going to stay on, making you think your furnace is constantly running. If you want the blower to turn off when the furnace turns off, then set the fan to “auto.”\nAnother common cause is one you should be familiar with by now – clogged filters. Considering how many times bad filters have come up as the cause of a furnace issue, it might be a good idea to get in the habit of changing yours regularly!\nClogged filters restrict, air flow, which can cause the temperature inside the furnace to rise. As a result, the safety switch remains open so the fan can run continuously to regulate the temperature. If that happens, chances are your furnace is overheating and that can cause serious damage unless it’s remedied.\n7. Why Does My Furnace Keep Turning On And Off?\nWhen your furnace constantly turns on and off it’s called “cycling.” That not only puts wear and tear on your system but requires more electricity and can increase energy bills. Cycling typically happens when the furnace overheats, which triggers a safety mechanism that shuts down the furnace. After a short cooling down period, the furnace starts up again and loops through the same cycle.\nAs we mentioned previously, clogged filters can be one cause of overheating. The blower stays on in an attempt to regulate temperature and the furnace cycles on and off repeatedly. Blockage in ductwork or at the exhaust vent or chimney can also cause cycling. Check for things like debris blown there after a storm, leaves, or birds’ nests.\nBut there could be a more ominous cause of cycling – a leaking heat exchanger. Not only can that cause your furnace to overheat but it can emit deadly carbon monoxide gas. Don’t fool around with this one. If you notice your furnace turning on and off constantly, have a professional take a look immediately.\nYour furnace is an investment that should keep you warm, safe and comfortable through many winters.

Overnight low temperatures will likely drop below zero.\nThe coldest periods are forecast to be Wednesday night into Thursday morning and Thursday night into Friday morning. Another bout of especially cold wind chills is possible Saturday night into Sunday morning and Sunday night into Monday morning.\n\"Temperatures this cold can be extremely dangerous to people and their property if the proper safety precautions are not taken,\" Warren said. \"We are urging residents to dress appropriately if they have to be outside and to ensure you have sufficient heating fuel and properly functioning appliances to prevent problems like frozen pipes or carbon monoxide leaks.\"\nWith this type of weather, frostbite and hypothermia are possible for those without proper protection from the cold. To stay safe, the East Kingston Fire Department asks that residents follow these tips from the New Hampshire Emergency Management Agency:\nMinimize outdoor activities for the whole family, including pets.\nIf outside, dress in several layers of loose-fitting, lightweight clothing instead of a single heavy layer. Outer garments should be tightly woven and water repellent. Wear a hat, mittens (not gloves) and sturdy waterproof boots to protect your extremities. Cover your mouth with a scarf to protect your lungs.\nBe a good neighbor. Check with elderly or disabled relatives and neighbors to ensure their safety.\nAdditionally, because of the extreme cold, other areas of your home and vehicles may be affected:\nIncreased fire risk due to unsafe/improper use of alternative heating sources or people trying to thaw frozen pipes with blowtorches or similar devices.\nIf you turn on a faucet and only a trickle comes out, suspect a frozen pipe. Locate the area of the water pipe that might be frozen. Likely places include pipes running against exterior walls or where your water service enters your home through the foundation.\nApply heat to the section of pipe using an electric heating pad wrapped around the pipe, an electric hair dryer, or wrapping pipes with towels soaked in hot water. Do not use a blowtorch, kerosene or propane heater, charcoal stove, or other open flame devices. A blowtorch can make water in a frozen pipe boil and cause the pipe to explode. All open flames in homes present a serious fire danger, as well as a severe risk of exposure to lethal carbon monoxide.\nPossible increase in incidents of carbon monoxide poisoning from unsafe/improper use of alternative heating sources.\nEnsure you have sufficient heating fuel, as well as alternate emergency heating equipment in case you lose electricity.\nWhen utilizing alternate heating sources, such as an emergency generator, your fireplace, wood stove or space heater, make sure they are properly ventilated and always operate a generator outdoors and away from your home. Improper use of heating devices can lead to dangerous carbon monoxide buildup in the home.\nMake sure your car is properly winterized. Keep the gas tank at least half-full.

{"question":"What's the difference between how bacteria and industrial hydrogenation processes add hydrogen to different substances?","answer":"Bacteria and industrial hydrogenation processes represent distinct approaches to adding hydrogen to substances. Bacteria, particularly rhizobia in symbiotic relationships with legumes, naturally convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia (NH3) through biological processes, which other bacteria then convert to nitrates. In contrast, industrial hydrogenation requires metal catalysts (such as platinum, palladium, rhodium, or ruthenium) to facilitate the addition of hydrogen to unsaturated organic compounds. The industrial process typically needs specific conditions - temperatures below 480°C and often high pressures - to work effectively. Without metal catalysts, virtually no reaction occurs between hydrogen and organic compounds at lower temperatures. The industrial process is highly controlled and can be adjusted for specific applications, while bacterial processes occur naturally as part of biological cycles.","context":["To use all functions of this page, please activate cookies in your browser.\nWith an accout for my.chemeurope.com you can always see everything at a glance – and you can configure your own website and individual newsletter.\n- My watch list\n- My saved searches\n- My saved topics\n- My newsletter\nHydrogenation is a class of chemical reactions which result in an addition of hydrogen (H2) usually to unsaturated organic compounds. Typical substrates include alkenes, alkynes, ketones, nitriles, and imines. Most hydrogenations involve the direct addition of diatomic hydrogen (H2) but some involve the alternative sources of hydrogen, not H2: these processes are called transfer hydrogenations. The reverse reaction, removal of hydrogen, is called dehydrogenation. A reaction involving hydrogen and cleavage of a carbon-oxygen bond or carbon-nitrogen bond is called Hydrogenolysis. Hydrogenation differs from protonation or hydride addition (e.g. use of sodium borohydride): in hydrogenation, the products have the same charge as the reactants.\nThe classical example of a hydrogenation is the addition of hydrogen on unsaturated bonds between carbon atoms, converting alkenes to alkanes. A simple example is the hydrogenation of maleic acid to succinic acid depicted on the right. Numerous important applications are found in the petrochemical, pharmaceutical and food industries.\nAdditional recommended knowledge\nHydrogenation has three components:\nThe largest scale technological uses of H2 are the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions associated with both heavy and fine chemicals industries. Hydrogenation is the addition of H2 to unsaturated organic compounds such as alkenes to give alkanes and aldehydes to give alcohols. Hydrogenation reactions require metal catalysts, often those composed of platinum or similar precious metals.\nAn important characteristic of alkene and alkyne hydrogenations both homogeneous and heterogeneous is that hydrogen addition takes place with syn addition with hydrogen entering from the least hindered side.\nWith rare exception, no reaction below 480 °C occurs between H2 and organic compounds in the absence of metal catalysts. The catalyst simultaneously binds both the H2 and the unsaturated substrate and facilitates their union. Platinum group metals, particularly platinum, palladium, rhodium and ruthenium, are highly active catalysts. Highly active catalysts operate at lower temperatures and lower pressures of H2. Non-precious metal catalysts, especially those based on nickel (such as Raney nickel and Urushibara nickel) have also been developed as economical alternatives but they are often slower or require higher temperatures. The trade-off is activity (speed of reaction) vs. cost of the catalyst and cost of the apparatus required for use of high pressures.\nTwo broad families of catalysts are known - homogeneous and heterogeneous. Homogeneous catalysts dissolve in the solvent that contains the unsaturated substrate. Heterogeneous catalysts are solids that are suspended in the same solvent with the substrate or are treated with gaseous substrate. In the pharmaceutical industry and for special chemical applications, soluble \"\"homogeneous\"\" catalyst are sometimes employed, such as the rhodium-based compound known as Wilkinson's catalyst, or the iridium-based Crabtree's catalyst.\nThe activity and selectivity of catalysts can be adjusted by changing the environment around the metal, i.e. the coordination sphere. Different faces of a crystalline heterogeneous catalyst display distinct activities, for example. Similarly, heterogeneous catalysts are affected by their supports, i.e. the material upon with the heterogeneous catalyst is bound. Homogeneous catalysts are affected by their ligands. In many cases, highly empirical modifications involve selective \"poisons.\" Thus, a carefully chosen catalyst can be used to hydrogenate some functional groups without affecting others, such as the hydrogenation of alkenes without touching aromatic rings, or the selective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes using Lindlar's catalyst. For prochiral substrates, the selectivity of the catalyst can be adjusted such that one enantiomeric product is produced.\nMechanism of reaction\nBecause of its technological relevance, metal-catalyzed “activation” of H2, has been the subject of considerable study, focusing on the reaction mechanisms of by which metals mediate these reactions. First of all isotope labeling using deuterium can be used to determine the regiochemistry of the addition:\nEssentially, the metal binds to both components to give an intermediate alkene-metal(H)2 complex. The general sequence of reactions is:\nPreceding the oxidative addition of H2 is the formation of a dihydrogen complex.\nThe obvious source of H2 is the gas itself, often under pressure. Hydrogen can also be transferred from hydrogen-donor molecules, such as hydrazine, dihydronaphthalene, dihydroanthracene, isopropanol, and formic acid. Transfer hydrogenation can be metal catalysed. Hydrogenation does proceed from some hydrogen donors without catalysts, examples being diimide and aluminium isopropoxide.\nThe reaction is carried out at different temperatures and pressures depending upon the substrate. Hydrogenation is a strongly exothermic reaction. In the hydrogenation of vegetable oils and fatty acids, for example, the heat released is about 25 kcal per mole (105 kJ/mol), sufficient to raise the temperature of the oil by 1.6-1.7 °C per iodine number drop.\nAlkynes can be selectively converted into alkenes in a so-called semihydrogenation, for instance with the compound Ethyl 2-Butynoate and catalyst palladium on barium sulfate and quinoline (which deactivates the catalyst enhancing chemoselectivity):\nor with 4-(trimethylsilyl)-3-butyn-1-ol:\nIn the food industry\nHydrogenation is widely applied to the processing of vegetable oils and fats. Complete hydrogenation converts unsaturated fatty acids to saturated ones. In practice the process is not usually carried to completion. Since the original oils usually contain more than one double bond per molecule (that is, they are poly-unsaturated), the result is usually described as partially hydrogenated vegetable oil; that is some, but usually not all, of the double bonds in each molecule have been reduced. This is done by restricting the amount of hydrogen (or reducing agent) allowed to react with the fat.\nHydrogenation results in the conversion of liquid vegetable oils to solid or semi-solid fats, such as those present in margarine. Changing the degree of saturation of the fat changes some important physical properties such as the melting point, which is why liquid oils become semi-solid. Semi-solid fats are preferred for baking because the way the fat mixes with flour produces a more desirable texture in the baked product. Since partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are cheaper than animal source fats, are available in a wide range of consistencies, and have other desirable characteristics (e.g., increased oxidative stability (longer shelf life)), they are the predominant fats used in most commercial baked goods. Fat blends formulated for this purpose are called shortenings.\nA side effect of incomplete hydrogenation having implications for human health is the isomerization of the remaining unsaturated carbon bonds. The cis configuration of these double bonds predominates in the unprocessed fats in most edible fat sources, but incomplete hydrogenation partially converts these molecules to trans isomers, which have been implicated in circulatory diseases including heart disease (see trans fats). The catalytic hydrogenation process favors the conversion from cis to trans bonds because the trans configuration has lower energy than the natural cis one. At equilibrium, the trans/cis isomer ratio is about 2:1. Food legislation in the US and codes of practice in EU has long required labels declaring the fat content of foods in retail trade, and more recently, have also required declaration of the trans fat content.\nIn 2006, New York City adopted the US's first major municipal ban on most artificial trans fats in restaurant cooking.\nThe earliest hydrogenation is that of platinum catalyzed addition of hydrogen to oxygen in the Döbereiner's lamp, a device commercialized as early as 1823. The French chemist Paul Sabatier is considered the father of the hydrogenation process. In 1897 he discovered that the introduction of a trace of nickel as a catalyst facilitated the addition of hydrogen to molecules of gaseous carbon compounds in what is now known as the Sabatier process. For this work Sabatier won half of the 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Wilhelm Normann was awarded a patent in Germany in 1902 and in Britain in 1903 for the hydrogenation of liquid oils using hydrogen gas, which was the beginning of what is now a very large industry world wide. The commercially very important Haber-Bosch process (ammonia hydrogenation) was first described in 1905 and less so Fischer-Tropsch process (carbon monoxide hydrogenation) in 1922. Another commercial application is the oxo process (1938), a hydrogen mediated coupling of aldehydes with alkenes. Wilkinson's catalyst was the first homogeneous catalyst developed in the 1960s and Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation (1987) one of the first applications in asymmetric synthesis. A 2007 review article advocated the use of more hydrogenations in C-C coupling reactions like the oxo process.\nAlthough for all practical purposes hydrogenation requires a metal catalyst there exist some metal-free catalytic systems that are investigated in academic research. One such system for reduction of ketones consists of tert-butanol and potassium tert-butoxide and very high temperatures. The reaction depicted below describes the hydrogenation of benzophenone:\n|This article is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.

Nitrogen gas (N2) spewed forth from the bowels of hot young planet Earth 5 billion years ago to become a defining element of the atmosphere. Nitrogen comprises 78 percent of the gasses that swirl invisibly around us and permeates our very essence.\nNitrogen is a part of all living cells. It is a building block of amino acids and nucleic acids, the stuff of proteins and genes. Nitrogen is essential to metabolic processes involved in the synthesis and transfer of energy. It is a part of chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants that enables photosynthesis. Nitrogen speeds plant growth, increases seed and fruit production, and improves the quality of leaf and forage crops.\nBut it is its very nature that caused the National Organic Program to ban most forms of nitrogen fertilizer from use on certified organic farms, deeming it unsustainable and damaging to the environment.\nThe reason why stems from a quirk of evolution. Life emerged and refined itself beneath a canopy of nitrogen gas, yet few organisms can secure the nitrogen they need for healthy growth from the atmosphere.\nTriple chemical bonds between the two atoms of the gaseous N2 molecule render atmospheric nitrogen inert or incapable of linking with atoms of other elements; nitrogen gas simply does not participate in any chemical reactions at room temperature or even at the higher temperatures found in small fires. Before life can make use of atmospheric nitrogen it must be \"fixed\" (a rather confusing term for the process of breaking nitrogen atoms apart) so that the nitrogen atoms can combine with atoms of different elements.\nOnly two natural phenomena can make the fix: lightning and bacteria. Lightning's powerful flashes cleave the bonds of nitrogen molecules in the surrounding air. Set free, the nitrogen atoms combine with oxygen and rain upon the Earth as nitrates (NO3-) -- a form of nitrogen that plants can absorb. Lightning contributes about 10 million metric tons of total fixed nitrogen per year for use by plants and animals.\nA few types of bacteria generate enough energy by oxidizing or \"burning\" carbohydrates to fix atmospheric nitrogen as well. The most familiar of these is rhizobium, which forms symbiotic relationships with members of the legume plant family. The bacteria convert molecules of nitrogen trapped in air pockets in the soil into ammonia (NH3), which other types of bacteria then convert into nitrates. Scientists estimate that microorganisms add approximately 140 million metric tons of fixed nitrogen to the soil every year.\nOnce fixed nitrogen has been taken up by plant roots, it can pass up the food chain to animals until it returns to the soil embedded in excretions and dead plant and animal material. Bacteria will decompose the fallen organic materials and recycle the nitrogen back to nitrate form for reuse by plants. In the process, some of the nitrogen will be converted into nitrogen gas and return to the atmosphere, completing the cycle from atmosphere to soil and back again.\nUntil the 20th century, farmers seeking to provide sufficient nitrogen to their crops dug cover crops, manures or compost into their soils and relied upon soil microbes to make the nitrogen in these materials available to plants' roots.\nThen, in 1909, German physical chemist Fritz Haber developed a high-temperature, high-pressure process to fix atmospheric nitrogen in his lab. Another German chemist, Carl Bosch, soon expanded Haber's process to a factory scale. Known as the Haber-Bosch process, industrial fixation of nitrogen combines atmospheric nitrogen and hydrogen into ammonia, the basis for all synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Natural gas is most often the source of the hydrogen.\nImagine the power now vested in humankind. With the ability to fix our own nitrogen we could free ourselves from dependence upon lightning and microbial masses and ramp up agricultural productivity to feed a hungry world. Perhaps the human species could yet outwit the Malthusian math that predicted that population growth would always outstrip our ability to increase food production. Indeed, so marvelous was this alchemy that both Haber and Bosch were awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry.\nImagine now, just a little less than 100 years later and as world hunger continues to rise, asking farmers to stop using industrially fixed nitrogen. It's a wonder that the organic movement ever got off the ground.\nThe National Organics Program, which regulates the use of the organic label in the United States, prohibits the use of synthetic substances unless their use is specifically allowed via exemption, an exemption not granted for synthetic nitrogen fertilizer.\nThe reasons why are of such import that they alone should set off a stampede to the nearest organic farmer's market.\nReason No. 1 is that synthetic nitrogen fertilizers are not sustainable. Building an agricultural system based upon industrially fixed nitrogen makes our ability to feed ourselves dependent upon a non-renewable fossil fuel and upon the wisdom, benevolence and cooperation of heads of state and multinational petroleum companies.\nRemember that natural gas is a key component of the Haber-Bosch process and accounts for 70 to 90 percent of the cost of nitrogen fertilizer production. Natural gas is found either dissolved in crude oil, or as a gas cap above reservoirs of oil. Due to the high cost of shipping natural gas, fertilizer plants are located where the gas is relatively abundant and cheap. Venezuela, Trinidad and Argentina are big producers. So are Russia, China and the Persian Gulf countries. According to the Fertilizer Institute, the United States was the largest importer of nitrogen fertilizers in 2002, importing 6.6 million metric tons of nitrogen or slightly over half of its total nitrogen fertilizer needs (approximately 12 million tons per year).\nSynthetic nitrogen fertilizers also fail to pass muster because of the environmental damage done when we pump enormous quantities of nitrates into the natural atmospheric and biological cycling of nitrogen. Overuse of nitrogen fertilizers are a primary cause of \"dead zones\" in coastal waters because nitrates are highly soluble; any nitrates not taken up by plant roots move quickly down through the root zone and enter ground water. When nitrate-laden rivers enter bays and estuaries, the excess nitrogen can cause larger than normal algae blooms. Decomposing algae draws oxygen from the water. Too large a drawdown of oxygen renders the water incapable of supporting most aquatic fish and animal life; anything that cannot swim or crawl out of the dead zone suffocates. The Mississippi River fertilizes a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico that fluctuates in size from 3,000 to 8,000 square miles.\nNitrates may create a dead zone of sorts on the land as well. Epidemiological studies have linked nitrates in drinking water to reproductive problems and bladder and ovarian cancer. When nitrate-contaminated well water is mixed with infant formula and fed to babies, the infants can suffer from methemoglobinemia, or blue baby syndrome. The nitrates decrease the oxygen-carrying capacity of infant's blood, causing them to develop a peculiar blue-gray skin color and to become lethargic and irritable. If the condition is not treated rapidly, it can quickly progress to coma or death.\nIf you're feeling a need to take a deep breath, don't. Oxidized forms of nitrogen -- often released when fertilizer is applied -- contribute to the formation of smog. Smog increases the incidence of asthma and chronic respiratory diseases, and can worsen viral infections. When nitrogen oxides rise to the midlevel atmosphere, they serve as a greenhouse gas, contributing to global warming. In the upper atmosphere, oxidized nitrogen destroys ozone. Holes rent in the stratospheric ozone permit more ultraviolet light to reach the Earth's surface, increasing the incidence of skin cancers.\nFinally, nitrogen oxides also contribute to acid rain, reacting with water in the atmosphere to form acidic compounds. When the compounds rain on or wash into lakes and rivers, they jeopardize fish, plant and bacteria populations that are sensitive to changes in water pH. As it percolates through the soil, acid rain leaches nutrients such as calcium, magnesium and potassium out of the root zone and mobilizes aluminum, which inhibits root growth.\nFar more than an arbitrary distinction between natural and synthetic, the National Organic Program's ban on industrially fixed nitrogen is key to creating agricultural systems that don't depend upon increasingly scarce fossil fuels and that don't degrade the environment. Nitrogen is natural: an integral part of the systems of life on Earth. As such, artificially ramping up its availability jeopardizes the integrity of these very systems.\nPermission granted to DIrt Doctor, Inc. from the author Deborah K. Rich to use the article.

{"question":"As a football coach, I'd like to understand the key differences between defensive and offensive preparation in football. What makes one more complex than the other?","answer":"According to Hall of Fame Coach Joe Gibbs, offensive preparation is more complex than defensive preparation. While defense mainly involves setting a plan and reacting to what happens on the field, offense requires managing numerous intricate details including blocking schemes, pass protections, blitz pickups, pass patterns, reads, and adjustments. This complexity is further evidenced by how NFL teams must carefully prepare offensive linemen, teaching them complex pass protections, blitz protection schemes, and adjustments in both run and pass games. The challenge is particularly notable given that many college players aren't ready for NFL-level offensive complexity when they arrive from spread offense systems.","context":["INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The spread offenses that dominate the NCAA produce a parade of points but also prospects that aren't quite ready for the NFL.

And yeah, it's not football, you can't see their toughness and everything like that like you can on tape, but the physiology of how a guy moves, sometimes you have to send a guy down there to see how they move.\"\nThey look for fluid footwork and flexibility in addition to seeing how strong and smart they are.\nIT'S EDUCATED GUESSES\n\"There are colleges that are wide open and throw the ball 100 times, so you don't get to evaluate every technique that they're going to be taught here,\" Bengals personnel director Duke Tobin said. \"You've got to kind of project them in. You've got to project traits. You've got to project size, strength, movement. You've got to project is he an aware player? Can he react quickly? If those are all yes, then you feel pretty confident that he can come in and run the techniques that you're going to have him run.\"\nProjecting was more of a buzzword at the NFL scouting combine this month than ever before.\n\"It's easy when you can see a guy go do exactly what you're going to ask him to do and you can evaluate that, judge that. It becomes a little bit more interesting when you have to project, and that's part of our business,\" said Texans GM Rick Smith.\n\"It still boils down to you want an athletic guy, a guy that has strength and power and smarts and movement,\" Buccaneers GM Jason Licht said. \"So, if you can see those things ... and you can. You just don't see it or identify it as quickly as you did in the past. But you can still see it. It just makes it more challenging.\"\nBRAIN POWER IS ALSO KEY\nRams coach Sean McVay said as important as athleticism is the academic side because of \"all the different things that they have to handle with blitz protection and pickups and pass pro, being able to adjust in the run game.\"\nSo they want to see the linemen get low for leverage and then see what they have \"above the neck,\" McVay said.\nNFL Network draft analyst Mike Mayock said the college O-linemen aren't \"used to the physicality of the NFL game in a three-point stance, and they're not used to how complex the pass protections are, and I think it slows them all down.\"\nThere are exceptions such as Titans tackle Jack Conklin , from Michigan State, and Lions tackle Taylor Decker, of Ohio State, who came more conventional, power run offenses.\nMore and more raw rookies, however, are getting essentially a redshirt year like Cardinals tackle D.J. Humphries, a first-round pick in 2015 who debuted in 2016.\n\"I loved him coming out (of Florida),\" Cardinals coach Bruce Arians said. \"We knew what we were getting, a very young guy who had very little skill set and a lot of athleticism. It took him a year to get the skill set. We knew he had the heart. To take these guys and teach them how to play, to hear a play in the huddle and decipher the information, to go up and get down in a stance, to run block that way, to get off on a hard count — it's very hard for these guys.\n\"They struggle all spring and a lot of times, they really struggle in training camp because that's the first time they've put on pads and actually hit anybody. That's a problem with our game, we just don't get to practice enough in pads with these young kids.\"\nA NEW CROP\nArians, however, isn't one to criticize the college coaches for not preparing these players for the pros.\n\"No, their job is to win games and I'd be doing the same damn thing if I was coaching in college with the 20-hour rule,\" Arians said. \"I'd get the best athlete I could, put him back there (at quarterback) and spread it out. It's our job now to adjust and not criticize what they're doing and really to get our fans to realize your No. 1 pick is not what it used to be. Tony Boselli ain't coming out now because he's in a different offense. There's so much more teaching involved with these younger players right now. Much greater athletes but much more teaching on our part.\"\nLEARNING ON THE FLY\nSometimes teams decide it's best to let their linemen figure it out on the field.\nThe Seahawks had the lowest-paid offensive line in football last year, spending just over $6 million on its inexperienced unit that featured a converted basketball player at left tackle, a rookie at right guard, a second-year player with one previous game at left guard and a center on his third position in three years.\nThe Seahawks took things up a notch last season by training former hoopster George Fant on the fly to play left tackle.\n\"It was a shock that he could compete, but he showed quite early that he was physically capable,\" his coach, Pete Carroll, said.\nNOT JUST THE NFL'S CONUNDRUM\nSeahawks GM John Schneider said the pool of O-linemen is thin even for college coaches because the best big men are lining up on the other side of the ball or even at tight end — two groups that are, not surprisingly, very deep in this year's draft class.\n\"The majority of guys aren't like, 'I'm going to be the best offensive lineman in high-school football,'\" Schneider said. \"They want to sack the quarterback.\"\nRamczyk comes from a power-run offense but even he is under no illusion about being able to step right in and dominate as he did in the Big Ten.\n\"Going into the NFL is a huge jump,\" Ramczyk said. \"You're playing against the best players in the world. So I don't think it's easy for anyone to adjust.\"\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton","No defensive coach will admit it, but it takes longer to prepare on offense. Now that I am out of football I can say so. With defense, it is a matter of setting a plan and reacting to what happens on the field. It is far more complicated on offense. You have so many details: blocking schemes, pass protections, blitz pickups, pass patterns, reads, adjustments, and so on. ~ Joe Gibbs, Hall of Fame Coach of the Washington Redskins from Game Plans for Success\nI have intently watched the first two weeks of the Canadian Football League season particularly with an eye to offensive structure and schematic approach. The CFL is a fast paced game with only 20 seconds between snaps and only three downs to gain the required ten yards to achieve a first down to maintain possession of the football. The 65 yards of width, the 20 yard end zones, and six men in motion (four may attack the line of scrimmage while two can move laterally) provide an endless array of advantages for the offense with a plethora of pattern combinations that provide coordinators the challenge of harnessing their ideas into teachable and executable game plans.\nHow do head coaches and coordinators go about putting these intricate plans together? It is one of the most difficult tasks in weekly preparation as the plan is based upon probability and you must account for every situation that can be reasonably anticipated. The differences in approach with each coach and system maintains foreseeing potential problems and eliminating them before they escalate but lay with do you adhere to “series oriented football” or “situational offense”?\n“Situational offense” is based on the belief that each play stands on it’s own merit. The idea is that the design is superior to the defensive scheme and that the play call involves specific conditions (field position, down and distance, perhaps time on the clock).\n“Series oriented football” premise is a base or foundation play that has variations off of it. The primary run has counter runs, screens, and play-action pass that are off-springs. Plays are used to set up the variations with some being held back until the second half after setting the table in the first.\nBoth approaches have proven successful but I lean more to “series oriented football” with specific conditions certainly incorporated. Here is a brief synopsis of putting together the plan:\n- How does the opponents defensive ends play contain? Do they box coming up field keeping their high arm free under control leveling off and then reacting to the play? Or are they “crashers”, closing down the line of scrimmage with reckless abandon? Do they run twists or “X” games? These types of questions once answered will determine the structure of your run game as is it more advantageous to run off tackle, kick out, trap, log, far reach, or option?\n- Once your run game is determined you will now have the basis of the play-action pass game. Pattern variations will be determined by how the defenses run support is structured from the secondary and coverage tendencies in normal “run down and distance” situations.\n- What is their defensive identity pertaining to stunts, dogs, and blitz? To define each; stunts involve the front down linemen and their activity such as twists and “X” games with the interior linemen as well as incorporating the ends. Dogs are when linebackers are used as additional pressure players to collapse the pocket and blitz is when secondary players are also engaged to disrupt across the line of scrimmage. As the tendencies are examined, protection schemes will be determined for the half roll, full roll/sprint out, and the three step and five step drop pass game with accompanying “hot schemes”. Hot schemes are clarified by the pressure player that can not be accounted for within the blocking scheme and is the responsibility of the quarterback to identify and deliver the ball into the void created by the pressure player, to a designated receiver “sight adjusting” his route into said void.\n- What are the coverage tendencies involving specific conditions? Pattern combinations are then selected to best attack the inherent weakness of the presented cover schemes from all launch points as defined within the protections.\nNow you can base your series orientation as the specifics of game conditions come into play.\n- Normal down and distance in the open field. We define this as first down or second and medium (4-7 yards) between the 35 yard lines in the Canadian game. It has been said that as a rule, 50% of the game is called within these parameters. Look to string together first downs moving the chains with an eye to averaging six yards per attempt on first down. This is also an area to take a chance on a more “exotic” designed play to create an explosive play of over 20 yards in the air or 12 yards on the ground to get the opponent on their heels.\n- “Go Zone”. The area from the 35 yard line to the 20 yard line going in. Continue with an aggressive mind-set used in the open field with awareness of your field goal kickers leg strength and preferred hash mark to attempt from.\n- “Break Out Zone”. The area from the negative 20 yard line to the 35. Again a similar mind-set to normal with a consciousness to wind conditions and hash mark to create an advantage for your punter.\n- Backed-up. Critical area of the field as you have possession of the ball inside your own 20 yard line which becomes even greater inside your 10. Select core plays that are lower in risk emphasising ball control. Call pass plays throwing to your quarterbacks dominant hand (if your QB is left-handed, throw to his left) and throw to the outside as interceptions of deeper balls happen over the middle and you protect your receivers from big hits throwing outside and reducing the chance of a fumble. You must also keep in mind if taking a safety is proper.\n- Second Down. A statistical tendency of your opponent will be evaluated on short yardage (1-3), medium (4-7), and long (8 or more) selecting what you execute best against the likelihood of the presented defensive scheme.\n- Third Down. With a yard to go, percentages in the CFL dictate that you go for it. Most will prefer the quarterback sneak as ball handling is to a minimum and the attack is straight forward. I do not adhere in the CFL to bringing in tight ends, particularly those that are by trade defensive players. It escapes my comprehension to have 65 yards of width and condense 24 players into a five yard area. Use the dimensions to your advantage. Plan for three to four different scenarios in short yardage.\n- Red Zone! You are within the opponents 20 yard line. Isolate what your staff has deemed as the most desirable match-ups. Look to beat pressure and man to man coverage without risking losing yardage and being taken out of field goal range. Determine your four deep zone across package.\n- 2 Point Conversion. With the depth of the CFL end zones, select plays that your unit executes with the most confidence from your second and medium package and have at least three available.\nOne of the last aspects but not final, you’ll need to consider is dealing with time related situations. How can you take as much time off the clock in the final five minutes moving the chains and protecting the football. What is your “hurry-up” or “no huddle” offense in comparison to your “three minute” offense? When will you call multiple plays in the huddle? What is your “sudden change” call when your defense has created a turn-over and now you are rushing on the field? All these aspects must be addressed in order to convince your players that you are prepared and they must be shown throughout the work-week that practice plans will execute the game plan.\nNow start watching tape!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c1838a2f-73f1-4436-b6f1-927c2755ee30>","<urn:uuid:40af76d5-fba7-4423-90cf-c6afcb31f346>"],"error":null}

{"question":"How has the relationship between traditional and modern medical practices evolved in Australia, and what impact does this have on healthcare accessibility for Aboriginal communities?","answer":"The relationship between traditional and modern medicine in Australia has evolved to recognize the value of traditional practices, as seen in the integration of Indigenous bush medicine with contemporary healthcare. This is exemplified by programs like the NPY women's council's mental health initiative, which incorporates both western and traditional healing approaches. However, the accessibility of healthcare services for Aboriginal communities remains challenging. Research indicates a significant disconnect between healthcare providers' perceptions and Aboriginal patients' experiences of culturally appropriate care. Despite providers receiving cultural awareness training, many Aboriginal people report dissatisfaction with services, indicating that cultural inappropriateness in clinical encounters continues to create barriers to healthcare access. This suggests that sustainable changes at the practice level are needed to improve health outcomes for Aboriginal people.","context":["Exhibitions - Past Exhibitions\nThe art of healing: Australian Indigenous bush medicine\nMonday 23 April to Saturday 2 March 2019\nThe art of healing: Australian Indigenous bush medicine follows the premise of Tjukurrpa (dreaming). It looks at traditional Indigenous healing practice as past, present and future simultaneously. It will present examples of healing practice from the many distinct and varied Indigenous communities throughout Australia. These will be shown through contemporary art practice and examples of plants and medicines. For example, Gija elder and artist Shirley Purdie has spent the last two year illustrating the bush medicine of her region near Warmun in the Kimberly.\nTreahna Hamm reveals in Yorta Yorta Bush Medicine First Aid Kit the use of medicinal plants in Victoria. Whereas in Alice Springs the NPY women’s council with their Ngangkari (women healers) have undertaken a mental health program that examines issues contributing to well-being. This also acknowledges and encourages two-way learning: western and traditional practice working hand in hand.\nThe exhibition will be accompanied by a major catalogue with the perspectives of Indigenous communities represented. The key to this exhibition is revealing that traditional Indigenous healing is a current practice informed by the past, and an intrinsic part of the life of indigenous people in Australia.\nThe illustrated work by Judith Inkamala from Hermannsburg Potters was commissioned for this exhibition. Here, Judith Pungkarta Inkamala depicts many examples of bush medicine.\n\"On this pot you can see the old brother walking, the eldest one, the sister in law going to visit the Ngangkara One (Bush Medicine Doctor). They are the eldest and are there to prepare the bush medicine and teach the young ones. The old lady and the old brother will sing, sing, sing and spit into the Bush medicine as they mix it. Singing medicine into the mixture, over the big pot then sing that medicine into the jars. That's why everyone will get better and everyone will become strong\".

Professor Nick Nicola\nThe story of cancer is complex and extremely personal. 1 in 2 Australian men and 1 in 3 Australian women will be diagnosed with cancer by the age of 85. It is a disease shrouded in fear and dread. There are many types of cancer: lung, prostate, breast, stomach, bowel to name some of the most prolific. For generations doctors and researchers have been frantically searching for remedies. At the moment the so-called 'blunt instruments' of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are still the main medical treatments, however new approaches and technologies are emerging.\nPivotal to the story of cancer in Victoria has been the contribution of the University of Melbourne in the development of treatment, research, public education and advocacy. Various Deans of Melbourne Medical School such as Peter MacCallum have been leaders in advocating for the infrastructure that has underpinned the cancer services for the Victorian community.\nThis exhibition explores the roles of key individuals, public education campaigns and cutting edge research. It also explores the personal responses of cancer sufferers through the work of contemporary artists who have cancer. The Cancer Puzzle draws on the collections of the Harry Brookes Allen Museum of Anatomy and Pathology, the Medical History Museum, University of Melbourne Archives, Cancer Council Victoria and other major collections.\nIt's a Gas! Dentistry & Cartoons\n\"It’s a gas!\" is an expression meaning \"it’s hilarious\" or \"it's funny\". A possible origin is the effect of Nitrous Oxide (Laughing Gas) on one’s behaviour. Nitrous Oxide gas was first synthesised by the English chemist Joseph Priestly in 1772, and first used to anaesthetise a dental patient in 1844. Anaesthetics transformed the delivery of dental services, having a significant impact on the well-being of the patient. However people still fear the dentist and the dentist is the brunt of many jokes. This exhibition traces the history of dentistry through illustrations and cartoons dating from the seventeenth century to today. Themes include fear, relief, pain and vanity. Works will come from private and public collections. It is on at the Medical History Museum, Brownless Biomedical Library, University of Melbourne.\nMedicine: Then and Now\nMedicine: Then and Now tells the story of how Medicine has transformed over the last fifty years. The exhibition highlights and contrasts important medical instruments and visual records of the student experience, past and present. This exhibition has been possible due to the generosity of Melbourne Medical School Alumni and current medical students who have kindly donated items for this exhibition. The exhibition concept and planning has been lead by members of the Melbourne Medical School Student Ambassador program. The Melbourne Medical School Student Ambassador program is an initiative to promote student leadership, peer-to-peer student support, and opportunities for mutual learning between students, alumni and the broader community. The exhibition is on the 1st floor of the Brownless Biomedical Library, University of Melbourne\nCompassion and Courage: Australian Doctors and Dentists in the Great War\nWar precipitates change and discovery in both the medical profession and in the field of dentistry due mainly to necessity and the immediacy of the issues at hand. The forefront of this innovation is in the field, in the midst of makeshift hospitals, poor hygiene and inadequate supplies. During WWI servicemen dealt with appalling conditions in the trenches and were subjected to the effects of new weapons such as mustard gas. Consequently, medical professionals in the field faced a courageous battle against the challenges of war wounds, poor sanitation and disease. This exhibition explores the physical injury, disease, chemical warfare and psychological trauma of WWI, the personnel involved and the important medical and dental breakthroughs that were a direct outcome of the War. Sponsored by Victorian Medical Insurance Agency Ltd, the name behind PSA Insurance.\nBoisterous Beginnings: Doctors in the Port Phillip District\nSurgeon George Bass, Matthew Flinders’ close friend, had visited what became Victoria when he landed in Western Port Bay in 1798 but it was not until settlement in the 1830s that doctors began their work in what was then known as the Port Phillip District. The Medical Register was extended from New South Wales to the Port Phillip District in 1838. There were some formidable personalities practising medicine in the area at the time, but they often had other interests and activities that were apparently more important: politics, for example, the acquisition of land and the accumulation of fortune. By 1844, the Medical Board had listed in the Government Gazette 35 “gentlemen [who had] submitted the necessary testimonials of qualification” to practise in the Port Phillip District. But it was two years before 12 of them formed a Port Phillip Medical Association (PPMA). This exhibition examines these early beginnings of a professional association highlighting the key individuals and social values of the day.\nEpilepsy: Perception, Imagination and Change\nAttitudes to epilepsy provide an excellent perspective on the collision between magic and science, the earliest records attempting to distinguish between disease and demonic possession. This interpretation of the origin of seizures has influenced significantly the management of the illness over the ages, and continues to inform popular conceptions. This exhibition brings together past and present attitudes to epilepsy examining impact on individuals, families and communities. 2014 is the fiftieth Anniversary of the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria.\nStrength of Mind: 125 Years of Women in Medicine\nWomen were admitted to Melbourne Medical School in 1887, 25 years after the course had commenced but 21 years before women were entitled to vote in Victoria. These first seven female medical students were tenacious, resilient, and visionary; challenging the social values of their day and making major contributions to public health in Victoria. Led by Constance Stone the first woman to register as a doctor in Victoria in 1890 ( she had undertaken her medical education in Canada) they went on to establish the Queen Victoria Hospital in 1896. The first hospital established in Australia for the care of women that was managed and staffed by women and one of three internationally. These attributes have been the qualities of many women in medicine over the last 125 years as they have contributed to all aspects of medical practice and research. Women now comprise over 50% of medical graduates. This exhibition celebrates their achievements from 1887 to now.\nVenom: Fear, Fascination and Discovery\nHuman fascination with the power of venom and the quest for a universal antidote against this most feared of poisons, is deeply woven into the history of medicine. Australia has some of the world’s most venomous creatures. Over thousands of years Australian Aboriginal people incorporated ways of understanding and dealing with these venomous creatures in their cultural and healing practices.

A total of 78 participants, including healthcare providers, administrative team members (n = 24, ~30% of study sample) and Aboriginal community members (n = 54, ~70% of study sample) living in remote North West Queensland participated in the study. Outcome measures were assessed by administering survey questionnaires comprising qualitative questions and various subscales (e.g. provider behaviours and attitudes, communication, physical environment and facilities, and support from administrative staff). Descriptive statistics were used to present quantitative findings, whereas inductive thematic analysis was used for qualitative data. In contrast to the views of PHC providers, a significant number of Aboriginal people did not perceive that they were receiving culturally appropriate services. Although PHC providers acknowledged cultural awareness training for familiarising themselves with Aboriginal culture, they found the training to be general, superficial and lacking prospective evaluation. PHC providers should understand that culturally inappropriate clinical encounters generate mistrust and dissatisfaction. Therefore, a broad approach involving culturally respectful association between PHC providers, Aboriginal consumers and administrative staff is required to bring sustainable changes at the practice level to improve the health of Aboriginal people.\nReferencesAndrews B, Simmons P, Long I, Wilson R (2002) Identifying and overcoming the barriers to Aboriginal access to general practitioner services in Rural New South Wales.

{"question":"I'm noticing recent trends in layout design: how does modern digital design incorporate alignment and proximity principles, and what makes these elementos fundamentales for effective communication?","answer":"Modern digital design integrates alignment and proximity principles as fundamental elements for effective communication. While amateur designers often default to center-alignment, contemporary digital designs show more sophisticated approaches where elements are aligned both horizontally and vertically to maintain balance. For instance, in modern templates, you might see top groups of text left-aligned while larger text elements maintain vertical alignment. Proximity complements this by organizing similar information together and creating logical groupings, which improves the design's readability and creates clear information hierarchy. These principles are essential because they reduce design clutter, improve the quality of the reader's experience, and help guide viewers through different parts of the message. For example, in business cards and project proposals, the strategic use of proximity and alignment ensures that contact information and other elements are arranged in a way that makes the information easily digestible and professionally presented.","context":["Design Principles: Proximity\nHumans have an innate tendency to organize images and design elements into logical groups. The design principle of proximity formalizes this natural inclination and is a valuable tool for helping graphic designers arrange information in a way that can be easily communicated to readers.\nWhat is the Principle of Proximity?\nThe principle of proximity suggests that designers should visually group similar or related items together to emphasize their relationship. On the flipside, unlike or unrelated items should be spaced further apart to emphasize their lack of relationship.\nWhy do we Need the Principle of Proximity?\nGrouping like items and separating unlike items reduces design clutter, allowing designers to create a more organized layout with a clearer information hierarchy. As such, proximity has a significant impact on your design’s readability, as well as the quality of the experience your reader has when viewing your design.\nHow to Implement the Principle of Proximity\nWe already unconsciously group like items together, so using the proximity principle is mostly a matter of simply being conscious of your groupings.\nThe principle of proximity is easy to implement. Here’s how:\nGrouping is the cornerstone of the proximity principle. Organizing similar information and separating dissimilar information improves the readability of your design, and it also creates white space between your groups.\nTake this business card for example. While separating my contact information like you see in the first figure occupies the full canvas, arranging my contact information like I’ve done in the second figure more clearly communicates the important information by grouping it together in logical chunks.\n2. Embrace White Space\n“White space”, also known as “negative space”, refers to the areas of your design that do not contain content. Basically, white space is the space between grouped elements in your designs. These spaces prevent your design from appearing over-crowded, and they help guide your reader’s eye towards key information by contributing to your visual hierarchy.\nLearn more about using white space in your graphic designs.\n3. Create a Visual Hierarchy\nGrouping like elements together and creating white space will help you build a visual hierarchy within your design. Your visual hierarchy will organize relevant information and improve your design’s flow and readability.\nContrast and typeface choice can also help you establish a visual hierarchy.\n4. Use a Grid\nGrids give you a guideline for where to place grouped elements within your design. They also ensure that you leave an appropriate amount of white space between design elements.\nTips for Using the Principle of Proximity\nThere are a couple of things you can do to make the most of proximity in your designs:\n- Create obvious groups using shapes, borders, and appropriate spacing.\n- Use proximity in combination with other design principles like contrast, white space, and alignment to add visual interest to your designs.\n- Resist the temptation to fill your entire canvas – this can make your information hard to read and understand, and it probably won’t look as good either.\n- Use sub-groups to break up larger sections of copy.\n- Place captions close to images to emphasize their relationship.\nThe Golden Rule of Design\nIf you’re trying to decide between clear communication and “exciting” design, always choose clear communication. Your message – not how it appears – is what really matters.\nGrouping similar elements and separating unlike elements improves the readability of your design, so don’t be afraid to let your design elements get a little cozy!\nCheck out the rest of our Design Principles series:\nDiscover the basic building blocks of any design!

Graphic designer and best selling author Robin Williams explains these principles in her classic book, The Non-Designer’s Design Book.\nToday we will be providing an overview of these principles using a few contemporary examples.\nProximity means grouping elements together so that you guide the viewer/reader to different parts of the message. Notice below in the template on the left, taken from Apple’s Pages, related elements are grouped together, as opposed to the linear arrangement of amateur designs as shown on the right.\nThough at first the elements may appear scattered, their proximity adds unity and continuity to the page. Even if you intend on sticking to templates, it still helps to know design principles for the purposes of customizing an existing design.\nAnother important design principle is aligning elements in a visual and readable arrangement. Most amateur designers start off by aligning everything in the center of the page, but that’s not the only way. Again with the “scattered” looking design, we can see the alignment of elements that helps keep the design balanced. The top group of text is left-aligned, and three larger text elements are vertically aligned.\nIt’s important to be consistent in the alignment of elements. When you look at the design and something doesn’t feel right, play around with the alignment and see if the design can be improved.\nLike the use of repetitious hooks in a song, repeating elements in a graphic design can be visually appealing. In the two examples below, a numbered list is used, but there’s also the repetition of the blue circles that make a bolder statement.\nIn the layout on the right, the image of the sandwiched is cropped and masked in repeating squares, as well as the use of repeated red strokes above the word “PANE.” Repetition puts emphasis on particular elements of a design, and it draws the reader’s attention to those elements.\nDepending on the presentation, the use of white space can be very powerful in design. It’s useful when you want to make a direct message, to stand out above the clutter found in many graphic designs. In this BYZION business card template, the empty space helps bring clarity to the message.\nA card reader first sees the graphic element, then the owner’s name, followed by the contact information. Elements on the card are balanced and uncluttered.\nThe same goes for this the coversheet of this Pages project proposal template. The white space provides room for the clean font style of the title, the graphic elements, and the grouped text. Don’t be afraid of leaving white space in your design. As Robin Williams points out, white space can also be a form of contrast."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:167a3f65-f6ab-4b2c-8442-22791def9ee6>","<urn:uuid:c7439513-16f2-4a8f-ac67-62b0da9260a2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the drying methods differ between Kenya's double fermentation process and Costa Rica's red honey process?","answer":"In Kenya's double fermentation process, after soaking, the coffee is first spread thinly on raised drying beds for rapid initial drying, then heaped into 6-inch mounds for slower drying, requiring constant turning until reaching 11-12% moisture. In contrast, Costa Rica's red honey process involves turning the coffee several times a day on raised beds, but not as frequently as yellow honey process, while maintaining the full mucilage on the beans throughout drying.","context":["FINCA CHAYOTE - Costa Rica\nNgariama farmers coop\nOctober - November 2019\nJammy, fruit bomb, light grape fruit and galaxy chocolate\nThis coffee was produced by various smallholder farmers belonging to the ngariama farmers cooperative society (fcs) delivering to the kamwangi wet mill (locally known as a ‘factory’), located in the northwest of kenya’s kirinyaga district.\nKirinyaga is famous for its coffee. the credentials of the location are indisputable. it is perhaps not surprising, then, that kamwangi coffees are also exceptional. the area has deep, well drained and fertile red volcanic soil at altitudes of 1,100+ metres above sea level with around 1,400mm of rainfall annually. smallholder members of this factory have access to training and technical advice in an effort to increase yields.\nThe main varieties of coffee grown here is sl28 and ruiru 11, with some batian. most farmers in the area grow tea in addition to coffee, and many (in recent years) have begun farming tea. tea is somewhat less demanding to grown and yields regular crops throughout the year.\nKenyan coffees are almost universally processed using a method called ‘double fermentation’, which is a variation of the washed processing method. almost all producers across kenya use only this method, and it is considered the best practice by many.\nIn the double fermentation processing method, farmers depulp the cherries immediately after harvest and place the mucilage-coated seeds in fermentation tanks, keeping the contact with water at the minimum, for 12 to 24 hours depending on the rate of fermentation. the fermentation helps break down the mucilage making it easier to remove, but also helps develop the mucilage’s latent fruit properties, imparting some of those properties into the coffee seed.\nAt this first stage, the fermentation is allowed to continue until most of the mucilage gets separated from the seed. the coffee is then flushed from the tanks into water channels where the agitation helps to rinse and remove the loose mucilage, stopping the fermentation process. seeds that are low density ‘floaters’ are also scooped off at this stage of the process, - this is one of many steps ensuring the consistently high quality of kenyan coffee.\nAfter the coffee has been cleaned, step one is repeated, and the coffee is left soaking in a secondary fermentation tank for other 12 to 24 hours. this restarts the fermentation, but this time less sugar and fruit material is available. when this second stage is over, the coffee is once again run through water channels where any final residual mucilage is removed.\nThe coffee is then separated in lots, and the various lots are moved into their own water tanks where the coffees are soaked for additional 24 hours. since the mucilage has been completely removed, and the coffee is soaking in significantly more water, it’s assumed that enzymatic activity in the coffee increases in this soaking tank, resulting in a strengthening of the amino acids and proteins present in the coffees.\nThe soaked seeds are then taken out and placed on raised drying beds and spread to a depth of a couple of inches. the idea is to initially dry the coffee rapidly to drop the moisture content and reduce the risk of rotting. after this initial fast drying period, the coffee is heaped into 6 inch deep mounds and moves into a longer, slower stretch of drying to encourage long term quality of green beans. how long the coffee remains on the raised beds can vary greatly depending on temperature and weather but it needs to be constantly turned during this period to achieve even drying. once the moisture of the coffee reaches around 11-12%, this essentially concludes the processing of kenyan coffee. they are finally dry hulled, graded and prepped for export.","Costa Rica Finca Calle Lajas Red Honey\nTart strawberry and blackberry flavors with a creamy mouthfeel and sweet caramel aftertaste.\nRegion: Sabanilla de Alajuela, Central Valley\nFarm: Calle Lajas\nVariety: Caturra, Catuai, Villa Sarchi\nAltitude: 1450 masl\nProcessing: Honey Process\nOscar and Francisca Chacon of Las Lajas Micromill are third-generation coffee producers who are committed to quality and innovation and are probably best known for being among the first to produce Honey and Natural coffees in Costa Rica in the 2000s. Las Lajas began producing honey coffees in 2008 after an earthquake cut off the mill's access to water for several weeks. Oscar had heard that in Brazil and Ethiopia they use pulped-natural and natural techniques to process coffees, so he tried it with his harvest that year. Around that same time, Cafe Imports founder and president Andrew Miller visited the area and was so impressed by the flavor of the Chacons' coffee he became one of the first buyers of the new process.\nThe micromill is also one of the only certified-organic mills in the area, and the Chacons take their environmental impact very seriously. As average temperatures rise and the weather patterns change, the Chacons are considering adding more shade trees to their farm to moderate the heat, and to add irrigation systems to combat the inconsistent rainy seasons Costa Rica has had the past few years. To mitigate their water usage, Oscar uses a Penagos demucilaging machine to depulp his coffee, which has cut the Chacon's water consumption down to almost nothing.\nHarvesting and processing are overseen with great care by both Oscar and Francisca: During the harvest, Francisca measures the Brix of the cherry to determine the optimal ripeness, and picking will begin when the Brix reads about 22°. Harvesting by Brix reading is also helpful as newer varieties sometimes ripen to different colors: Using the refractometer helps keep the harvest at uniform ripeness, which is key when producing high-quality Naturals and Honeys.\nThe Chacons produce several different types of Honeys and Naturals: For their Honeys, 100% of the mucilage is left on the coffee, and the coffee is dried in different ways. Oscar believes that just as the roast profile will change the flavor of a coffee, the drying curve also has an impact. He wants the drying to happen slowly, which means that production is necessarily limited. \"Every day I wake up I learn something new,” Oscar says about his study of the drying process.\nThe Chacons determine which process to use based on the weather on the day the coffee is harvested, as well as the desired profile.\n- Yellow Honey: Coffee is turned hourly on raised beds.\n- Red Honey: Coffee is turned several times a day on the beds, but not as frequently as for yellow honey.\n- Black Honey: The coffee is only turned once per day.\nThe Chacons also do different Natural processes.\n- Perla Negra: Dries directly in the sun for 10 days, rotating constantly, then transferred to bags and left for 2–3 days before being finished on the raised beds.\n- Alma Negra: Drying starts on the patio, then the coffee is piled overnight and spread out in the sun during the day.\nDescription from Cafe Imports."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:db020551-664a-4d6f-8f4e-837d239e3ddc>","<urn:uuid:7a6c49f9-2d17-4da4-8bac-8be120d4a209>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Looking at modern food media coverage, what key differences are there between how NPR's digital food content and traditional food films approach the visual presentation of cooking?","answer":"NPR's digital food content and traditional food films take distinct approaches to visual presentation. NPR's Hot Pot series creates shorter-format videos optimized for social media, incorporating both cooking demonstrations and personal storytelling while ensuring the content works across different platforms (often without sound on Facebook). They focus on regular people cooking meaningful dishes with basic ingredients in a low-budget, in-house production style. In contrast, traditional food films like 'Chocolat' or 'Willy Wonka' emphasize more elaborate visual presentations with high production values, creating dramatic or fantastical food scenes. Films typically have longer formats allowing for more detailed visual storytelling and carefully crafted food cinematography to create lasting emotional impact.","context":["Spend some time on social media, and you’re sure to see food videos — maybe featuring a restaurant’s unique dish or showing the process of decorating a dessert. NPR is keying into audiences’ appetites for this trend in their recent project NPR Hot Pot.\nNPR blogs The Salt and Goats and Soda teamed up to launch a six-part series that connects people around the world through food-related memories. The name is a nod to hot pot dishes, which are warm, food-filled pots found in many different cultures.\nEach episode of NPR Hot Pot includes a video of a person making a favorite dish from their own culture. That’s accompanied by the recipe and an article that dives into cultural issues related to the dish. Collectively, the episodes cover a variety of cultures, foods and topics. NPR also published a social media callout asking audience members to submit their own food-related memories and favorite dishes with the hashtag #NPRHotPot.\nAfter the second video was released, we talked to Hot Pot producer/reporter Rhitu Chatterjee and producer/director Ben de la Cruz about the project’s development process, the merits of using food to frame deeper issues, and points to consider when starting multimedia projects.\nHow did the project idea originate?\nDE LA CRUZ: The idea for Hot Pot is trying to create a new type of food video, at least on the web. The idea was to create this video where you learn about the food and you hear a very personal story about a memory while they’re making food. It’s sort of a hybrid of a story, hence the title “Hot Pot: A dish, a memory.” So that’s how it began. I mean, it’s not an entirely unique thing because there’s “Chef’s Table” and stuff on Netflix that have done this, but it hasn’t been done online — at least we haven’t seen it done so much.\nCHATTERJEE: Food videos are incredibly popular online, but the vast majority of them are based on a how-to approach showing what the ingredients are and the steps in making it. They’re very beautiful videos, but as a storyteller — and especially somebody having grown up elsewhere in the world and having done global journalism — I’m always trying to find connections between cultures. And I’ve always watched these videos and left craving a little more connection to the place where the food comes from and the people.\nThat’s why we decided to go for this approach where you still get to see some of the steps in making the dish, but it’s really also using that as a medium to connect viewers to the place and to the people — what it means to them and the emotions around that food.\nDE LA CRUZ: Food videos are sort of mesmerizing — I use this word “mesmerizing” because you can’t stop watching them. We wanted to keep that aesthetic while also including this emotional part as well, this story part. So that’s what our goal is.\nCHATTERJEE: There’s magic that happens in creating something beautiful out of very basic, everyday ingredients and there’s also magic involved in making and sharing that food with people you love. What we wanted to get across in these videos was the magic in both the chemistry of the food creation and the relationships between people.\nDo you know any other examples of projects using a universal topic like food to connect to deeper issues?\nCHATTERJEE: I have to mention The Salt, the blog I work for, which has already been doing this for several years. What we’re doing is using food as a lens to look at a whole range of issues. We look at diet and nutrition, politics through food, agriculture, economics, environment — it’s an endless list. Food is such a basic human need and the basis of so much of the global economy and people’s lives and culture, so I have to say it sort of came naturally from what The Salt already does.\nDE LA CRUZ: There’s a great series on Netflix called “Chef’s Table” that is very inspirational in the way they cover food. Visually, that’s something that was in my head. There’s lots of documentaries about food out there that are pretty interesting. “Jiro Dreams of Sushi” is another one. So that sort of aesthetic as well as the personal story behind people and the food they make is sort of a model in some way. Obviously this is so much shorter; they’re doing 45 minutes to an hour. So it was just more like, can we make something cool like this for the web or Instagram, which has its own aesthetic and time limit.\nCHATTERJEE And obviously we’re not going for famous celebrity chefs. We wanted to feature people not for their success in cooking, but for how central food was to their own lives. And that’s true for a lot of us. That’s what makes them more relatable. The other thing we should also point out is that this was a very low-budget creation. They were mostly all shot at NPR, and this is an additional project we all took on. Created in-house, shot locally, and featuring regular people.\nWhat’s the value in approaching stories through the angle of food?\nCHATTERJEE: Right now, not just in the U.S. and in many parts of the world, it seems that we’re living in very divisive times. To me, not just as a journalist but also as a human being, the value is bringing up the universality of many human experiences through food. To me, that is one of the values of this project. NPR, like a lot of the work we do, is about connecting people and crossing borders, and this is sort of along the same lines.\nDE LA CRUZ: I think it’s also a way to humanize people. We say in these videos, it’s this picadillo as shared by Wilma Consul. We purposely phrased it that way because we want it to be about the idea of a communal experience. I think that we’re just trying to show there’s more than one way to think about certain areas of the world.\nWhat considerations were important in choosing a group of subjects for the series?\nCHATTERJEE: First of all, with these six videos we wanted to cover different parts of the globe. In addition to that, with any story you want to find the core part, right? The challenge was, “What is this story about? What is this food video about?” And it’s preferably something that takes people by surprise.\nThe first video was about this young girl at the age of 7 under unusual circumstances having to step up and step into the kitchen to help her single mother take care of her four siblings. And even though her circumstances may have been kind of unusual, I knew from having covered gender-related issues that this was also something that millions of girls around the world could relate to. That’s a surprising story and yet relatable to many people, especially girls and women. The second one was again, finding something surprising yet universal. Here, it’s about how people get creative during times of shortage.\nAnd the other thing is finding something emotional. Obviously with the first one it was a lot more emotional than the second one, but even there you have Alina sharing memories of being a little girl, helping her mom make these cookies while stealing bites of the crumbly bits into her mouth. That’s a lovely little memory that a lot of people can relate to.\nDE LA CRUZ: When Rhitu and I chat about the subjects, we also talk about what food they’re going to make, because that’s what we’re going to see in the video. Like choosing a subject in terms of geographic diversity, we also wanted food diversity. And we also wanted food that people could somehow relate to as well. Oftentimes, the food is sort of determined in part by the story and the memory, but we also need to film a certain amount of steps. It needs to have a certain amount of complexity, so that we can show something being created that looks interesting.\nDE LA CRUZ: And, yes, something that can be mesmerizing as well. You can watch it on screen as you hear a story unfold. That is a sort of consideration. Something that only takes five minutes to make, for instance, may not be a dish that we want to film because we want different steps. Alina’s story about the oreshki was great because she had a really interesting utensil that she used to make it. We thought people probably hadn’t seen this, at least I hadn’t. In fact when we looked at the comments on social media, some people wanted to know where they could find that utensil.\nWhat are the most significant things for journalists to remember about using multimedia to connect different audiences?\nDE LA CRUZ We think about each platform of social media and multimedia as very specific in terms of audience and the way that you reach them. So we’re trying to create customized versions of these platforms.\nCHATTERJEE: It’s about getting to your audience where they are.\nDE LA CRUZ: For instance, on Facebook, you see a very low rate of people who actually listen to sound — at least that’s historically been the case with Facebook videos. So we include the subtitles so that people can view them the way they want to. In that example, I think we’re trying to make sure that no matter what platform we’re on, we’re understanding how people consume the content.\nCHATTERJEE: For journalists wanting to do these multimedia projects for different online platforms, the questions they should ask are: Which platform or platforms am I going to use and why? Do I have to use all of them; is that justified? And what am I going to count as success?\nAnd think about these things early on. Ben had to create different things for Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Be aware that each platform has different needs and each will require a lot of work and targeting and outreach. So really think about if you really want to use all, or which do you want to use and why.\nJust because you put it on a platform, doesn’t mean that’s the end of your responsibility in terms of getting people there. … Each platform has a whole list of to-do’s that you have to check off to make it successful.\nDE LA CRUZ: Rhitu touched on an important point there. Just because you put it on a platform, doesn’t mean that’s the end of your responsibility in terms of getting people there. A lot of the work also has to do with reaching out to influencers on the platform. Each platform has a whole list of to-do’s that you have to check off to make it successful.\nCHATTERJEE: For smaller newsrooms, that may not be possible so they might have to decide if it’s wiser to go with one or two platforms. Think of these questions well in advance, when you’re conceptualizing the process — it can’t be an afterthought. It can’t be the traditional way of working where the story’s the main thing, you put it out there, and then you do a little bit of social media outreach. It has to be part of the thinking upfront.\nFinally, we’re curious to know: What’s your own #NPRHotPot memory?\nCHATTERJEE: I have so many. I’m from India, and my home’s in the state of West Bengal. I come from a culture where family discussions are often around what meal shall we eat next. These discussions often happen while we’re eating the current meal, so there are countless!\nMy favorite hot pot dish would be a simple meal of rice and masoor dal, which is the red lentil. This is a very basic dish back home. You boil the lentils with turmeric, then you use sauteéd onions and a five-spice mix. It’s a very simple meal, rice with lentils — this kind of thin, watery lentil, not any kind of lentil you’ve had in any Indian restaurant here in the U.S. You squeeze a little bit of fresh lime on it, and then you eat it plain or with fried fish, fried potatoes or okra.\nThat is my go-to food when I’m desperately craving comfort, and especially when I don’t have the energy to make too much. It can cure homesickness, it can cure a mild case of the virus, it can cure me of longing to see my mother or go back to my childhood days. Masoor dal is one of the first dishes I learned to cook when I moved to the United States in 2002. I’d resisted learning cooking when I was back home, but it’s one of the first things I wanted to cook when I moved here. I called my mom and she guided me on the phone — and many, many times after that in the years since.\nDE LA CRUZ: I was born in Manila in the Philippines, and I came to the U.S. when I was five and grew up in Baltimore. I have a younger brother who’s a year and a half younger than I am. When we were kids my parents always took us fishing — it was one of our favorite things to do. We used to go fishing all over in Baltimore.\nWe weren’t the “catch and release” type of family. When we caught fish, we took it home to eat it. One Filipino dish that my parents always made was this soup called sinigang, which is a sort of sour soup made with tamarind. You can use fresh tamarind, but most people just use these tamarind packets. You make a soup that has a little bit of onion and some greens, and then you put the fish in. You can even put meat and fish in it, or shrimp, but just fish is my favorite. And it’s just a really comforting dish that you have with rice, usually jasmine rice. It’s a simple dish, doesn’t take long to make, and it tastes healthy. For me, it just really reminds me of family time with my parents and my brother.","Films centred on food aren’t anything new. From Babette’s Feast to Ratatouille, the delights of the table have long been a part of the celluloid landscape. Recently, though, there has been a glut of high-profile gastronomic cinema.\nLast year's Indian romance The Lunchbox, in which a mistakenly-delivered box of food brings together a young housewife and an older man, won a gong at Cannes and was the top foreign film at the US box office that year. In May, we had Chef, a Jon Favreau movie about a disenchanted chef who starts dishing out Cuban sandwiches from a food truck. Next year, Bradley Cooper will be donning his whites for Adam Jones (originally - or unoriginally - also called Chef, until the Jon Favreau food truck beat it to the box office). And in September, Helen Mirren stars in The 100 Foot Journey, about the battle between a French and Indian restaurant operating across the street from each other.\nThe rise of these \"foodie films\" is a trend which ties in with the wider prominence of food in our culture. Once upon a time, a “foodie” (or as we used to call them, a gastronome) was someone who knew about caviar and truffles and dined in the classiest restaurants. These days, as the huge range of food programmes on our televisions every night attests, everyone seems to be into food – and a street truck sandwich is viewed as worth being tweeted about as a wagyu steak on a white tablecloth. Indeed, a vast number of images uploaded to the photo-sharing service Instagram are of food: Instagram estimates the hastag “food” has been used on its platform over 12 million times.So it’s no wonder Hollywood is whipping up food films faster than Mary Berry can a meringue - the studio executives are simply catering to audience demand.\nThankfully, such films provide plenty for directors to sink their teeth into as well. First of all, there's the visual power of good food – who can forget the gorgeous streams of molten chocolate moulded by Juliette Binoche in 2000's Chocolat, or the wacky confectionary landscapes of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971)? But food films can also provide high drama – there’s few experiences more nail-biting than throwing your all into opening a restaurant, and few environments as tense and full of power-struggles as a restaurant kitchen. (It’s no surprise that the BBC’s 2005 reworking of Macbeth was set in a kitchen).\nThere's also, of course, limitless erotic and romantic potential in all that sensual food. One of my favourite food films is the magical realist movie Like Water for Chocolate (1992). It centres on a young Mexican woman called Tita, whose emotions infuse all she cooks. The wedding cake she tearfully bakes for the marriage of the man she loves to her sister triggers insatiable longing for their lost lovers – as well, as rather less erotically, bouts of vomiting.\nHere, to whet your appetite for The 100 Foot Journey, are a few recipes inspired by the film.\nBeef Bourguinon a la Hassan recipe\nIn the film, this is Indian chef Hassan's twist on a French classic\nCreated By Floyd Cardoz\n4 tablespoons canola oil\n1.13kg (2 ½ lbs) boneless short ribs of beef, fat removed and cut into 1½ x 1½ inch pieces\nSalt and pepper\n95g (3.3 oz) plain flour\n170g (6oz) smoked bacon, cut into 1/4-inch pieces\n2 tablespoons butter\n2 bay leaves\n18 small pearl onions, peeled\n18 baby carrots, peeled and cut into halves if longer than 2 inches\n18 baby turnips, peeled and cut into halves\n225g (2½ oz) chanterelles mushrooms, cleaned, trimmed and cut in half\n2 onions, diced\n1 garlic head, cloves separated, peeled, and chopped\n1½ tablespoons fresh root ginger, minced\n1 tablespoons freshly ground cumin\n1 tablespoons ground brown mustard seed\n2 tablespoons tomato paste\n½ teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground\n½ tablespoons Aleppo pepper\n1 (750ml) bottle red Burgundy wine\n950ml of beef stock\n4 sprigs thyme\n2 tablespoons brown sugar\nHandful of parsley, chopped\nHandful of chervil, chopped\nPre heat oven to 160C/325F/gas mark 3\nSeason the beef with salt and pepper and lightly coat with flour, keeping the rest of the flour back.

{"question":"I'm a roofer planning some outdoor work. How does sunlight affect metal roof seams, and what precautions should be taken when sealing them?","answer":"Sunlight has damaging effects on roof seams through both UV and infrared radiation. The sun's beams break down roofing material, causing seam sealants to split and open prematurely. When working with metal roof seams, proper sealing is crucial. For flat-seam roofing, before closing seams with a mallet, you should apply thick white lead paint to the locks with a small brush. This technique makes the job water-tight. Additionally, when connecting different metals together (like tin to copper), the copper sheets must be thoroughly tinned on both sides to prevent electrolysis damage when the joints become wet with rain.","context":["This section is from the book \"Cyclopedia Of Architecture, Carpentry, And Building\", by James C. et al. Also available from Amazon: Cyclopedia Of Architecture, Carpentry And Building.\nSome roofers omit the scraping of rosin and paint directly over it.\nThis is the cause of rusting of seams which sometimes occurs. If the paint is applied to the rosin, the latter, with time, will crack, and the rain will soak under the cracked rosin to the tin surface. Even when the surface of the roof is dry, by raising the cracked rosin, moisture will often be found underneath, which naturally tends to rust the plate more and more with each storm. If the rosin is removed, the entire tin surface is protected by paint.\nOne of the most difficult jobs in flat-seams roofing is that of covering a conical tower. As the roof in question is round in plan and tapering in elevation, it is necessary to know the method of cutting the various patterns for the sheets. In Fig. 214 A B C shows the elevation of a tower to be covered with flat seam roofing, using 10 X 14-inch tin at the base. Assuming that the tower through B C is 10 feet 6 inches, or 120 inches, in diameter, the circumference is obtained by multiplying 126 by 3.1416 which equals 395.8416, or say 396 inches. As 10 x 14-inch plate is to be used at the base of the tower the nearest width which can be employed, and which will divide the space into equal spaces, is 13 1/5 inches without edges, thus dividing the circumference in 30 equal spaces. This width of 13 1/5 inches together with the length of the rafter A B or B C in elevation, will be the basis from which all the patterns for the various courses will be laid off. At any convenient place in the shop or at the building, stretch a piece of tar felting of the required length, tacking it at the four corners with nails to keep the paper from moving. Upon the center of the felting strike a chalk line as A B in Fig. 215, making it equal to the length of the rafter A B or A C in Fig. 214. At right angles to A B in Fig. 215 at either side, draw the lines B D and B C each equal to 6 3/5 inches, being one half of the 13 1/5 above referred to. From the points C and D draw lines to the apex A (shown broken). As the width of the sheet used is 10 inches and as we assume an edge of 3/8 inch for each side, thus leaving 9 1/4 inches, measure on the vertical line A B lengths of 9 1/4 inches in succession, until the apex A is reached, leaving the last sheet at the top to come as it may. Through the points thus obtained on A B draw lines parallel to C D intersecting the lines A C and A D as shown. Then the various shapes marked 1 2 3 etc. will be the net patterns for similarly numbered courses. Take the shears and cut out the patterns on the felting and number them as required.\nFor example, take the paper pattern No. 1. place it on a sheet of tin as shown in Fig. 216, and allow 3/4-inch edges all around, and notch the corners A B C and D. Mark on the tin pattern \"No. 1, 29more\", as 30 sheets are required to go around the tower, and cut 29 more for course No. 1. Treat all of the paper patterns from No. 1 to the apex in similar manner. Of course where the patterns become smaller in size at the top, the waste from other patterns can be used.\nIn Fig. 217 is shown how the sheets should be edged, always being careful to have the narrow side towards the top with the edge toward the outside, the same as in flat seam roofing. Lay the sheets in the usual manner, breaking joints as in general practice. As the seams are not soldered care must be taken to lock the edges well. After the entire roof is laid and before closing the seams with the mallet take a small brush and paint the locks with thick white lead, then close with the mallet. This will make a water-tight job. After the roof is completed the finial D in Fig. 214 is put in position.\nAs the method used for obtaining the patterns for the various sheets in Fig. 215 is based upon the principle used in obtaining the envelope of a right cone, some student may say that in accurate patterns the line from C to D and all following lines should be curved, as if struck with a radius from the center A, and not straight as shown. To those the writer would say that the curve would be so little on a small pattern, where the radius is so long, that a straight line answers the purpose just as well in all practical work; for it would amount to considerable labor to turn edges on the curved cut of the sheet, and there is certainly no necessity for it.\nWhen different metals are to be connected together, as for instance tin roofing to copper flashing, or copper tubes to galvanized iron gutters, or zinc flashings in connection with copper linings, care must be taken to have the copper sheets thoroughly tinned on both sides where it joins to the galvanized iron, zinc, or other metal, to avoid any electrolysis between the two metals. It is a fact not well known to roofers that if we take a glass jar and fill it with water and place it in separately, two clean strips, one of zinc and the other of copper, and connect the two with a thin copper wire, an electrical action is the result, and if the connection remains for a long time (as the action is very faint) the zinc would be destroyed, because, it may be said, the zinc furnishes the fuel for the electrical action, the same as wood furnishes the fuel for the fire. Therefore, if the copper was not tinned, before locking into the other metal, and the joint became wet with rain, the coating of the metal would be destroyed by the electrical action between the two metals, and the iron would rust through.\nWhile the roofer is seldom called upon to lay out patterns for any roofing work occasion may arise that a roof flashing is required around a pipe passing through a roof of any pitch, as shown in Fig. 218, in which A represents a smoke or vent pipe passing through the roof B B, the metal roof flashing being indicated by C C. If the roof B B were level the opening to be cut into the flashing C C would simply be a true circle the same diameter as the pipe A. But where the roof pitches the opening in the flashing becomes an ellipse, whose minor axis is the same as the diameter of the pipe, and whose major axis is equal to the pitch a b. In Fig. 219 is shown how this opening is obtained by the use of a few nails, a string, and a pencil, which the roofer will always have handy.\nFirst draw the line A B representing the slant of the roof, and then make the pipe of the desired size passing through this line at its proper angle to the roof line. Next draw the center line R S of the pipe, as shown. Call the point where this line intersects the roof line, I, and the points where D E and C F intersect A B, G and H respectively. Through I draw K L at right angles to A B, making K I and I L each equal to the half diameter of the pipe. Having established the minor axis K L and the major axis G H, the ellipse is made by taking I H, or half the major axis, as a radius, and with L as a center strike arcs intersecting the major axis, at points M and N. Drive a small nail in each of these two points and attach a string to the nails as shown by the dotted lines K M N, in such a way that when a pencil point is placed in the string it will reach K. Move the pencil along the string, keeping it taut all the time until the ellipse K H L G is obtained. Note how the position of the string changes when it reaches a, then b, etc.","Sunlight Damage on Roof\nSimilar to the effects of the Sun on your skin, it is important to note that commercial roofing systems are also very sensitive to the Sun. Particularly, in certain areas of the United States like the Western parts. The geographical locations are heavily impacted by the amount of Sun they get. For instance, if you reside in the Los Angeles area, the amount of Sun that you will get is about 44% of the time throughout the year. Unfortunately, even though some people may enjoy this warm weather, this amount can wreak havoc on roofing systems, especially because the Sun is composed of both UV radiation and infrared radiation.\nSunlight Damage on Roof\nNegative Domino Effects of Sunlight on Your Roofing\nThere are a number of different negative domino effects that you will most likely see on your roof today. Some of the more commonly known include bumps, cracks as well as other kinds of damages. In fact, as the beams of the Sun break down the roofing material, it causes the chemicals in the seam sealants to split and open prematurely over time. In addition to the seams of the roofing opening up, the damages from the Sun can also adversely affect the fasteners on the roof because of the pulls, tears and the twist that negatively compromises the fasteners. Further damages may be caused by the integrity of the roof, even after the Sun has set in the afternoon. This is because dark coloring on your roofing system will inherently hold onto the heat and will not allow it to cool down. Thereby, causing the heat that remains to continue to compromise the integrity of your roof.\nHidden Damages Exposed When Ultraviolet Radiation Compromises the Roofing\nEven more insidious, you will also discover that the ultraviolet radiation, another part of the sunlight, is not easily detected but imposes a lot of extra damage to the roofing’s overall structure. Therefore, it does not matter what kinds of materials used in your roofing system, the degradation continues in pretty much any type that is installed (i.e. single-ply-membrane, bitumen and others). Also, because this is hidden damage that is being done behind the scene in a more subtle fashion, no one will notice that these problems have been occurring until the rain clouds move in as the Sun goes away. Hence, when you inspect the roofing system on your building, the after effects usually show split seams, cracking, and blistering that will ultimately allow water flows to work their way down inside the building causing all kinds of interior damage.\nDealing with the damages that occur to your roofing system can be a huge issue for you when you are impacted by its effects. Due to the severe damages that the Sun can cause on the roofing materials and the seams in the design, the damages can completely destroy the tops of your building. To avoid these issues and damages, it is important to note that many property owners are turning to a newer innovative solution that is called cool roof systems."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b6689880-a1ea-42e2-a44a-0ecc08ca8ae8>","<urn:uuid:291efccb-36a3-4d9e-8aa6-d189339caf38>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As someone interested in Hindu philosophy, I'd like to know what Hindus believe about the fundamental nature of reality and how humans can achieve liberation from the cycle of rebirth?","answer":"According to Hindu beliefs, ultimate reality (Brahman) is an impersonal oneness beyond all distinctions. Humans' true selves (atman) are fundamentally one with Brahman, similar to how air inside a jar is identical to the surrounding air. The main problem humans face is ignorance of their divine nature, leading to attachment to ego and desires, which creates karma. This karma determines rebirth in the cycle of samsara (life, death, and rebirth). Liberation (moksha) can be achieved through multiple paths: the path of action (selfless acts), the path of knowledge (pursuit of self-knowledge), the path of renunciation (giving up worldly desires), and the path of devotion (considered the best path). The Bhagavad-Gita presents an integrated approach where devotees must live a divine-centered life, performing actions with detachment and offering them to God with pure devotion and total surrender.","context":["Article ID: DH122 | By: Dean C. Halverson and Natun Bhattacharya\nOf the 760-800 million Hindus in the world, approximately one million reside in the United States. In Part Two of this article, we will offer specific pointers on witnessing to Hindus. But first it is important for readers to have some understanding of the historical and philosophical background of Hinduism, and that is what this installment will provide.\nThe origins of Hinduism can be traced back to the polytheistic and ritualistic religions that began around 1500 B.C. in India’s Indus Valley. At first, the rituals were so simple that fathers could perform them. As the centuries passed, however, they became increasingly complex. This made it necessary to create a class of priests specially trained to perform the intricate rituals correctly, because the consequences for incorrectly performing a ritual were considered costly. During this time, the Hindu scriptures known as the Vedas were written to instruct the priests in how to conduct the rituals.\nBecause of how exclusive the priests became in appeasing the gods, they gained a power over the people that became unbearable. Around 600 B.C., the people revolted, and the form of Hinduism that emerged was more mystically oriented, focusing on the individual rather than the priest.\nBetween 800 and 300 B.C. the Upanishads were written. They expound on the idea that behind the many gods stands one Reality, called Brahman — an impersonal, monistic (“all is one”) force. The highest form of Brahman is nirguna (“without attributes or qualities”).\nThe Hindu concept of God continued to develop even after the Upanishads were written. Nirguna Brahman became saguna Brahman, which is Brahman “with attributes,” and is called Ishvara.\nAccording to Hindu tradition, Ishvara became known to humanity through the Trimurti (“three manifestations”) of Brahman. Those manifestations include Brahma (the Creator), Vishnu (the Preserver), and Shiva (the Destroyer). Ishvara became personified even further through the ten mythical incarnations, or avatars, of Vishnu in the forms of both animals and persons. Beyond the principal deities of the Trimurti, it is estimated that there are 330 million other gods in Hinduism (Halverson, 87-89).\nHinduism is amazing in its diversity and in its ability to absorb such a diversity into one belief system. Such diversity can cause interesting situations, such as when that religion is transported to another country like the United States. For example, it was reported in Hinduism Today, “In Nashville, Hindus building a temple sent out a ballot to decide which would be the central Deity, since there [were] worshipers of Kali, Krishna and Shiva in their area. It was democratically voted to choose Lord Ganesha” (Melwani).\nOne of the ways in which Hinduism is divided is according to their varied views on how the universe is related to ultimate reality (Brahman). The nondualists (advaita) see Brahman alone as being real and the world as illusory (maya). The qualified nondualists (vishishtadvaita) affirm the reality of both Brahman and the universe in that the universe is extended from the Being of Brahman. And the dualists (dvaita) see Brahman and the universe as being two distinct realities.\nWhile Hinduism is certainly diverse, most Hindus hold to the following beliefs:\n- The Impersonal Nature of Brahman. Hindus see ultimate reality, Brahman, as being an impersonal oneness that is beyond all distinctions, including personal and moral distinctions.\n- The Brahman-Atman Unity. Hindus believe they are, in their true selves (atman), extended from, and one with, Brahman. Just as the air inside an open jar is identical to the air surrounding that jar, so our essence is identical to that of the essence of Brahman.\n- The Problem Is Ignorance. Humanity’s primary problem is that we are ignorant of our divine nature. We have forgotten that we are extended from Brahman, and we have mistakenly attached ourselves to the desires of our separate selves, or egos, and thereby to the consequences of their resultant actions as determined by the law of karma (cause and effect).\n- Samsara (Reincarnation). Samsara refers to the ever-revolving wheel of life, death, and rebirth. Through the law of karma we are reaping in this lifetime the consequences of the actions we committed in previous lifetimes. A person’s karma determines the kind of body — ranging from human to insect — into which he or she will be reincarnated in the next lifetime.\n- Moksha (Liberation). The solution to the problem of attachment and karma is moksha — to be liberated from the wheel of life, death, and rebirth. This can only occur when we truly realize that our separate self is actually an illusion and that only the undifferentiated oneness of Brahman is real. We must therefore strive to detach ourselves from the desires and actions of our ego in order to attain true enlightenment.\nDean C. Halverson is world religions specialist for International Students, Inc., and Natun Bhattacharya, a former Hindu, is the director of support and development for international trainers with Mission Training International.\nHalverson, Dean, ed. The Compact Guide to World Religions. Minneapolis, MN: Bethany House, 1996.\nMelwani, Lavina. “Stirring Up the Melting Pot,” Hinduism Today. Kapaa, HI: Himalayan Academy, March 1998.","Hinduism and the Belief in one God\nThe Hindus believe in many gods and goddesses. At the same time they also believe in the existence of one Supreme God, whom they call variously as Paramatma (Supreme Self), Parameshwar (Supreme Lord), Parampita (Supreme Father). Iswara, Maheswara, Bhagawan, Purusha, Purushottama, Hiranyagarbha and so on. In the Vedas and several scriptures, He is popularly known as Brahman, the infinite, expansive, supreme God\nThe idea of supreme God in Hinduism pervades all teachings and methods of worship although it may not always be visible. It is also the main feature of Shaivism and Vaishnavism. Both the sects believe in one God who assumes different forms and roles for the sake of creation.\nHinduism is unique because it is essentially a monotheistic faith which acknowledges polytheism as reflective of the diversity in God's creation. God is one, but also many. He manifests Himself in innumerable forms and shapes. As Purusha (Universal Male), He enters Prakriti (Nature, Matter or Divine Energy) and brings forth the numerous worlds and beings into existence. He upholds His entire creation with His unlimited powers.\nHe is both the Known and the Unknown, the Being as well as the Non-Being, Reality as well as Unreality. As the Unknown, He is rarely known and worshipped in his unmanifested aspect (avyakta) for difficult and painful is the path for those who choose to worship Him as the Unmanifested (The Bhagavad-Gita XII.6).\nHe exists in all and all beings exist in him. There is nothing other than Him, and there is nothing that is outside of Him. He is Imperishable, unknowable, immortal, infinite, without a beginning and without an end. However, when worshipped with intense devotion and unshakeable faith, He responds to the calls of His devotees and comes to their aid and rescue.\nAll the gods and goddess are His manifestations only. In His female aspect He is Shakti, who as the Divine Universal Mother assists the whole creation to go through the process of evolution in Her own mysterious ways, acting as the field and force of creation.\nThe relationship between God and His devotees is purely personal. They have the freedom and the permission to approach Him and worship him in their own ways. The world may create divisions and categorize people into groups (Jati) and castes (Kula), but for God they are all the same.\nThere are no fixed rules and no central controlling authority on the subject of devotion and what should or should not be done. They are influenced mostly by a person's karma and his or her family traditions. The scriptures and law books (Smritis) do provide guidelines and suggest methods of worship but whether to follow them or not is purely an individual choice.\nThe concept of monotheism is not new to Hinduism. It is as old as the Vedas themselves. References to One indivisible and mysterious God are found in the Rigveda itself. The concept is the central theme of all the Upanishads in which He is variously referred to as Brahman, Iswara, Hiranyagarbha, Asat, etc.\nWhile the students of Upanishads tried to know Him by the path of knowledge with utmost secrecy and there by made it the exclusive domain of a few enlightened persons, the bhakti marg or the path of devotion brought Him closer to the masses and contributed to mass awakening.\nThe One Imperishable and Ancient Being was no more a God of remote heights, secret teachings and elite classes, but a popular and personal God of infinite power, love and compassion, eager to help His aspiring devotees in numerous forms and willing to perform miracles if necessary.\nThe rise of tantric cults added a new dimension to our understanding of Him. To the tantric worshippers, the Supreme Self is the Universal Mother (Shakti). Purusha is subordinate to Her, who plays a rather passive and secondary role in Her creation as the witness. For them Shakti is not a dependent entity, but independent and supreme. Being passive, God cannot initiate creation unless He is joined by Shakti.\nAt the highest level and in his purest aspect, He is satchitananda. Truth, Consciousness and Bliss. As the lord of the universe, He is the inhabitant of the whole world and the indweller of all. There is nothing that is outside of Him or without Him. He exists in the beings (jivas) as Atman, the Enjoyer who delights in Himself, without undergoing any change, but willing to participate in the cycle of births and deaths and bear witness to the illusions of life.\nHe is realized in many ways. The paths or the methods that lead to liberation or union with God can broadly be groupd into four, the path of action, the path of knowledge, the path of renuciation and the path of devotion. All the paths are interrelated, and for success on any path, perfection in others is necessary.\nThe first path requires performance of selfless actions, the second one pursuit of self-knowledge, the third one renunciation of desires and worldly life, and the fourth one devotion to God and absorbing the mind in the contemplation of God. Of the four, the path of devotion is considered the best.\nIn the Bhagavad-Gita we come across an integrated approach. The path of action incorporates the essential elements of the other three as one integrated approach to liberation in which a devotee has to live a divine centered life as a servant of God upon earth (bhagavata), performing his actions with detachment, without any desire for the fruit of actions and offering them to God with pure devotion and total surrender.\nThus, it can be seen that Hindus have a broader approach to the concept of God and his worship. One may call Him by any name or worship Him in any form. The names and forms of God are mere reference points to know him and relate to him in the objective world. Since the senses can only grasp the objects, for us God becomes an object, while the reality is that He is transcendental, beyond the senses and hidden in the objects.\nOtherwise, how can we worship Him, who is unreachable, indescribable, beyond grasp, and beyond all words and thoughts? He objectifies the best and the highest in us. He elevates our very thought and vision, and represents the loftiest ideals, which we can aspire to achieve in our search for meaning and truths about ourselves.\nHe is the highest goal (Parandhama), attaining which in our individual ways is the very purpose of our lives. Those who quarrel about His name or forms, blinded by their faith and their attachment to it, are ignorant and deluded. They never attain him, until they mend their ways.\nTruly, the Brahman of Hinduism represents the Highest principle which the human mind can ever conceive of. He is not God of just one world or a few worlds, but represents the entire known and unknown Universe as well as Time or Kala, the all devouring God of Death.\nSuggestions for Further Reading\n- The Concept of Brahman As Priest and As Supreme Self\n- Aspects, Emanations, Incarnations and Forms of God in Vaishnava Tradition\n- Brahman according to Advaita and Dvaita schools of thought\n- Mahavakya, Prajnanam Brahma, Brahman is Knowledge\n- Bhagawan meaning and significance\n- The Samkhya Philosophy and 24 Principles of Creation\n- The Bhagavadgita On The Problem Of Sorrow\n- The Concept of Atman or Eternal Soul in Hinduism\n- The Practice of Atma Yoga Or The Yoga Of Self\n- The Problem of Maya Or Illusion and How To Deal With It\n- Belief In Atman, The Eternal Soul Or The Inner Self\n- Brahman, The Highest God Of Hinduism\n- The Bhagavad Gita Original Translations\n- The Bhagavadgita, Philosophy and Concepts\n- Bhakti yoga or the Yoga of Devotion\n- Hinduism And The Evolution of Life And Consciousness\n- Why to Study the Bhagavadgita Parts 1 to 4\n- The Triple Gunas, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas\n- The Practice of Tantra and Tantric Ritual in Hinduism and Buddhism\n- The Tradition Of Gurus and Gurukulas in Hinduism\n- Origin, Definition and Introduction to Hinduism\n- Hinduism, Way of Life, Beliefs and Practices\n- A Summary of the Bhagavadgita\n- Avatar, the Reincarnation of God Upon Earth\n- The Bhagavadgita on Karma, the Law of Actions\n- The Mandukya Upanishad\n- The Bhagavadgita On The Mind And Its Control\n- Symbolic Significance of Numbers in Hinduism\n- The Belief of Reincarnation of Soul in Hinduism\n- The True Meaning Of Renunciation According To Hinduism\n- The Symbolic Significance of Puja Or Worship In Hinduism\n- Introduction to the Upanishads of Hinduism\n- Origin, Principles, Practice and Types of Yoga\n- Hinduism and the Belief in one God\nTranslate the Page"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ad633fd7-fdc9-4ba0-9326-62d8f22bff4c>","<urn:uuid:a830589f-65be-4852-aca8-c81d07e80000>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm studying references between Zelda games. How do the Twilight Princess's Dominion Rod and Skyward Sword's Silent Realm mechanics compare in terms of their connection to previous games?","answer":"The Dominion Rod from Twilight Princess and Silent Realm from Skyward Sword both draw inspiration from previous Zelda games in different ways. The Silent Realm mechanics were directly taken from Twilight Princess, where Wolf Link had to collect tears to fill a vessel of light. This concept also has roots in A Link to the Past's Dark World sections, where Link could only travel as a pink rabbit until obtaining the Moon Pearl, which resembles the Tears from both Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword. Additionally, the Silent Realm Guardians are similar to the Phantoms from Phantom Hourglass that appear in the Temple of the Ocean King. As for the Dominion Rod, while it appears exclusively in Twilight Princess as a mystical artifact that can control ancient statues, there is no direct connection mentioned to previous games in the series.","context":["Mess With The Final Boss (Spoilers)\nWhen you get to the second form of Demise at the end of the game you can mess with him by taking out your Bug Net and moving it around, similar to the final battle with Ganondorf in Twilight Princess. He will remain focused on it instead of attacking you, giving you a chance to sneak in a couple of sword strikes.\nYou can only access this at a certain point in the game, at around the Triforce Temple after the 4th and final silent realm.\nA somehow fitting note about the Moonlight Merchant is that, unlike other Gossip Stones, it doesn't give you a treasure when it appears.\nField Of Kittens\nAfter acquiring the Clawshots, many new areas are available for Link to discover. While many of these areas have new treasures and collectables, some are seemingly just for fun. Fly to Skyloft and enter the Goddess Statue area. Navigate to the left of the statue and look up to find a clawshot bullseye. Hook your way up and over the wall to find a patch of flowers. Five adorable kittens will be napping, waiting to show Link some cuddly love.\nAngry Kittens Can Fly\nThe kittens that live in Skyloft attack you at night. Once you have the Gust Bellows, go out in Skyloft at night and when a kitten attacks you, hit it twice with your sword and it will run away meowing. Pick up the kitten and throw it in the water at a place where it can get out, like the steps near Kukiel's house. Get near enough to make it come out of the water to attack you again, and the angry kitten will shake itself, flap its ears, curl its tail, and fly into the air. Use the Gust Bellows to blow it around and it will get even angrier and yowl at you. The kittens fly back to their usual night-time locations in Skyloft.\nAlso, if you throw a kitten off Skyloft during the day, they will flap their ears and land back on Skyloft.\nYou can find Glittering Spores in Faron Woods, in the mushroom patch near the eastern entrance. Hit a mushroom with your sword and then ready an Empty Bottle to swipe the cloud of glitter up. You will get 5 doses of Glittering Spores.\nDump them on enemies to stun them for a few seconds, even while you attack. Dump them on insects after sneaking up to them to slow them down immensely. Dump them on heart plants to turn them into a fairy!\nGetting Into Zelda's Room\nZelda's room is locked, but you can enter it via a chimney on the roof. Climb around to the roof using the ledge by the upper entrance to the Knight Academy. Use the Clawshots on the target on the top of the chimney's reverse side and you can get inside the Academy. If you do this at night, Gaepora will be taking a bath below the spot where you land!\nCrawl through the passage and you can access Zelda's room. Here you can do several things:\nGoddess Harp Melodies\nIf you begin to play the Goddess Harp in Skyloft or in other locations, it will play in harmony with the music of the area.\nIn addition, if you press A on the Wii remote during the final credits, you can play along with the ending music. It makes watching the credits not so boring!\n- Upon revealing a Gossip Stone, it will produce a random treasure.\n- Talking to a Gossip Stone will reveal hints specific to the area you are in.\n- If you bomb a Gossip Stone it will fly into the sky, and if they hit something they'll blow up and sprout out of the ground again.\n- You can latch onto them with the Whip\n- You can blow on them with the Gust Bellows\n- You can knock them in different directions with your sword\n- Play your Goddess's Harp, and the Gossip Stones will sway to the music.\n- When you shoot a Gossip Stone with your Bow; a single Green Rupee will pop out each time you hit it\nBeedle's Back Door\nIf you enter Beedle's Shop and select an item and then decline buying it, he activates a trap door that will send you falling to the ground below as you leave.\nSee Link Poop\nInside the Academy in Skyloft there is a bathroom on the same floor as Link's bedroom. If Link sits on the toilet and gets back up, the toilet will flush, indicating that Link used the bathroom. Gross.\nThe Reversed Ocarina Song\nWhen played in reverse, Zelda's theme, and the main theme of Skyward Sword, is actually Zelda's Lullaby from Ocarina of Time.\nWhen walking around places like the Bazaar, walking near many of the townsfolk and vendors will cause the music to change slightly to reflect that character's personality.\nIn the cutscene before the Wing Ceremony, the announcer will state that it is the 25th anniversary of the Knight Academy, just like 2011 is Zelda's 25th anniversary.\nA Tune from the Past\nIn the fight to save Zelda at the bottom of the Sealed Grounds, a few of the Red Bokoblins with a horn will play a tune that is different from the one normally played. This tune is the tune used to summon the flying duck on the Flute in The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.\nGaepora the Owl?\nHeadmaster Gaepora's features resemble the owl Kaepora Gaebora in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Their names are very similar, and the wise old owl is said to be the \"reincarnation of an ancient sage.\" Also, in the cutscene after Zelda is kidnapped, Gaepora ends one of his messages with \"Hoo Hoo\".\nThe Great Spirit of the Skies, Levias, shares a striking similarity to the Windfish, a flying whale, from Link's Awakening.\nLevias is also infested with parasites, just as was Jabu-Jabu in Ocarina of Time, whose appearance was also remarkably similar to that of the Windfish.\n\"Recurring\" Zelda Characters\nThe following characters appear with the same name, likeness and role in other Zelda games. They may not be the exact same individual, however, but distant ancestors.\nGameplay Introduced in Earlier Games\n- The Silent Realm part of Skyward Sword is taken from Twilight Princess, where Wolf Link had to collect tears in order to fill a vessel of light several times throughout the game.\n- A Link to the Past also had alternate-realm sections of gameplay, notably the Dark World. While there, Link could only travel as a pink rabbit until obtaining the Moon Pearl, which looks similar to one of the Tears from Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword.\n- The Silent Realm Guardians are analogs of the Phantoms from Phantom Hourglass that appear in the Temple of the Ocean King.\nIt's a Secret to Everybody\nBoth the Kikwi Hermit in Faron Woods and the Parella in the cave with all of the breakable walls in Lake Floria that tells you where the exit is say, \"It's a secret to everybody.\" This is the same line rupee-paying Moblins used in The Legend of Zelda.\nTower of Spirits?\nThe room where you defeat Moldarach in the Lanyru Mining Facility is remarkably similar to the lobby of the Tower of Spirits from Spirit Tracks. It's easy to recognize by the large circle/wheel in the middle of the room that would turn the train, and the many doors the train could exit from. Interesting in that the mines use railways throughout the game.\nGerudo Desert Reference\nThe Gerudo Dragonfly references the Gerudo Desert area found in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. These bugs can only be found in Lanayru Desert.\nSkippers Retreat Titanic Reference\nWhen you get into Skippers Retreat (House) in the Lanaryu Sand Sea, after dusting up the place and opening the chest you will get a cut scene of Fi telling you about the pictures on the Wall. The Middle Picture is Captain Skipper holding a special someone at the front of the ship like the classic scene on Titanic.\n\"Smokey the Bear\" Reference\nIn the Lanayru Ship Yard (where you fight the second Moldarach), there are several posterboards which hold news. If you walk up to one, it will tell you multiple phrases, one being, \"Only you can warn your co-workers of an oncoming pirate attack.\"\nIf you see any stone engraving of a face, shoot one of the eyes with your slingshot or bow and you'll get a blue rupee.\nSit on a stool or bench to slowly refill your health.\nStand still to refill your stamina gauge faster.\nIf you dive off your loftwing while flying over the Lumpy Pumpkin, a bunch of colourful gliding creatures will surround Link. If he catches all of them they will form a circle and give Link a Red Rupee.\nThis is very similar to the skydiving game in Wii Sports Resort.\nWhile flying upon your loftwing, knights of Skyloft may briefly join you as you traverse the sky. If three knights follow your flight path at the same time, you'll notice each knight wears a different color tunic - one blue, one red, and one green.This harkens back to the tunics acquired in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and the colors Link could wear in the original Legend of Zelda depending on which ring, if any, had been acquired.\nIf you go into Groose's room and stare at his punching bag, there is a picture of Links face.\n\"23 Is Number 1\"\nIn Lanayru Mining Facility, there is a puzzle that requires you to hit three switches in a specific order. Across the room is a clue on the wall that tells you what order to hit the switch in. The clue shows 2-3-1, the same order to opening Queen Gohma's room in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.\nSages' Medallions and Chamber of Sages Reference\nOnce the Isle of the Godess has fallen into the Sealed Grounds, if you stand beneth the ceiling that connects the Sealed Temple and the Isle of the Goddess and look up you will see this reference. In the centre of the ceiling, along the top portion of the wall, will be a painting of the triforce with the six medallions of the six sages from Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. The entire image also bears a striking resemblance to the image of the Chamber of Sages also found in Ocarina of Time.\nOpening Cinematic Images found within Sealed Grounds\nIn the Sealed Grounds, right at the bottom where The Imprisoned is sealed, look at the walls along the path going up. There will be carvings on the wall that show the images from the opening cinematic sequence of the game\nMysterious Hand: Link's Awakening reference\nIn the side quest, \"The Haunted Restroom,\" a mysterious floating hand asks for a piece of paper. This is very similar to the mysterious hand in Link's Awakening, Majora's Mask, and the Oracle games who also asks for paper.\nBreaking Jars In Skyloft\nIf you go to the kitchen in the Knight Academy in Skyloft, you can lift up the barrels, jars, and pots and throw them at the old lady working there. She will get mad at you each time and threaten you with funny comments. If you do this in the gear-peddler's house and roll into the wall of jars, the old lady will get mad for breaking her antiques and force you to pay rupees to cover for the damage.","- This article is about the item in Twilight Princess. For the weapon in Hyrule Warriors, see Dominion Rod (Hyrule Warriors).\n\"You got the Dominion Rod! This mystical artifact breathes life into ancient statues. Set it to [B] on the [\"-\"] screen, use [W] to aim [R], and press [B] to swing the rod. Statues that have received its light and been filled with life will move like their master.\"\nThe Dominion Rod, also called the Rod of the Heavens, is an item that appears exclusively in Twilight Princess. Link acquires the Dominion Rod in the Temple of Time, after defeating the Mini-Boss, a Darknut. It can be used to control statues, such as the Ancient Statue found in the Temple of Time or the Owl Statues found across Hyrule. Once these statues have been controlled, they move exactly as their master, who in this case is Link. The main use of this is to move the statues to a new location, which is the premise behind most of the puzzles that involve the Dominion Rod.\nOnce Link returns from the past-state of the Sacred Grove and into the present-state, Ooccoo tells him that the Dominion Rod is what she has been looking for all this time. She continues by revealing to Link that she can see that the rod's power has been exhausted. Before running off in search of the Owl Statues that \"respond to the rod\", Ooccoo mumbles about a spell that can restore the Dominion Rod's power, which she has forgotten. Once Ooccoo is gone, Midna explains to Link that without its power the Dominion Rod is just more baggage. However, she says that restoring the power to the rod will definitely come in handy, especially in their attempt to reach the heavens, where the final Mirror Shard lies.\nRestoring the Power\nThe Dominion Rod is completely unused during the first few events of the quest to reach the City in the Sky. It is finally brought back once Link has given the Horse Call back to Ilia. After telling Link that she is fine and that he must return to his quest, she tells Link that Impaz from the Hidden Village is waiting for the messenger of the heavens who holds the rod of the heavens, because it is by royal decree that she gives him something. The mysterious rod is obviously the Dominion Rod, so that makes Link the messenger of the heavens. With this new found knowledge, Link can head back over to the Hidden Village, where Impaz awaits. Upon arriving in the Hidden Village and entering Impaz's House, Link can show Impaz the Dominion Rod, at which point Impaz exclaims that Link is the messenger to the heavens. After a little backstory of the Dominion Rod, she gives Link the Ancient Sky Book, which by royal decree was only to be given to the messenger of the heavens. She concludes by telling Link that the book is written in the ancient language of Sky Writing.\nWith the Ancient Sky Book in hand, Link can head to the basement of the Sanctuary, where Shad awaits. After showing Shad the book, he exclaims that this book may contain the word that breaks the seal on the Owl Statue found in the basement. He tries it out, but there is no reaction. However, Shad thanks Link for bringing him one step closer to solving this puzzle. He returns the book to Link and explains that he is going to try the word out on the other statues. He concludes by offering to mark Link's map with the locations of the other statues. Once Shad has left, the Dominion Rod starts to flash. Link can hold it up, at which point it is revealed that the Dominion Rod has regained its power thanks to the word spoken by Shad. With the Dominion Rod's power back, Link can continue his quest in search of the City in the Sky.\nOwl Statue Locations\nThere are only a few locations which Link can use the Dominion Rod on the Owl Statues. Firstly, there are the six locations that each hide a Sky Character. These locations are in the Faron Woods, Kakariko Gorge, Bridge of Eldin, Hyrule Field outside of Castle Town, just north of the Great Bridge of Hylia, and in the Gerudo Desert. Additionally, each of these locations include a puzzle, where Link must use the Dominion Rod to move the Owl Statues into certain position where he can jump on there in order to reach another platform. Each platform carries a Treasure Chest, which holds either a Piece of Heart or an orange Rupee depending on the location.\nThere are only two other places where Owl Statues can be found, and those are found within the Cave of Ordeals and Hyrule Castle, respectively. In the Cave of Ordeals, there are two Owl Statues that push down switches. Moving these statues releases the switches, opening the gate that leads to the next floor. In Hyrule Castle, the Owl Statues are found in the hidden graveyard at the back of the dungeon. These Owl Statues must be moved to a location where Link can jump on them to reach another platform, where a Small Key lies.\n- There is a glitch in Twilight Princess which allows Link to bypass the entire Sky Cannon quest by transforming into a wolf right in front of the Owl Statue in the basement of the Sanctuary. If done correctly, Link lands on the statue, allowing him to continue into the depths of the basement. This allows Link to skip the entire Temple of Time dungeon. Since the Dominion Rod is only required to collect the Sky Characters, which is during the Sky Cannon quest, this glitch makes it possible to complete the game without collecting the Dominion Rod.\nDominion Rod Artwork from Hyrule Historia\n- ↑ \"DOMINION ROD\nAlso known as the Rod of the Heavens.\", Hyrule Historia, pg. 196\n- ↑ \"Statues, the word that breaks the seal, and the rod of the heavens...

{"question":"What is the recommended daily caffeine limit for pregnant women compared to breastfeeding mothers?","answer":"The recommended caffeine limit for breastfeeding mothers is 200mg per day according to the NHS. Similarly, for pregnant women, studies suggest keeping caffeine intake to no more than 200mg daily, with some studies suggesting even lower limits of 150mg. Both groups should be mindful of caffeine consumption as it can affect both mother and baby, though the effects manifest differently - in pregnancy it can affect fetal growth and increase risks of complications, while during breastfeeding it may cause over-stimulation in babies, particularly younger ones.","context":["Diet and breastfeeding\nMany mothers worry about how their diet will affect their baby whilst breastfeeding. There are memes and articles all over the place with great long lists of ‘foods to avoid whilst breastfeeding’! The truth is, as long as your baby does not have any allergies, you can eat whatever you like (with a couple limitations). Whilst it’s always best to eat a good diet to maintain your own health, what you eat does not have a huge effect on the quality of your milk or your supply.\nModerate alcohol consumption whilst breastfeeding is considered safe. Alcohol passes freely in and out of breastmilk and rises and falls at about the same rate as your blood alcohol level, so there is no need to ‘pump and dump’. Some mothers find that their babies are fussier and sleep less if they have consumed alcohol, so follow your baby’s lead. Although only very small amounts of alcohol enter your breastmilk, this has not been extensively studied. More info on this can be found here.\nThe NHS recommend that you limit caffeine intake to about 200mg/day. Caffeine does pass into breastmilk. Some babies are quite sensitive to it and others aren’t. It tends to have a greater effect on younger babies. Some women find they can drink coffee all day with no effect on their baby, others find that just one cup of tea has their baby over-stimulated. Follow your baby’s lead.\nOily fish is a fantastic source of Omega 3 and vitamin D, but it also contains low levels of pollutants and so should be limited to two portions a week.\nThere is no reason to avoid acidic food such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, vinegar etc. Eating a large amount of acidic food does not change the pH of your blood plasma. Your breastmilk is made from your blood—not the contents of your stomach.\nIBCLC on maternal diet\nSpicy and gassy food\nThere is no reason to avoid spicy foods whilst breastfeeding. Women from some cultures eat lots and lots of spicy foods, and their babies suffer no more digestive issues than babies who’s mother’s eat no spicy foods.\nSome vegetables, such as cabbage, beans and Sprouts, might make you feel gassy and bloated. This gassiness and bloating is caused by your body breaking down the carbohydrates in those foods. Those carbohydrates do not enter your milk undigested, so this will not effect your milk. As above, your milk is made from your blood, not the contents of your stomach.\nIt is possible for your baby to have an intollerence to the proteins in your diet, but this is very rare. If you think your baby has an intollerence to a food in your diet causing fussiness or digestive problems, try cutting it out for a couple weeks, then reintroducing it to see if symptoms return.\nUnless your baby has an allergy or intolerance to cows milk (or you’re vegan!) then there is no need to avoid dairy. CMPA is rare in breastfed babies, affecting around 0.5%. Symptoms generally include:\n• Projectile vomiting\n• Stools which are loose, frothy, mucousy and/or bloody stools\n• Failure to thrive/weight loss/ slow weight gain\n• Hives or other skin rashes\n• Wheezing or breathing difficulties\nYou can find more info on CMPA here.\nCMPA is massively over diagnosed. A diagnosis of CMPA more often than not leads to women moving their baby on to a hydrolysed formula. In the past decade, despite there being no evidence that cases of CMPA have actually increased, the number of diagnoses have. Prescriptions for hydrolysed formulas have increased by 500%, and the amount of money which formula companies have made from sales of prescription formulas has increased by 700% (the cost of which falls to the NHS to cover). Formula companies funded the writing of guidelines for diagnosing CMPA. They are a main sponsor of the charity Allergy UK who run a helpline for parents, and they also run allergy training days for Dr’s, health visitors, and other healthcare professionals. Formula companies profit directly when babies are diagnosed with CMPA and given prescription formula, and it is believed that their influence is the driving force behind the huge increase in babies diagnosed with CMPA. A report on this was published in the British Medical Journal here.\nHumans don’t really need cows milk in their diets, so if you want to cut out dairy that’s absolutely fine! Anecdotally, some women think that it helps for issues such as reflux and colic, though there isn’t any evidence to support this in the absence of an alergy. However, it is hidden in A LOT of unexpected places and takes up a bigger percentage of most people’s diets than you would expect! So if you do decide to cut it out, make sure that you’re finding other sources of calories and calcium to make up for it so that you do not lose too much weight or become deficient.\nLactose intolerance is extremely rare in breastfed babies. Lactose is the main sugar in your milk, whether you consume dairy or not.\nBreastfeeding Network factsheet on CMPA","Caffeine during pregnancy is something all pregnant moms-to-be need to know about. When you’ve been up to go to the bathroom five times at night, a hot cup of joe in the morning sounds like just the thing. But can you drink coffee while pregnant? How much is too much? We’ve got all the coffee pregnancy facts you need below.\nWhy Is Coffee and Pregnancy an Issue?\nCoffee contains caffeine, a powerful stimulant. That’s why we love it because it makes us feel like we have more energy and blocks the chemicals in our brain that makes us feel sleepy. During pregnancy, the body is slower at processing caffeine, which means it hangs around for longer. This can cause problems for both mom and baby.\nCaffeine is a diuretic, which means it makes you pee more than usual. This is a contributing factor towards feeling dehydrated, which is bad news during pregnancy when you need more water than ever. Dehydration also leads to dry and dull skin, irritability, and can affect the immune system.\nAlthough the stimulating effect of caffeine is why we love our coffee, this is also bad news during pregnancy. Caffeine can raise blood pressure. Very high blood pressure can lead to conditions like pre-eclampsia. Caffeine also makes the heart rate, which puts press stress on you and your unborn baby.\nCaffeine Pregnancy Facts\n- Caffeine can pass through the placenta to your baby.\n- Your baby can’t withstand the same amounts of caffeine as you can.\n- Caffeine may disrupt your and baby’s sleep patterns.\n- Caffeine is in more food and drinks than coffee.\n- Caffeine in pregnancy may cause premature labor.\n- Caffeine may increase the risk of a miscarriage.\nSo, Can I Drink Coffee While Pregnant?\nCoffee during pregnancy can cause problems, but only over certain amounts. A range of studies come to differing conclusions. Some say less than 150mg caffeine a day is fine; others say 200mg or less. When working out how much caffeine your taking in every day, remember that caffeine is in more than just coffee- see our helpful list below.\nHow Much Caffeine When Pregnant Is Safe?\nUnderstanding how much caffeine a pregnant woman can have is about looking at the most recent studies we have on the subject. A British study concluded that over 200mg of coffee could seriously increase the risk of fetal growth restriction. The World Health Organization recommends that women who take in more than 300mg a day should lower this during pregnancy, and it’s a good idea to do this if trying for a baby too.\nEnjoying a coffee while pregnant is still possible. The problems with pregnancy and caffeine tend to occur when the regular daily intake is consistently high. So, how much caffeine can a pregnant woman have? The best recommendation is no more than 200mg daily, and the less, the better. Remember that caffeine comes from more than just coffee and can also be found in:\n- Energy drinks (avoid these when pregnant)\n- Some candy\n- Certain medications\nHere are some approximate caffeine amounts for favorite drinks, courtesy of the Mayo Clinic:\n8 oz brewed coffee: up to 165mg caffeine\nEspresso: up to 47mg\n8oz instant coffee: 63mg\n8oz latte or mocha: up to 126mg\n8oz black tea: up to 48mg\n8oz green tea: up to 29mg\n8oz cola: up to 46mg\nCan pregnant women drink coffee? Sure, but from the caffeine amounts shown above, only around one cup a day. We know that’s tough, so here are some alternatives to help you get your hot drink fix:\n- Decaf Coffee- still has caffeine in but only around 5mg per 8oz\n- Tea- a standard black tea has about a quarter the caffeine of coffee\n- Decaf Tea\n- Redbush Tea, also called Rooibos Tea- a South African herbal drink, which may help with nausea and doesn’t contain caffeine; however, speak to a doctor before taking any herbal drinks or supplements.\n- Peppermint Tea – also be good for nausea\n- Ginger Tea- good for nausea and has a comforting, warming effect\nDon’t fall into the trap of thinking all herbal teas are great. For example, anything with raspberry in it should be avoided as a raspberry leaf can cause uterine contractions. It’s so powerful that your doctor may recommend this at the very end of your pregnancy to help things along. Aloe vera can also have this effect, which is why it’s crucial to talk to a doctor before taking any herbal remedies or teas while pregnant.\nIs It Safe to Quit Caffeine?\nThe best option for both mom and baby is to cut out as much caffeine as possible. But is it safe to go cold turkey? Potential side effects of quitting caffeine include:\n- Headache due to increased blood flow\n- Lack of focus\n- Low mood\nAs a pregnant mom-to-be, you might have some of these symptoms anyway- particularly the tiredness! However, to avoid these, simply cut down your caffeine intake before quitting. Go from a large coffee to a small, and then if you want to quit completely, the effects will be much less. These effects all pass after a few days.\nDrinking coffee when pregnant is okay in moderation, although experts can’t agree how much is too much. If you’re worried, switch to decaf or a low caffeine option. Whatever you choose to do, make sure you’re drinking plenty of water and eating healthily.\nTakeaway: Can you drink coffee when pregnant? Drinking too much coffee while pregnant can mean you’re taking in high amounts of caffeine. High amounts of caffeine during pregnancy can cause problems for both mother and baby."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2a0a3f77-e4ce-469c-b29c-b25a8c1e7c4f>","<urn:uuid:7746f94d-f2cf-473b-91ef-70b51124dbe7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What maintenance challenges exist in vertical farming systems versus aquarium environments, and how are they managed?","answer":"Vertical farming faces maintenance challenges including high energy requirements, extensive investment costs, and potential indoor issues with excessive UV, heat, and ozone-induced plant damage. These are managed through automated control systems using sensors, imaging techniques, and artificial intelligence. In aquarium environments, maintenance challenges are more straightforward - hermit crabs are tolerant of less than ideal water conditions and require only regular water changes and parameter testing. They can help maintain the environment by consuming leftover food, though careful management is needed to prevent them from killing snails by providing adequate empty shells of varying sizes.","context":["Ever since I had the privilege of seeing those telltale trails on the sand on the white sandy beaches, I know that I have wanted to own a Hermit Crab. Not only are they great to watch for amusement as they rummage around the substrate and rocks, they actually serve a greater purpose for maintaining a clean tank.\nIn this article, we are going to look at how to care for these fascinating creatures and why you should seriously consider adding them to your tank (if you haven’t already!). Also note we are looking specifically at the Green Striped Hermit Crab. There are a large variety of hermit crabs that can be found at your Local Fish Store (LFS). A lot of the care guidelines detailed in this article will be generally applicable to other species of hermit crabs, however you should also do your due diligence and research specific care instructions for the type of hermit crab you are interested in.\nGreen Striped Hermit Crabs can be found in and around coral reef systems located around the Caribbean. They can also be found in the waters around the Gulf of Mexico.\nProbably one of the most interesting features about Hermit Crabs is that they inherit abandoned (and sometimes not abandoned) shells. Throughout it’s life you will probably only see the Hermit Crabs claws, a few feet, beady eyes and it’s waving antennae. However if you are lucky, you may be able to catch a brief glimpse of the Hermit Crabs body as they switch between shells.\nThe coloration of the Hermit’s claws and legs can vary between species, however for the Green Striped Hermit Crab you will see greenish to dark green stripes on the claws and feet.\nHermit Crabs are a proud member of the clean up crew. This means they will forage and scavenge on uneaten foods around the tank that the resident fish have missed during feeding time. This is particularly handy in keeping your water parameters in check and your tank doesn’t become toxic with ammonia or nitrite.\nHermit Crabs will also graze on algae growing in your tank and pick their way across live rock and corals.\n|Tank size||At Least 20 Gallons|\nHermit Crabs are considered a good animal to begin with for reefers starting in the hobby as they are tolerant of less than ideal water conditions. As such they do not have any specific requirements (unlike other fish and corals) to live a long a happy life.\nThe main thing to remember is to maintain regular water changes and testing your water parameters. Also feed your fish a variety of foods and the leftover uneaten food will make it’s way down to the bottom of the tank where the hermit crabs will scavenge their meals.\nThings to consider for Hermit Crabs\nDo they kill snails?\nOne of the main concerns with reefers considering adding Hermit Crabs to your tank is whether they will kill other inhabitants, particularly snails.\nIn general, the answer will be a no. However there are certain things you can do to discourage the practice of killer Hermit Crabs. As your Hermit Crab grows it will inevitably look to move home. This means if there are no other abandoned shells lying about the tank, it may resort to killing snails for their shells. To prevent this, ensure you have enough shells of varying size lying on the bottom of your tank. By doing this you will give the Hermit Crab amble options and it won’t have to even consider looking at those snails on the walls and live rock.\nJust to show you that it does happen here is a video of a poor snail being preyed on.\nMixing Hermit Crab Species\nAnother thing to consider is whether or not to mix different species of Hermit Crabs in the same tank. Unfortunately there is no definitive answer to this question. With so many species of Hermit Crabs and the different types of personalities within the same species, you will never be able to confidently same yes or no. In general you should probably stick to one type of species, as the likelihood of every crab co-existing peacefully is higher than two or three different species living together. The reason for this is because if food becomes scarce in the tank, it is natural for one species to attack another for food and to eliminate the competition.\nI highly encourage all reefers to include Hermit Crabs in their tank. Not only do they help with breaking down uneaten foods and facilitating the nitrogen cycle. They are quite amusing to watch climb around the tank.\nThe few things to look out for is if you have snails, they may prey on them if they need a new home. Also try not to mix species of crabs together, as having one versus more than one species in the tank will likely result in a more peaceful tank habitat.\nIf you found this article helpful please share this with other reefing enthusiasts by using the share buttons on this page.","Agricultural systems around the world need to adapt to the rapidly changing environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic landscapes, and new alternative practices, such as vertical agriculture, may offer new opportunities to accelerate such adaptation.\nNext Gen Farming Without Soil and 90% Less Water | GRATEFUL\nWhat is vertical farming and why is it important\nModern agricultural systems encompass an estimated 1.5 billion hectares of the world’s surface area. With a growing population and resource needs, the availability of arable land is shrinking rapidly.\nSince the agricultural revolution, conventional agriculture has focused on practices requiring considerable quantities of space, water, fertilizer, and pesticides. The past 50 years have seen an accelerating rate of increase in these requirements as modern food production aims to increase productivity in the hopes of addressing growing food insecurity.\nLooking into the future, yield production is forecasted to decrease due to widespread environmental and socioeconomic changes that will generate unpredictable consequences on food systems.\nIn response, many strategies have been developed as alternatives to conventional agricultural practices. These strategies have focused on key principles and their combination to be effective: require less space, less water, and increase yield per unit of area. Moreover, due to the negative effects of agrichemicals, modern practices have also aimed to use significantly less to avoid potentially adverse effects for humans and animals.\nOne such alternative is the development of vertical agriculture, also referred to as vertical farming. As the name implies, vertical agriculture relies on expanding production vertically and not horizontally. Vertical agriculture is a multilayer indoor plant production system that allows for precise control of growth factors, such as light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, water, and nutrients.\nThis allows for the growing and production of crops year-round, completely independent of solar light and other external conditions. Indeed, vertical agriculture makes use of key concepts within ecology and physiology to optimize growing and fertilization within controlled conditions. For instance, elements of photobiology, thermomorphogenesis, hydroponics, and genetic breeding, are all used commonly across systems of vertical agriculture.\nBenefits, challenges, and disadvantages moving from horizontal to vertical farming\nAs a result of tight control over crop breeding, growing, and harvesting, vertical farming provides several benefits relative to conventional methods of ‘horizontal’ food production. This was the topic of a literature review by Kalantari et al. published in 2016 in the Journal of Landscape Ecology.\nFrom a systems perspective, the enclosed design prevents pests and diseases from entering by the adoption of a high level of hygiene, continuous monitoring, and non-chemical disinfection, providing security from crops. Moreover, recent technology has also allowed for automated control over environmental conditions by using sensors and imaging techniques in combination with crop simulation models and artificial intelligence, limiting the need for physical labor.\nVertical farming also allows for flexible organization, with designs ranging from large vertical walls covered with crops to large hangars or re-used shipping containers that can be transported. Consequently, vertical agricultural systems, can comprise many varying sizes and be located within many different areas from the middle of highly urbanized cities to more suburban or rural areas.\nMoreover, the verticality element of this system also provides nutrient and water flow, helping to reuse costly resources. The reduction in space also means there is a significant increase in yield per area, holding extensive potential for a future world of urbanization.\nFrom an economic perspective, vertical farming also provides for more jobs in localized areas and is community-focused by addressing the needs of immediate areas, which in turn can provide food at a lower price. Finally, the optionality of location for vertical systems also allows producers to reduce transport costs, as consumers may access them within urban areas, or transport can be minimized to nearby areas.\nHowever, despite the design, environmental, and economic advantages, vertical farming also incorporates several issues that remain a challenge to its broader implementation as a system.\nVertical farming has a high energy requirement and needs extensive investment costs to implement and develop successfully. Moreover, indoor issues relating to excessive UV, heat, and ozone-induced plant damage may have unpredictable repercussions for plant growth.\nAdditionally, vertical systems are difficult to adapt to a larger scale. They are costly to build and maintain and have yet to demonstrate the ability to provide food for larger areas than community-scale populations. This would make it difficult to implement in areas at higher risk of food insecurity, such as developing agricultural nations.\nThe lack of empirical research on a broader scale has meant that vertical farming has yet to develop past the concept stage on community levels, as persistent issues make it difficult to break through to a larger scale.\nImage Credit: YEINISM/Shutterstock.com\nGrowing skywards - the implications of vertical farming in a rapidly populating and changing world\nAmong the development of alternative agricultural practices, vertical agriculture provides a promising solution for many of the challenges facing current agricultural policies. However, for vertical systems to be integrated on a larger scale requires further technological progress and economic investment.\nNevertheless, gradually implementing more verticality, or combining it with other practices aiming for more sustainable practices may be promising. For instance, the combination of verticality with other practices such as intercropping may be particularly beneficial for developing more sustainable food systems.\nIncorporating technological progress into vertical systems also holds promise, with automated sensors and machinery able to operate near-independently. Progress in gene editing and plant genome modifications will also allow for faster, bigger, and healthier crops, allowing vertical agriculture to produce more over time.\nThroughout agricultural history, farming systems have typically spread over large spans of land, yet the reduction in arable land, as well as the increase in demand to house growing populations, means that such strategies need to be reconsidered, and vertical agriculture may play a role looking into the future.\nContinue Reading: Benefits of Vertical Agriculture and Hydroponics\n- Beacham, A.

The investment process requires close cooperation with government and city councils, adherence to strict restrictions on procedures, quality, sustainability, and safety, and careful reporting of all activities to authorities for verification.","context":["Smart cities, intelligent transport\nWhat does the future of transport look like? The answer to this question is multifaceted, as transport, whether municipal or private, is about to take a quantum leap forward as several digital technologies mature and converge.\nSmart mobility, particularly in urban environments, will continue to evolve. The smart city is quickly coming into focus as technologies such as 5G, AI, IoT, AR, Wi-Fi, and edge computing are all components of an intelligent, efficient and secure transport system.\nThe digital infrastructures that an intelligent transport system needs to operate are being constructed. Smart parking, intelligent mobile real-time route planning, cashless payments, and integrated control systems are all in various stages of development. Businesses like Uber have shown how decentralised transport managed with a smartphone can transform how individuals’ access transportation services.\nIntelligent transport systems, though, offer much more than just calling a taxi: The smart digital ecosystem that all transport systems need to operate effectively creates a digital environment where even more innovation can occur.\nThere is also a commercial aspect as the report from Juniper Research concluded, smart traffic management systems will save cities $277 billion by reducing emissions and congestion globally by 2025. And the key technology behind these savings could reduce by over 33 hours the time spent in traffic per annum per motorist.\nIn its report, Arup summarise how a range of technologies converge to create the digital spaces transport can use to deliver efficient services to citizens: “Mobile phones, parking sensors, congestion charging zones and smart card ticketing all yield valuable data about how and when people are moving around the city, and how these patterns are affected by variables like traffic, weather or public events.”\nSpeaking to Digital Bulletin, John Cowan, CEO, EDJX, outlined how the Autonomy Institute – a cooperative research consortium focused on advancing and accelerating autonomy and AI at the edge, announced plans to launch the Public Infrastructure Network Node (PINN) in Austin, Texas.\n“The PINN is the first unified open standard to incorporate 5G wireless, edge computing, radar, lidar, enhanced GPS, and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a single unified system,” says Cowan. “PINNs are designed to rapidly deliver a multitude of advanced edge sensors and computing capabilities urgently needed to support autonomy and IoT. PINN is a breakthrough in digital infrastructure, solving the current challenge of delivering low-latency computing and sensors at the edge while avoiding unsightly urban infrastructure sprawl.”\nDeveloping the digital ecosystem that advanced transport systems need to operate efficiently is a critical first step. And these systems are taking shape. For example, citizens in Hamburg, Germany can use an app on their phones that tracks their current location and constantly matches this to available buses and trains. The app also allows tickets to be paid for, making the use of their transport systems more efficient for everyone. Helsinki has WHIM that goes even further and integrates public transport access with bike and car-sharing services – all accessed via a citizen’s smartphone. And Copenhagen has smart traffic lights it claims can reduce bus travel by up to 20% and can even prioritise cycle users.\nStructure and technology\nOne clear prerequisite for smart cities and the intelligent transport systems they contain is fast, reliable connectivity. Here, edge computing comes into play. Moving data storage and processing away from decentralised data centres closer to the devices they serve (such as autonomous vehicles) is a fundamental component of creating an intelligent transport system. Autonomous vehicles need access to low-latency data networks. Edge computing delivers that performance.\nA byproduct of a smart transport ecosystem is data. Masses of information are generated within this digital environment. The value of that data is its ability to offer transport companies, governments, automotive manufacturers, and mobile broadband providers the insights they need to evolve their services.\nPwC, in its overview of the challenges building a smart city with an intelligent transport system, places data and its analysis at the core of these systems: “Once the core infrastructure – roads and railways – is in place, what matters then is understanding, anticipating, and meeting users’ needs.\nSmart use of data is vital in shaping the system to do this. So, the vision for the smart future is focused on people, enabled by transport, and powered by technology and data.”\nPaul Thomas, head of proposition development at North that designs and delivers integrated technology solutions for complex and critical environments throughout the UK, stated to Digital Bulletin that data is the key to intelligent transport systems: “Our public transport system should be frictionless; efficient, deterministic, an improvement on our air quality and supportive of the natural environment. It should also prioritise commuter experience and adoption. A robust transport system is critical in supporting economies and increasing productivity, so ease of use and efficiency is paramount. To deliver this, we need a baseline of data acquired from a connected city.”\nAs intelligent transport systems develop, they have a symbiotic connection to the environments they move through. Autonomous vehicles may grab the news headlines, but the vehicles themselves are just one small component of a smart digital network that enables them to operate safely.\nThe transport systems in development across the urban landscape are becoming complex networks of sensors and data analysis systems that the personalised transport services cities need are being built upon.\nConnect and protect\nIntelligent transport systems inherently use complex networks to deliver their services. The security and privacy of personal data is a core debate as smart transport systems develop. According to BAI Communications, who looked closely at how rail transport could be created, concluded 81% of respondents are at least somewhat comfortable with their anonymised data being used to improve transport systems. Similarly, three-quarters of rail users (75%) are at least relatively comfortable with their data being used to predict travel patterns to provide them with a personalised transport service.\nAlso, Hatem Oueslati, CEO and Co-Founder of, IoTerop makes the salient point that interoperability with systems and data is fundamental to developing integrated smart transport networks. “5G for connectivity and Lightweight M2M for security and data standardisation are strategically important. Not only do they reduce the technical and economic barriers spurring innovation, but they rationalise and future-proof investments as well. By adhering to the standard of these devices, systems, security, and data become interoperable.”\nThe data generated by intelligent transport systems must also be protected. Robust and flexible security is a critical component of any smart city and the intelligent transport systems they contain. There has been much debate around the lack of security within the IoT space.\nAccording to ABI Research, by 2026, it’s predicted there will be over 23 billion active IoT devices. However, the recent announcement from the FIDO Alliance’s proposed Device Onboard standard could offer a more comprehensive security platform as IoT expands, which will benefit the burgeoning smart transport networks as they evolve over the next few years.\nWhether using private vehicles or accessing public transport, the pervasive networks needed will disappear into our built environments. For citizens, their smartphones become their connection to these systems, which are fully integrated and deliver the personalised travel services they need on demand.\n“In the future, we need ‘smart cars’ to become more integrated with national intelligent transport infrastructures to ensure vehicles can operate safely and efficiently,” concluded Kevin Curran, IEEE senior member and professor of cyber security at Ulster University.\n“Satellite navigation and traffic signal control systems will ensure vehicles know when to stop, slow down and speed up as well as identify hazards in good time. This communication will result in better traffic management and significantly reduce the number of accidents. Ultimately, the roads beneath us will communicate with smart cars, most likely through indestructible sensors embedded within the road.”\nFor a transport system to be genuinely transformative for its users, the technical components must be fully interoperable. Systems that couple IoT with 5G are a powerful combination. Transport systems serve their customers. For them, seamless and transparent access to mobility is their holy grail. In the next few years, that goal will become a reality.","Smart city programs all over the world have been rapidly rising in the past decade or two. It brings up new innovative technologies and possibilities but also risks and could have unpredictable outcomes and consequences. A good way to portray the size and growth potential of smart city market is that today over half of global GDP is produced by 380 cities and by 2025 the estimates are that 600 cities will be responsible for more than 60% of economic growth (Iliev, 2018). For the sake of comparison there were over 4000 cities with more than 100 000 inhabitants in 2015 and to this date that number has undeniably only grown bigger (Brilliant Maps, 2018).\nThe IoT (Internet of Things) has given a possibility for cities to make themselves more reachable and interconnected with its citizens and the technological advancements in data gathering and analyzing will lead to substantial cost savings and economic growth. This will also give outside investors a chance to be part of these rapidly growing programs. The effect of big and smart cities in global economy and future growth cannot be underlined enough. And if estimates come true, 66% percent of human population will be living in urban areas by the year 2050 and therefore there needs to be major accomplishments in technology and proper allocation of resources to handle this huge population (Low, 2018).\nWhat Makes a City Smart?A city might have a large population and a lot of big companies in technology and business, local public transportation and a good economical situation. But what makes a city smart is the communication, data collection and analyzation of this data and the use of it in daily life. Whether it is about optimizing the public transportation to efficiently match the needs of citizens and the current traffic flow or adjusting the lighting and heating in an office building based on the amount of natural light and warmth and more importantly the location of workers and the nature of work they are doing. The optimizing based on people’s location and the things they do extends all the way to water and energy usage and transportation and sewerage (Gardner, M., Brown, M. and Petel, G. 2018), (du Preez, 2017).\nAll these things have a huge impact on citizen well-being, cost-savings due to optimizing the usage of energy and water, transportation all-around and on environmentally sustainable life in a city. An optimal and desirable smart city is efficient, focused on making life better on all areas, non-discriminating, environmentally friendly and sustainable and has a wide range of possibilities on communication with the citizens and is continuously listening to ideas for improvement. That is a place everyone would be happy to live and should be a target for all governments and city councils all around the globe.\nStrategy of Smart City Investing\nAs a company investing in a smart city is a little different from usual as there is also the government and city council to cooperate with and that lays out some new challenges that separate the smart city investing from regular business to business or business to customer -based thinking. There is a lot of restrictions involving the procedures used, quality, sustainability, safety and privacy and all the work has to be done with close interactions and communication with the authorities and there needs to be a report on everything that is done or will be done and it has to be properly and with caution delivered to the authorities who verify and check everything to make sure it matches the restrictions (Gardner, M., Brown, M. and Petel, G. 2018).\nSince there is a lot of competition on the technological field concerning smart cities, the company absolutely needs to have a stand-out innovation plan that most proficiently fills the needs of the city and is sustainable, environmentally friendly and has an overall positive economic impact. And there must be a realistic plan to reach these requirements since failure in a matter of this significance and size is not really an option to the city and therefore the strict restrictions are in place.\nThere has been a lot of talk about the privacy concerns a smart city faces since the whole idea is based on data collecting and analyzing. One idea to most effectively keep the information safe is to cooperate with technology-businesses that have a lot of experience in protecting data and all kinds of challenges it creates like Google, Apple and Facebook. Cities using this data will have to find the happy medium in the depth of the data analyzing since eventually there will be a gray area of information that the citizens will not be willing to give up for use and don’t want to risk losing that information to third parties.\nA lot of the smart city ideas are based on following the locations of people. For example when a person wants to go to a business meeting in the center of the city with a car during the worst rush hour, an app could tell him where the nearest free parking spot is and where he has to turn to access this parking spot. Eventually this kind of location monitoring adds up to patterns that reveal extremely indistinguishable information about people that they certainly do not want to share. That kind of information can be where they live and work, what kind of hobbies they have, where do their friends live and what kind of medical issues they have. At some point in addition the law comes an obstacle in at least most of the modern states that value human rights and privacy (Gardner, M., Brown, M. and Petel, G. 2018).\nWays of Investing in a Smart City Ways of investing in a smart city vary on all levels of imagination. Whether it is about funding a sustainable green energy project just outside the city to cover a major part of the energy consumption in the city or developing a new kind of data storage system that can handle the massive amount of data collected and can withstand the growth of that data in the future as well (Iliev, 2018).\nMost likely the most used way of investing is and will be buying shares of the companies that have the connections and possibilities to in a major way affect some aspect of smart city technology and can be most profitable in the long run. An investor has to be extremely careful when investing in these companies though, since the smart city program is relatively new and we do not yet know how everything will turn out with it because there are no experiences from the past to compare to. In addition there is a massive amount of technology companies that want to be part of these programs but only a small proportion of them will succeed and have a profitable role in the smart city world. An investor needs to find the most potent, innovative, stable, ambitious and well-funded companies that have the necessary elements to be a successful operator in the field.\nEconomic Benefits of a Smart CityI\nmplementation of the Internet of Things allows a city to create variety of ways to both save and generate money through reducing energy and water usage and being more efficient in car-parking and speeding fines to name a few. Most importantly applying Internet of Things in the basic fundamentals of a city saves everyone’s time, money and effort and also the environment as the data collected allows cities to adjust their services and businesses to most efficiently do their work (Eichler, 2018).\nA significant effect on being a stable and profit generating city is that it attracts even more investors to make the city an even better place to live through continuous investment and new smart technology projects.\nThere has been concerns about the funding necessary for cities to start a program to implement the Internet of Things even though the overall amount of money invested in smart cities is exponentially growing. The reasons to this are mainly location- and state -based since the main proportion of funding comes from the local authorities (Eichler, 2018).\nIf a proper plan is introduced, a smart city project will get a big share of private funding, but as mentioned before, the privacy and security concerns need to be properly addressed and that requires the local authorities to have a substantial part in the developing and maintaining process, hence the need for local funding too. In addition the city itself is always held accountable for the safety and functionality of the technological systems and the area as a whole. Therefore it is understandable that the first thing to start a smart city program is to find a government-backed funding plan. Other significant reason for the hold-ups of smart city projects is the lack of infrastructure to back the systems needed to create a sufficient technological entity for the Internet of Things to be implemented (Eichler, 2018). Business Insider’s estimation of Internet of Things attracted investments. (Business Insider Intelligence)\nAs the technology grows and people keep on moving in large cities after work, family and way of life, the cities have to create more ways to save costs and at the same time be more reachable and environmentally friendly. This offers numerous chances for investors as technology companies implementing the Internet of things line up for cities to choose from. Investment choice has to be even more carefully planned than usual since the massive competition in the field compared to the amount of companies that will actually be used to build up the city’s communications- and data analyzing -systems.\nThere is a bright future in the technology-business considering the smart city programs. There is also a moral incentive as the smart city idea itself is to quarantee the well-being of the citizens and to provide sustainable and environmentally friendly services and power in addition to a huge impact on economic growth.\n- Iliev, I.

{"question":"As a mental health counselor, I'm curious how self-concept and social adaptation influence mental health in college students compared to social anxiety disorder symptoms in the general population?","answer":"Both populations show significant interconnections between psychological factors, though through different mechanisms. In college students, self-concept impacts mental health both directly and indirectly through social adaptation as a mediating factor - good self-concept leads to better social adaptation which then promotes better mental health. Studies show 20-30% of college students experience mental health issues. For the general population with social anxiety disorder, the key mechanism involves persistent fear and anxiety in social situations that is disproportionate to actual threat. This leads to avoidance behaviors or enduring situations with high distress, significantly impacting work, school, and relationships. The disorder typically emerges between ages 13-18 and manifests through specific triggers like public speaking, eating in front of others, or being the center of attention.","context":["In recent years, with the increasing enrollment of universities throughout the country, the number of college students is increasing year by year. At the same time, with the complexity and diversity of the current society, college students are facing more and more psychological pressure, such as employment, emotional and interpersonal relationship. The mental health of college students has increasingly become an issue and hotspot which is noticed and researched by society. Currently, College students in all factors of Symptom Check-List90 (SCL-90) were significantly higher than the norms in 1986   . The number of college students with mental disorder arrived at 20% - 30%, which is much higher than other social groups  . Therefore, the aim of the study was to explore the internal impact factors and the mechanism of action of the psychological health among college students, and to provide an important theoretical and practical significance for the prevention and intervention of college students’ psychological health.\nSelf-concept is the individual’s cognition and evaluation of the self and social environment which are formed during the process of socialization, which is the sum of the individual’s self-cognition   . The formation and development of self-concept is a dynamic and changing process. College day is the period that self-concept goes through fastest development and has the most problems. College Students’ understanding and evaluation of self will not only affect their own behavior, but also affect their mental health. It is found that there is a significant positive correlation between self-concept and mental health, which has a strong predictive effect on mental health     . Self-concept can prevent the social dysfunction  , but also can prevent mental health problems  . That is to say, college students with good self-concept can make a more objective evaluation of themselves, and actively accept the self, thus regulating and maintaining their own mental health. However, how does self-concept affect the mental health of college students?\nSocial adaptation refers to the individual in the interaction with the social environment, and constantly learns or modifies the behavior and life-style, and ultimately to maintain a harmonious and balanced state with the social environment  . Does social adaptation play an intermediary role in the relationship between self-concept and mental health of college students? At present, there is no relevant literature to explore this issue. It is found that there is a significant positive correlation between self-concept and social adaptation of college students, that is, the lower the self-concept of college students is, the lower the level of their social adaptation is  . Relative to the individual with high self-concept, the individual with low self-concept in the fact of social adaptation showed negative features  . In addition, social adaptation is one of the crucial factors affecting mental health  . For example, researches have found that social adaptation can effectively predict mental health, individuals with poor social adaptation; their mental health status will be also relatively poor    . Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the social adaptation is a mediating variable between self- concept and mental health of college students.\nOverall, self-concept, social adaptation and mental health are closely linked, and social adaptation may act as a link and bridge. Therefore, this study takes college students as the research object, and for three main purposes, one is to explore the relationship among self-concept, social adaptation and mental health; two is to examine the mediating role of social adaptation in self-concept and mental health; three is to reveal the internal mechanism that self-concept affects mental health.\nThis study adopts the method of random cluster sampling, taking the class as a unit. Questionnaire survey was conducted among the undergraduates in a university; subjects filled the questionnaire under unified instructions from staff. Questionnaires were in total 580, and valid questionnaires were 505. Of the participants, 47.1% were males (n = 238); 52.9% were females (n = 270). The ages of the subject range from 17 to 24 (Mean = 21.41, SD = 1.35).\n2.1. China College Student Adjustment Scale\nThis study uses the China College Student Adjustment Scales (CCSA), which has been used as china college student adjustment in the former research  . The scale has 7 dimensions that interpersonal adjustment, learning adjustment, campus life adjustment, job selection adjustment, emotion adjustment, self adjustment, and life satisfaction, total 60 items. It is a 5-point rating scale (1-2-3-4-5), respectively, from the “completely disagree” to “completely agree”. The higher the score, the better the ability of social adaptation. The coefficient of internal consistency of this scale in the present study was 0.883.\n2.2. College Student Self-Concept Questionnaire\nThis study uses the College Student Self-Concept Questionnaire (CSSQ), which has been used as college student self-concept in the former research  . The questionnaire has 23 items, α = 0.716, the retest reliability was 0.785. The questionnaire has good content validity and constructs validity. It is a 5-point rating scale (1-2-3-4-5), respectively, from the “completely disagree” to “completely agree”. The higher the scores, the students’ self-concept is more positive, the level of self-development is more higher. The coefficient of internal consistency of this scale in the present study was 0.883.\n2.3. Development of Chinese College Student Mental Health Scale\nThis study uses the Development of Chinese College Student Mental Health Scale (DCCSMH), which has been used as college student mental health in the former research  . The scale has 12 dimensions and 96 items, measures of somatization, anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, withdrawal, attack, paranoia, compulsion, dependence, impulsivity, psychological disorders, psychotic tendencies and other mental health problems. The reliability of the subscales is between 0.764 - 0.893, which indicates that the scale has good reliability. It is a 5-point rating scale (1-2-3-4-5), respectively, from the “completely disagree” to “completely agree”. The higher the score, the more the mental health problems were severe. The coefficient of internal consistency of this scale in the present study was 0.955.\nTo test the model, data were collected from one university, which adopts the method of random cluster sampling. Before the data collection, all participants was signed informed consent.\n3. Data Analyses\nThe data were analyzed statistically by SPSS 18.0 and AMOS 22.0. The methods of statistical analysis including descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, Bootstrap test.\n3.1. Statistical Test for Common Method Biases\nAccording to previous research  , the study adopts Harman’s single way factor analysis to test common method biases; the result shows that when the research data is not rotating, a total of 47 factor, could explain variance of 68.43%. The first factor explains 17.91% variance, under 40% of estimate criteria. It is shown that the study has not existed serious common method biases.\n3.2. The Correlation Analysis of College Students’ Self-Concept, Social Adaptation and Mental Health\nFrom the correlation analysis as shown in Table 1, except the self-concept and mental health of three factors (anxiety, dependence and impulse) are no significant correlation. self-concept, social adaptation and mental health are significant positive correlation among various factors.\n3.3. The Test of Mediating Effect\nThis research uses Bootstrap test for each mediating effect   . First, using repeat random sampling method (N = 505) extracted from the original data of 1000 samples of the Bootstrap, then according to the samples of fitting mediating effect model (Figure 1). Mediating effect index of each path and the mediation effect of 95% confidence interval (Table 2). If the path coefficient of the 95% confidence interval does not include zero, indicates that the mediation effect is significant. From the Table 2, the relationship\nTable 1. The result of correlation analysis, mean and standard deviation.\nps: 1 = somatization, 2 = anxiety, 3 = depression, 4 = Inferiority, 5 = flinch, 6 = attack, 7 = bigotry, 8 = constrain, 9 = dependency, 10 = impulsion, 11 = psychosexual disorder, 12 = psychotic tendencies, 13 = social adaption, 14 = self-concept; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.\nFigure 1. Social adaptation in mediating effect model between self-concept and mental health.\nTable 2. The bootstrap analysis of mediating effect significance test.\n*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.\nbetween self-concept and mental health of three factors (anxiety, dependence and impulse) are “covered” by social adaptation, which belongs to cover effect   . Others factors, the 95% confidence interval of the path does not contain zero, which social adaptation is verified in the partial mediation effect of self-concept and mental health. The proportion of mediation effect respectively that somatization = 12%, depression = 16%, Inferiority = 14%, flinch = 20%, attack = 8%, bigotry = 11%, constrain = 10%, dependency = 16%, psychosexual disorder = 14%, psychotic tendencies = 9%.\nFrom the correlation analysis, we can see that there is a significant positive correlation between the factors of self-concept, social adaptation and mental health, in addition to self-concept and anxiety, dependence and impulse. The result is consistent with the conclusions of previous studies     , this shows there is a close relationship among self-concept, social adaptation and mental health. It can be seen from the test results of mediating effect that self-concept can not only influence the mental health directly, but also affect the mental health indirectly through the social adaptation. But the relationship between self-concept and the three factors (anxiety, dependence, impulse) are “covered” by social adaptation. This is consistent with the results of the correlation analysis, which shows the influence of self-concept on the mental health of three health factors (anxiety, dependence and impulse) are restricted by social adaptation.\nIn this study, social adaptation plays a mediating role between self-concept and mental health of college students. This shows that self-concept can not only affect mental health directly, but also affect the mental health indirectly through social adaptation. The time of university is the period of development, change and maturity of self-concept. Besides, having a good self-concept and a positive self-acceptance will help students to actively regulate and maintain their own mental health. On the contrary, the negative self-concept will cause a lot of bad social behavior, such as aggression, infraction, crime and psychological problem (depression and neurosis, etc.).   . Self-concept, of course, is not an independent factor that affects mental health. It also needs to through the interaction between social adaptation and environment, and then influence the mental health. Self-concept through a good social adaptation can provide the power and source for mental health, and poor social adaptation will lead to the hidden trouble about the more psychological problems.\nIn short, self-concept as an internal factor, social adaptation as an external factor, the two play crucial role in mental health. Among them, self-concept not only has a directly impact on mental health, but also indirectly impacts on mental health through the social adaptation, namely, the mediating effect, such as inferiority, aggression and paranoia, etc. In addition, social adaptation, in turn, suppresses self-concept, namely, the cover effect, such as anxiety, dependence, and impulse. Therefore, the conclusion of this study has two implications for the prevention and intervention of college students’ mental health: First, self-concept and social adaptation should be meanwhile considered, especially in the college students’ mental health prevention and intervention. Second, enhance and even strengthen the social adaptation of college students, functions of social adaptation as bridge should be fully exerted.\nNaturally, there are still limitations in this study that can be improved in future research. First, this study adopts the cross-sectional study design which could not get the conclusion of causality. Second, this study adopts self-report measurement way, so the social desirability may influence the result. Third, longitudinal studies or experiments could be considered in future research.\nThis work was supported by the Science foundation for Young Scholars of Jiangxi Province (20151BAB215033); the postdoctoral Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province (2014KY52, 2014RC11); the graduate student innovation project of Jiangxi Province (YC2016-S136); and the MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (16YJCZH105).\n Byrne, B.M.

They consistently experience anxiety that is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the feared situation. The individual will either avoid the situation or endure it with high levels of distress. This anxiety significantly interferes with functioning or normal routines in the areas of work or school, social activities, and relationships. Social anxiety relates to the fear of being evaluated by others. Most of us have some level of social anxiety when meeting new people, talking to someone we are attracted to, or performing in front of a group such as making a toast at a wedding. We may feel embarrassment when making social mistakes, like forgetting someone’s name or giving the wrong answer to a question.\nWhat differentiates clinically severe social anxiety disorder from the social anxiety experienced to some degree by most people are the intensity and persistence of the anxiety, shame, and embarrassment and the extent of avoidance of situations and people that trigger anxiety. People with social anxiety are usually aware that their anxiety is out of proportion to the situations, but this awareness does not decrease their level of anxiety or their urge to escape.\nPeople with social anxiety disorder may have panic attacks anticipating or during triggering situations. Unlike those with panic disorder, who often fear that a panic attack will result in dying or going crazy, socially anxious people with panic attacks are afraid of doing something that would embarrass them.\nDue to the intense anxiety experienced in relation to social situations, socially anxious people will often use safety behaviors (e.g., rehearsing what they are going to say; asking questions instead of talking about themselves; wear makeup to cover blushing) or avoidance as coping mechanisms. While these tactics may work in the short run to decrease their anxiety, they come at a high cost of interference with functioning in the areas of relationships, school, and work.\nTypical situations that trigger intense anxiety and possibly avoidance:\n• Starting or maintaining a conversation\n• Participating in small groups\n• Eating in front of others\n• Giving a presentation\n• Asking someone out\n• Being the center of attention\n• Urinating in the presence of others\n• Any situation with potential for appearing nervous to others or being observed blushing, sweating or shaking\nChildren and Teens\nThe typical age of onset for social anxiety disorder is between the ages of 13 and 18, but it may occur in younger children. Selective mutism, which is a separate diagnostic category in DSM-5, is a form of social anxiety that usually manifests in children between the ages of 3 and 6. Children with selective mutism avoid speaking in situations such as at school, doctors’ visits, or around people other than their family.\nTypical situations that trigger intense anxiety and avoidance in children and teens:\n• Answering questions in class\n• Asking the teacher a question\n• Ordering food at restaurants\n• Inviting others to get together\n• Oral presentations\n• Talking on the phone or texting\n• Going to birthday parties\n• Attending school dances\n|Adults||Children and Teens|\n|First-Line Treatments: Psychotherapy||Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), the clear first-line psychotherapeutic treatment, can be administered in group or individual format. The most effective component of CBT is exposure to feared social situations.|\nOn average, individual CBT lasts 15-20 sessions. Techniques included: psychoeducation about the disorder, exposure to feared social situations, cognitive restructuring exercises before and after exposures, modification of core beliefs, and relapse prevention.\nExposure exercises may be usefully designed to include an emphasis on focusing attention outward rather than on the self and refraining from the use of subtle avoidance or safety behaviors.\n|CBT involves the child and parents: psychoeducation about the disorder and the relationship between anxious thoughts, feelings, and avoidance behavior. Cognitive restructuring involving identifying distortions and developing more realistic thoughts can be helpful.|\nAn essential component to the treatment is exposure to feared social situations, done in vivo and/or imaginal. SET-C, a CBT program combining exposure therapy with social skill training, has been shown to be effective for children between ages 6 and 14.\nCan be delivered individually and in group; usually 12 to 24 sessions.\nParents are integral and are taught how to reinforce the child’s approach to situations that trigger anxiety.\n|First-Line Treatments: Pharmacotherapy||SSRIs and SNRIs venlafaxine are the clear first-line pharmacotherapy treatment based on demonstrated efficacy in randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. Medications in these classes that have been FDA-approved in the U.S. are paroxetine (immediate-release and controlled release), sertraline, fluvoxamine controlled release, and venlafaxine extended release. Other medications in these classes with evidence of efficacy from randomized controlled trials include citalopram, escitalopram, and vilazodone. Fluoxetine has had mixed results in randomized controlled trials. SNRIs should be used with caution in patients at risk for suicide due to greater toxicity in overdose. No individual medication within this class has been consistently shown to be superior to another in this class. SSRIs and SNRIs have not been specifically studied for the performance type of this disorder.||SSRIs**|\nFirst-line treatment SSRIs, the most favorable treatment options due to their efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Specific SSRIs that have been examined include fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, escitalopram, and citalopram. Most of the pharmacological studies (youths ages 7-17) comprised the anxiety triad of symptoms and disorders: the combination of separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder; few data are specific to the pharmacotherapy treatment of social anxiety disorder in children and teens.\n|First-Line Treatments: Combined||Little evidence suggests that combinations of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are more efficacious than either modality administered alone. The literature is simply too small, and the conclusions are inconsistent. However, combination with first-line pharmacotherapies may be useful for patients who have shown only partial response to a course of CBT.||Limited evidence from one study: Combined treatment with CBT and sertraline was superior to either treatment alone, and all treatments were superior to placebo.|\n|Second-Line Treatments: Psychotherapy||CBT Variants. Some evidence suggests that exposure without cognitive restructuring is as efficacious as exposure with the cognitive component. But much more evidence is in favor of the full CBT approach, and exposure without the cognitive component is recommended only if the patient has difficulty with those activities or the feared situation is narrowly defined and specific.|\nRecent research has demonstrated preliminary efficacy of CBT focused on intolerance of uncertainty in social situations. Although promising, insufficient research prevents this approach from being considered a first line treatment. Transdiagnostic group therapy (in which individuals with social anxiety disorder may be treated alongside individuals with other anxiety or emotional disorders) has shown very positive results in early trials and may be equivalent to diagnosis-specific approaches. CBT administered via the Internet shows great promise. Current data suggest that therapist- or coach-assisted programs may be preferable to fully self-administered programs. A concern about Internet CBT is the screening of patients to make sure that the content is appropriate for the patient and that there are not more pressing clinical concerns that should receive prior attention.\nMindfulness and Acceptance-Based Therapies. This category includes acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), and mindfulness and acceptance-based group therapy (MAGT); all have demonstrated efficacy in waitlist controlled trials. One study found MBSR to be efficacious but inferior to group CBT on measures of social anxiety and treatment response. Other trials have demonstrated similar efficacy of ACT and MAGT to CBT. Although the quality of this research is quite good, the number of trials is modest.\nApplied Relaxation Training. Progressive muscle relaxation training has not demonstrated efficacy as a treatment. However, applied relaxation, in which the patient learns to practice relaxation skills while engaging in increasingly complex activities and then in feared social situations has demonstrated efficacy in a number of trials. In one trial comparing applied relaxation to CBT, whereas applied relaxation was superior to waitlist, it was not as successful as CBT.\nSocial Skills Training. Very popular for many years based on the idea that social anxiety is based on a deficit in social skills, social skills training has shown little efficacy in controlled trials. The social skills deficit theory has not maintained traction in the research community, but it is clear that it applies well in some individual cases, and it should be considered on that basis.\nInterpersonal Psychotherapy. Although much of CBT is interpersonally focused and some evidence suggests that this emphasis may be useful, interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), a well-established treatment for depression that focuses on interpersonal problems (i.e. grief, role disputes, role transitions, and interpersonal deficits) has much less supportive data in the treatment of social anxiety. In one large-scale trial, IPT was superior to the control condition but less efficacious than CBT, both immediately post-treatment and at a one year follow-up.\nPsychodynamic Psychotherapy. Psychodynamic therapy has only been studied in controlled trials in recent years, and the literature base is not yet adequate to suggest it as a strong alternative; it is offered here only if other psychotherapeutic options have been unsuccessful or unavailable. The particular variety known as supportive expressive psychotherapy (SEP) in one large multisite clinical trial yielded better response than waitlist but lesser response than CBT at post-test. However, two-year follow-up data showed little difference between SEP and CBT.\n|Second-Line Treatments: Pharmacotherapy||Another SSRI or SNRI: Patients who do not response to a single trial of an SSRI or SNRI sometimes respond to another medication within this class.|\nOther antidepressants: Mirtazapine has had mixed results in randomized controlled trials. Moclobemide, a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase, has had mixed results in randomized controlled trials; meta-analyses suggest it may not be as efficacious as SSRIs. Phenelzine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, has appeared highly efficacious in several randomized controlled trials, but is reserved for treatment refractory patients due to its need for dietary restrictions to minimize risk of hypertensive reactions.\nBenzodiazepines: Clonazepam, and to a lesser extent alprazolam and bromazepam, have been found efficacious in randomized controlled trials. They are usually reserved as a second-line treatment due to risks of abuse and lack of efficacy for comorbid depression.\nGabapentin and pregabalin have been found efficacious in randomized controlled trials.\nOlanzapine and quetiapine have shown some evidence for efficacy in small randomized controlled trials, but they are usually reserved for refractory patients due to risks of metabolic syndrome and tardive dyskinesia. Single doses of quetiapine were ineffective for public speaking anxiety.\nBeta adrenergic blockers, such as propranolol and atenolol, have appeared efficacious in single doses for undiagnosed anxious performers in randomized controlled trials. They have been anecdotally reported to be helpful for the performance anxiety. But beta adrenergic blockers have not been found effective when given on a daily basis for social anxiety not limited to the performance type.\nOther second-line treatments with very limited evidence for efficacy based only on open trials: bupropion SR, clomipramine, topiramate, and divalproex.\n|SNRIs: Emerging evidence for the serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Their use is currently supported by only one positive randomized controlled trial with venlafaxine, classed as second-line agent due to limited efficacy data and potential toxicity in overdose.|\n|Second-Line Treatments: Combined||N/A||N/A|\n|Adjunctive Treatments||Clonazepam has been shown efficacious as an adjunct to SSRI treatment in an RCT. D-cycloserine has had mixed results as an adjunct to CBT exposure sessions in RCTs.||N/A|\n|Complementary and Alternative Treatments||St. John’s Wort did not demonstrate superiority in one RCT.||N/A|\n|Options for Treatment Refractory Conditions||Limited open-trial evidence supports adjunctive treatment of partial responders or nonresponders to SSRIs, with buspirone, risperidone, and aripiprazole.||N/A|\n|Treatments Not Recommended||Atomoxetine, levetiracetam, imipramine, tiagabine, nefazodone, and pergolide have all appeared ineffective in RCTs or open trials.|\nStanding doses of beta adrenergic blockers have appeared ineffective in RCTs in social anxiety disorder samples that were not limited to the performance subtype.\nSingle doses of quetiapine were ineffective for public speaking anxiety in patients with social anxiety disorder .\n|Benzodiazepines have not been evaluated.|\n|Comorbidity Concerns||Some question stands whether comorbid depression impedes progress in CBT. Some studies suggest this, but others suggest that poorer post-test outcomes are related to poorer baseline functioning. Data suggest that comorbid anxiety disorders have less of an influence on CBT for social anxiety.|\nPresence of comorbid unipolar depression supports preference for antidepressants with efficacy for both social anxiety and depression over other pharmacotherapies.\nAntidepressants should be used with caution in bipolar disorder due to risk of inducing mania.\nPresence of comorbid substance use disorders are a relative contraindication to treatment with benzodiazepines.\nBeta adrenergic blockers are contraindicated in the presence of asthma and some cardiovascular conditions.\n|CBT: cognitive-behavioral therapy; RCT: randomized controlled trial; SET-C: social effective training for children; SNRI: serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; SSRI: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|\n|** In 2004 the U.S Food and Drug Administration issued a statement that antidepressant manufacturers include a “black box warning” concerning antidepressant treatment and the potential risk of suicide in children and adolescents. This followed an analysis of clinical trials, which revealed a 4% risk of suicide associated with antidepressants vs. 2% with placebo. Most of the included studies were in major depressive disorder as opposed to anxiety disorders. Moreover, other reports from the same time period have indicated that the relative risk of suicide associated with SSRIs versus non-SSRIs was significantly decreased (RR=0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.43). However, children and teens treated with antidepressants should be closely monitored for the emergence or heightening of suicidal ideation.|\n|Social Anxiety Disorder Clinical Practice Review Task Force|\nMichael Van Ameringen, MD, McMaster University — Chair\nRichard G.

{"question":"I saw a news headline about voting rights: are Native Americans and women still facing similar challenges in accessing voting rights today?","answer":"Yes, both groups continue to face challenges, though in different ways. For women, the Equal Rights Amendment, which would protect against sex-based discrimination, remains unratified almost a century after its 1923 introduction, and voter discrimination and suppression persist. For Native Americans, particularly since the Supreme Court's 2013 decision affecting the Voting Rights Act, numerous state legislatures have passed new election laws creating significant barriers for Native voters. This has led to ongoing work by organizations like the Native American Voting Rights Coalition to remove barriers to Native American voter registration and voting.","context":["|Protestors showing support for \"equal rights for women.\"\n(Office of the University Historian Collection, AR.0015)\nThe addition of the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution was a massive success for suffragists and others who envisioned a democracy that lived up to its name. However, this did not mark the end, but simply a milestone on the journey toward electoral equality. This amendment did not address the many other types of obstacles that many women faced, particularly those from marginalized and minority communities. When the amendment went into effect, Native Americans were not considered U.S. citizens and therefore could not vote; they were granted citizenship in 1924. Black women faced the same voter intimidation tactics that were being used to keep Black men from voting. Not until the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 was it illegal to deny the right to vote based on race. Although great strides have been taken to increase voting equality, beginning with the 19th amendment, voter discrimination and suppression persists even now, making full electoral equality a dream not yet realized.\nWhile the 19th amendment protected women's right to vote, it did not guarantee protection against discrimination in other areas. Legislation like the Equal Rights Amendment, which would deny any discrimination based on sex, remains a reform for which many activists fight. It was first introduced in Congress in 1923, passed the House of Representatives in 1970, passed the Senate in 1972, but failed to ratify. Almost a century after it was first introduced, it continues to hang in limbo.\nFollowing the passage of the 19th amendment in 1920, suffrage groups and supporters turned their energies toward issues like voter registration and education. Some began working more closely with politicians on social reform legislation. Many women began seizing the new opportunity to work in politics by running for and holding political office. NAWSA, one of the primary suffrage organizations, evolved into the League of Women Voters which has continuously worked to increase voter participation and supported women entering politics. NWP, another main suffrage organization, turned its focus to the Equal Rights Amendment. Women continue to play a crucial role in creating a more equitable society through these reforms and more.\nThe papers of activists, politicians, and reform-focused organizations can provide insight into the ongoing crusade of social, political, and economic equality:\n|Issues of the Voter Education Project's newsletter from 1969.|\nWilma Dykeman and James R. Stokely Jr. Papers, 1807-2011 (MS.3800)\nAppalachian authors Wilma Dykeman and James R. Stokely Jr. focused many of their works on progressive topics like environmental activism, birth control, and social justice. Together the couple extensively researched and wrote about the Civil Rights movement, and they participated with the Southern Regional Council, an organization promoting racial equality that focused many efforts on voter registration and political awareness. Additionally, for Wilma's work, Tennessee Women: Past and Present (1977), she worked closely with women's rights activist Martha Ragland. This work is documented in their collection of papers.\nEstes Kefauver Papers, 1925-1967 (MPA.0144)\nTennessee native Estes Kefauver (1903-1963) served with the U.S. House of Representatives from 1939-1949 and with the Senate from 1949-1963. His papers include subject files that contain correspondence, reports, reference material, and other documents on important subjects related to Kefauver's legislative work including \"Civil Rights\" and \"Equal Rights for Women.\"\nNational Organization for Women, Memphis Chapter, Newsletters, 1974 (MS.2890)\nFounded in 1966, the National Organization for Women (NOW) has championed women's rights and equality. These newsletters illustrate the work of the organization's Memphis chapter.","A History of Native Voting Rights\nThe right to vote is considered a fundamental right within our democracy; however, for Native Americans, the fight to obtain voting rights is couched in a long history of racism and struggle. When the Fourteenth Amendment was passed in 1866, making all persons born in the United States citizens, Indians on reservations were specifically excluded. Michigan Senator Jacob Howard opined, “I am not yet prepared to pass a sweeping act of naturalization by which all the Indian savages, wild or tame, belonging to a tribal relation, are to become my fellow-citizens and go to the polls and vote with me…” (Congressional Globe. May 30, 1866). page 2895). There were pragmatic reasons, beyond racism, to keep Native Americans from voting; given their large numbers, votes by Native Americans at the time would have wielded significant political power.\nIt was more than half a century later that the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 ensured all Native Americans born within the United States citizenship. However, the Act did not automatically enforce the right to vote. While the Fifteenth Amendment declared that a citizen’s right to vote could not be denied on account of race, many states were able to find other reasons to deny Native peoples the vote—residing on a reservation, tribal enrollment, taxation, and incompetency were all used as reasons for denying Native citizens in some states the right to vote. One outcome being that, thousands of Native veterans, including American Indian Code Talkers returning from World War II, found themselves prohibited from participating in basic civil liberties in the nation that they fought to protect.\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 finally outlawed exclusionary practices that “deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.” However, despite these protections and subsequent legislation, discriminatory practices continue to this day. Since its inception in 1970, NARF has worked on cases to ensure equal and fair access to voting for Native citizens. Repeatedly we have encountered voting rights abuses against Native Americans in Alaska, South Dakota, Montana, Arizona, New Mexico, and other states with significant Native American populations. In addition, in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2013 decision striking down parts of the Voting Rights Act, numerous state legislatures have passed new election laws that impose significant barriers to Native voters.\nThe Native American Voting Rights Coalition\nIn January 2015, NARF proposed an ambitious new project: gathering voting rights advocates, lawyers, civil rights experts, and tribal advocates into one room to discuss current problems with voting in Indian Country and begin to develop solutions to these problems. Previously, individuals and organizations working to protect Native voting rights did so independently, with no coordinated strategy in place. Often, the work was reactive—in response to an immediate threat—rather than proactive or planned in advance of an election. That is what NARF’s project was meant to change. Thus, the Native American Voting Rights Coalition (NAVRC) was formed.\nThe NAVRC includes, among others: Native American Rights Fund (NARF); National Congress of American Indians (NCAI); American Civil Liberties Union, Voting Rights Project (ACLU); Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights (LCCR); Fair Elections Center; Western Native Voice; and Four Directions. NAVRC is organized into three working groups: legislation and policy issues (led by NCAI); litigation (led by NARF); and capacity building and education issues (led by LCCR).\nThe project’s main goal is to remove barriers to Native American voter registration and voting, increase Native civic engagement, and foster a more informed and active Native electorate. With mounting evidence of voter suppression and violations of voting rights laws, NAVRC has accelerated its work. This work includes: (1) planning for redistricting related to the 2020 census; (2) addressing violations observed in the 2016 elections; and (3) overseeing the largest survey of Native voters ever conducted to discover the state of voting in Indian Country.\nRead More: Promote Native American Human Rights"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b3bdd795-4044-4abd-98d1-796e79209ce5>","<urn:uuid:047152a2-b999-4ea1-a67c-a47b6fe737bf>"],"error":null}

The giardial cytoskeleton changes drastically during encystation and excystation. However, the signal transduction pathways mediating these transformations are poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that PP2A, a highly conserved serine/threonine protein phosphatase, might be important in giardial differentiation. We found that in vegetatively growing trophozoites, gPP2A-C protein localizes to basal bodies/centrosomes, and to cytoskeletal structures unique to Giardia: the ventral disk, and the dense rods of the anterior, posterior-lateral, and caudal flagella. During encystation, gPP2A-C protein disappears from only the anterior flagellar dense rods. During excystation, gPP2A-C localizes to the cyst wall in excysting cysts but is not found in the wall of cysts with emerging excyzoites. Transcriptome and immunoblot analyses indicated that gPP2A-C mRNA and protein are upregulated in mature cysts and during the early stage of excystation that models passage through the host stomach. Stable expression of gPP2A-C antisense RNA did not affect vegetative growth, but strongly inhibited the formation of encystation secretory vesicles (ESV) and water-resistant cysts. Moreover, the few cysts that formed were highly defective in excystation. Thus, gPP2A-C localizes to universal cytoskeletal structures and to structures unique to Giardia. It is also important for encystation and excystation, crucial giardial transformations that entail entry into and exit from dormancy.\nAuthor Posting. © The Authors, 2006.

Hypnozoites are dormant forms in the life cycles of certain parasitic protozoa that belong to the Phylum Apicomplexa (Sporozoa) and are best known for their probable association with latency and relapse in human malarial infections caused by Plasmodium ovale and P. vivax. Consequently, the hypnozoite is of great biological and medical significance. This, in turn, makes the origin of the name “hypnozoite” a subject of interest. Some “missing” history that is now placed on record (including a letter written by P. C. C. Garnham, FRS) shows that Miles B. Markus coined the term “hypnozoite”. While a PhD student at Imperial College London, he carried out research that led to the identification of an apparently dormant form of Cystoisospora (synonym: Isospora). In 1976, he speculated: “If sporozoites of Isospora can behave in this fashion, then those of related Sporozoa, like malaria parasites, may have the ability to survive in the tissues in a similar way.” He adopted the term “hypnozoite” for malaria in 1978 when he wrote in a little-known journal that this name would “… describe any dormant sporozoites or dormant, sporozoite-like stages in the life cycles of Plasmodium or other Haemosporina.” At that time, the existence of a hypnozoite form in the life cycle of Plasmodium was still a hypothetical notion. In 1980, however, Wojciech A. Krotoski published (together with several co-workers) details concerning his actual discovery of malarial hypnozoites, an event of considerable importance.\nKeywordshypnozoite Isospora malaria Plasmodium ovale Plasmodium vivax relapse\nUnable to display preview.

{"question":"What types of commercial projects do elementary students create using video and green screen technology?","answer":"Elementary students create various commercial projects using video and green screen technology, with complexity varying by grade level. Second graders work with existing products, while fourth graders invent their own. Students work in teams to create commercials for creative products like gloves that help climb walls, foldable grills for truck tailgating, and collars that translate dog speech. They write scripts and use green screen technology to bring their ideas to life, while sound effects, transitions, and titles are added to complete the productions.","context":["This summer the Education Division will coordinate a number of fun and interactive learning experiences to take place in the month of July.\nLights! Camera! Integrate! Impacting Students and Your Curriculum Through Video/Green Screen Project Based Learning\nFrom our Educator Guest Blogger Series\n“You've clearly stolen their hearts,” What a joy to read this recently from a teacher whose class I’ve been working with this year. In all fairness, here’s the rest of the sentence “as every group wants to do another green screen video”.\nSo maybe I haven’t stolen their hearts as much as green screening and video production has but I’ll take it! The excitement, enthusiasm, willingness to get to work writing scripts and drawing storyboards is especially moving coming from students who don’t often show such passion for learning. Their eagerness makes every bit of the work on my end worth it- times two!\nWhile collaboration with this teacher has gone on for years, this year’s class started with a project centered on inventors. Students, in groups, chose an inventor to research and then share with the class in an “inventive” way. While some students opted for reports and posters, after sharing previous examples with them, many decided to film and include some green screen elements in their final video project.\nFor these projects, storyboards and scripts were required for each production. I met with each group to rehearse and tweak their performances before filming, while their classroom teacher met with them to focus on their research and content. Together we discussed all the elements of “being on camera” and worked on expression, speaking clearly, mannerisms and even where to stand to make our project look more realistic.\nAt first, the students had a hard time visualizing the finished project. “I’m going to be standing in front of what?” “How is that lightbulb just going to appear?” But as we continued through the process they began to form mental images of the finished product. When it was all put together with sound effects, transitions, green screen images (such as Henry Ford’s model T car sales lot) the students were overjoyed and extremely proud of what they had created. Oh, and they just happened to learn A LOT about inventors.\nSo, ready to get started?\nHere are a few more ideas on video production and green screening in the elementary classroom.\nFirst graders chose a person in American History. Students researched in the library, read books and searched online resources about their person. They chose a moment in history they would like to highlight and I helped bring the projects to life by having the student “meet their person” through green screen production. The pictures included students marching with Dr. Martin Luther King, riding the bus with Rosa Parks, going to school with Ruby Bridges and standing tall with President Abraham Lincoln.\nThe pictures were displayed along with the students’ writing. The authors loved seeing people stop to read their work and admire their photo. Through the photos, students became witnesses to historical events.\nMany third graders around South Carolina make Antebellum dolls when learning about SC history. For this project, we decided to take the traditional doll creation a step further. Students chose from a variety of roles including being a slave, a sharecropper, a store owner or a plantation owner. Each student’s research included what they would have worn, where they would have lived and the work they would have done. Students then created their doll using a wide variety of makerspace materials, for example, markers, fabric, and yarn. After the dolls were created, students wrote a dialogue according to their characters’ experiences. The students learned how to take a picture of the doll on green paper and using green screen technology placed their doll into their environment using pictures from local historical places.\nAll the dolls were placed into a movie program and students narrated their doll’s life using the dialogue they had written. Over the years, instead of just having students narrate we began to use the Chatterpix app to create the impression that the doll was actually speaking to the audience. This was a great transition from 3rd person to 1 person narration! Students tried to imitate the way they thought their doll would speak. Yes, even in the south we had some really bad southern accents but once all the clips were put into one class project it became an authentic presentation of life in the south during the Antebellum time.\nThis project is done in various forms on multiple grade levels. Second graders may be asked to use an existing product while 4th graders invent their own. Students work in teams to create a commercial that will sell their product. Students have created commercials about gloves that help you climb walls, a grill that folds out from your truck for tailgating, a collar that translates your dog’s speech and many, many other creative products. We have witnessed some true inventors in the making! Once the product is created and scripts are written, video and green screen brings the ideas to life and demonstrates the students’ powers of persuasion. Once the students have created all of their content I work to add in sound effects, transitions, titles etc….A future goal is to have kids more involved in the editing process.\nIt is worth noting that all of these projects promote collaboration, digital citizenship, learning about sources for reliable information, the writing and editing process and storytelling. Each project can be differentiated to promote student learning and growth. Have students who love to draw? Have them draw their own backgrounds. Musically inclined students could create their own soundtrack. A student who doesn’t want to be on camera can help film, narrate or create storyboards.\nPutting students in the director’s chair facilitates authentic learning and promotes a transformation in students as their confidence grows in their content knowledge and as their production skills improve. Video creation increases student engagement and boosts achievement by focusing on the growth and learning that takes place during the process. Through speaking and listening opportunities students learn the necessary content and cross curricular learning is seamless.\n“Classroom video projects teach students to plan, organize, write, communicate, collaborate, and analyze. In fact, video has become so prolific that some colleges even include video submissions as part of their application process. As this media further matures, students may need to be able to express themselves as effectively through moving imagery as with the written word.” (edtechteacher)\n“Assigning students projects involving video production can lead to many positive academic outcomes, and today more opportunities exist for educators to incorporate such video-oriented projects into their classroom practice. Video-making technology is more affordable, more user-friendly, and more powerful than ever before”.

{"question":"How does UNESCO World Heritage status affect tourism destinations, and what role do government strategies play in managing sustainable tourism at these sites?","answer":"UNESCO World Heritage listings often lead to overtourism because the historical significance automatically attracts travelers, creating a paradoxical situation where environmental protection efforts result in damage through increased human activity. Despite initial management plans, there is insufficient funding and implementation to prevent overtourism at these sites. As for government strategies, while many have developed ecotourism or sustainable tourism plans, they often face challenges such as overly ambitious priorities, political interference, and insufficient attention to socio-cultural enrichment. However, successful responsible tourism strategies do exist, typically when incorporated into a government-wide vision of sustainable initiatives, which become fundamental assets in achieving holistic sustainable development.","context":["Photo Credit: Pixabay\nIn Paris, you’ll find a mass of queues to go up and down the Eiffel Tower; in London, don’t bother hitting up the London Eye unless you’ve booked; in New York, you’ll be barging people out the way to make it to the middle of Times Square. It’s no surprise that popular cities are a tourist’s haven, but places like Phuket and Venice which were once remote and rural have now become packed with picture-taking and souvenir selling just as bad. So, what is this “overtourism”, and how detrimental has our travelling become?\nYou may have heard the word flung about in news articles and it had a steep increase of interest on Google towards the end of 2017; “overtourism” refers to saturated areas of the world where the influx of tourist crowds has become so bad that they disturb the local community and environment.\nMany cities throughout 2018 have had to address the overcrowding with some form of limitation to the area. Take the romantic getaway of Venice for example, where the mayor called for segregation between locals and tourists on a weekend in May this year by redirecting sightseers form the popular streets and certain areas only available to residents. But this isn’t the first time Venice has had to make restrictions to tourists, when travellers were warned about “sitting fines” in September 2017 of a fine up to 500 euros.\nPhoto Credit: Shutterstock\nOne of the problems with the industry is the exotic, luxurious ideal sold to travellers. Maya Bay in Thailand – which was once featured as a paradise destination in 2000 film The Beach – was reaching visitors of up to 5000 a day back in June 2018 and saw a closure of four months to disperse the demand. Similarly, in the Philippines, the island of Boracay was reopened with strict limits on the tourism to regulate the excess population; restrictions were implemented such as no drinking and removal of casinos and beach vendors. Even all water sports were banned.\nNot just the utopian paradise attractions are in danger of overtourism, the cultural and historical landmarks of cities bring in an excessive interest too. UNESCO World Heritage listings are often a child of overtourism because the historical connotations of the name automatically attract travellers – creating a catch 22 situation where environmental protection by UNESCO creates a consequential damage through human curiosity. Although managed and planned before being listed, there is a lack of funding and implementation to ensure that overtourism isn’t a consequence of this title.\nBut can this problem be solved? If we filter tourism out to more remote places, surely this is just going to fill up the smaller, less-known adventures and make them just as full. Even if this overtourism averts travellers to far-flung escapes, many places which are unexplored can be dangerous. The city of Kyoto in Japan has been trying to ease off peak times from travellers who are putting themselves in danger with treacherous hikes and treks to get that perfect selfie.\nPhoto Credit: Shutterstock\nThere is one answer to this. Responsible tourism. A very simple answer to a big problem in the travel industry. To be able to responsibly travel is for us visitors to consider what the wider impacts are, and whether it can be made positive. Moving away from the typical landmarks and exploring cultures in different areas allows tourism to become more sustainable. With the uprise of ‘ecotourism’ and sustainable travel, it has become more accessible to travel without leaving a big mark.\nSo next time you’re searching out the best hotspots on the next destination on your bucket list, crowded tourists and unsustainable impacts might not be so hot after all.","In sports, you're only as strong as your weakest player. Similarly, when it comes to ecotourism, a destination is only as sustainable as its least eco-friendly attraction. The attractions, accommodation, services, and infrastructure are all integral components to the overall sustainability of a destination, therefore the eco-success of a destination depends on the sustainability of its parts. For those conscious travelers seeking an holistic experience of sustainability, there are a few key elements to be considered when evaluating the overall sustainability and ecotourism potential of a destination.\nAccording to the definition and principles of ecotourism established by The International Ecotourism Society (TIES) in 1990, ecotourism definition is \"Responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the well-being of local people.\"\nAs such, when considering how to conduct sustainable development and participate in ecotourism, it is crucial to consider all aspects of this definition: economic, social, and environmental impacts. Following this, these are some ways to consider the elements of ecotourism on your next adventure.\nA destination's care and concern for the protection of its natural environment is integral to the destination's sustainable and ecotourims practices success. Often considered a cornerstone of sustainability, along with socio-cultural and economic factors, the environment is so easily impacted by human activity, especially due to high levels of tourist behavior. Environmental concerns will be touched upon in most of the following sub-headings, and it is important to understand that a destination's sustainability can be defined by its commitment to environmental protection. The environment, however, is not the only mark of a sustainable and ecotourism destination, as will be discussed further below.\nLocal vs. Foreign Ownership\nForeign capital investment is, often times, an integral component of development when it comes to the tourism industry, as are foreign business consultants. However, foreign ownership of properties, attractions, transportation, and services can be one of the most detrimental forces working against local communities seeking to benefit from tourism. Often times foreign ownership causes economic leakage, which is when profits 'leak' out of the destination and back to the country of ownership. This typically happens with resort properties and chain hotels, common destinations for tourists, so it is important for ecotourism travelers to understand the full impacts of their spending. Not only do profits from the rooms go to benefit foreign entities, it is also very common for hotel accessories, amenities, food, and other products to be imported into the destination from the source country, meaning local farmers and producers have no opportunity to provide their produce to hotels. This barrier between the locals and tourism industry is unfair and unsustainable, since it does not allow the local population to profit and benefit from a consumptive industry operating in their backyard. When the local population is involved in the process, they are able to contribute to a ecotourism industry that is positively facilitating opportunities for local development through responsible tourism.\nLocal Communities and Tourism Development\nThe cornerstone of sustainable tourism is that it is able to enrich a promising future, economically, environmentally, and socially, for the local community. Often times we focus on environmental impacts, and economic forces, and forget that the social concerns are just as important.\nWe’ve talked about buying local, but it goes further than that. Not only is it important to support the local economies, it is important to enrich local societies by involving the communities in the tourism industry.\nIt is also vital to understand the detrimental impact tourism can have on communities. There are a number of different ways tourism can actually cause human-rights violations in destinations, and in some cases, locals can be exploited for the benefit of tourists. This exploitation commonly occurs through the exploitation of women and children, as well as cultural conflicts and poor working conditions in the tourism industry.\nHowever, in the face of enormous challenges and depravity, there are bright lights in the future of local communities and tourism. There are community-based initiatives around the world that seek to enrich the lives of locals and tourists alike by promoting local accommodation and tour ownership and positive tourist behaviours. Many communities are benefitting from these types of efforts, and provided education, awareness, and initiatives continue, more local communities will be able to successfully implement community-based tourism.\nIt is so critical to understand the role local communities play in tourism development, in that it must be of a sustainable nature for the community to truly benefit. Employing initiatives that are run and managed by locals, using local man-power, material, and resources is crucial, otherwise tourism has the potential to ravage, exploit, and destroy a community’s resources, people, and dignity.\nGovernment-Initiated Responsible Tourism and Ecotourism Strategy\nIn recent years, many governments have developed ecotourism or sustainable tourism strategies. While many ecotourism strategies are well crafted and use a balanced approach of focusing on appropriate areas, many responsible tourism strategies contain problems that are seen throughout the world.\nWhile oftentimes the overall intention of the strategy is well meaning, many responsible tourism strategies possess glaring faults, predominately in the form of excessively ambitious lists of priorities, political interference, economic misguidance, and lack of attention to socio-cultural enrichment. Often ecotourism strategies lack focus, and fail to address the cornerstones of sustainable tourism development - environment, socio-cultural, and economic. The fourth cornerstone, politics, when not promoting sustainability, has the nasty habit of getting in the way of it. Can't help itself.\nThere are, however, some very successful responsible tourism strategies. These typically incorporate the strategy into a government-wide vision of responsible and sustainable initiatives, and these strategies are fundamental assets in achieving holistic sustainable development.\nEcotourism Practices for accommodation\nAs mentioned earlier, hotels possibly have the most negative impact on the sustainability of destinations, and they really needn't. Hotels can be guilty of any number of offenses, including foreign ownership and thus economic leakage through imports, exclusion of the local population, exploitation of the local population through poor working conditions, strain on the environment due to water consumption, disregard for building codes with structural and environmental ramifications, and segregation of tourists and locals. Bad nuts, eh? Many tourists (and this is perhaps where we see the greatest distinction between 'travelers' and tourists') are completely or partially unaware of these issues, and unfortunately, quite a few don't particularly care and choose to be blissfully ignorant.\nHowever, if you're a keen traveler with an interest in sleeping ethically in an ecotourism destination, there are accommodations throughout the world that focus on low or zero emissions, and keep a close eye on their carbon footprint. There are green-focused hostels, eco-lodges, boutique hotels, and luxury ecotourism accommodations around the world that are committed to sustainable tourism and achieving zero carbon emissions. A word to the wise, though - some hotel groups that are focused on zero emissions and low carbon footprints may not have local ownership (or opportunities for locals to profit and benefit from the industry), so be wary of the terminology used. Usually your best option is a certified eco-lodge, but if there isn’t one in your destination, use your knowledge and discretion to make the best decision.\nYou can also impact how sustainable your accommodation experience is by following ecotourism guidelines about water-saving efforts such as re-using your towels, saving water while brushing your teeth, and showering efficiently. Also remembering to turn off your lights, TV, and air conditioning when not using the room can help reduce your impact, so even if you aren't able to find an eco-lodge or certified green room to sleep in, you can still make personal adjustments to yield a more sustainable experience.\nEcotourism Attraction Policies and Procedures\nOkay, so you've found your eco-lodge (or at least left your hotel room with the lights off), and you want to go exploring. How do you know that your attractions are following the right ecotourism policies and procedures when it comes to sustainability? As previously discussed, if a destination is to achieve holistic sustainability, its attractions, as well as its other tourism components, need to be green. For instance, snorkeling or scuba diving outfitters should ensure they're operating responsibly with regards to number of tour participants, rules and regulations for participants under water, etc. Ecotourism hiking trails should ideally have guide pamphlets available and information on where and how to dispose of trash.\nSome ecotourism destinations around the world have the right attitude towards greening their tourism and local attractions. They often provide visitors with comprehensive guides to sustainable attractions and ecotourism in their region, and typically point visitors towards attractions that are committed to environmental awareness, or ones that are car-free. Many of these destinations have some type of green business scheme, which usually acts as encouragement for tourism businesses to carry sustainable attitudes and ecotourism initiatives into the future. While these programs are met with mixed levels of success, this is the type of thing that contributes to the overall sustainability of a destination.\nTransportation in ecotourism\nTransportation can be really difficult in-destination, especially if the necessary infrastructure doesn't exist (it usually doesn't). Obviously the easiest way to compensate for your ecotourism transportation to the destination would be to off-set your air travel, (less expensive than you think), or to consider carbon-neutral methods of transportation, like walking, using eco-friendly cabs, public transit, or some trains.\nOnce you're in the destination, the challenge begins. In developing nations, traveling by car can appear to be ridiculously bad for the environment, since almost all of their aging car models spew out the worst-looking emissions that simply wouldn't pass in developed nations with emission testing programs. Same thing could be said with boats and trains, to a certain extent. However, some developing nations that traditionally rely on bicycles and other man-powered forms of transportation are beginning to excel at eco-friendly transportation development in other areas of their infrastructure. With green buses on the roads as well as bicycle taxis, some developing nations are quite advanced in terms of greening their transportation and imporve their ecotourism initiatives.\nHowever, using transportation in a sustainable manner does not always have to focus on the environment, although it usually does, it can also include using local companies for hired drivers, boat tours, canoe/kayak rentals, or similar. So long as you ensure your safety is not compromised, having these options at hand can help make a destination more sustainable, and help you better engage in responsible tourism.\nMaking Ecotourim Decisions\nThe paradigm of a wholly sustainable and ecotourism destination is the presence of all of these elements, however a good balance of the elements still indicates a destination and development entities that are focused on holistic and long-term sustainability. It is unlikely that the paradigm often exists, but many destinations are focused on making changes and progressing towards sustainable development, so it's not all doom and gloom.\nIf sustainable travel is truly important to you and your fellow travelers, take the time to research your destination before you start planning. There are a number of comprehensive ecotourism websites, like MyNatour, that are dedicated to eco-friendly and sustainable tourism, as well as advice on making ethical travel decisions.\nOther ecotourism tips\nAnother way to improve the sustainability of the ecotourims industry is to make every effort to 'buy local' while away. From the obvious don't-eat-at-McDonald's (but really, why would you?) to visiting farmers markets for a fruit snack or seeking out local tour operators for your kayak trip, there are ways you can ensure the currency you spend stays in-destination. Think about it - there's a chance that the less demand tourists place on foreign imports, the less goods will be imported.\nThe most sustainable travelers tend to be the most proactive and knowledgeable travelers. There's no shortage of information or ways to make your traveling more sustainable or ethical, and it is absolutely all of our responsibilities, as global citizens and wanderers, to ensure that we understand how to evaluate the sustainability of our destinations, and what we can do to travel responsibly and ethically with the information and resources we have."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0e32f915-afcc-4b01-90be-d5b2ec97b540>","<urn:uuid:1bd7dab1-7f47-433e-bb9e-1126e71f3d48>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the immediate symptoms of nerve damage after a dental procedure, and how long can the recovery process take?","answer":"Immediate symptoms of nerve damage after dental procedures can include numbness or tingling sensations in the affected area, loss of taste, difficulty speaking or swallowing, and persistent pain or discomfort. Some patients may also experience muscle weakness or paralysis in the affected area. Regarding recovery, nerve damage can be either temporary or permanent. Temporary nerve damage typically resolves on its own within a few weeks or months. However, if severe pain occurs or discomfort worsens, patients should see their dentist. After root canal treatment specifically, some slight tenderness around the treated tooth is normal but usually lasts only a short time, and any swelling or bruising should improve within two weeks of treatment.","context":["Your dentist may suggest root canal treatment if there is inflammation or infection inside one of your teeth. They will clean and fill inside the tooth to prevent further damage or infection. Root canal treatment can save your tooth from having to be taken out.\nWhat is a root canal?\nYour teeth have ‘roots’ that anchor them into your jawbone. Inside each of your teeth there is a mixture of blood vessels and nerves called pulp. Pulp sits inside a space called the pulp chamber and this extends down into the roots of the tooth. The pulp chamber within the root is called the root canal.\nWhy might I need root canal treatment?\nIf your tooth is damaged, bacteria can get inside it. This causes irritation, pain and swelling. If the pulp inside the tooth becomes infected, this can spread into the pulp inside the root canal. The aim of root canal treatment is to prevent your tooth from being taken out by removing the damaged pulp and treating the infection.\nYou may need root canal treatment for a number of reasons, including:\n⦁ Severe tooth decay\n⦁ Repeated dental treatment on the tooth\n⦁ A cracked tooth\n⦁ A broken crown\n⦁ Cracked or loose fillings and Gum disease\n⦁ An injury, such as a blow to your mouth\nIf an infection isn’t treated, it can spread further and cause an abscess, which is a collection of pus. This can be painful, tender and can cause swelling around your tooth and jaw.\nSometimes your tooth may look darker in colour than your other teeth, which means that the nerve inside your tooth is dead or dying. Without treatment, the infection may spread further into your jawbone and you may need to have your tooth removed.\nIf you’re experiencing toothache or would like to find out more information about root canal treatment, contact your dentist. We have over 350 dental practices around the UK, find your local Bupa Dental Care dentist here; we’d be happy to hear from you.\nPreparing for root canal treatment\nRoot canal treatment is done by a dentist. But if your tooth is difficult to treat, your dentist may refer you to an endodontist. This is a dentist who specialises in root canal treatment.\nYour dentist will examine you and ask about your symptoms, including any pain you’re having. They may also ask you about your medical history and any previous treatment you’ve had on your teeth. Your dentist will take an X-ray of your tooth. This can help to show which tooth is causing your pain and needs treatment, and how far any infection has spread. These examinations are necessary for your dentist to make sure that the tooth is not too badly damaged for root canal treatment.\nAlthough some root canal treatments can be completed within one appointment, most are done over two or more sessions with your dentist. Root canal treatment is usually done under local anaesthetic. This completely blocks pain from your tooth and jaw area, and you will stay awake during the procedure.\nWhat are the alternatives to root canal treatment?\nSometimes, damaged teeth can’t be repaired with root canal treatment. This is usually if your tooth is badly damaged or if you have severe gum disease which prevents your tooth from healing or being well supported after treatment. If this happens, your dentist may suggest you have the tooth removed (extracted).\nFind your local Bupa Dental Care practice\nWhat happens during root canal treatment?\nOnce the area is numb, your dentist will place a thin rubber sheet inside your mouth. This is called a dental dam and covers everything except the tooth being worked on. It helps to keep the area around the tooth clean and stop the spread of any infection.\nUsing a drill, your dentist will make a hole in the top of your tooth and remove the pulp. They will clean out the empty hole using small instruments and a liquid to irrigate and disinfect the inside of the tooth. The instruments help to make the canals a more regular shape to enable the tooth to be filled and cleaned more precisely. The irrigating liquid makes sure that all infected material is flushed out.\nOnce the tooth is clean, your dentist will fill and seal it. Unless the dentist is sure that all infection has been removed, they will put in a temporary filling. You then have a second appointment to have the tooth permanently filled.\nIf your tooth is badly worn or is at risk of further damage, your dentist may suggest having a crown fitted. This is an artificial cap that fits over your tooth. You’re more likely to need a crown if you’re having one of your back teeth treated, because these are used for chewing.\nHaving root canal treatment can be uncomfortable because you have to sit still with your mouth open for longer than you’re used to. Your dentist will make you as comfortable as possible before the procedure starts.\nWhat to expect afterwards\nAfter a local anaesthetic, it may take several hours before the feeling comes back into your jaw and face. Take special care not to bump or knock the area. You may need pain relief to help with any discomfort after the anaesthetic wears off and for the next couple of days. You can take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. Always read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine and if you have any questions, ask your pharmacist for advice.\nFind your local Bupa Dental Care practice\nRecovering from root canal treatment\nWhen you next need to see your dentist will depend on the reasons for your treatment and how the procedure went. Your dentist may ask you to have further X-rays and check-ups to make sure that the tooth is secure and you’re healing well.\nSome people need to have further root canal treatment if the tooth cracks or more decay develops.\nAfter your treatment, it’s important to take care of your repaired tooth. These tips will help to keep your mouth, teeth and gums healthy:\n⦁ Brush your teeth twice a day using a fluoride toothpaste\n⦁ Rinse your mouth with a mouthwash, if your dentist recommends it\n⦁ Clean in between your teeth every day, either using floss or inter-dental brushes\n⦁ Don’t smoke\n⦁ Try to limit sugary foods and drinks and only have them at mealtimes\n⦁ See your dentist regularly for check-ups\nSide-effects of root canal treatment\nYou may have some slight tenderness around the tooth that has been treated, but usually this lasts for only a short time. If you have severe pain or any pain or discomfort that gets worse, see your dentist. The area around your tooth may also be swollen and bruised. This should get better within two weeks of your treatment.\nComplications of root canal treatment\nComplications are when problems occur during or after treatment. All medical and dental procedures come with some risk. But how these risks apply to you will be different from how they apply to others. Be sure to ask for more information if you have any concerns.\nMost root canal treatment is successful, but sometimes further problems can occur. Possible complications include:\n⦁ Damage to the root canal or the tissue surrounding the tooth\n⦁ Damage to the nerves around the tooth\nIf your root canal treatment doesn’t work, you may be advised to have more treatment. This is called re-treatment. You might also need re-treatment if your symptoms return years after you’ve had root canal.","Potential Causes of Nerve Damage During Dental Procedures\nThere are several potential causes of nerve damage during dental procedures. One common cause is the improper administration of local anesthesia. If the dentist injects the anesthesia too close to a nerve or applies too much pressure, it can result in nerve damage. Another cause is excessive force during dental treatments, such as when extracting a tooth or performing a root canal. This can put pressure on the surrounding nerves and lead to damage.\nIn some cases, nerve damage may also occur due to surgical errors during procedures such as dental implant placement or jaw surgery. If the dentist makes an incision in the wrong area or damages a nerve during the surgery, it can result in long-term nerve damage.\nPotential causes of nerve damage during dental procedures:\n- Improper administration of local anesthesia\n- Excessive force during dental treatments\n- Surgical errors during procedures\nImproper administration of local anesthesia:\nThis occurs when the dentist injects the anesthesia too close to a nerve or applies too much pressure, resulting in nerve damage.\nExcessive force during dental treatments:\nIf excessive force is applied during procedures such as tooth extraction or root canal treatment, it can put pressure on surrounding nerves and lead to damage.\nSurgical errors during procedures:\nMistakes made during surgical procedures like dental implant placement or jaw surgery can result in incisions made in the wrong area or nerves being damaged, leading to long-term nerve damage.\nHow Common is Nerve Damage as a Result of Dental Treatments?\nNerve damage as a result of dental treatments is relatively rare, but it can occur in certain situations. The most common cause of nerve damage during dental procedures is the accidental injury to the inferior alveolar nerve or lingual nerve, which are responsible for sensation in the lower jaw and tongue respectively. This can happen during procedures such as tooth extractions, dental implants, or root canal treatments.\nWhile the overall incidence rate of nerve damage from dental procedures is low, it is important to note that certain factors can increase the risk. These include complex or invasive procedures, anatomical variations in nerve positioning, inexperienced dentists, and pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or compromised immune systems. It is crucial for dentists to be aware of these risks and take appropriate precautions to minimize the chances of nerve damage.\nSymptoms and Signs of Nerve Damage After a Dental Procedure\nRecognizing the symptoms and signs of nerve damage after a dental procedure is essential for early detection and prompt treatment. Common symptoms include numbness or tingling sensations in the affected area, loss of taste or altered taste perception, difficulty speaking or swallowing, and persistent pain or discomfort.\nIn some cases, patients may also experience muscle weakness or paralysis in the affected area. It is important to note that these symptoms may not appear immediately after the dental procedure but can develop over time. If any of these signs are present following a dental treatment, it is crucial to consult with a dentist or oral surgeon promptly for further evaluation and appropriate management.\nPreventive Measures Dentists Can Take to Minimize the Risk of Nerve Damage\nDentists have several preventive measures at their disposal to minimize the risk of nerve damage during dental treatments. Firstly, a thorough pre-operative assessment should be conducted to identify any anatomical variations or potential risk factors for nerve injury. This may involve the use of advanced imaging techniques such as cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) to visualize the nerves and surrounding structures.\nDuring the procedure, dentists should exercise caution and precision, especially when performing invasive or complex treatments near nerve-rich areas. The use of magnification tools, such as dental loupes or surgical microscopes, can enhance visibility and aid in avoiding accidental nerve injury. Additionally, continuous communication with the patient during the procedure can help identify any discomfort or unusual sensations that may indicate potential nerve damage.\nFurthermore, dentists should stay updated with the latest advancements in dental technology and techniques that aim to minimize the risk of nerve damage. By adhering to these preventive measures and maintaining a high standard of care, dentists can significantly reduce the occurrence of nerve damage during dental procedures.\nTemporary or Permanent: Nerve Damage from Dental Procedures\nNerve damage can occur during dental procedures, leading to temporary or permanent complications. Temporary nerve damage may cause numbness or tingling sensations in the affected area, which usually resolve on their own within a few weeks or months. However, in some cases, nerve damage can be permanent, resulting in chronic pain, loss of sensation, or difficulty performing everyday tasks such as eating or speaking.\nIt is important to consult with a medical professional if you experience any symptoms of nerve damage after a dental procedure. They can assess the extent of the damage and provide appropriate treatment options. In some cases, additional procedures may be necessary to repair the damaged nerves and alleviate symptoms.\nLegal Grounds for Suing a Dentist in Cases of Nerve Damage\nIf you have suffered nerve damage as a result of a dental procedure, you may have legal grounds to sue your dentist for negligence. To establish a successful lawsuit, you must prove that the dentist breached their duty of care towards you and that this breach directly caused your nerve damage. This requires demonstrating that the dentist failed to meet the standard of care expected within the dental profession.\nAn experienced personal injury attorney specializing in dental malpractice can help gather evidence such as expert testimonies and medical records to support your case. They will also guide you through the legal process and ensure your rights are protected throughout.\nProving Responsibility: Did Your Dentist Cause Nerve Damage?\nTo prove that your dentist caused your nerve damage, several factors need to be considered. First, it must be established that there was a doctor-patient relationship between you and the dentist at the time of the procedure. Second, it needs to be shown that the dentist acted negligently by deviating from accepted standards of care.\nMedical Records and Expert Testimonies\nObtaining your dental records is crucial in proving negligence. These records may contain important information about the procedure, any complications that occurred, and the steps taken by the dentist. Expert testimonies from other dental professionals can also provide valuable insights into whether the dentist’s actions were negligent.\nCausation and Damages\nFurthermore, it is necessary to establish a direct link between the dentist’s negligence and your nerve damage. This requires demonstrating that the nerve damage would not have occurred if proper care had been provided. Finally, you must provide evidence of the damages you have suffered as a result of the nerve damage, such as medical bills, lost wages, or pain and suffering.\nTime Limitations for Filing a Lawsuit Against a Dentist for Nerve Damage\nIt is important to be aware of the time limitations for filing a lawsuit against a dentist for nerve damage. These limitations vary depending on your jurisdiction and are typically outlined in state laws known as statutes of limitations. Failing to file within these timeframes may result in your case being dismissed.\nTo ensure you meet all deadlines, it is advisable to consult with an attorney specializing in dental malpractice as soon as possible after discovering your nerve damage. They will guide you through the legal process and ensure all necessary paperwork is filed within the appropriate timeframe.\nCompensation Sought in Lawsuits for Dental-Related Nerve Damage\nIn lawsuits for dental-related nerve damage, various types of compensation can be sought depending on the specific circumstances of each case. These may include:\n- Medical expenses: Reimbursement for past and future medical costs related to treating the nerve damage.\n- Lost wages: Compensation for income lost due to the inability to work during recovery or ongoing treatment.\n- Pain and suffering: Damages awarded for physical pain, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life caused by the nerve damage.\n- Disability or disfigurement: Additional compensation may be sought if the nerve damage results in permanent disability or disfigurement.\nAn experienced attorney will assess your case and determine the appropriate types of compensation to seek based on your specific circumstances.\nAlternative Dispute Resolution Methods Before Pursuing a Lawsuit Against a Dentist\nPrior to pursuing a lawsuit against a dentist for nerve damage, alternative dispute resolution methods can be explored. These methods aim to resolve conflicts outside of court and can potentially save time and money. Two common alternative dispute resolution methods are mediation and arbitration.\nIn mediation, a neutral third party known as a mediator facilitates discussions between you and the dentist with the goal of reaching a mutually acceptable settlement. The mediator does not make decisions but helps facilitate communication and negotiation between both parties.\nIn arbitration, an arbitrator is appointed to hear both sides of the case and make a binding decision. This process is similar to a trial but is typically less formal and more streamlined. The arbitrator’s decision is final, meaning it cannot be appealed in court.\nBefore considering alternative dispute resolution methods, it is advisable to consult with an attorney who can provide guidance on which approach may be most suitable for your specific situation.\nIn conclusion, it is possible to sue a dentist for nerve damage depending on the circumstances and evidence of negligence.\nCan nerve damage from dental work be repaired?\nInjuries to nerves during routine dental and oral surgery procedures are uncommon but can be treated effectively with proper management. It is important to conduct a thorough examination in a timely manner to increase the likelihood of successful surgical repair.\nWhat is the average settlement for nerve damage?\nThe settlement amount for nerve damage claims can vary depending on the severity of your injuries, how they affect your daily life, and the financial losses you incur as a result. Generally, settlements for nerve damage claims fall within the range of $15,000 to $100,000, although your specific claim could be lower or higher than these figures.\nHow common is nerve damage in dentistry?\nIt is common for branches of the trigeminal nerve to be damaged during maxillofacial surgery and dental procedures. However, in most cases, the symptoms are temporary and patients typically regain sensation over time.\nIs it hard to prove nerve damage?\nDiagnosing nerve conditions can be challenging, and many patients suffer for years without understanding or finding effective relief from their muscle weakness or pain. Our specialists recognize that the underlying cause of a nerve condition is not always apparent and may require thorough investigation to uncover.\nCan a doctor prove nerve damage?\nA skin biopsy is a medical test that can assist doctors in determining if there is nerve damage that is causing a loss of sensation.\nWhat happens if dentist hits a nerve?\nIndications of Nerve Injury If you have experienced nerve damage after a dental treatment, you may encounter the following symptoms: loss of sensation or numbness in the gums, cheeks, jaw, face, or tongue; a tingling or pulling sensation in these regions."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c3ddf997-337e-4344-b05f-f94c78524ad5>","<urn:uuid:08a96bbd-e8b6-455e-a839-62f87a0a0c88>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm interested in understanding different rapids levels. How does class III rapids on the Black River compare to class III in the general difficulty classification system?","answer":"On the Black River, class III rapids involve tight drops and creeky sections that can become class IV with extra water. In the general classification system, class III (Intermediate) rapids are characterized by moderate, irregular waves that may be difficult to avoid and powerful currents, particularly in large-volume rivers. The Black River's class III rating seems consistent with this classification, featuring technical sections through small gorges and requiring careful navigation around obstacles.","context":["This section of the Lamington River is known as the Black River. I'm not just making this up, you will see the name used in businesses in the area (Black River Coffee Co.) and on signs in Hacklebarney St. Pk. It is a very pretty run. It is also very small and creeky and can be a long day if you do the whole thing from Coopers Mill to Pottersville.\nGenerally it's a III, but with a little bit of extra water some of the tighter drops could easily be called a solid IV. This creek also picks up a lot of wood at times which can add to the difficulty.The run has two small gorges. The first is upstream of Hacklebarney, the second is just above Pottersville and is very narrow (it starts just below a small summer home on river right). The second has only two rapids, but the first is quite tight and would be a solid IV+ with 3' on the gauge.\nFirst Descent Alert!! As far as I know, Trout Brook and Rinehart Br. haven't been run!\nA 2 foot ledge which drops from river right to river left. It comes up a short distance below a hikers' foot bridge and signals the beginning of the whitewater.\nOther than the dam (Kay Falls), this is the highest individual drop on the run. It's a straight forward slide/falls into a pool. The pool below is the beginning of the pond (from the Kay falls dam) and it collects wood at times. Scout.\nThis is an old stone dam. At the right water level you can run it in the center. Scout on the left.\nJust after the ripples below Kay Falls Dam, you get to the top of Eddy Hop. Scouting may be a little easier on the left, but either is possible. Because the pond above catches much of the lumber, this usually isn't as strainer laden, but still, scout.\nAfter a messy little rock pile ledge, the creek goes around a large rock (10' high?). The creek goes left around the rock. The photo shows the smaller ledge which precedes Big Rock in the distance. The big rock is just left of the photo.\nThere used to be a dam below Big Rock and above the bridge. consequently, the banks are steep dirt (sediment), and there is a rocky rapid/riffle just upstream of the bridge. This is also a location which has picked up wood at times.\nShortly after the bridge, the creek drops over a small (3') ledge into a pool. The ledge is at a constriction of the creek with a boulder on river right and the river bank on river left. The pool is man made ( it was originally for swimming) and has a short (3' ?) dam at the end of it. This is all well and good, except that there is a hole in the bottom of the dam. If it's clear (sometimes it's blocked) and water is draining through it, it's about the right size for the first half of a swimmer to go through and then get stuck. Try not to swim here.\nThis rapid is named for the picnic table on river right. When the river disappears to the right behind a big rock, get out on the right to scout.\nThis side of the island is a little steeper and very tight (line your paddle up with your boat) currently it has a log jam in it. Scout from the island or the top of the big rock (if you can safely get onto it). If those options aren't possible, scout from left bank.\nThis side isn't as tight or steep, but currently it's the slot of choice as it's clear of wood. (it has been choked with wood at times in the past). Scout from the island, or river left.\nYou'll know when this is coming up as you'll see a small red house perched above the creek on river right. Take out on river left to scout. This Rapid is actually pretty cool, but there's a nasty looking pointy rock on the left in the finish drop, hence the name. You won't see the rock very well unless the water is fairly low (like in the photo). Luckily, the rock is only in play in the bottom of the runnable range (2.3-2.5' or so) and even then it flushes you past it/around it pretty smoothly.\nThis drop is followed by a tight bend where the river drops a few more feet.\nThis is a nice finale to this pretty little run. After you run (or carry) Nasty, the river turns left away from the road, then right, then left again (parallel to the road). Get out on the left to scout. Finale is a simple drop, but the two rocks on either side make the hole hard to get out of at certain levels.\nI ran this last week at 200 cfs or about 2.5 ft high on the fall and it seemed optimal for sneaking under many logs as well as humping over others. All the drops were open except for the 1st big drop. It was a hairy deal but I put in a complete run. Looking over the comments nobody has given this run any tlc with a saw for some time.\nI scouted Trout Brook and Reinhart Brook during the spring floods. They were both running when the Black was at 1,750 cfs. Trout Brook is basically a death trap at that level, but Reinhart Brook was a sweet class III-IV. Good luck catching these runs though. Black river road was flooded out and impassable to give you an idea of the level.\nAwesome reach. Thanks to Stephen Strange for posting the details. Nick P. Noah S. and Brian H and I put in at the fishermans access just below the pond. The level was around 260 cfs and we were more than pleased, maybe even a bit lower would have been nicer for our first time on the reach. The small dam outlet to the pond looked sketchy, maybe some debris or metal so we skipped it and went on. Every drop on the Black was run! Unfortunately the pool below six foot falls had two large trees which made for awfully nasty swim when it was run by an unnamed member of our party who had just gotten back from the Big Sandy. Please use extreme caution running six foot falls, if you swim the hole will eject you into the trees leading to an underwater body pin forcing the swimmer to climb his way to the surface through underwater branches (super ugly). The Kay falls were runnable center left, nasty rapid was bad ass and finale falls was clean and sweet. Again, awesome reach and as of 4/8/2007 everything was runnable except six foot falls, and of course there were around 10 portages in the boogie water because of strainers.\nOne of the local landowners strung what appear to be dear attractants across the river downstream of the State Park, I guess to prevent the deer from destroying the spackel buckets its in. I don't know, but either way exercise caution in the boogie water after the park.\nI ran this with my Brother Thanksgiving morning. We grew up hiking in Hacklebarney so it was great to paddle it. We put in at the fishermens pond and had 6-7 riverwide strainers before we got to the Park. Both big drops at the top are unrunnable....which was disapointing. At least Nasty Rapid was clear (except for wood on river left at the top...easily avoidable). This run needs some TLC. It could be a blast at high water.\nNo way i had no idea that this was a runable whitewater creek! i pass it every sunday on my way to my lax games.\nI scouted this creek yesterday and on the secound half, past Hacklebarney park, along side Black River Road, just a few yards before the gauging station (which is on river right, a few feet from black river road)there is a rope or wire going completly across the river with a NO TRESSPASSING sign on it.Physically, even at high water, Idought it would be a problem but perhaps someone dosn't think you belong there? Also anyone this river for the first time you would want to get out a little after that gauging station once you see house on river right because there is a falls,make sure you scout this. I got heart but I wouldn't do it, not yet that is.I would venture to say you realy need to know what you are doing to make it down safly. I plan on taking out before the falls.\nUnless it has been replaced in the last few months (I'll go check on it soon), the sign above the gauging station is the same one which has been there for years. It's indicated on my guide map, but isn't in-play and can be ducked under unless the water is extremely high. (If it was low enough to decapitate people, it would have disappeared years ago, thanks to my hacksaw) As for the \"falls\" after the house on river right, unless there's been some major geologic activity that I'm unaware of, this rapid consists of a 2-3'ledge with a small eddy below it on the left, followed by a 4'ledge, immediately followed by a slide to the left which drops about another 3-4', which pools/pillows back to the right (now downstream) and drops another 3-4' feet or so. I refer to this rapid as \"Nasty Rapid\" on my map because of the upleasant looking rock at the finish in low water. It is best to scout it from river left. I have run every inch of this run a number of times and though I wish there was a 20ft falls, I haven't found it yet.\n1 year ago\nby Stephen Strange\nThe onsite gauge is the staff gauge of the USGS gauging station (on Black River Rd.). It is on river right, at the crest of the gauging station weir. You may have to bush wack through about 5' of brush to get a look at it.\nEd Gertler's book lists 2.3' (on the gauge on Black River Rd. upstream from Pottersville) as minimum. I've run it at that level and I would list 2.4' (160 cfs - ed.) as minimum, with 2.5-3.0' (200-400) as optimal and over 3' very exciting.\nI ran it at 3.3' (800cfs?) and the constricted mini-gorge at the end was \"interesting\". Scout on the left.\nThe primary gauge: the LAMINGTON (BLACK) RIVER NEAR POTTERSVILLE NJ should be over 2.4'. If it is over 3' then you're in for treat.\nSecondary Gauge: South Br. Raritan River at High Bridge (USGS # 01396500) should be at 7.6'/460cfs.\nPermits are not required for this reach.\nThere are three put-in options: If you want to run the whole thing, put in either at the Cooper Grist Mill on Rt. 24, or at the fishing access to the pond on State Park Rd.(as shown on the map). If you only want to run the second half, you can put in where Hacklebarney Rd. crosses the river.\nThe first half is more bang for your buck if you don't have a whole day.\nyou can scout in Hacklebarney St. Pk. and the rangers have told me that you can paddle through with no problems, but don't try to put-in inside of Hacklebarney!\nThere is a lot of private land around here and lots of fisherman in the spring (especially the first few weeks in April) So, as is generally the rule, try to access where the road is very close to the creek (a few feet) or where a bridge crosses.\nBig Rock Rapid\nHigh Water in NJ\nthe real nasty rapid, sorry\nthe slot, left of island\nthe slot (slot machine?)\nHigh Water on the Black R. in NJ\nRain Gauge for the Black R.\nSix-Foot Falls on the Lamington\n11X17 Map of the Black (Lamington) River\nThere are drops too\nAnother Rapid on the Black\nIf someone gets hurt on a river, or you read about a whitewater-related injury, please report it to\nAmerican Whitewater.

It is, therefore, important to measure the rate of their difficulty. The international scale of river difficulty is a rating system which is designed to provide a benchmark for river users. The scale was created by America Whitewater Association to evaluate the rivers throughout the world. The scale should not be confused with the whitewater scale which is used by the Committee of International Canoe Federation. The grades on the International Scale of River Difficulty reflect the technical difficulty and the skill required to navigate a section of a river. The scale is important for various water sports and activities including rafting, canoeing, surfing, and water kayaking. The scales are used in most parts of the world, especially in countries with major rivers or rivers with the main activities such as sports, fishing, and transport. The rivers are grouped into six categories often called a Grade or Class followed by a number. The scales are neither fixed nor are they linear since there could be difficult grade twos and easy grade threes. The grades may change from time to time depending on the level of flow of the river. The rapids are given numerical grades and a plus or minus to indicate the difficulty level as either on the higher or lower end. Sections of the river may also be given an overall rating but may have sections above or below that grade always noted as features.\n6. Class I Easy -\nThis category of Class I easy is characterized by fast flowing water with very few riffles and small waves. The rivers exhibit minimum impediment and less risk to swimmers. Examples of such rivers include Black River, Carp River, and Drag River. In this category the risk to swimmers is light and self rescue is easy.\n5. Class II Novice -\nUnder this category of Class two Novice, the Rapids are straight forward with moderate difficulty characterized by small waves and some obstacles. The river can be maneuvered with a little difficulty. There are some few rocks with medium sized waves which can be avoided easily by the trained paddlers. Swimmers in are hardly injured, though group assistance is helpful it is hardly needed. Examples include Irvine River, Mississippi, Ottawa River, and Salmon River.\n4. Class III Intermediate -\nClass III Intermediate is characterized by rapid with moderate, irregular waves which may prove difficult to avoid. Powerful currents may also be found especially in the large-volume river. Examples include Head River, Crower River, and Moore’s Creek\n3. Class IV Advanced -\nClass IV advanced is characterized by intense, powerful rapids which are predictable and requires precise boat handling. Large and unavoidable waves and holes may characterize the river and may also constrict the passage. Examples of such rivers include Black River and Spencer Creek.\n2. Class V Expert -\nClass V advanced has rapids characterized by longer rapids with dangerous rocks and boiling eddies. The route is difficult to maneuver and may require precise and powerful canoes. Examples are Crower River and Petawawa River.\n1. Class VI Extreme and Exploratory Rapids -\nClass VI Extreme and Exploratory Rapids are unraftable Rapids because of the extreme difficulty and unpredictable dangers. Runs in this class are runs are hardly attempted because a slight error could be disastrous and rescue might be impossible. An example of Class VII is river Zambezi on the border of Zimbabwe and Zambia at Victoria Falls"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4ee14f2c-bfbd-438c-b6eb-71e83eb90bdb>","<urn:uuid:ea72de1e-2497-4e67-a7a2-fe44a07aac12>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key components of a cash flow statement, and how does dividend policy affect a company's financial decisions regarding cash distribution?","answer":"The cash flow statement consists of three main components: operating activities (showing cash flows from core business operations, including accounts receivable, payable, and inventory), investing activities (showing cash used for long-term investments or received from selling investments), and financing activities (including cash from stock/bond sales or bank loans). As for dividend policy's effect on cash distribution, it involves decisions about the amount and timing of payments to shareholders, influenced by factors like the company's financial position, cash flow, and growth prospects. Companies with stable earnings and excess cash flow may adopt a liberal dividend policy, while those with high growth potential might reinvest earnings instead of distributing them.","context":["Dividend policy refers to the decisions companies make regarding the amount and timing of dividend payments to shareholders. This policy has a significant impact on shareholder wealth and can influence the overall value of a company.\nHow Dividend Policy Affects Shareholder Wealth\nDividend policy affects shareholder wealth in several ways. First, regular dividend payments are often seen as a signal of a company’s stability and financial health. Companies that consistently pay dividends are perceived as reliable and trustworthy, leading to a positive impact on shareholder confidence and, ultimately, the stock price.\nSecond, dividend payments provide shareholders with a tangible return on their investment. A company that pays regular dividends can attract long-term investors who are looking for steady income, thereby increasing demand for the stock and potentially driving up its price.\nOn the other hand, companies that do not pay dividends may be perceived as riskier or as lacking investment opportunities. This can lead to a decrease in shareholder confidence and a negative impact on the stock price.\nFactors Influencing Dividend Policy\nSeveral factors influence a company’s dividend policy, including its financial position, cash flow, growth prospects, and tax considerations. Additionally, management’s perception of the company’s future financing needs and the preferences of shareholders can also play a role in determining the dividend policy.\nFor example, a company with stable earnings and excess cash flow may choose to adopt a more liberal dividend policy, distributing a larger proportion of its earnings to shareholders. Conversely, a company with high growth potential may choose to reinvest its earnings to fund future expansion, resulting in a more conservative or nonexistent dividend policy.\nOverall, dividend policy has a significant impact on shareholder wealth. By carefully considering the financial position and growth prospects of a company, as well as the preferences of its shareholders, management can implement a dividend policy that enhances shareholder value and contributes to the long-term success of the business.\nHow to Develop an Effective Dividend Policy\nDeveloping an effective dividend policy requires careful consideration of various factors. Here are some steps to help companies create a dividend policy that maximizes shareholder wealth:\n- Assess the financial position: Evaluate the company’s financial position, including cash flow, earnings stability, and capital requirements, to determine the capacity for dividend payments.\n- Consider growth prospects: Assess the company’s growth prospects and investment opportunities to determine the appropriate balance between reinvesting earnings and distributing dividends.\n- Understand shareholder preferences: Take into account the preferences of different types of shareholders, such as income-oriented investors and growth-oriented investors, when determining the dividend policy.\n- Communicate the policy: Clearly communicate the dividend policy to shareholders to manage expectations and build confidence in the company’s financial stability and outlook.\nWhat is a dividend policy?\nA dividend policy refers to the decisions companies make regarding the amount and timing of dividend payments to shareholders.\nHow does dividend policy impact shareholder wealth?\nDividend policy can impact shareholder wealth by influencing the perceived stability and financial health of the company, as well as providing shareholders with a tangible return on their investment.\nWhat factors influence dividend policy?\nFactors that influence dividend policy include the company’s financial position, cash flow, growth prospects, tax considerations, future financing needs, and shareholder preferences.","Businesses and investors depend on financial statements to accurately depict the financial condition of an organization. Financial statements are vital to making investment decisions. Two important financial statements readily used by investors include the cash flow statement and statement of shareholders’ equity. The cash flow statement shows the cash that is coming into and leaving a company, while the statement of shareholders’ equity shows detailed changes in the shareholders’ equity listed on a company’s balance sheet. To make informed investment decisions, investors should understand the components of the cash flow statement and statement of shareholders’ equity.\nCash Flow Statement Components\nThe cash flow statement includes three main components: operating, investing and financing activities. Operating activities measures the cash inflows and outflows in reference to a company’s core business operations. Important categories under operating activities include the cash associated with accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory. Investing activities typically shows cash leaving the company to purchase long-term investments, such as equipment or buildings. Investing activities can also show cash a company receives from selling some of its investments. The third component shows the cash flow from financing activities, which may include cash a company raised from selling stocks and bonds to investors or money borrowed from a bank. The cash a company spends to repay a loan also appears under financing activities.\nImportance of the Cash Flow Statement\nThe cash flow statement is important to investors because it shows whether a company has sufficient cash on hand, even while it’s profitable. Companies need adequate cash flow to maintain business operations and make necessary business investments to spur growth. Many investors compare the cash flow statement to the income statement to determine if the cash the company receives from operating activities is exceeding net income. Some investors are wary of companies with cash that is significantly less than net income.\nUnderstanding the Statement of Shareholders’ Equity\nThe elements of the statement of shareholders’ equity include preferred stock, common stock, treasury stock, unrealized gains and loss, retained earnings and dividends. Preferred stock gives shareholders the right to receive dividends before common stockholders. Common stock allows shareholders to receive as large of a dividend as a company decides to issue. If a company chooses to pay out a small dividend, common shareholders may not receive dividends if the company pays all of the money out to preferred shareholders. Treasury stock includes shares that the company repurchased from the open market. Unrealized gains and losses reflect the price changes in a company’s investments that are available-for-sale. Retained earnings refers to the part of a company’s profit it chooses to keep instead of pay as distributions to shareholders. Dividends include the portion of net income a company pays to shareholders as an incentive for investing.\nImportance of the Statement of Shareholders’ Equity\nThe statement of shareholders’ equity is important to investors because it shows a company’s equity interest among shareholders. Investors subtract liabilities from the amount of a company’s total equity to determine its net worth. Retained earnings is a component of the statement of shareholders’ equity that investors closely analyze because it shows the amount of money a company is reinvesting in itself to further growth."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ea72984b-a54e-492f-ad69-38831db78a06>","<urn:uuid:dfcd84f9-75e4-4bb2-a81e-5d64c6bd8d69>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do state-mandated energy reporting requirements align with property value benefits, and what specific building features contribute to sustainability?","answer":"New Jersey joins California, Washington state, and over 42 cities in requiring energy and water disclosure, which helps tenants assess building efficiency and supports companies' ability to measure and verify environmental data. In terms of property features, sustainable buildings can incorporate various elements like high efficiency lighting, Energy Star appliances, automatic lighting controls, building automation systems, daylight harvesting features, smart irrigation systems, and high efficiency HVAC systems. These features can potentially increase property value, particularly in income-producing properties where they reduce operating costs, though the value impact depends on whether basic functionality needs are met first.","context":["In September, 2022, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) issued an order requiring the owner or operator of every commercial building over 25,000 square feet in the state to benchmark their energy and water use as part of an effort to spur energy efficiency.\nBuilding owners must use the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s online Portfolio Manager Tool to measure and analyze their respective facilities’ energy and water usage. NJBPU’s website has information about how to report benchmarking. The first benchmarking submissions are due on Oct. 1, 2023, for energy and water consumed in 2022. Portfolio Manager is a FREE tool from the EPA that enables owners to input data and measure and monitor consumption.\n“This is the next important step in implementing a best in class, statewide, energy efficiency program which will help us achieve Governor Murphy’s goal of 100% clean energy by 2050,” said NJBPU President Joseph L. Fiordaliso. “Creating a system of benchmarking allows us to measure the use of energy (electricity and gas) and water by the state’s biggest buildings and support building owners in reducing energy and water usage and operating costs.”\nBenchmarking is intended to help commercial building owners and operators measure and analyze their respective facilities’ energy and water usage and compare it to other similar buildings. Building owners and operators can use this information to make informed decisions about taking advantage of financial incentives for energy efficiency improvements.\nThe NJBPU initiative is directed by the New Jersey’s Energy Master Plan, which calls for transparent benchmarking and energy labeling. The program it intended to enable building owners to obtain aggregated, building-level energy and water data from their utility companies through a data access service. The Board will also establish a “help desk” to assist building owners as they measure and analyze their respective buildings’ energy and water performance.\nThis program will also protect individual ratepayers’ energy and water use information by requiring utilities to securely provide aggregated, building-level data. Building owners are required to obtain their tenants’ affirmative, written consent for the utilities from which they receive services to provide building-level energy and water data to the building owner in certain situations to protect individual energy and water use information.\nConsent will be required only when there are fewer than four tenants in a building or if one tenant exceeds 50% of the energy or water consumption.\nMore information about building benchmarking through NJBPU is available at https://njcleanenergy.com/commercial-industrial/programs/energy-benchmarking.\nFood For Thought – NJ through the NJBPU Order joins California and Washington state as well as over 42 cities and 2 counties in requiring some form of energy and water disclosure mandate. While many do not like being forced to report which is understandable, having this mandate will enable the State and tenants to better access which buildings are more efficient than others when it comes to energy and water consumption that are often paid for by common area charges assessed to these tenants. If and to the extent the SEC’s proposed rules on climate disclosure become effective, having a tool that allows for measurement and verification of various data sets will help bolster various companies ability to measure, verify and report on such data in the energy, water, waste, recycling, materials and air quality space.\nDuane Morris has an active ESG and Sustainability Team to help organizations and individuals plan, respond to, and execute on your Sustainability and ESG planning and initiatives.

Most green building certifications have several compliance path routes, meaning that the project can go after a plethora of different features which combined may allow the property to reach certification. A property need not be certified to be green. A property can very well be sustainable, net-zero or efficiently constructed without having a certification.\nHowever, the market may not realize a value to many green features without certification. Further complicating the matter is the fact that, if the feature is not properly marketed, the buyer may simply not know it’s there or why they should be interested in it. Read on for further explanation.\nThere are a plethora of green certifications, view some Common Green Building Certifications here.\nGenerally, a green feature would be an automatic or natural enhancement to the property that minimizes energy consumption, water consumption, waste, or environmental degradation.\nHere is a partial list of green features:\nUnder floor air\nHigh efficiency lighting\nEnergy Star appliances\nAutomatic lighting controls\nAuto-dimming light balasts\nReal-time energy tracking\nBuilding automation system\nDaylight harvesting features – natural or automatic\nPassive solar building design\nDemand controlled HVAC\nHigh efficiency furnace\nHigh efficiency air conditioning\nSmart irrigation system\nThe list goes on…\nIs My Property Worth More if I Install Solar Panels or other Green Features?\nThis is where things get complicated. The short answer: maybe. Green features are similar to other property improvements in that they:\n(1) Enhance some aspect of the building; and\n(2) How much that enhancement is worth is a function of your specific property, whether certain needs have already been met, the most probable buyer/tenant, property type, and property use.\nFrom what we’ve seen, certain basic space needs must be met first before the value of a green component is recognized. Basic budget, location, livability/useability, functionality, condition, and durability needs should be satisfied to the extent necessary for the end-user, prior to most green features or certifications adding value. For example, though not always the case, if a home lacked a functional floor plan but had solar panels, it is likely that a buyer would not be willing to pay an additional amount for the home because although it has solar, the basic functionality need has not been met. Income producing properties present a slightly different scenario due to the fact that value is more heavily weighted to income and expenses. Thus, some of the previous residential buyer needs may come into play less if the green feature is reducing operating costs, increasing rental rates, etc. It is important to select an appraiser with experience valuing green properties because the analysis can get very complicated.\nIs My Building or House Worth More with Certification?\nGreen certification is one aspect of a property. For example, consider you are buying a used car. A used car that is “certified” by an auto-dealer as “certified-used” is still a particular color, make, model and age, at a particular price point. That is, the primary features of the car are still in-tact with or without certification. If the car is also “certified-used” by some entity, you may perceive the car as having passed certain quality control measures, performance tests, maintenance tests, etc. Green building certifications are similar in that they provide a real or perceived third party warranty that the building has met certain design requirements, performance metrics (depending on certification type) or other quality standards. Without the certification, there are still characteristics of the property that relate to certain buyer demands. How the market views this characteristic will depend on your specific property, local market, property type, and use.\nCommercial green buildings can have several quantifiable benefits within their market, such as:\nLower cap rates\nLower operating expenses\nLower maintenance expenses\nLower employee turnover\nHigher rental rates\nHigher stabilized occupancy\nDoes this mean that every green building has all of these attributes? No. However, they are components that should be considered and explored when appraising a green property. Several case studies have been completed that support these considerations, though generalizations such as these do not necessarily reflect all individual cases. Minor differences in any of these categories can have substantial implications for the value of the building. For some market studies and/or other resources view our Green Building Appraisal Resources page.\nResidential green buildings can also have quantifiable benefits within their market, such as:\nFewer days on market\nHuge PR capabilities – free advertising\nLower maintenance expenses\nLower utility costs\nAdditional property enhancing features\nIncreased curb appeal\nDo all green residential properties have these benefits? Probably not. However, they are components that should be considered and explored when appraising a green property.

{"question":"I care about food safety. What key differences exist between conventional and organic farming regarding chemical usage and GMOs?","answer":"Conventional agriculture heavily relies on synthetic chemicals and GMOs to maximize crop yields. Farmers use synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, and genetically modified crops. In contrast, organic farming strictly prohibits the use of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, GMOs, synthetic growth regulators, and synthetic processing substances. Additionally, organic systems focus on nurturing ecosystems for sustainable productivity, while conventional methods often lead to environmental damage through chemical pollution and reduced biodiversity.","context":["Table of Contents Show\n- Brief History of Agriculture\n- What is Conventional Agriculture?\n- What is Sustainable agriculture?\n- What is the difference between conventional and sustainable agriculture?\n- Basic principles of sustainable agriculture\n- How is Sustainable Agriculture better in Modern World?\n- Will sustainable agriculture fulfill World’s food demand?\nFarming has been the number one source of food for thousands of years now.\nAgricultural methods and practices have constantly been refined and perfected over time to meet demands of the growing population. With increased world hunger, today’s food demand is higher than it’s ever been before.\nUnfortunately, this pressure to fulfill demand leads to increase in pollution and destruction of natural environment.\nThere are various agriculture techniques available to modern farming. However, it is necessary that the techniques being adopted are not harmful to the environment and more importantly, sustainable.\nWill sustainable farming really ensure continuous supply of food for all generations? Let’s find out!\nToday we’ll be comparing conventional and sustainable farming. These are two broad classes of agriculture being employed in the modern world.\nBrief History of Agriculture\nAgriculture has played a major role in mankind development, ever since it began way back in 10,000 B.C. It allowed humans to manipulate ecosystems to maximize growth and bring food to the table.\nIn Colonial Period of American history (1607-1761), agriculture was the primary source of income for 90% of the population!\nAgriculture, and the vast science behind it, has allowed people to live and permanently settle across the world. Once humans discovered the ability to plant seeds, the ability to explore potential agricultural lands grew immensely.\nSelective breeding began to be implemented 10,000 years ago to produce desired characteristics. This allowed further increase in settlements around the world.\nAs farmers came to realize the negative impacts of farming throughout the year, especially exhaustion of nutrients, various new methods such as intercropping and crop rotation came into play to reduce such burdens.\nIntercropping is still one of the most commonly implemented agricultural techniques being employed today, which helps to maintain soil composition, biodiversity, and plant health.\nHowever, due to high rise in populations, drastic measures have been taken to ensure continuous supply of food. Many countries have now shifted towards a more conventional method of farming.\nOther factors like economic instability, high poverty and avoiding shortage put more pressure on farmers to produce a much higher yield. This meant use of toxic chemicals and intensive farming techniques.\nIt may seem beneficial at the first glance. More food, Yay!\nHowever, it is quite the opposite. Because to carry out such methods farmers became locked in a cycle of loans, debts, and subsidies to fulfill the greed of food industry.\nWhat is Conventional Agriculture?\nConventional agriculture is a form of agriculture in which farmers utilize synthetic chemicals to grow and maintain their crops (usually genetically modified).\nA high amount of chemical and energy input is put in to produce the highest possible yield from the crops when farmers are carrying out conventional agriculture.\nThe goal concerned with conventional agriculture is to maximize the potential crop yield as much as possible.\nSadly, to achieve these yields, environmental impact is not considered. This makes conventional agriculture particularly harmful.\nWhat is Sustainable agriculture?\nSustainable farming represents the other extreme of agriculture.\nIt is a form of agriculture that aims to protect soils, ecosystems, and all living organisms. It has a higher reliance on ecological processes, biodiversity, and cycles of nature.\nNo external interventions. Period!\nIt is a holistic approach to agriculture with greater reliance on ecosystems and natural resilience to protect the farmland.\nYou should also read 10 Methods of Sustainable Agriculture to know what’s it all about!\nWhat is the difference between conventional and sustainable agriculture?\n|Conventional Farming||Sustainable Agriculture|\n|Main goal: Best Yield and High Profit||Main goal: Sustainability (Secure Future)|\n|Use of Agricultural Chemicals||No use of Agricultural Chemicals|\n|High Environmental Damage||Low Environmental Damage|\n|Use of GMO crops||No use of GMO ( like organic farming)|\n|Promotes Monoculture (same crop throughout)||Promotes Poly-culture (variety of crops)|\n|Reduced Biodiversity||High Biodiversity|\n|High Yields||Lower Yields (Comparatively)|\n|Reduced Soil Fertility||Good Soil Fertility|\n|Soil Erosion||No Soil Erosion|\n|Requires fertilizers||Crops naturally strong against pests and disease|\n|High Farmer Debts||Low Farmer Debts|\n|Better Maintenance (Reduced No. of Processes)||Difficult to Maintain (Many processes to keep track)|\nTo give you a one-liner explanation, I’d like to put it this way.\nConventional farming is like burning both ends of the stick at the same time. It generates more heat (and energy) but burns out quicker.\nThe main objective of conventional farming across the world is to achieve the best possible yield from their land. For achieving that, farmers may choose to use various synthetic chemicals to create an artificially designed environment best for crop growth.\nThese agricultural chemicals are a source of land, water, and air pollution that cannot only be detrimental to the environment but to all living beings that may come in contact with it.\nIt also promotes use of genetically modified crops (GMO) that are modified to give higher yields.\nYou should also read up Pros and Cons of Applying Biotechnology in Agriculture.\nSustainable agriculture doesn’t employ the use of genetically modified species of crops, nor does it use any potential synthetic chemicals or fertilizers.\nSustainable farming aims for minimum environmental impact on the farmland, while maintain good yields.\nIn conventional agriculture, a farmer will use more commodity crops that are much easier to transport, don’t ripe early in storage and provide a variety of consumer and non-consumer products.\nCommodity crops are known to be the most lucrative options available on the market.\nConventional farmers choose to grow specific commodity crops, Corn being one of the major examples in this practice.\nBy planting a single crop variety, farmers tend to make their work simple and efficient. Better farm management can be carried out with better maintenance and harvesting practices across the farmland.\nThis will allow for better planning for the future while investing in machinery and obtaining crop varieties better suited for the area.\nWhat we are trying to convey here is that conventional agriculture is based on generating the maximum amount of profit. Sadly, this vision has a dark side to it. The farming method completely ignores the potential impact the approach may have on the environment.\nThis form of practice can generally lead to the loss of soil fertility and erosion.\nOther than that, the land becomes devoid of nutrition due to intensive farming techniques carried out throughout the year. Intensive agriculture practices do not give enough time for the soil to replenish its nutrients.\nSustainable farmlands are rich with much more nutrients, as they get the necessary time to replenish their nutrients. It is important that there is an emphasis on a high nutrient level and biodiversity as these two factors will help to contribute to a healthy crop and farmland.\nA better quality of soil is seen in sustainable agriculture. These practices generally have a lower burden on soil fertility. Soil management is vital for continued production of crops and sustainable farming is highly effective to prevent loss of soil fertility and soil erosion, both of which are common findings in conventional agriculture.\nBiodiversity is important as it protects the plants from various pests and diseases. This isn’t seen in conventional agriculture as they practice monoculture (plant one or two crops throughout the field).\nHigher biodiversity enhances the various ecological cycles’ performance that sustainable crops heavily rely on.\nYes, sustainable agriculture doesn’t make the same amount of yield products that conventional agriculture does nor can it match the production rate of conventional agriculture, but it sure makes up for these drawbacks by being sustainable.\nThis is beneficial because not only does it protect the land from various forms of pollution, but also aims to increase biodiversity.\nBasic principles of sustainable agriculture\nSustainable agriculture can be characterized by\n- Increased Biodiversity\n- Integration of Farming Processes.\nSustainable agriculture promotes biodiversity of plants and animals on farmlands. Both, plants and animals, on a sustainable farmland are interconnected to the point that sometimes you don’t need to do anything!\nLook at it this way; fertile lands and animals have always worked in harmony to promote biodiversity and ensure sustainability. That’s basically the reason why we still have fertile farmlands.\nOne of the major benefits of sustainable farming is that a bio-diverse system is healthy and resistant against pests and diseases. Bio-diverse species are much more adaptive changes in climate and temperature than monoculture species.\nThey find ways to utilize nutrients efficiently and thereby prevent soil depletion.\nA Part of produce from sustainable farming is actually planted to replenish agricultural land. Such plants include Soybean, Peanut and Clover which fix nitrogen into the soil. This helps to fill the soil with organic matter and improve nutritional cycles.\nThe sustainable farm works towards achieving a balance between using resources and allowing them to replenish themselves; all the while maintaining food supply.\nHow is Sustainable Agriculture better in Modern World?\nThere are a few reasons why people should start adopting sustainable agriculture. Let me discuss some of those reasons of how it beats conventional agriculture. Then you can decide and tell me what you think.\nSustainable agriculture uses resources with better efficiency and tries to conserve (save) as much as possible.\nIt aims to build up organic soil matter through various farming methods like green manure, compost application, and no-tillage. This makes the soil naturally enriched. As a result, farmers don’t have to use a high amount of fertilizers on their lands.\nThe soil organic matter aims to provide nutrients to crops, improve soil quality, enhance microbial growth and promote water retention. Improvement in water retention helps to make crops more resistant to droughts, producing higher yields in low water conditions.\nThere is an aim to reduce the farmer’s dependency on external inputs (fossil fuels) when carrying out sustainable agriculture. The system is created in such a way so most of energy on the farm is recycled.\nThese farms are highly diverse with interconnected production units, crop residues or harvest leftovers go to feed the farm’s livestock.\nThis reduces the need to import feed for livestock and promotes manure production on the farm. The cycle of energy continues once the manure is used as a fertilizer on the land to grow crops once again.\nSustainable agriculture also fares better in terms of fossil fuels. This is because conventional farming is mostly based on machinery which uses insanely high amount of fossil fuels.\nEven fertilizer production requires fossil fuels. You won’t believe it but fertilizer production makes up for more than 50% of all energy used in conventional agriculture.\nPS: Fossil fuels are limited non-renewable resources so we shouldn’t depend on them so much.\nConventional farms require hundreds of acres of land to drive maximum profits. Environmental impact is the least of their worry. These lands are made available by clearing out forests.\nAround one-third of all forests in the world have been removed since 2001, mainly for agricultural activities.\nDeforestation at such large scale destroys ecosystems, modifies creeks for water supply, dries out ground water and drains wetlands.\nIn long-term, conventional agriculture has triggered numerous negative effects around the world. Effects that have been detrimental to human lives as well like\n- Pollution (Air, water and Land)\n- Greenhouse gas emissions and Global warming\n- Drinking water contaminated with Pesticides\n- Nutrient Pollution\n- Eutrophication and Dead zones in nearby rivers\n- Floods and Droughts due to changes in natural water streams\n- Reduced pollination and reduced biodiversity\n- Soil erosion\nImagine the damage!\nSustainable agriculture can fulfill world’s demand without harming the environment.\nThey help restore degraded lands once left behind by farmers as they were infertile. Degraded agricultural lands are recovered by use of methods like composting and crop rotation.\nAn achievement in sustainable agriculture was when Ethiopian government recovered 390,000 hectares of degraded agricultural land. They did this with crop rotation, terracing the hills and introducing permanent ‘green cover’ of the land.\nIowa State University held a 7-year long experiment to observe the benefits of sustainable farming. The experiment was located in U.S Corn Belt, one of the most intensively-farmed areas in the region. They compared sustainable farming practices to conventional farming methods of growing corn and soybean (in monoculture farming).\nFrom 2008-2015, after 4 crop rotations, the results were as follows:\n- Both crops had higher yields! Corn yield increased by 3% per acre and Soybean increased by more than 10 percent.\n- Reduced Soil Erosion\n- Requirement of Nitrogen Fertilizers fell by 90%\n- Requirement of Herbicide fell by 50% (90% reduction in run off)\nSustainable farming has greatly improved biodiversity on various farms as well. They’ve achieved this by carrying out agroforestry, improved water retention and application of soil conservation measures like no-till or cover crops.\nThis practice proves that world’s food demand can be fulfilled without harming the environment, preventing further destruction of our ecosystems.\nResilience to Climate Change\nAs I told you, farmers focus on one or two crops at most. Due to this, conventional farms have a great disadvantage when it comes to climate resilience.\nReduced biodiversity means that if there is harvest loss, drought or pest attack; farmers will lost almost all of the harvest.\nAs we were just talking about Iowa State University experiment, I’ll tell you about another one.\nResearch showed that if it rained more in spring, there would be 30% loss of corn yield in U.S Corn Belt. This is actually very bad news. Because the climate change model there predicts increase in spring rainfall in the future.\nOn the other hand; sustainable farming has a better ability to withstand stress events related to climate change. This is especially true because of heightened biodiversity and soil quality.\nSoils rich in organic matter absorb water like a sponge. Ability to store water for extended periods of time makes the farm resistant to droughts. Organic soils tested in Switzerland were found to have 40% higher ability of water-holding capacity.\nSustainable agriculture employs smart methods of rainwater harvesting. Ponds are created on farmland to collect and store rainwater, mainly to prepare for drought seasons.\nSome may even make wetlands on their farms, further improving water management on the farm and the surrounding.\nDiverse species have greater adaptability towards climate change and higher resistance to pest damage. Climate change is also known to alter pest lifecycles to make them more vicious. Higher biodiversity greatly protects from new infestation. If it was a conventional farm, it would’ve been wiped out!\nAdditional benefits of sustainable agriculture are its ability to store carbon. Soil and perennial vegetation can be found on such marks, serving as a natural sink helping to offset the greenhouse effect, potentially mitigating climate change.\nConventional farming practices have given farming an industrial cover. The goal of agriculture to provide food to the table has been changed. It has now become a business tool to power global economy.\nAn example of a simple crop turned into profit-driven tool is corn. Corn is the most-grown crop of United States with acreage as large as 100 million acres! Farmers love growing corn on their farms because it brings high yields.\nIt would’ve been understandable if those yields were used to feed us. That’s not it. 40% of the corn is used for producing ethanol as biofuels, 35% gets mixed into livestock feed and the rest of it either gets exported or used in making corn syrup.\nLocal people who live around those farms do not get access to that corn because hundreds and hundreds of acres around are being solely exported.\nOne of the key differences when it comes to sustainable farming is that it helps to improve livelihood of rural populations by enabling small farmers to grow and supply locally sourced food that is safe, diverse, and filled with nutrients, and at the same time maintain good farm health.\nThe key principles of sustainable farming is that food grown is used by local people, making it a direct and least wasteful way of managing excess harvest. This localized approach helps to develop respect for the land and improves management of resources.\nPS: Lower greenhouse gases because of local transport only.\nWill sustainable agriculture fulfill World’s food demand?\nOur agriculture system is working as hard as it can! Farmers working day in-day out, farming machines working to their maximum and agricultural chemicals are being used at highest concentrations, all to ensure maximum yields.\nConventional farming really drains the soil quality and does it quicker than the land can recuperate. This, much like non-renewable energy resources, cannot go on longer.\nSustainable agriculture is already proving to become a capable source of food for the growing population. It offers a combination of methods that help in soil regeneration, water retention, energy-saving methods, and a greater diversity of nutrients for consumption.\nFarmers have the freedom to select the right crop; they can make a choice that fulfills their needs as well as needs of the local community. If done properly, these processes can be up-scaled without increased use of resources or installing expensive equipment. This opens up luxurious income possibilities for small farmers.\nIt will help to solve rising poverty levels seen on the countryside, especially where most villagers are dependent on farming as their source of income. The money can be then used to buy more diverse, nutritious food to provide a better standard of living for their family.\nSustainable farming has the power to connect people by providing basic nutritional needs to the community and secure their food supply in times of difficulty without making a compromise on the land’s future capacity of producing food.\nThe principles of sustainable farming are concerned with being economically viable for farmers and key to strengthening communities without harming the environment. These fundamentals should be sufficient enough to sustain the growing population in years to come by.","Organic: farm systems employ management practices that seek to nurture ecosystems in order to achieve sustainable productivity\n• DO NOT contain any genetic engineering\n• DO NOT use any synthetic pesticides\n• DO NOT use any fertilizer\n• DO NOT use any veterinary drugs including antibiotics\n• DO NOT use sewage sludge as soil amendment\n• DO NOT use synthetic growth regulators\n• DO NOT use synthetic processing substances and food additives\n• DO NOT use ionizing radiation\n• ALL equipment, packaging materials and storage containers or bins DO NOT contain any synthetic fungicide, preservative or fumigant\nCertified organic symbol means that products that are at least 95% organic\n· Organic: must use more than 95% organic content.\n· % organic product: must contain 70-95% organic content\n· Multi-ingredient products with less than 70% organic content may only contain organic claims in the product’s ingredient list.\n· ‘Natural’ or ‘free-range’ - NOT organic!\nThe Dirty Dozen: The Fruits and Vegetables that are the most important to buy organic\n- Sweet Bell Peppers\nGenetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)\n- Based on the idea of \"substantial equivalence”\nAnimal studies: immune dysregulation, infertility, accelerated aging, insulin dysregulation, changes in liver, spleen, kidneysGI tract\nAllergenicity: Introducing a new gene to a plant can create new allergens, or pose a health threat to already susceptible individuals\nHealth Canada claims that genetically modified foods are no different than conventional foods\nNo long term studies have been done to assess the effects of modified foods on human health\nSoybeans and corn are the top two most widely grown crops (82% of all GM crops harvested in 2000), with cotton, rapeseed (or canola) and potatoes trailing behind.\nOver 35 countries require Genetically Modified Foods to be labeled…..Canada does not.\n• Animals are treated with Antibiotic as a form of prevention and treatment of disease\n• Antibiotic resistance increases the chance of antibiotic resistant bacteria developing, making it more difficult to treat human disease\n· Canadian beef: the Canadian Food Inspection agency has approved use of growth hormones and synthetic derivative à estrogen, progesterone, testosterone\n· Canadian chicken: not fed hormones\n· Free range: not legally defined\n· 88% of chicken feed is made of grain\n· Organic meat: hormone free, anti-biotic free, additive free\nWhen buying meat…\n• Look for key words such as lean.

{"question":"When and why did maracatu music nearly disappear in Brazil?","answer":"Maracatu music nearly disappeared in Brazil in the mid-1960s due to two main factors: Brazil's economic decline made it difficult to maintain the large groups (which sometimes had over 100 members), and the music faced social stigma, being negatively associated with 'black-people music' and viewed as something involving 'drunk people falling in middle of street'.","context":["A collaboration between a group from Brazil and a drummer from Brooklyn is part of a rebirth of music with roots in Afro-Brazilian slave culture.\nThe music is experiencing a resurgence these days, thanks in part to a collaboration between the Brazilian group Estrela Brilhante and the Brooklyn-based band Nation Beat. The groups kicked off a US tour recently in New York City, and also held a series of workshops on the basics of the music.\nForty people with drums slung around their necks are packed into the third floor of the Gowanus Arts Building in an old industrial part of Brooklyn. One cluster is playing the shallow caixa snare drum, another group pounds on the deeper alfaia. One person counts triplets on the oversized congue cowbell.\nAlmost everyone's wearing ear plugs–this stuff gets loud.\nWalter Ferreira de França strides through the middle, marking the beat with two drumsticks, playfully urging drummers on, and leaning in close to check their call-and-response singing.\nDuring one break he gently suggests, in Portuguese and somewhat enigmatically, \"A bull lying down is not a cow.\"\nThe group is a mix of musicians from Mestre Walter's group Estrela Brilhante, and people studying maracatu with Brooklyn-based percussionist Scott Kettner.\nKettner first heard about maracatu from a drum instructor in New York. He spent time in Brazil in the early 2000s studying with Estrela Brilhante, and he started noticing some familiar things in maracatu.\n\"The deeper I got into the music–the deeper I got into the religion and the culture–I started to realize all these similarities between New Orleans, and the Southern United States, with the Northeast of Brazil,\" Kettner says.\nThere were rhythmic similarities, and similarities in how the music was performed–the costumes, the pageantry. And the musical styles each have their roots in the culture of African slaves in the New World.\nKettner formed a group called Nation Beat to explore these connections. The connection was made explicit on an album that they and Estrela Brilhante recorded together in 2005. You can hear some of the collaboration here.\nThis partnership has grown–and maracatu is enjoying a resurgence in Brazil and elsewhere.\nIt nearly disappeared in the mid-60s. Brazil's economy was in decline and it was hard to maintain the sprawling groups–sometimes numbering over 100 members. Dona Marivalda Maria dos Santos, the Queen and President of Estrela Brilhante, says the music was also looked down on.\n\"Maracatu used to be thought of as black-people music, black-people dancing,\" she explains, speaking in Portuguese. \"It was seen as negative thing, with drunk people falling in middle of street.\"\nBut maracatu groups are now proliferating in the northeastern state of Pernambuco. This rebirth was sparked in part by popular musicians incorporating maracatu into their work in the 1990s, including Chico Science and his mangue movement. Groups are now getting some state support, too. And, Dona Marivalda says, the music has transcended racial boundaries. She says the majority of her group is now white.\n\"It's true that it's a black culture, but it's a black culture that can involve white people. Because maybe your skin is light, but you're not white. Your grandma or your grandpa were black. So, your skin is white, but the blood is black. Now, our group has a beautiful salad of colors all mixed together.\"\nEstrela Brilhante kicked off a tour with Kettner's Nation Beat recently at Lincoln Center in New York City. It's their first US tour.\nWalter Ferreira de França was psyched to see the crowd's enthusiastic response, and says he thought there was some of the feel of the big carnival parades his group marches in in their native Pernambuco.\nThis wasn't totally unexpected. A doll that used to accompany Estrela Brilhante in all their parades actually spent decades in the US. The doll, named Joventina, came here when the group went dormant for a while in the late 60s.\nWalter thinks Joventina's decades in the US prepared the way for the group. As the courtly procession made its way on stage at Lincoln Center, Joventina was held high, protecting them still."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:99147000-1fda-428f-82d5-28e32ff1e0cd>"],"error":null}

{"question":"I need to bake some hamburger buns and want to understand both the basic recipe and the flour options. What's the process for making hamburger buns, and what are my choices between whole grain, whole wheat, and multigrain flour?","answer":"For hamburger buns, cut the dough into 9 equal pieces, shape into balls, place 3 inches apart on a greased/cornmealed baking sheet, flatten slightly, and bake at 375F for 12-15 minutes until golden brown. For flour choices: whole wheat flour is made exclusively from wheat and has a lighter taste and texture; whole grain flour uses all parts of the grain (bran, germ, and endosperm) and provides complete nutritional benefits; multigrain flour contains multiple grain types and offers varied proteins and plant fibers, though nutritional benefits depend on the specific grains used.","context":["A recipe made with half whole wheat, and half white bread flour, divided into two baguette-sized loaves.\nThis recipe is for a bread machine; I always bake it in the oven with a tray of boiling water sitting on the bottom of the oven. I’m not a fan of white bread — taste or nutrition-wise), but this bread is delicious! I have recently been trying to add whole wheat bread flour to this recipe to make it more nutritious; 1 cup of whole wheat bread flour plus 2 cups of unbleached bread flour gives pretty much the same results. This video, with chef Ciril Hitz, is excellent if you want to make better baguettes.\nMakes a 1.5 lb loaf, or buns.\nPlace these ingredients in your bread machine in the order recommended by the machine’s manufacturer:\n- 1 ¼ cup water, plus up to 2 Tbsp extra, depending on how the dough is looking\n- 1 ½ teaspoons salt\n- 1½ teaspoons butter\n- 1½ teaspoons sugar\n- 3 cups bread flour, white or unbleached\n- 2 teaspoons bread machine yeast\nSet machine on “dough” setting, and start. Keep an eye on the dough as it is kneading; if, after 5 or 10 minutes it seems dry, or the machine is struggling, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough forms a smooth, soft, pliable ball that is slightly tacky to the touch. Weather will affect the amount of water the dough will need.\nWhen the dough cycle is finished, tip the dough out onto a well-floured counter or cutting board. Let it rest for a couple of minutes. Shape it into a 15″ log (or any other shape you like).\nSprinkle a cookie sheet with cornmeal, or grease; the cornmeal gives the crust a nice crunch. Place the dough onto the cookie sheet and brush with oil. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled in bulk. A good way to test for whether its ready to go in the oven or not is to poke the side of the loaf gently; if the depression from your finger remains, then the bread is ready to be baked.\nPreheat oven to 425F. I like to place a shallow pan of boiling water on the bottom of the oven, as this gives a crustier bread.\nYou can slash the top, glaze it with egg wash or milk, or anything else you like to do with bread.\nBake at 425F for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown and 200F in the center.\nRemove from oven, and cool on a rack.\nFOR HOTDOG OR HAMBURGER BUNS:\n- Cut the dough into 9 equal pieces.\n- For hotdog buns, shape into ropes.

Cool on rack before slicing.","We know that we’re not the only ones who get confused by all the different types of bread.\nIf you’ve ever wondered about the difference between whole grain vs whole wheat or whole grain vs multigrain, you’re in the same boat.\nUnderstanding grain products can be seriously perplexing. We see now that the baked goods in store have more labels and regulations that ever before, which can be stressful to decode.\nWhat is considered a whole grain? Is wholemeal bread the same as whole wheat?\nHere are the differences between whole wheat, whole grain, and multigrain to help you unravel the mystery behind your food.\nWhole Grain vs Whole Wheat vs Multigrain\nHumans have been growing and eating grains for millennia, but they never had the food choices that we have today.\nHere’s what you need to know about three of the healthiest alternatives to white flour products.\nA multigrain label might sound like the healthiest option, or the most filling, but there’s actually more to it than that.\nSimply put, multigrain products contain more than one type of grain, be it oats, barley, or rye. If you can’t eat gluten, you might have to check the ingredients before chowing down.\nWith a variety of grains, there are more types of proteins and plant fibers in bread made out of multigrains than in your average loaf of white bread.\nHowever, the nutrition benefits can differ between products depending on which grains are included in the recipe.\nMake sure to check the ingredients list if you have certain dietary needs and look for brands that include whole grains.\nWhole grain means that all the parts of the grain are used in the bread recipe.\nSo that’s the bran, germ, and endosperm – all of that good stuff stays in.\nWhen it comes to whole grain vs multigrain, the multigrain can contain whole grain, but not the other way around.\nWhole grains provide the proteins, nutrients, fiber, and other healthy compounds found naturally in the grain. Of course the nutrition benefits vary according to each kind of grain used.\nNot all whole grains are created equal, so you may want to do a bit of research if you are looking to achieve complete grain consumption efficiency.\nWhole wheat (sometimes called wholemeal in the UK) is a subset of whole grain.\nLike whole grain, it uses all parts of the grain, but differs in that it is made exclusively with wheat.\nWhole wheat has a lighter taste and texture making it great for white bread, noodles, and cereals.\nWhen it comes to whole grain vs whole wheat healthwise, whole wheat is pretty much equal to whole grain.\nSince it is made of wheat, there is gluten, but considerably less than in all-purpose flour.\nBaking with Grains\nAll three of these grains can be used in a breadmaker. Although, baking with these grains requires a bit of understanding on how they behave.\nBaking Multigrain Bread\nThe first thing you notice with multigrain products is that they have a different taste than white flour.\nMultigrain flour brings its own flavors into the mix, while white flour is bland and features the flavors of any ingredients that you add into the recipe instead.\nDepending on the mix of grains in your multigrain flour, you might have to make some modifications to your recipe.\nSome multigrain flours absorb more liquid than others, so you might have to do a bit of guesswork when baking (or get a great bread machine cookbook that will spell it out for you).\nWhole Grain Bread in a Bread Maker\nBaking with whole grain is considerably different from baking with white flour, but the outcome is a wonderfully textured, nutty bread that is surprisingly light and soft.\nOne of the difficulties of baking with whole wheat is that you cannot simply substitute the white flour for whole grain in a recipe: you have to redesign the recipe to compensate for its different nature.\n- Firstly, whole wheat contains germ and bran which soaks up more water that white flour. Not enough water in your recipe can lead to a dry loaf that doesn’t hold together. Make sure that you use enough water to create a slightly wet and sticky dough.\n- The structure of whole wheat dough is another aspect to take into consideration. Whole wheat flour contains flakes of bran which can “cut” the gluten strands when kneaded, so extra care needs to be given when handling the dough. Some bakers supplement their flour with a little bit of all-purpose or concentrated gluten flour to compensate for the lack of gluten.\n- Lastly, use less yeast than you would when baking with white flour, as a whole wheat dough can over-ferment and collapse if there’s too much. This is because there are more nutrients for the yeast to consume in whole wheat, so it rises faster, putting it at risk of over-fermenting. Just use less yeast and give it less time to rise.\nWhole Wheat Bread in a Bread Machine\nBaking with whole wheat is essentially the same as baking with whole grain. It is more likely that home bakers will use it because it is generally easier to find than other whole grains.\nWhich Grain is Right for You?\nThese three options give you room to customize your bread based on taste, nutrients, and dietary restrictions. The best path forward is to read up on the labels to understand where your health could be hindered, and if nothing stands in your way, start experimenting!\nWhat’s your favorite grain?"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:102f987b-a0c2-422c-9472-4a6d09cff18b>","<urn:uuid:cad7a79c-b10d-45f8-9ddf-69cdb860922a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the neurotypical approach to autism education compare with sensory-focused environments, and what specific sensory equipment is available for creating supportive spaces?","answer":"The neurotypical and sensory-focused approaches represent different philosophies in autism education. The neurotypical approach advocates for replicating real-world environments to help with generalization skills, arguing that sensory-sensitive environments may limit universal access and integration. Proponents believe students need to learn in settings similar to the outside world to transfer their skills. However, critics argue that individuals need to first acquire skills before generalizing them, and question whether replicating potentially substandard environments is beneficial. For creating sensory-supportive spaces, specific equipment includes bubble tubes that produce streams of bubbles with changing light colors, fiber optic strands that can be used as curtains or carpets providing visual focus and deep pressure input, themed projectors displaying moving images for calming and visual tracking, and specialized furniture with built-in speakers allowing users to feel music through vibration. These components can be combined in multi-sensory environments (MSEs) designed to promote relaxation, focus, and understanding of cause and effect.","context":["Similar to a mainstream school setting, Celebrate the Children, a school for children with autism, lines its hallways with colorful banners, photographs, and student artwork. Parents concerned with some of their children’s hypersensitivities often ask Monica Osgood, the school’s director, if there is too much stimulation. Monica responds that her students need to learn in ‘real’ world settings if they will ever have a chance to use their acquired skills outside of the classroom. This logic for replicating ‘neuro-typical’ environments, argues directly against the sensory sensitive approach, and, with reasons worth exploring. Individuals with autism often have very poor generalization skills. Therefore proponents of ‘neuro-typical’ simulated environments claim that sensory sensitive environments actually cause less, not more, universal access and integration into the larger population. Whether or not there is any truth to this claim is unknown. There are strong arguments for and against the ‘neuro-typical’ approach, but there are no definitive studies comparing the sensory sensitive approach to the ‘neuro-typical’ approach.\nThe first argument for the ‘neuro-typical’ approach is an argument against the prevalence of sensory difficulties in autism. Developmental Psychologist Uta Frith writes, “a question mark hangs over the sensory phenomena, which are often reported but not currently required for diagnosis.” Psychologists Meena O’neil and Robert Jones found that much of the early sensory research and conclusions suffer “from serious methodical limitations.” Many of the early studies lacked appropriate control groups and depended on “the limitations of retrospective parent-report methodology typical of the area” for data collection. In regards to the first-hand accounts, O’neil and Jones also point out that “a number of dangers are inherent in uncritically accepting these accounts at face value and in any wider generalization to the autistic population as a whole.” Still, some researchers, like Janet Kern, insist that more current research demonstrates that sensory processing dysfunction persist globally throughout autism and affects “all the main modalities and mulitsensory processing” systems. Others like Geraldine Dawson and Renee Watling contend that “sensory processing abnormalities are not universal or specific to autism, the prevalence of such abnormalities in autism is relatively high.” If sensory processing dysfunction is not universal to autism then it might be hard to advocate for sensory sensitive environments if they hinder generalization skill development, which appears to be a more universal difficultly for individuals on the autism spectrum.\nIn reality, you rarely hear proponents of the ‘neuro-typical’ approach denying sensory processing difficulties. They simply believe sensory sensitive environments are more limiting due to poor generalization skills. ‘Neuro-typical’ proponents are correct about poor generalization skills in autism. Laura Klinger and Geraldine Dawson’s research, at the University of Washington Autism Center, demonstrates that children with autism struggle applying previously learned concepts in new situations. For instance, if an individual learns how to use the bathroom in one particular setting s/he may not generalize this skill set to other bathroom settings. This struggle exposes an intriguing difference between the wiring of a ‘typical’ brain and an autistic brain.\nThe majority of human cognitive systems possess a “built-in propensity to form coherence over as wide a range of stimuli as possible, and to generalize over as wide a range of contexts as possible.” Uta Frith explains that poor generalization skills may be the result of an autistic brain’s propensity to discriminate between the finest of detail. “Autistic children might not be prepared to see similarities at a more abstract level, and hence would fail to place stimuli into the same category, even when they only differ in the tiniest detail.” Undoubtedly, if individuals are unable to transfer skills they become imprisoned to the select few autism specific environments where they acquired the skills.\nWith generalization in mind, USA Architects’ concept for the 167,000 square-foot Morris-Union Jointure Commission’s (MUJC) Developmental Learning Center (DLC) “was to replicate the environments and social settings that students would normally travel “off-campus” to experience.” USA Architects designed the main corridor as a “replica of a typical American main street.” This “street” includes the Commerce Bank, Warrenville and Berkeley Hardware Store, Carmen’s Barber Shop, Ferratti’s Plant Nursery, Towne Deli Diner, Manufacturing lab, ShopRite, and a mock Apartment complete with living and dining room, kitchen, bedroom, laundry and game rooms. Dr. Kim Coleman, MUJC’s superintendent, believes that, “Simulating the real world in school should make the transition to the real world that much less intimidating.”\nNot everyone agrees with Dr. Kim Coleman for several reasons. First, proponents of the ‘neuro-typical’ approach must assume that current ‘neuro-typical’ environments represent the best environments in which people learn. If not, then they are awkwardly advocating for designed environments that fail both mainstream and autistic individuals. For example, we know that sunlight and certain types of exterior views improve overall health, increase productivity, and reduce sick days and attrition rates. Yet, how many schools, grocery stores, retail stores, banks, and apartments provide adequate daylight and beneficial exterior views? In parts of California, for example, “many of the classrooms built since the 1960’s have little daylighting. Windows are commonly built with “black glass” that allows a view out, but no useful daylight in. Numerous schools have been built with no windows at all.” What type of ‘neuro-typical’ environment should architects replicate in such a context, the environment ‘neuro-typical’ students have or should have? If the latter, then the argument that replication helps generalization doesn’t apply. If the former, then could it also be argued that if ‘neuro-typical’ students learn to read in the dark, then individuals with autism must learn to read in the dark?\nAdditionally, proponents of the sensory sensitive approach argue that individuals with autism need an environment that helps them acquire a skill before they can generalize it. In other words, individuals can only generalize skills that they possess. If individuals cannot acquire or experience extreme difficulty learning a skill in a ‘neuro-typical’ simulated setting then the ‘neuro-typical’ argument is a hard sale.\nA third argument against replicating ‘neuro-typical’ environments is that such settings do not improve generalization skills, but merely mask poor ones. Being able to generalize skills does not mean being able to only function in substandard ‘neuro-typical’ environments. It means being able to use a skill in good, mediocre, and bad environments. ‘Neuro-typical’ environments attempt to simulate the real world so the individuals with autism never actually have to generalize skills. USA Architects’ DLC is somewhat of an exception to this. Unlike Celebrate the Children, the DLC does not attempt to replicate a ‘neuro-typical’ school. By not having to replicate a typical school, USA Architects were able to offer individuals more opportunities to practice generalizing skills. For example, there are a variety of bathrooms from residential to public scale. This emphasizes generalization over replicating skills in copied environments.\nThe last argument against the ‘neuro-typical’ approach stems from a larger question about society’s responsibility towards individuals with disabilities. Should individuals with disabilities be required to habituate themselves to the ‘typical’ standard if they want access and acceptance into the larger society? For example, if the ‘ambulant-typical’ environment consists of mainly stairs should architects force individuals with limited mobility to learn to navigate the environment without ramps, lifts, or curb cuts? That’s a rhetorical question. Perhaps ‘neuro-typical’ environments should be more accommodating for individuals with autism. We demand it to be for individuals with limited mobility, why not autism?\nBoth, the sensory sensitive and ‘neuro-typical’ approach, have good reasons to believe the other limits individuals with autism. Until future studies can answer the following questions comparing the two we will be left squabbling over many logical arguments that might prove superfluous. Do sensory sensitive environments hinder generalization skills? Do ‘neuro-typical’ settings hamper skill acquisition? Do individuals with autism more quickly learn skills in sensory sensitive environments? Is the rate of acquisition statistically meaningful when compared to the possible difficulties of generalizing that skill? Does replicating the ‘neuro-typical’ environment improve generalization skills? Is it statistically meaningful when compared to the possible difficulties of acquiring that skill? Do individuals exhibit differences in quality of life between the two environments, i.e. rates of depression, stress levels and overall health? Perhaps the answers to these questions will bridge the divide between the two theories, and the more appropriate approach will be more of a mixture of the two than a triumph of one over the other.\nIf you enjoyed this article check out more by Christopher N.

He has conducted post-occupancy evaluations of autism schools, homes and clinics in Denmark, England, and the US. Christopher also spent 9-months working direct-care at Bittersweet Farms, a residential and vocational facility for adults with autism. He currently runs Autism Design Consultants, where you can find more information about autism design.\nCombining these factors with the current difficulty of reliably finding sensory dysfunction symptoms in learning disabled children, O’Neil and Jones believe that we still know very little about the prevalence of sensory processing issues along autism spectrum, its degree of severity, and its course over time.

I am unaware if this is typical within the larger community context of the DLC. Therefore I am unable to comment on which approach the DLC represents in regards to lighting; providing what ‘neuro-typical’ should have or do have. If abundant natural lighting is typical of the DLC’s context then it is a win win for the ‘neuro-typical’ approach in this situation.

They can also be utilized as part of the learning or treatment experience or for leisure and relaxation.”\nTypically, a MSE is a dedicated space or room that is designed to stimulate the senses through a controlled environment enhanced with individualized sensory equipment. Some of the goals and benefits of MSE’s include promoting relaxation and a feeling of well-being, focus and attention, understanding of cause/effect and social interaction skills and are often a perfect milieu for those on the autism spectrum. With their adjustable sensory components combining touch, vibration and movement with sight and sound, they offer something for all levels and sensory preferences.\nComponents in a sensory room can vary widely and usually involve selection based on the assessment of the special needs or general population that will be utilizing the space. A collaboration between educators, parents, equipment vendors and other related specialists are helpful when planning an MSE. Here are just a few of the options available that may work well for individuals with autism:\nThe clear plastic water column produces a steady stream of small bubbles which coordinate with changing light colors within the tube. With an interactive Bubble Tube, the user presses a switch or panel which allow the tube to change color and/or speed of vibration of the bubbles so can help promote cause/effect, turn taking and simple visual perception skills. In addition to the light, the hum and vibration of the tube are also often a source of attention and appeal.\nFor an update on a traditional bubble tube, consider the Calming Bubble Wall as a space saver and/or if there are behavior issues that would preclude using a standard tube.\nThese are light sources made of fiber optic strands in a variety of options including hanging curtains, wall or floor carpets, vertical sprays or draped strands over a sitting piece such as a bean bag cushion. In a semi-darkened room, Fiber Optics produce a soft glow that can promote visual focus and tracking. When used in strands (usually grouped in sets of 100 or more) and draped across the body in a seat or in a swing, the weight of the combined strands provides deep touch pressure input on the body which may help promote the relaxation/calming response.\nThese devices are a fun method to project colorful images onto walls, ceilings, floors or a soft space such as a draped parachute. Themed concepts such as shapes, planets, a deep sea environment or even customized pictures are displayed on a projector disc or wheel which gently rotates producing a clear slow moving image across the desired surface. In a semi- darkened room, these oversized rotating images are great for calming, attending and visual focus and tracking.\nThese lounging pieces such as a beanbag, recliner, wedge, pillow or mats have built in speakers which allow the user to “feel” the music through vibration. Classical, drumming and/or even some contemporary new age composers are often good music choices to use with this equipment.\nWhen considering a MSE keep in mind your space. Obstructions such as excess light from windows, wall barriers such as closet doors, cabinets/shelving and/or ventilation (side hvac units etc.) should be covered, moved or minimized as feasible. Additional electrical outlets may need to be installed and lighting should be changed to a rheostat control to allow gradual dimming. Floor and/or wall padding may be needed for comfort and acoustics. If space or budget is limited a Sensory Calming Cocoon or a Portable Sensory Corner may be good options.
