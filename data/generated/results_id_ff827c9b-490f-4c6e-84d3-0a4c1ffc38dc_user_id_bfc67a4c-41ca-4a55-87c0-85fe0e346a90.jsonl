It explores how people view themselves, their future, their life, and their general trust in others.\nSuitable for all occupational levels; for selection and development, vocational guidance, counselling and research.\nDutch, Italian, UK English, US English\nPositive thought, or positivity, can be described as a basic general tendency to approach everyday life with hope and trust. It has also been shown to be a successful predictor of professional success. Positivity corresponds to a pervasive tendency in how people look at reality, which can have a profound effect on the way in which they assign significance and value to their existence in the world.\nThe Positivity Test assesses positivity by presenting a series of statements reflecting three positive constructs:\nEach statement is rated on a scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree, thus providing an insight into the individual's overall positivity. In definitive terms, self-esteem, optimism and life satisfaction are 'global evaluations' that have a pervasive influence on individual emotions, cognition and actions. All three constructs have also demonstrated correlations with a consistent number of indicators of good psychological adjustment or success in life and at work.\nThe Positivity Test is a useful tool for businesses, as evidence links positivity to job performance. It can also be used by clinical psychologists as a predictor for mood changes or disorders such as depression. Cross-cultural studies have shown that it is equally appropriate for people from different cultural backgrounds.\nThe test has two scales of measurement.\nIn addition, two validity scales improve the reliability of results by measuring heroic self-perception and moralistic self-perception, self-presentation strategies (or biases) that are well known in the field of social psychology.\nThe Positivity Test reports describe in detail how the test taker performed.

{"question":"What are the key differences between Sheldon's original coin grading scale from 1949 and the traditional Middle Ages grading system?","answer":"In the Middle Ages, coin grading used a simple three-tier scale: Poor, Fair and Good, which was sufficient for ancient coins. In contrast, Sheldon's scale, introduced in 1949, was a sophisticated 70-point system that served as a way to convert condition-to-value for coins. The Sheldon scale was specifically designed so that a VF-20 coin would be worth one-third the price of an MS-60 coin, allowing for simplified price calculations. This numerical system became the de facto standard and was later adopted by the American Numismatic Association as their official grading standard.","context":["why the AU designation if it isn't almost uncirculated\nDo you want the short answer, or the long answer?\nHere's the long answer. Scroll down to the bottom of the post for the short answer.\nOnce upon a time, back in the late Middle Ages, coins were graded much the same everywhere, and on a very simple scale: Poor, Fair and Good. Since the only coins being collected back then were ancients, this scale was sufficient, and the words meant pretty much what they mean in everyday conversation: a coin in Good condition was actually pretty good, given that it had been dug up after being buried for a thousand years.\nAs coin collecting became more popular and modern coins began to be collected, additional grades beyond \"Good\" had to be invented, especially with the introduction of modern machinery capable of creating coins of very high quality (just like new words to describe the purity of olive oil had to be invented as oil refining and filtering technologies advanced). This we acquired Fine, Very Fine and, early in the 20th century, Extremely Fine. Then there was Uncirculated, to describe a coin in mint-fresh condition. \"AU\" or \"aUnc\" is a relatively modern invention.\nUp until at least the mid-20th century, condition was not a particularly significant factor in assigning a value to a coin; rarity was much more important. The Sheldon scale was invented in 1949 as a simplified way to convert condition-to-value for a given coin: a VF-20 coin was worth one-third the price of an MS-60 coin, no matter what the coin actually was. This kept the Sheldon catalogue relatively uncluttered, since only one price was required to be listed for each type and variety: the theoretical \"basal-state\" (BS-1) price. Prices for higher grades could be calculated just by multiplying the BS price by the Sheldon number for the grade.\nTime marched on, and the demand for coins in the \"best possible grade\" grew. Prices for Unc coins escalated far beyond the usefulness of the Sheldon scale to calculate value. Thus, we have the complicated system of grading, with multiple levels, adjectives, and words that seem to mean the opposite of their normal everyday sense - compared to a coin in aUnc condition, a coin in Good condition is actually rather awful.\nFrom now we can more clearly see a curious effect: \"grade creep\", also known as \"gradeflation\" - which is the main reason why the Americans have a much slacker grading standard than ours. The definitions of what qualifies a coin as \"Good\" or \"Very Fine\" has changed over time, and have gotten worse. As I said, originally a coin in Good was in pretty good nick.\nGradeflation happens at different rates in different places; it is faster where there has a high market demand for high-grade coins for a longer period. If the supply isn't meeting the demand, the grading standards are slackened slightly, to allow for increasing numbers of coins to reach the threshold for each grade. It's an evolutionary (or, more precisely, a devolutionary) process; tiny changes made over a long time period. Gradeflation has been more rampant in America than it has here in Australia, because of the higher collector demand generally which has meant that high-grade coins have been in demand there for longer.\nDon't think the Australian standard of grading has been immune to gradeflation, either. Today, the British grading standard is even tougher than ours; an American AU-55 ought to make an Australian EF, but would only rate a British gVF. But back when we were part of the British Empire, our grading standards were the same. And if you want to see how far our grading standards have slipped since the \"good old days\", grab a copy of an old grading guide from the 1960s. The book \"Collecting Australian Coins\" by Tom Hanley and Bill James came out in 1966, just after decimalization. Listen to these lines from the grading guide for the reverse of George V silver coinage, contained therein (emphasis mine):\nUncirculated: This would be a proof coin if the field showed more finish. The surface retains a mint-fresh lustre, detail of the heads of the kangaroo and emu are sharp, and the feathers on the emu's back show no trace of wear under the glass. Magnification discovers no blemishes such as scratches or nicks. Only the cream of coins obtained from the banks in the original mint rolls are in this condition.\nExtremely Fine: This is the condition in which all but a few of the roll coins are found. These coins show the marks, usually superficial scratches of the chutes and conveyors along which they travelled during minting processes. A good deal of their mint lustre remains and the glass should show no more than the slightest trace of wear on the uppermost feathers on the emu's back.\nOnly a tiny fraction of coins from mint rolls\nqualify as Uncirculated? Mint bag marks only visible under magnification\ncount as \"wear\"? Now that's a harsh standard, harsher even than the current British standard. Yet it's the standard many of our old-time collectors (and dealers) grew up with, and it's the standard the price guides from the 1960s would have used.\nSo, the short answer: America has had more gradeflation than us.\nDon't say \"infinitely\" when you mean \"very\"; otherwise, you'll have no word left when you want to talk about something really infinite. - C. S. Lewis","ANACS was created in 1970 and has been the standard grading system. Its success led to the ANA’s becoming more profitable than ever. In addition, the private sector began providing grading services and became more liberal in granting grades. This situation led to a debate about whether or not the ANA should remain a nonprofit organization. Today, the ANA grading scale is a widely accepted standard in coin grading.\nSheldon Coin Grading Scale\nThe Sheldon Coin Grading Scale is a 70-point grading system used in numismatics to determine the quality of coins. William Herbert Sheldon created the Sheldon coin grading system. The American Numismatic Association based its official grading standards on the Sheldon coin grading scale. It was developed by William Herbert Sheldon and has since been used to grade coins for collectors worldwide.\nThe Sheldon Scale is the de facto standard of coin grading and provides valuable information for coin owners. The Sheldon scale is based on a 70-point system used by most coin grading services. Coin grading services may differ slightly, and sometimes employees will grade coins differently. While comparing coins graded by different companies can be difficult, it is essential to remember that Sheldon grading standards are based on the same standards.\nSheldon’s Coin Grading Scale includes 70 points and is derived from an original scale developed in 1949. It was first presented in Dr. William Herbert Sheldon’s book, Early American Cents. It was later revised in the 1970s to accommodate broader coins. In addition to the Sheldon Coin Grading Scale numbers, the coin’s condition is also determined by its Sheldon grade. The better the condition of a coin, the higher its grade. TPG has modified the Sheldon Coin Grading Scale and includes specific criteria for each level.\nUncirculated coins on the ANA grading scale\nCirculated coins are very similar to uncirculated coins, but they may exhibit small amounts of wear and still display their original luster. Uncirculated coins fall into the AU50 to AU58 grade on the ANA grading scale. There are many different types of uncirculated coins. Coins with these grades will have an average value of $100, but they can go up to $2,000 if they are genuinely uncirculated.\nWhile the ANA’s grading system has changed over time, the basic guidelines remain the same. Uncirculated coins on the ANA grading scale are rated from MS-60 to MS-70. The higher the grade, the better the coin is. As a result, uncirculated coins generally show a greater appreciation rate than their circulated counterparts. However, while some collectors prefer higher-grade coins, many still prefer lower-graded ones.\nBefore purchasing coins, consult the Official American Numismatic Association’s grading standards. This book includes descriptions of the different uncirculated grades and lists of typical coin wear. ANA grading standards are included with each series of United States coins. While this publication is an excellent introduction to coin grading, it’s not a comprehensive reference. Therefore, before purchasing a coin, you should view it in the marketplace to get a more accurate idea of its condition.\nOther coin grading systems\nBefore the ANA grading scale was introduced, coins were sorted into two categories, good and bad. Numismatists found that many coins landed in between these two categories. The grading system was developed to describe the current condition of precious metal coins. It is used to grade coins in the U.S. Mint. Other coin grading systems include the Sheldon Scale, an acronym for the numerical method used by the Professional Coin Grading Service.\nNGC was founded in 1987 and is the largest coin grading organization by volume. As of May 2010, it had certified over 30 million coins. The organization was also named the official coin grading service of the American Numismatic Association and Professional Numismatists Guild in 1995. NGC also has several satellite offices throughout the world. The service grades coins from all over the world, although it does not grade modified coins. To submit a coin for certification, you must be a member of the NGC.\nOther coin grading systems other than the ANS are not as standardized as the ANA grading scale. The purpose of coin grading is to determine the coin’s market value. The value of a coin is determined by several factors, including its strike, the level of preservation, and the amount of wear or damage. However, most beginning collectors focus on the condition of lettering and designs, which are more visible than others."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7b703948-6968-4668-84be-df297eb8f677>","<urn:uuid:ee2e5859-faed-4c86-949b-a7b66b5ad955>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do new technological platforms support both artistic expression and mental wellness practices?","answer":"In terms of artistic expression, platforms like YouTube's 360° player and dedicated mobile apps enable innovative ways to present music, as demonstrated by Ethiocolor's interactive music video that allows viewers to experience performances in an immersive way. Meanwhile, technological advancement has also enabled deeper understanding of mental wellness practices through brain scanning and blood sampling, which help validate the benefits of contemplative meditation, showing how it enhances learning ability, balances emotions, and induces progressive changes in brain structure and function. Both applications of technology serve to make their respective experiences more accessible and better understood by wider audiences.","context":["Ethiocolor's 360° Music Video Revolution In Addis Ababa\nStocktown Films shares a 360 degree music video and app for the Addis Ababa-based band Ethiocolor.\nAll images courtesy of Stocktown Films\nEthiocolor is an all acoustic group, known both for their performances on the road and as the house band for one of Addis Ababa's most important cultural hubs, Fendika. With musicians playing together that span three generations, Ethiocolor exemplifies what it is to honor traditions while remaining innovative, and carrying a culture into the future. The closest you can get to the electric energy of spending an evening at Fendika is spending an hour with Ethiocolor's beautiful self-titled debut LP, released on Selam Sounds.\nI met Teddy Goitom of Stocktown Films at The New School's Afrofuturism Conference in New York City last month. We were talking about Ethiopian music and he casually mentions that he recently worked on a music video for the Ethiocolor. I exclaim, \"That's one of my favorite groups!\" and he passes me his phone as the video starts playing. I watch for a few seconds and he says \"Now, move the phone.\" I do, and the image moves, as if I was personally standing on this rooftop in Addis holding a camera phone in the center of all these musicians. Before Teddy knew it I had passed his phone around to all my friends at the conference, and I didn't know it, but I was viewing the video through a beta version of Ethiocolor's app, being launched today on Google Play alongside their 360° video for the song \"Mali Malonayie.\"\nI had a chance to interview one of Teddy's creative partners, Senay Berhe of Stocktown Films, for the launch. We spoke about the video, Afripedia, and how what very well may be Africa's first 360° music video was filmed with just one camera.\nDownload the Ethiocolor 360° app for Android via Google Play. An iPhone version of the app is coming soon.\n*YouTube's 360° interactive function is only available on smartphones & Chrome browsers for the moment\nGabriel Teodros for Okayafrica: Tell us a bit about the process. Where and how was the video filmed? How important was it for you to work with Ethiocolor on this project?\nSenay Berhe for Stocktown Films: The Ethiocolor 360°music video was shot during a half day in January 2015. We filmed it on the roof of the national theatre in Addis Ababa with a GoPro camera. We had seen Ethiocolor perform live earlier both in Stockholm and Addis Ababa at Selam's annual music festival. We were struck by their performance on stage and approached them during our visit in Addis and presented the 360° idea. Ethiocolor and their record label Selam Sounds loved the idea and we decided to shoot it in just a couple of days. The 360° technology makes it possible to experience Ethiocolor and their performance in a new way. The viewer comes closer, almost as they were there in Addis to experience Ethiocolor's great live act.\nOkayafrica: Were there any challenges in the process, and how did you get through them?\nBerhe: One of the challenges during the shoot was that we only had one GoPro camera. It made the shoot a little more difficult and time consuming. We had to mark out positions for all the band members and keep track of all the positions to be able to stitch the seven different takes together for the final composition. Although, the biggest challenge has been how to present the video in the best possibly way. We wanted to make it as an experience for your phone, something that you can watch and share with your friends, but also as an online experience. The lack of budget meant it took some time to find the right partners. Eventually we hooked up with Earth People, a bunch of talented developers that helped us out with the Ethiocolor 360° app. Luckily for us YouTube released their 360° player on Chrome earlier this year where we could release the online experience.\nOkayafrica: Both with Afripedia and this latest video for Ethiocolor, your approach to filmmaking seems very innovative, combining new technology and interactive ways of storytelling with music from all around the continent. How and why did you start bringing these pieces together?\nBerhe: With Stocktown Films, we want to tell stories about passionate people who love to do what they do and our focus especially with the Afripedia documentary series is to highlight African creatives that usually doesn't get the attention we feel they deserve. New technology makes it possible for us to share the stories in new ways, make it more accessible and reach out to a wider audience.\nOkayafrica: It feels like the concept of a 360° video is just one baby step away from virtual reality. Do you feel like your film work will continue to move in that direction?\nBerhe: Finding new stories and storytelling will always be our primary focus. In which format it will be presented will always come secondary. But it's always challenging and fun to try new tools. It creates new possibilities. That is something we are open for and have had in the back of our heads since we started.\nOkayafrica: Let us know if there's any projects you all are working on that we should be looking out for?\nBerhe: Stocktown Films wants to create the best online platform to highlight African creatives from all over the world.

Is there another state of consciousness that enhances our learning ability, balances our emotions, and repairs our body? If sleep is work, how about a career change?\nContemplation and Meditation\nContemplation; from the Latin contemplari, “to observe,” and meditation; from meditari, “to reflect” – together, they inform a mental practice which is distinct from ordinary thinking but is not exclusive from it. Contemplation and meditation are the meta-training for the mind: I wouldn’t meditate on a calculus problem but meditation, like sleep, makes learning and calculus an easier quest.\nBy endeavor, diligence, discipline, and self-mastery, let the wise man make (of himself) an island that no flood can overwhelm\n(Dhammapada, ‘sayings of the Buddha,’ Verse 25)\nContemplation and meditation—let’s just say, contempla-meditation—is taught in some form in every religion as a foundational practice for well-being. Brain scans and blood samples can never show the ineffable, inner experience of contempla-meditation, but we do have some grasp on how contempla-meditation transforms the mind. Contempla-meditation, like sleep, can take place in stages; in fact, being meta-training, these contempla-meditative stages correspond with certain cognitive modes:While I write this article, I am in “effortful processing” mode. I sustain my attention on the ultimate objective of synthesizing research on contempla-meditation, and I adjust my approach (and expectations) as I progress. Effortful processing can be trained by “controlled focus,” a contempla-meditation stage wherein the practitioner ruminates upon a selection of information. Catholicism teaches lectio divina, “sacred reading,” where the practitioner reads a passage of Scripture slowly and thoroughly and then hypothesizes its meaning by connecting the passage to other texts, by imagining one’s self in the scene described, by searching for subtext, and so on. Buddhism encourages similar practices, as in the famous lotus flower sermon: Gautama pulled a lotus up by its roots from a pond and held it aloft. His students gazed on the flower until one, Mahakasyapa, smiled—having understood the message of the lotus. Controlled focus elicits the same fast brain waves, gamma and beta (13-50 Hz), which signify effortful processing.\nRecall and reorganization of information without explicit problem-solving, or, planning, can be trained by open monitoring, where the practitioner permits their attention to wander around their sensory environment, their memories, or any experience at all. The practitioner engages with none of those thoughts. Lectio divina, Hindu Vedanta, Daoist Qigong, Zen Buddhism—most traditions encourage that controlled focus gives way to open monitoring.\nOpen monitoring, like planning, elicits theta brain waves (4-7 Hz), especially from the prefrontal cortex.\nWhen it seems that the mind ceases even to wander, the practitioner enters “self-transcendence.” The brain is still active: powerful alpha waves (8-12 Hz) surge throughout the default mode network (DMN). In waking life, large-amplitude alpha waves (10-12 Hz) suppress task-irrelevant processing and create an index or ‘ready’ state so that the brain can enter the other cognitive modes, and smaller alpha waves (8-10 Hz) signify mental imagery—usually, of the external world. In contempla-meditation, the focus shifts inward—effectively, the mind maps itself. DMN regions govern autobiographical reflection, including this mind-mapping, as well as theory of mind—our concept of how others think. Mental imagery filtered through this biographical-autobiographical scheme may explain the profound yet consistent perceptions of cosmic unity and interconnectedness which characterize self-transcendence.\nConsistent discipline in contempla-meditation induces progressive systemic changes in the form and function of the brain. A few months of practice grow the hippocampus, the medial prefrontal cortex, and the caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia. Working memory and attentional capacity increase, and anxiety and fatigue markedly decrease when handling new tasks. Old memories are also sent back to the hippocampus and reconsolidated just as in sleep with help from the caudate nucleus, working from the striatum of the basal ganglia. The caudate nucleus flexibly assesses goal-directed behavior and recommends new plans to the executive regions of the brain—especially those which govern problem-solving, verbal reasoning, empathy, and sociability. Bolstering these three structures also lays the groundwork for the long-term impact of contempla-meditation.\nOver months to years, continued practice realigns the brain with the priorities set by the caudate nucleus. Additional growth occurs in brain regions governing metacognition and self-regulation, such as the left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. Growth of the somatosensory cortices improves tactile acuity; coupled with improved processing in the insula, practitioners are able to consciously separate the emotional and sensory qualities of pain. Temporal lobe growth enhances visual imagery; with somatosensory improvements, this may augment spatial reasoning. So, whether you are a scholar, a student athlete, or a creative type—or all three—contempla-meditation can benefit you.\nThe hippocampus remains critical for the reassessment of old behaviors, and growth of the hippocampus, especially in glucocorticoid receptor density, further promotes emotional resilience and adaptability.\nStructural decreases are really only seen in specific nodes of the default mode network which are redundant in function to other nodes which increase in thickness. For example, the posterior cingulate cortex decreases, while the medial prefrontal cortex increases; both drive autobiographical recall and future planning, especially in regard to other people. Default mode network activity imbalanced in either direction results in mental dysfunction: hyperconnectivity correlates with depressive rumination, while hypoconnectivity correlates with avoidant patterns of attachment and autism.\nSo, all this sounds exciting—but will we have time for it? Can contempla-meditation replace the need for sleep?\nPartly. Total sleep deprivation will hurt contempla-meditation as much as it would hurt any form of learning, but up to three hours of sleep can be replaced by an equal time in contempla-meditation by experienced practitioners with no sacrifice in vigilance the next day. It’s equivalent to conventional sleep therapies like paradoxical intention and scheduled exercise. See, the brain activity elicited during contempla-meditation resembles the brain during sleep:\nWaking and dreaming (REM, rapid eye movement)) brain activity generate beta and gamma waves like in controlled focus, and intermediate NREM (memory consolidation) generates theta waves like in open monitoring. In fact, the augmented activity entrained during contempla-meditation redounds directly to the sleeping brain—and reappears.\nUsing an electroencephalographic map of the scalp, we can see differences between experienced meditators and novices emerge around the anterolateral regions of the cerebral cortex. The activity sites are consistent with the left rostrolateral and medial prefrontal cortices, the primary somatosensory cortex, and the middle temporal gyrus (which subsumes the hippocampus)—some of the cortical structures which develop most with long-term contempla-meditative practice. There could be a reciprocal relationship here: replicating the waking waves during sleep increases efficiency, and the efficient signaling during sleep assists the cortical growth.\nContempla-meditation cannot replace the deep delta-wave sleep, during which the body and brain repair themselves and clear out metabolic waste—but it’s clear that sleep and contempla-meditation are natural partners in creating a healthy, effective mind.\nWake up, go about the day, sleep, repeat—no more. Contempla-meditation serves as a perfect transition between waking and resting, adding a sense of calm and thoughtfulness to the day—and to ourselves!\nBasso, J., McHale, A., Ende, V., Oberlin, D., & Suzuki, W.

{"question":"How do math calculation challenges support learning, and what's the role of explicit modeling in teaching math skills? 🤔","answer":"Math calculation challenges support learning by reinforcing practical skills through real-life applications like calculating school days, costs, and savings. These activities can lead to other calculation challenges and provide powerful support for children's learning. Meanwhile, explicit modeling serves a dual purpose: it provides students with a clear, accurate, multi-sensory model of math concepts, and it gives them a process for becoming independent learners. Teachers act as a 'bridge of learning' by breaking down concepts into learnable parts, using multi-sensory techniques, and providing both examples and non-examples while maintaining student engagement through questions and understanding checks.","context":["New Year's Math\nNow that your child is in fourth grade, she’s usually come pretty far in some fundamental math. She should know her addition and subtraction facts down cold; and by the middle of fourth grade, she should feel pretty solid in multiplication and division, too. Want a fun way to reinforce those skills and their real-life, practical relevance? Try messing around with our “New Year Calculation Challenge.”\nWhat You Need:\n- New Year Calculation Challenge Questions (see below)\n- Pencil, pen, and colored markers\n- Calendar of the upcoming year\n- Clean sheet of card stock for Calculation Challenge Results\n- No calculators, please!\nWhat You Do:\n- Start with a calendar of the full year ahead, along with a pencil and some scratch paper for calculations. Then pull out a sheet of card stock for Calculation Challenge Results. Encourage your child to decorate the margins, too—while other kids may find that some of their calculations overlap, each one will be unique.\n- Now use the calendar to calculate the following New Year Math. (Psst: parents, here’s a cheat sheet italics are included in case your child gets fuzzy on the required math operations).\n- From today until the last day of the school year, how many school days are left? (addition)\n- How many days until the first day of spring break? (addition)\n- Between January 1 and July 1, what is the average length of each month? (addition and division).\n- Your birthday is __________________________. If you start counting today, how many days before your birthday? (addition). Now calculate: how many full weeks until then, with how many days left over? (division).\n- If Halloween is October 31, and you started counting today, how many days until then? (addition) Now calculate: how many full weeks until then, with how many days left over? (division)\n- If songs on iTunes cost 99 cents each, and you DON’T buy one per week for every week before your birthday, how much money will you have saved? (multiplication with decimals/money).\n- Suppose a favorite adult in your life happens to buy Starbuck’s coffee for $2.65 a cup, 4 times a week. Suppose, starting today, that this person only buys coffee two times a week, every week until your birthday. How much money will this person save? (addition, subtraction, multiplication).\n- Suppose your parent uses 1/2 gallon of gas driving you to school and back every day, five days a week, and your car’s tank holds 14 gallons. To save the environment, you and your parents decide to bike or walk every day instead. How many days of school would you need to save a whole tank of gas? (multiplication with fractions) Extra challenge: by biking or walking to school, how many tanks of gas could you save between now and the last day of school?\n- Baseball season’s opening game will be ________________________ (date) this year. If you save 50 cents in allowance starting this week, how much money will you have for baseball tickets and hotdogs by the opening day? (multiplication)\nOnce launched, you may find that this activity leads to lots of other calculation challenges—average weather temperatures, for example, or cost of junk food. Let your math imagination soar—it’s all powerful support for your child’s learning! Just be prepared for a twist and turn now and then. If you’re the adult who loves Starbuck’s, you might want to have some good arguments to counter your fourth grade accountant once she gets rolling!","Explicitly Model Mathematics Concepts/Skills & Problem Solving Strategies\nWhat is the purpose of Explicitly Modeling Mathematics Concepts/Skills and Problem Solving Strategies?\nThe purpose of explicitly modeling mathematics concepts/skills and problem solving strategies is twofold. First, explicit modeling of a target mathematics concept/skill provides students a clear and accessible format for initially acquiring an understanding of the mathematics concept/skill. Explicit modeling by you provides students with a clear, accurate, multi-sensory model of the skill or concept. Students must first be able to access the attributes of a concept/skill before they can be expected to understand it and be able to use it in meaningful ways. Explicit teacher modeling does just that. Second, by explicitly modeling effective strategies for approaching particular problem solving situations, you provide students a process for becoming independent learners and problem solvers. While peers can sometimes be effective models for students, students with special needs require a well qualified teacher to provide such modeling, at least in the initial phases of instruction.\nWhat is Explicit Modeling?\nExplicit modeling involves well-prepared teachers employing a variety of instructional techniques to illuminate the key attributes of any given mathematics concept/skill. In a sense, you serve as a \"bridge of learning\" for your student, an accessible bridge between the student and the particular mathematics concept/skill they are learning:\nThe level of teacher support you provide your students depends on how much of a learning bridge they need. In particular, students with learning problems need a well-established learning bridge (teacher model). They learn most effectively when their teacher provides clear and multi-sensory models of a mathematics concept/skill during math instruction.\nWhat are some important considerations when implementing Explicit Modeling?\nThe teacher purposefully sets the stage for understanding by identifying what students will learn (visually and auditorily), providing opportunities for students to link what they already know (e.g. prerequisite concepts/skills they have already mastered, prior real-life experiences they have had, areas of interest based on your students' age, culture, ethnicity, etc.), and discussing with students how what they are going to learn has relevance/meaning for their immediate lives.\n- Teacher both describes and models the math skill/concept.\n- Teacher breaks math concept/skill into learnable parts/steps. Think about the concept/skill and break it down into 3-4 features or parts.\n- Teacher clearly describes features of the math concept or steps in performing math skill using visual examples.\n- Teacher describes/models using multi-sensory techniques. Use as many \"input\" pathways as possible for any given concept/skill including auditory, visual, tactile, and kinesthetic means. For example, when modeling how to compare values of different fractions to determine \"greater than,\" you might verbalize each step of the process for comparing fractions while pointing to each step written on chart paper (auditory and visual), represent each fraction using fraction circle pieces, running your finger around the perimeter of each piece, laying one fraction piece over the other one and running your finger along the space not covered up by the fraction of lesser value/area; \"thinking aloud\" by saying your thoughts aloud as you examine each fraction piece (visual, kinesthetic, auditory), verbalizing your answer and why you determined why one fraction was greater than the other, and having students run their fingers along the same fraction pieces and uncovered space (auditory, visual, tactile, kinesthetic).\n- Teacher provides both examples and non-examples of the mathematics concept/skill. For example, in the above example, you might compare two different fractions using same process but place the fraction of greater value/area on top of the fraction of lesser value/area. Then prompt student thinking of why this is not an example of \"greater than.\"\n- Explicitly cue students to essential attributes of the mathematics concept/skill you model. For example, when associating the written fraction to the fraction pieces and their respective values, color code the numerator and denominator in ways that represent the meaning of the fraction pieces they use. Cue students to the color-coding and what each color represents. Then demonstrate how each written fraction relates to the \"whole' circle:\n2/4 = 2 of four equal pieces\n- Teacher engages students in learning through demonstrating enthusiasm, through maintaining a lively pace, through periodically questioning students, and through checking for student understanding. Explicit modeling is not meant to be a passive learning experience for students. On the contrary, it is critical to involve students as you model.\n- Scaffold your direction as students begin to demonstrate understanding through questions you ask.\n- After modeling several examples and non-examples, begin to have your students demonstrate a few steps of the process.\n- As students demonstrate greater understanding, ask them to complete more and more of the process.\n- When students demonstrate complete understanding, have various students \"teach\" you by modeling the entire process.\n- Play a game where you and your students try to \"catch\" each other making a mistake or leaving out a step in the process.\nHow do I implement Explicit Modeling?\n- Select the appropriate level of understanding to model the concept/skill or problem solving strategy (concrete, representational, abstract).\n- Ensure that your students have the prerequisite skills to perform the skill or use the problem solving strategy.\n- Break down the concept/skill or problem solving strategy into logical and learnable parts (Ask yourself, \"What do I do and what do I think as I perform the skill?\"). The strategies you can link to from this site are already broken down into steps.\n- Provide a meaningful context for the concept/skill or problem solving strategy (e.g. word or story problem suited to the age and interests of your students. Invite parents/family members of your students or members of the community who work in an area that can be meaningfully applied to the concept/skill or strategy and ask them to show how they use the concept/skill/strategy in their work.\n- Provide visual, auditory, kinesthetic (movement), and tactile means for illustrating important aspects of the concept/skill (e.g. visually display word problem and equation, orally cue students by varying vocal intonations, point, circle, highlight computation signs or important information in story problems).\n- \"Think aloud\" as you illustrate each feature or step of the concept/skill/strategy (e.g. say aloud what you are thinking as you problem-solve so students can better \"visualize\" the metacognitive aspects of understanding or doing the concept/skill/strategy).\n- Link each step of the problem solving process (e.g. restate what you did in the previous step, what you are going to do in the next step, and why the next step is important to the previous step).\n- Periodically check student understanding with questions, remodeling steps when there is confusion.\n- Maintain a lively pace while being conscious of student information processing difficulties (e.g. need additional time to process questions).\n- Model a concept/skill at least three times.\nHow does Explicitly Modeling Mathematics Concepts/Skills and Problem Solving Strategies help students who have learning problems?\n- Teacher as model makes the concept/skill clear and learnable.\n- High level of teacher support and direction enables student to make meaningful cognitive connections.\n- Provides students who have attention problems, processing problems, memory retrieval problems, and metacognitive difficulties an accessible \"learning map\" to the concept/skill/strategy.\n- Links between parts/steps are directly made, making confusion and misunderstanding less likely.\n- Multi-sensory cueing provides students multiple modes to process and thereby learn information.\n- Teaching students effective problem solving strategies provides them a means for solving problems independently and assists them to develop their metacognitive awareness.\nWhat Mathematics Problem Solving Strategies can I teach my students?\nMathematics problem solving strategies that have research support or that have been field tested with students can be accessed by clicking on the link below.

{"question":"Could you compare the reproductive characteristics of invasive Didymo algae and Quagga mussels? I'm particularly interested in understanding how these two species spread in water systems.","answer":"While both are invasive species that can spread through water systems, they have different reproductive characteristics. Didymo is a freshwater diatom that forms stalks that attach to rocks, and while the algae eventually die and break off, these stalks can persist and impact stream habitats for weeks or months. For Quagga mussels, they have very high reproductive rates - a female can release up to 40,000 eggs in a season. Quagga mussels can reach sexual maturity when females reach about 10mm shell length (usually in first 12-18 months) and can even spawn in the same year they were born. Their veligers (free-swimming larvae) are waterborne for 2-3 weeks, during which they can travel many miles with currents to colonize new sites.","context":["Didymo (Rock Snot) Fact Sheet\nThe invasive algae known as Didymo has been found in the Elk River in the Webster Springs area following reports from anglers that heavy algal mats were seen in the Elk River. DNR staff collected samples from three locations near Webster Springs. The samples were sent to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources for confirmation. All three samples contained Didymo.\nDidymo is a common name for Didymosphenia geminata, a freshwater diatom species that can form extensive mats on stream beds. The thick mats can smother native algae and aquatic insects, and make fishing very difficult. These thick mats appear slimy, but feel more like cotton or wool fabric. The algal mats are also called “rock snot” and can be white, yellow or brown in color. The algae form stalks that attach to rocks. While the algae eventually die and break off, the stalks persist and may impact stream habitats and aquatic organisms for weeks or months.\nDidymo is native to the northern latitudes of North America, Europe and Asia. Its range has expanded and it now can be found in rivers in the western United States and more recently in Maryland, New York, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Vermont. It has also been found in three western Virginia rivers (Jackson, Pound and Smith).\nRecreational users of West Virginia’s aquatic resources have the potential to spread aquatic invasive species and fish and wildlife pathogens from stream to stream and watershed to watershed. Responsible stewards of our state waters take precautions to minimize the spread of these threats. Follow these ‘Best Practices’ and Disinfection Procedures to minimize the spread of aquatic invasive species, such as Didymo, and fish and wildlife pathogens. This approach is modeled after New Zealand’s widely-used ‘Check, Clean, Dry’ strategy.\nBEST PRACTICES for minimizing the spread of Didymo, other aquatic invasive species, and fish and wildlife pathogens:\n- Anglers – Consider the use of easily disinfected wading gear. For example, rubber-soled wading boots with cleats are easier to disinfect quickly than felt-soled boots.\n- All Users – Disinfect your gear and boat before traveling between different bodies of water or watersheds (see below).\n- All Users – If you move around to fish, boat, play or work, construct and use a simple, portable disinfection kit.\n- All Users - Visually inspect your boat, gear and equipment before entering and leaving the water. Remove all plants, plant fragments, animals, mud or other debris and discard in the trash.\n- Anglers – When practical, fish in a downstream direction. This doesn’t mean you can’t wade upstream a bit to fish that nice run upstream – think on a watershed scale. By fishing at the mouth of a large river in the morning, then going to the headwaters in the afternoon without disinfecting your gear, you’ve potentially spread Didymo upstream to the whole stream, which may not have been previously infected. Most algae and aquatic invasives/pathogens can’t swim upstream.\n- Anglers, Guides, Outfitters – Designate waders/boots/canoes/tubes for different watersheds or have multiple sets available for same-day travel, when needed.\n- Canoeists, Kayakers, Boaters, Tubers – Remove drain plug and drain any water prior to leaving boat loading/unloading area. Don’t move water between waterbodies.\nHow can I properly disinfect my recreational equipment?\nDISINFECTION PROCEDURES – Disinfect prior to moving to another waterbody, watershed, or upstream site\nThere are a number of disinfection techniques that will kill most aquatic invasive species and fish and wildlife pathogens, including Didymo. Solutions of bleach or dishwashing detergent products are suggested as they provide the best combination of availability, cost AND effectiveness against Didymo as well as other aquatic invasive species and fish and wildlife pathogens, such as whirling disease. Choose the appropriate agent based on the actual items requiring disinfection (i.e. bleach solutions can damage some items). It is recommended that all disinfected equipment be rinsed on dry land, away from state waters. It is preferable to drain used solutions into treated wastewater (e.g. pour down a sink drain).\nNon-absorbent items (boats, canoes, rubber waders, ‘hard-sided’ objects)\n- Dishwashing Detergent: soak and scrub for at least one minute in 5% solution (add 6.5oz of detergent with water to make one gallon). ‘Green’ products are less effective and not recommended for disinfecting.\n- Bleach: soak or spray all surfaces for at least one minute in 2% household bleach (2.5oz with water added to make one gallon). Bleach solutions must be replaced daily to remain effective.\n- Hot Water: soak for at least one minute in very hot water (above 140°F – hotter than most tap water) OR for at least 20 minutes in hot water kept above 120°F (hot tap water, uncomfortable to touch).\n- Drying: Drying will kill Didymo, but slightly moist environments will support some organisms for months. This approach should only be used for gear that can be left in the sun for extended periods of time (i.e. a canoe that’s left in the yard for several days between uses).\n- Freeze: Place item in freezer until solid.\nAbsorbent items require longer soaking times to allow thorough penetration into the materials. Felt-soled waders, for example, are difficult and take time to properly disinfect. Other absorbent items include clothing, wetsuits, sandals with fabric straps, or anything else that takes time to dry out. The thicker and denser a material, the longer it will require for adequate disinfection. Err on the side of caution. Bleach solutions are not recommended for absorbent materials.\n- Hot Water: Soak items for at least 40 minutes in very hot water kept above 140°F (hotter than most tap water).\n- Dishwashing Detergent and hot water: (‘Green’ products are less effective and not recommended for disinfecting): soak for 30 minutes in a hot 5% detergent/water solution kept above 120°F.\nA simple, portable DISINFECTION KIT might include:\n- Large trash can and/or medium sized Rubbermaid-type bin for soaking wading boots\n- Large stiff bristle brush for scrubbing\n- Spray bottle(s) or herbicidal pump spray can(s)\n- Graduated cylinder or measuring cup\n- 5% detergent solution and/or 2% bleach Solution\nPlease contact the DNR fisheries biologist at the nearest district office to report possible Didymo outbreaks.\nOther sources of information on Didymo\nDidymosphenia geminata Identification\n|Location||mostly clear flowing water with rocky bottom, may be attached to plants||deep silty areas with no rocks or plants, highly colored waters|\n|Color||tan, light brown or whitish||green or dark brown/black\nclear or transparent\n|Texture||clumps or ropy strands, rough cottony feel, fibrous||thin layers, slippery or gelatinous|\n|Appearance||no leaves or roots (BUT may attach to leaves or stems); Sometimes mistaken for fiberglass, toilet paper or tissue||has leaves or roots\nlooks like an aquatic plant","Management of Quagga and Zebra Mussels for Preventing Blockage of Water in Delivery Systems and Protecting Infrastructure\nThis study is addressing integrated, cost-effective methods for managing and controlling highly invasive quagga and zebra mussels in Reclamation water systems. Research questions include:\n* What are the best integrated management options for controlling mussels that block, damage, and corrode these water delivery and irrigation systems?\n* How can we protect sensitive, high-value structures such as dams and pumping plants from being colonized?\n* How can we maintain the designed water delivery capability when canal linings are being infested with mussels?\n* How do we remove quagga/zebra mussels for structures once they have been colonized?\nNeed and Benefit\nQuagga mussels (_Dreissena bugensis_), an exotic noxious mussel, have been recently introduced into the lower Colorado River, presumably originating from contaminated boats in Lake Mead. Related to the zebra mussel (_Dreissena polymorpha_), the quagga is a macrofouler of equal tenacity. It quickly colonizes new areas and rapidly achieves high densities (tens of thousands per square meter). Unlike native mussels that burrow in sand and gravel, these mussels spend their adult lives attached to hard substratum. They can also attach to man-made surfaces made of plastic, concrete, wood, fiberglass, iron, and surfaces covered with conventional paints.\nQuaggas (and zebras) have very high reproductive rates. A female is capable of releasing as many as 40, 000 eggs in a season. It is possible for newly spawned individuals to reach sexual maturity and spawn in the same year. Sexual maturity usually occurs when the female reaches about 10-millimeter shell length (usually in its first 12 to 18 months). Veligers (free-swimming larvae) are waterborne for their first two to three weeks when they travel aided by currents to a new site for settlement. In riverine or flowing systems, the distance traveled may be many miles.\nReclamation has thousands of miles of canals and water systems at considerable risk to biofouling damage by quagga and zebra mussels. To date there may be as many as four regions affected. It is anticipated that the mussel veligers can very quickly spread downstream in western water conveyances and colonize them throughout. Their impacts will likely fall into one of three categories:\n* Flow restriction in canals or roughening ranging to complete blockage of small diameter (<1-foot diameter.) pipes\n* Ecological damage through competition with other aquatic organisms.\nConsequently, these mussels seriously threaten basin-wide operations. Quagga mussels have invaded the Colorado River and threaten dams and irrigation facilities throughout that drainage. Control of these mussels will directly support all aspects of Reclamation's mission of enhancing western water supplies, increasing reliability, and saving money.\nThere are a number of factors which have singly and in combination aggravated the quagga mussel invasion. Until the recent breakout, the known _Dreissena spp._ infestations were essentially confined to east of the 100th meridian. Western irrigation and other man-made water conveyance systems have to this point been unaffected, so there is very limited experience and a lack of knowledge by field operators on how to contend with attached biofouling mussels. Western water systems were designed to disperse water, which serves to spread the problem by transporting veligers (free-swimming larvae) downstream and at times, to other watersheds by interbasin transfer. Additionally, Western United States water systems were designed in the absence of the very concept of such biofoulers. As a result, there is a lack of redundant structural features and operational practices which would lessen quagga mussel impacts.\nTechnology is needed to remove the threat these organisms impose on our water facility operations and structures. Great advances have been made in the Eastern United States during the past 20 years of _Dreissena spp._ management. These tools need to be evaluated in a western context. However, as it was already mentioned, western water systems have different designs, water chemistry, and operational criteria. Existing management tools may need to be modified or new ones may need to be developed to help us cope with this new problem.\nContact the Principal Investigator for information about these documents."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7b442cd4-4889-45fb-ad1d-3633ce2b0ff0>","<urn:uuid:2dac9607-7ebb-43b5-b724-5bf435a6880f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the metaphysical conceits used by John Donne compare to the role of 'Maya' (illusion) in metaphysical thought?","answer":"Donne's metaphysical conceits, which compare far-fetched objects to create surprising connections, serve a similar philosophical purpose to the concept of Maya in metaphysical thought. In Donne's poetry, conceits like comparing lovers to compass feet in 'A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning' reveal underlying spiritual truths through physical comparisons. Similarly, Maya in Vedantic philosophy makes distinctions between beings appear real, while actually all are manifestations of the same truth - just as waves appear distinct but are all water. Both Donne's conceits and the concept of Maya serve to bridge the physical and spiritual realms, helping readers transcend surface appearances to grasp deeper spiritual realities.","context":["This line from Donne’s The Canonization is found in the lips of Tagore’s hero Amit in Sesher Kobita. And question arises why out of so many poets Tagore choose Donne’s line, when Tagore has once claimed that of all English poets John Keats has influenced him the most. But it can be assumed that the idea of ‘platonic love’ is the reason behind it.\nJohn Donne and Rabindranath Tagore both belong to two different ages but there are certain things in both Tagore and Donne which make their writings similar in thoughts. In my paper I want to discuss mainly about the similarity that they share. But they are dissimilar too, mainly in their style of writing, and my paper also focuses on those dissimilarities. Love, to them is something or someone who is a divine entity who is being loved or rather who crave for love. In Donne’s poetry and in Tagore’s song and in writings one found this tension. This research will also show how the words of the Vedanta1 and Sri Krishna’s2 words in Bhagvat Geeta3 get mingled with the words of Donne and obviously with the words of Tagore. Not only that this paper of mine will also show have that Sufism4 and the mysticism that is there is Sufism also had a great recurrence in their work. The research also questions that why the great poets like Tagore and Donne have a definite positive attitude to the question of death.\nIn this paper of mine I have used the theories of Is Upanishad5 and have also taken the help of the Vedanta; especially the analysis of the Vedanta made by Swami Vivekananda. In this project theories of Sufism too helped me a lot. Jaidev’s Vaishnav Padavalli 6 helped med to understand this theme of divine love. Helen Gardner’s essay on Metaphysical Poets was also of great help to me. And finally, Rabindranath Tagore and European Romanticism by Bikash Chakravarty and Rabindra-Sarani by Promothonath Bishi helped me to rediscover Rabindranath once more.\nThe connection and the love between the divine and the human is an old tradition of Indian or rather Bengali literature. In Jaidev’s Vaishnav Padavalli we see the love between the divine and the human. The love of Sri Krishna and his beloved Radha7. This same kind of love or this Radha- Krishna is also been reflected in Rabindranath Tagore’s song, that were written by him in his youth in the Brajabuli language. The collection of these songs together is known as Bhanushingher Padaballi. But Bhanushingher Padaballi is just a pebble in a vast ocean. There are many Tagore’s song and poem which talks about the same divine and the human love. In an essay on Rabindranath, Promothonath Bishi had said that Tagore’s poems in Kori and Komol had created a sensation during that age. The reason behind this was that, the poems describe heavenly women figures (like Urvasi) in a very sensuous manner. But Promothonath Bishi disagrees with the contemporary criticism. According to him through these poems the poet has tried to reach the infinite world while being in the limited world. Thus the poet says:\n“Eki durashar swapno hai go Ishwar\nToma chara a milan ache konkhane” [What a dream sans hope hey almighty it is/without you this meet thus always cease] [Purnamilan]\nHere we hear in Tagore, the plea to get united with the Almighty God. And if Tagore wanted to get united with the divine then Donne asks this divine:\n“Take mee to you, imprison mee, for I\nExcept you enthrall me, never shall be free.”\nMen are born Immortal, or according to the Vedanta Men (and also women) are born from the Amrit. And not only humans but every one in this Earth is born form that Immortal, so none of the creature neither have any beginning, nor any decay and nor any death. According to the Vedanta Man’s aim in life should be the manifestation of the divine in the self. Bhagvat Geeta on the other hand had said that, human body is like the old cloths, and it is not a human entity. Souls are the owner of this body and when the soul wants it can leave one body and be the owner of the other body. These basic thoughts get reflected in the works of Donne and Tagore. Both of them had believed in the union of the souls and not in the union of the bodies. And thus bodily beauty never attracts any of them.\n“For he who colour loves and skinne\nLoves but their oldest clothes”\nThese lines clearly ring in mind the words of Bhagvat Geeta where a body of a human being is being compared to old and torn cloths. And to Rabindranath eternal beauty is the beauty is the beauty that one should love and so we find his hero Aruneshwar saying:\n“Aami rupe tomay bholab na\nAami haat diye dwar khulbo na\nGaan diye dwar kholab” [I won’t woo you with my beauty/I will woo you with my love/ I will not open these doors with my hands/ I will through music open these doors]\nInterestingly, Aruneshwar (The Sun God) getting married to Komolika, in Shapmochan, [The Curse Redeemed] is symbolic of a marriage between two souls as because here Komolika first gets married with Aruneshwar Veena. This Veena is symbolic of the musical qualities that are being possessed by Aruneshwar. It is in a way the soul of Aruneshwar because Aruneshwar in his previous life was a musician. And in his after life he has just two things from his previous life; his efficiency in music and his unknown and uncanny feeling towards princess Komolika (who in the previous life was his wife). In this dance drama the Veena is responsible for the union of Aruneshwar and Komolika. Like the flea, in Donne’s poem Flea is responsible for the marriage of the two lovers and for that matter in their union. In both Tagore and Donne’s poetry we find a disregard for sexual and physical love. But at the same time it is also true that both did not denied the existence of the body and thus Tagore says in his poem, Deher Milan:\n“Hriday lukono ache deher sayar a\nChirodin tire bosi kori go krondon” [The heart is hidden beneath this body/ I weep my all through my life sitting at the shore]\nThis poem actually speaks of that prize moment when the speaker did not understand that the body is actually preserving the heart or the souls, he like Donne is asking:\n“Our bodies why doe wee forebear?”\nAnd the answer that he is rceiving is also can be said through Donne’s these lines:\n“They are ours, though they are not wee, Wee are\nTh’intelligences, they the Spheares” [Extasie]\nIn Tagore there is an assimilation of the ‘Jiban’ (Visible real life) and the ‘Arup’ (the idealized unseen). To understand the idea of ‘Arup’, one has to understand the Is Upanishad. In Is Upanishad the character of divine is ‘Shunya’, it neither have any form, any shape or any quality. That is why it is called the ‘Nirgun’ (without any quality) and ‘Nirakar’ (without any shape). The essence of ‘Nirgun’ and ‘Nirakar’ is the very essence of the divine in Is Upanishad. This essence in Sufism is known as the Dhat (Zat) and this essence leads to Sankarcharya’s theory of Non-dualism, or “Adwatiyabad”. This means that there is no ‘you’ and no ‘me’; both ‘you’ and ‘me’ mingle in one self. From dualism raises a love that contains fear, but from non-dualism love devoid of fear is being raised. In Donne’s word:\n“And dare love that, and say so too\nAnd forget the Hee and Shee” [The Undertaking]\nAnd according to the Vedanta it is reaching to an assertion through negation. This is vividly found in Tagore’s poem Premer Abhishek, where he describes the beauty of the dancer of the heaven, Urvasi, and says:\n“Noh mata, noh kanya, noh bondhu, sundari rupasi” [Nor mother, nor daughter, nor betrothed, hey beautiful].\nThus by negating the qualities that a woman possesses, that of a mother, daughter and wife, Tagore is celebrating the womanhood. Thus through negation Tagore is trying to reach to an assertion.\nWe, the human beings comes from the infinite therefore finite goals cannot satiate the infinite human desire. Therefore Tagore, according to Promothonath Bishi, neither searched for the infinite nor for the finite. He remained in this finite world and tried to make a connection with the infinite. To Rabindranath ‘facts’ are decaying death and ‘truth’ is the everlasting life of the youth. This thought of Rabindranath gets reflected in his dance drama Falguni. Thus Donne says:\n“All other things, to their destruction draw\nOnly our love hath no decay” [The Anniversary].\nIn the explanation of the Vedanta, made by Swami Vivekananda, we find a reference to ‘Rahasya’. ‘Rahasya’ is a portion of Vedanta and it says that religion has got rid of all external formalities. According to ‘Rahasya’, spiritual things are told in the language of spirits. ‘Rahasya’ is bold, brave and is definitely beyond the concept of the present age. In this respect if we observe Donne style of writing then we will find that his style of writing is bold, brave and is definitely from the conception that used to persist in his age. According to Helen Gardner he tried to establish a ‘relationship between the spirit and the senses.’ Rabindranath too is his relationship with God was different from the poet of his age and in his poetry we find a surrender of his self to the Almighty God.\nAnother important feature of Vedanta is ‘Maya’. According to Vivekananda ‘Maya’ makes millions of being distinguishable. Soul, which in the Vedanta has been called the ‘atman’, is caught up in this ‘Maya’. And this ‘Maya’ gives water the name of the “ocean” and the “waves”. But after the wave subside what is left is water. So if we let Maya alone, and let form and names go, then all these varieties vanish forever. And we find the true self in us; this whole concept in one word is called the ‘Maya.’ We find a reference to this ‘Maya’ in many Tagore’s dance drama, poems and also in many of his novels. For instance, in Sesher Kobita, we find Jogomaya saying:\n“Se jeno bujlum tumi Amit er kache chirokal ei Maya rupe thakbe”\nBut Jogomaya was not really right in the sense that, not for a few moments, but Labnya remains as ‘Maya’ to Amit till the end of the novel. It is Labnya’s presence that makes Amit’s character distinguishable from that of Labnya. Amit’s soul was caught up in Labnya’s ‘Maya’. In Bhagvat Geeta, one found that Sri Krishna is telling Arjun that he should not lament about the fact that the war of Krukshetra is going to take the lives of his relatives. According to Sri Krishna the relations that a Man (or a woman) made in this Earth is nothing but ‘Maya.’ It just makes us different from the other person and does not allow us to have, the true knowledge of who we really are. Thus in George Herbert’s (another metaphysical poet), The Collar that a God gives a Man is the only true collar, and from this freedom is never gain. But the other collars, that one feel that one is wearing, is nothing but illusion. This ‘bani’ of Sri Krishna to Arjun8, about the ‘Maya’ allows Arjun to be strong and mature enough to experience the death of his very dear ones.\nDeath and its pain have also been experienced by Donne and Rabindranath. But their attitude towards death can be said in the words of Vedanta as\n“Sad Chidananda Swaroop”\nThis means that this world is all about the flow of joy without any attachments. Thus we see that after the death of Mrinalini Devi, Tagore wrote”\n“Hriday amar nache re aji k mayur rer moto nache” [Like a peacock feathers so the same way swings my heart]\nAnd in another song he puts the rhythm of life and death and wrote:\n“Nache janam, nache mrityu, pache pache” [Birth swings beneath and so does death].\nIf Rabindranath has related death eternal joy, then Donne has asked “Death” to not to be “proud”; and had said:\n“One short sleepe past, wee wake eternally\nAnd death shall be no more, Death thou shalt die”\nThis ring back in minds the same old teachings of Vedanta that we are Infinite and at the same time born from the Immortal and is thus Immortal. Thus we have neither any beginning, nor decay, and neither an end. We have one life and in this one life we neither have the knowledge of the previous life and neither have we had, the knowledge of the after life. This whole complicated matter in Tagore is described in a very simple line by Tagore:\n“Notun name dakbe more a, bandhbe notun bahu dore a, asbo jabo chirodin er sei ami” [I’ll be called by different names, bound by relation new, yet I’ll coming back to you]\nThus a life after death will wake up with a new name, and get him or her tied up in relations; but the life will be that same eternal life.\nAccording to Tagore in the connection between the ‘incomplete’ Visible Real and the ‘fulfilled’ Idealized Unseen, lies the success of poetry. Both Donne and Tagore has idealized the Idealized Unseen because the Visible Real is prone to decay and destruction. So, love for them is ‘Platonic’, they can eliminate the self, the notion of You and me. And if the idealized Unseen is the divine, then both of them love that Idealized Unseen. And love it in such a way that one feels that the love is between the lover and the beloved. It is like the eternal life of Radha and Krishna. That is why in Tagore’s Sesher Kobita we find Donne’s dramatic line:\n“For godsake hold your tongue and let me love”,\nrepeated again and again and again. After al Amit and Labnya’s love is indeed an example of Platonic love. Thus while or after reading Donne if we say:\n“…………..;though I bid farewell,\nThine, in mine hearts, where my soul dwels, shall dwell”\nAnd after reading Rabindranath if we say:\n“Nayan er Sammukhe tumi nei\nNayan er maje tumi niyecho je thei”\nThen we are actually referring to the same thought in a different language.\n- Vedanta- A collection of Hindu texts that talks about the foundation of Hinduism. There are four texts; and among them AtharvVed was the last to be written down. This is the ‘Ant’ or the last among the four Vedas. Thus it is known as Vedanta.\n- Sri Krishna- The seventh son of Devaki and Basudev, who was the King of Mathura, a place in India. He played a vital role in the battle of Krukshetra, reference found in the Indian epic Mahabharata, fought between the Kaurav and Pandav.\n- Bhagvat Geeta- In the battle of Krukshetra Lord Krishna gives a speech to his friend Arjun, who was de-motivated by this knowledge that he is fighting against his own family, to motivate him to fight the battle.

This type of poetry was known for bold and ingenious conceits, subtle thought and frequent use of paradox as well as the directness of language. Metaphysical poetry, in an etymological sense, is poetry on subjects which exist beyond the physical world.\nIn other words, it is a type of poetry dealing with abstract or philosophical subjects such as love, religion, God, beauty, faith and so on. But in reality the poetry which comprises the ideas or aspects that – physical love leading to spiritual union or religious, argumentative presentation of emotion, terseness of expression, use of conceit and wit in profusion, skillful use of colloquial language instead of Elizabethan lucid diction with the abrupt opening can be considered to be metaphysical. Originally the term ‘Metaphysical Poetry’ was coined by John Dryden and later popularized by Samuel Johnson and the features of the school which unite the various authors are quite numerous. As well as making widespread use of conceit, paradox and punning, the metaphysical poets drew their imagery from all sources of knowledge particularly from science, theology, geography and philosophy. However, John Donne is the founder of the school of metaphysical poetry and the other practitioners of the type of poetry are Crashaw, Cowley, Denham, Davenant, Herbert, Marvell, Vaughan and Waller.\nThe most striking quality of Donne’s poetry is the use of metaphysical conceit which is a figure of speech in which two farfetched objects or images of very different nature are compared. It surprises its readers by its ingenious discovery and delights them by its intellectual quality. Such conceits are available in his poetry. Such a famous conceit occurs in the poem titled “A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning”. The conceit reads as:\n“If they be two, they are two so\nA stiff twin compasses are two;\nThey soul, the fixed foot, makes no show\nTo move, but doth, if th’ other do.”\nHere in the poem the two lovers are compared to the two feet of a compass. The lover is compared to the moving foot and the beloved to the fixed foot consecutively to show the ideal relationship between them. It is made clear that in this relationship the woman’s part is passive and her place is in the home, while the man’s duty is to move in the world of affairs. She stays in the centre apparently unmoving, but certainly as the outer foot moves around describing the circle, the inner foot moves too, revolving on the point which is the centre. The two, in fact, move in harmony and neither is unaffected by the movement of the other. At first sight such a comparison seems to be impossible but after the discovery of the underlying meaning it delights the readers.\nAnother leading feature of Donne’s poetry is his dramatic presentation that arrests the attention of the readers very quickly. Like other famous poets, Donne has the capacity of opening a poem abruptly adding a dramatic quality to the poem. As we find such abruptness in opening the poem “The Canonization”. The line goes as:\n“For God’s sake hold your tongue, and let me love,\nOr chide my palsy, or my gout,”\nUpon reading or hearing those opening lines, we can easily understand that the poem begins somewhat in the middle of a conversation. Now the more we advance, the more clear it becomes that why the speaker of the poem makes such a request to the unidentified listener.\nClosely related to the dramatic directness and abruptness of opening is Donne’s dexterous use of colloquial speech. This dramatic quality is strengthened by its colloquial tone. In the song: “Go and Catch a Falling Star” we can trace such a quality:\n“Go, and catch a falling star,\nGet with child a mandrake root,”\nOn perusing the two lines we will see that like many other poems Donne has employed colloquial language to make the poem more lifelike. From the lines it is clear that a conversation is going on between two people.\nThrough all the love poems of Donne, there runs a belief that physical passion is a good thing and he recognizes the claim of body side by side with the souls. His love poems enhance its attraction and novelty by blending physical, spiritual and mystical love. Although there is a complexity in the poem, “The Ecstasy” Donne deals twin aspects of love - physical and spiritual; love here is concretized through physical enjoyment of sex and then turns in its pure essence, spiritual. The setting of the two lovers provides the physical closeness by their love is enriched by the mutual understanding of their souls and like heavenly beings that influence the actions of men through manifestation. The soul must express themselves through the bodies. The greatness of the poem lies in reconciling the opposites – physical love and spiritual love, the physical aspects of love must precede the spiritual union. Donne’s poetry lies far reconciling dichotomy between psychical and spiritual shifting quickly from the physical to the spiritual fashion.\n“The Sun Rising” is another poem illustrating the peculiar blend of passion and thought, feeling and ratiocination. The delight of satisfied love is the feeling in the poem, but it is expressed in intellectual terms and not merely in an emotional tone. How well the fusion of feeling and thought is expressed in the finality of:\n“She is all States, and all Princes, I\nNothing else is.”\nPassion is conveyed in images which are erudite, logical and of an intellectual nature. In the poem, we again see Donne’s ratiocinative style, reasoning step by step towards his conclusion, which in this case, is that love is self-sufficient and unaffected by outside force.\nTerseness is another characteristic of all the metaphysical poets. It is true in the case of Donne in particular. And the use of such terseness results in obscurity. Such compactness is traceable in “Go and Catch a Falling Star”.\nLives a woman true, and fair.”\nIn the compact idea Donne wants to show that just as it is impossible to catch a falling star in the sky, so a woman with both honesty and fairness is rare to find out as they first seem to be honest but later they are found to be different.\nIn addition to that, the poems “The Canonization”, “Twicknam Garden”, “A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning”, “Go and Catch a Falling Star” and “The Sun Rising” in one or other way deal with the abstract idea which is most dominating feature of the metaphysical poetry and is a must for this type of poetry.\nDonne was the greatest of the metaphysical poets. In some of their poems he was equaled by Vaughan and Marvell and in religious poetry by Herbert. But the body of his work is poetry of a quality which, when compared with that of any other of these poets, is unsurpassed. When his images are understood in their function of communicating a state of mind, and his ideas in their power to give expression to emotion, Donne’s poetry is appreciated for its wit, beauty and perception. In conclusion, considering all the characteristics of Donne’s poetry as discussed above, Donne can be regarded as a true metaphysical poet. Although he was considered a minor poet till the 20th century, he is regarded as one of the major English poets by T.S. Eliot and other major modern poets.\nIf this site is helpful, please like the page.\nA Doll’s House. Agamemnon. A Passage To India Bacon's Prose Style. Doctor Faustus. Donne as a metaphysical poet.

{"question":"Hi, I need to understand differences between neuropsychology testing and Raven IQ scores interpretation - how are results presented in each case?","answer":"Neuropsychological testing results identify specific strengths and weaknesses across various domains of functioning, providing detailed information about deficits and abilities that can be used to create customized treatment plans and interventions. The Raven IQ test, on the other hand, presents results as percentile ranks measured against a relevant population group, where a score indicates the percentage of people who scored equal to or lower than the test-taker (for example, a 90th percentile score means performing better than 90% of the comparison group).","context":["The clinics in Wheaton, IL offers neuropsychological testing for adults and children to identify conditions of the brain or central nervous system. If we are not in your area, we will be glad to try and help you find a resource in your area.\nWhat is the Purpose of Neuropsychological Testing?\nNeuropsychological assessment identifies strengths and weaknesses in specific domain/areas of functioning such as attention, concentration, memory, auditory and visual processing, processing speed, language skills, reading skills, math skills, writing skills, sensory development, sensory integration, gross and fine motor movement, executive functioning, social skills, and emotional or personality development. The domains investigated depend upon the referral question for the neuropsychologist. This domain specific assessment can be very helpful in clarifying a diagnosis, as well as identifying clearer treatment and intervention recommendations when specific difficulties are evidenced.\nNeuropsychological testing plays an important role in the assessment of ADHD, traumatic brain injury, concussion, dementia (most common variety being Alzheimer’s disease), neurological disorders (including stroke, epilepsy, tumor), learning disorders (such as math, reading, writing disorders), dyslexia, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder (including Asperger's), executive functioning, impact of substance use, social difficulty, and behavioral concerns.\nHow is it Helpful for Me?\nNeuropsychological assessment can be a very important part of a comprehensive process in clarifying a diagnosis and the best treatment options. This evaluation will provide greater clarity related to the specific difficulties and/or strengths that an individual might experience related to a specific diagnosis or condition. Specifically, a neuropsychological evaluation will identify and clarify the severity of experienced deficits and identification of areas of strength in the individual assessed. The neuropsychologist can then identify areas of daily functioning which may benefit from accommodation or intervention from appropriate professionals. These accommodations can include things such as additional testing time at school, memory enhancement techniques, approaches to organization, and approaches to maximizing attentional capacities.\nThe neuropsychological assessment can provide invaluable information that will allow for customized treatment plans and intervention recommendations tailored to an individual’s particular strengths, weaknesses, and support needs. There are a number of ways in which the results/information from a neuropsychological evaluation can be applied to enhance care. This might include specific applications related to each individuals levels of daily functioning, tailoring specific accommodations, evaluation of the course of progressive conditions, monitoring the impact of other forms of treatment on the individual’s cognitive performance abilities, and determining whether a particular treatment may be appropriate for an individual.\nWho Can be Evaluated?\nThe neuropsychologists at Meier Clinics see clients ages 4 through older adulthood. Neuropsychological concerns and questions regarding personal strength and weaknesses can occur at any stage of life. Meier Clinics employs neuropsychologists who specialize in children, adolescent, and adult assessment.\nPeople often seek an evaluation when they, or someone they love, experiences difficulties in their ability to concentrate, solve problems, remember things, learn required information, pay attention, regulate behavior, process interpersonal cues, and/or make decisions. Some people may seek an evaluation when they, or someone they love, experience movement abnormalities, head injuries, have behavioral or learning difficulties, social difficulties, or perhaps want to explore the impact of substance use/abuse on functioning. These difficulties might be evident at home, in school, or in occupational settings.\nFor more information, please call one of our intake representatives at 1-888-725-4642.","The Raven IQ test, formally known as Raven’s Progressive Matrices, is a globally recognized evaluation method that aims to measure an individual’s abstract reasoning and general intelligence. It’s a non-verbal test, making it universally accessible, and it focuses on what is called ‘fluid intelligence’. But a question that often arises is, “Is the Raven IQ test accurate?” We delve into this topic in this comprehensive guide.\nUnderstanding Fluid Intelligence\nTo comprehend the accuracy of the Raven IQ test, it’s vital to grasp the concept of fluid intelligence. This term was coined by psychologist Raymond Cattell, and it’s one of the two constituents of his theory of General Intelligence.\nFluid intelligence refers to the ability to solve unique reasoning problems with minimal prior learning or assimilation. In other words, it’s the aspect of intelligence that remains unaffected by experience, education, and past learnings. It’s your ability to perceive new patterns and relationships to form abstract concepts or frameworks, thus enabling you to handle complexity.\nThe other component of Cattell’s theory, crystallized intelligence, contrasts with fluid intelligence as it involves applying previously learned concepts to infer derivative relational abstractions.\nDelving into Raven’s Progressive Matrices\nThe Raven’s Progressive Matrices test involves analyzing incomplete patterns and determining the missing element. The ‘progressive’ nature of the test means that the questions increase in difficulty as the test progresses.\nThere are three different versions of the RPM:\n- Colored Progressive Matrices (CPM): This format is designed for younger children, the elderly, and those with moderate to severe developmental disabilities. It comprises three sets of 12 items each, with the last few questions presented in black-on-white to ease the transition into the SPM.\n- Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM): The SPM is the original format of the Raven IQ test. It consists of five sets of 12 items each, all presented in black-on-white.\n- Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM): The APM is intended for adults and adolescents with above-average intelligence levels. It comprises two sets, the first having 12 questions and the second 36.\nApart from these primary forms, several parallel versions have been designed due to the potential over-familiarization of test-takers with the original CPM and SPM.\nEvaluating the Accuracy of the Raven IQ Test\nNow that we’ve detailed what the Raven IQ test is and how it works, let’s explore the question, “How accurate is the Raven IQ test?”\nThe accuracy of any IQ test, including the Raven’s, depends on what it measures and how it measures it. The Raven IQ test is designed to assess fluid intelligence through abstract reasoning. It does this by presenting visual patterns and asking the test-taker to identify the missing element.\nThe fact that it’s a non-verbal test makes it less culturally biased, allowing for a fair evaluation across cultures. This feature significantly contributes to its accuracy as it reduces the impact of cultural and language differences on the test results.\nHowever, like any test, the Raven IQ test has its limitations. It primarily measures abstract reasoning and fluid intelligence. Therefore, it might not accurately reflect other aspects of intelligence such as verbal skills, practical knowledge, and social understanding.\nInterpretation of Raven IQ Test Scores\nInterpreting scores from the Raven IQ test involves understanding the progressive matrices system. The test consists of 60 questions, and the score is often presented as a percentile rank measured against a population group relevant to the individual’s context.\nThe percentile rank indicates the percentage of scores in its frequency distribution that are equal to or lower than it. For instance, a score in the 90th percentile means the test-taker performed as well as or better than 90% of the comparison group.\nComparing the Raven IQ Test with Other Tests\nWhen pondering “Is the Raven IQ test accurate?”, it’s useful to compare it with other intelligence tests. A popular comparison is with the Wechsler test. Both tests aim to measure intelligence, but they do so differently.\nWhile the Raven IQ test focuses on fluid intelligence and abstract reasoning, the Wechsler test assesses a broader range of cognitive abilities. It includes verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed.\nTherefore, individuals with strengths in areas other than abstract reasoning might score higher on the Wechsler test than the Raven’s.\nThe Evolution and Use of the Raven IQ Test\nThe Raven IQ test was first published in 1936 and has seen several revisions since. The most recent is the introduction of parallel forms in 1998. This was necessitated by the overt popularity of the original forms, which led to premature familiarization among test-takers.\nThe test’s primary use is in educational and occupational assessments, clinical and neurological evaluations, and adult neurology treatment. Furthermore, it’s a standard requirement for admission into certain high IQ societies like The Triple Nine Society and The International Society for Philosophical Enquiry.\nConclusion: Is the Raven IQ Test Accurate?\nIn conclusion, the Raven IQ test is an accurate measure of abstract reasoning and fluid intelligence. Its non-verbal format allows for fair evaluation across cultures. However, as it primarily evaluates a specific aspect of intelligence, it doesn’t provide a comprehensive picture of an individual’s cognitive abilities.\nTherefore, while the Raven IQ test can provide valuable insights into an individual’s fluid intelligence, it should be complemented with other assessments for a more holistic understanding of intelligence.\nFor readers interested in delving deeper into the Raven IQ test, crystallized intelligence, or other related topics, several resources provide more in-depth information. These include the original publications by J.C. Raven and others detailing the development and application of the Raven Progressive Matrices test.\nAs the Raven IQ test and the field of intelligence testing continue to evolve, it’s crucial to stay updated on the latest research and developments. This helps ensure the continued accuracy and relevance of these tools in assessing and understanding human intelligence."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:272aa134-293f-4442-a4b9-828e427b86bb>","<urn:uuid:5f9f83e7-880b-41bf-8434-56c6bdb1239c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are some typical examples of schizophrenic delusions that have been studied?","answer":"The typical schizophrenic delusions that have been studied include three main types: misidentification, alien control, and thought insertion. These cases have been examined using an interventionist model of causal explanation from philosophy of science and the predictive coding approach from computational neuroscience.","context":["Ebook | $28.00 Short | ISBN: 9780262320962 | 304 pp. | 5.375 x 8 in | 3 b&w illus.| July 2014\nAbout MIT Press Ebooks\nThe Measure of Madness\nIn The Measure of Madness, Philip Gerrans offers a novel explanation of delusion. Over the last two decades, philosophers and cognitive scientists have investigated explanations of delusion that interweave philosophical questions about the nature of belief and rationality with findings from cognitive science and neurobiology. Gerrans argues that once we fully describe the computational and neural mechanisms that produce delusion and the way in which conscious experience and thought depend on them, the concept of delusional belief retains only a heuristic role in the explanation of delusion.\nGerrans proposes that delusions are narrative models that accommodate anomalous experiences. He argues that delusions represent the operation of the Default Mode Network (DMN)—the cognitive system that provides the raw material for humans’ inbuilt tendency to provide a subjectively compelling narrative context for anomalous or highly salient experiences—without the “supervision” of higher cognitive processes present in the nondelusional mind. This explanation illuminates the relationship among delusions, dreams, imaginative states, and irrational beliefs that have perplexed philosophers and psychologists for over a century.\nGoing beyond the purely conceptual and the phenomenological, Gerrans brings together findings from different disciplines to trace the flow of information through the cognitive system, and applies these to case studies of typical schizophrenic delusions: misidentification, alien control, and thought insertion. Drawing on the interventionist model of causal explanation in philosophy of science and the predictive coding approach to the mind influential in computational neuroscience, Gerrans provides a model for integrative theorizing about the mind.\nAbout the Author\nPhilip Gerrans is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Adelaide.\n“A first-rate exploration of how reference to multiple levels of explanation and description, from phenomenology to chemistry, may be assembled into a synoptic theory of delusion. Gerrans offers an erudite, novel, and insightful approach to the whole topic of delusional thought and attitude. This is an important book that deserves to be widely read.”\n—George Graham, Professor of Philosophy and Adjunct Faculty, Neuroscience Institute, Georgia State University; author of The Disordered Mind; and coeditor of The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Psychiatry\n“An elegant meditation on delusion, dreaming, and default-mode thought. From dopamine dysregulation to delusional mood, from predictive coding to the phenomenology of agency, The Measure of Madness paints a compelling picture of thought gone wrong. This is philosophically informed cognitive neuropsychiatry at its best.”\n—Tim Bayne, Professor of Philosophy, University of Manchester\n“Philip Gerrans’s wonderful book not only presents an original and rigorously well-informed account of some of the most persistent and perplexing psychiatric delusions discussed by philosophers and cognitive scientists; it also shows how to develop a philosophical model of the mind that takes into account the functional, neural, and biochemical bases of mental capacities. Writing in an elegant but accessible style, and showing a mastery of the philosophical and the neuroscientific literature, Gerrans advocates an integrative approach to psychological mechanisms, as opposed to seeing the neural and the psychological levels as autonomous and independent of each other.

{"question":"How do prebiotics differ from probiotics in terms of their definition and function?","answer":"Probiotics are live microorganisms that provide health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts, while prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients that selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial bacteria to improve host health. In other words, probiotics supplement existing gut flora, while prebiotics nourish both native flora and any added probiotic flora.","context":["Digestion and Rosacea\nHow probiotics, prebiotics, digestive health and stress influence rosacea.\nFor those who remember the cantankerous comedian W.C. Fields, frequently appearing\non the tipsy side in vaudeville sketches and movies, his red, bulbous nose is often\none of the first recollections that come to mind—along with his famous line,\n\"...my little chickadee.\" This signature appearance, used to great effect\nin his various roles, is thought to be the result of rosacea, a chronic, inflammatory\nskin condition affecting up to 14 million in the United States, and many more worldwide.\nThe red, bulbous nose is but one manifestation of the condition, typically appearing\nin men much more than women. The more common symptoms of rosacea—the flushed\nredness of the face; accentuated small blood vessels and capillaries visible around\nthe nose, chin and cheeks; bumpy papules or acne-like pustules; and at times dry,\nred, itchy eyes—can all appear in a range of severity, most commonly in adults\n30–60 years of age, and more often in women upon entering menopause.\nWhat causes rosacea is still largely unknown, but advances are being made in our\nunderstanding of the molecular pathways involved. For those interested in safe natural\nsolutions, new research that reveals the connections between digestive health and\nrosacea is particularly promising. These studies include findings on how digestive\nsupplements in the form of probiotics and prebiotics influence ongoing interactions\nbetween our immune systems and digestive systems. Research continues into ways to\ntreat rosacea and at least manage the appearance of the skin affected, pointing\nto the use of such supplements as a means to quell the inflammatory processes that\nunderlie inflammatory skin conditions.\nDiet and Stages of Rosacea\nRosacea can manifest in phases. An individual may blush easily, with the area around\nthe nose flushing red from blood vessels dilating close to the skin's surface. Redness\nthat persists in this manner may be a sign ofpre-rosacea. The progression\nof this red flushing, with swelling and the visible appearance of capillaries under\nthe skin (telangiectasia) may be an indication of what is calledvascular\nrosacea. Skin sensitivity may increase in the area affected, and the condition\ncan be confused withseborrheic dermatitis, which sometimes produces flaky,\nirritated skin and oily dandruff.\nInflammatory rosaceadescribes cases where the condition has progressed\nto the point where persistent papules and pustules, and swollen, sensitive skin,\nsometimes involving the eyelids and around the eyes (ocular rosacea) occur.\nThe red, bulbous nose (rhinophyma), again, most common in men, is the result\nof the sebaceous glands of the nose enlarging, causing swelling and thickening of\nthe tissues around the nose, telangiectasia, and skin sensitivity. Thickening of\ntissues on the cheeks, forehead, and chin may also be seen in some cases of rosacea.\nInterviews with patients have yielded a list of potential triggers that cause flare-ups\nand a worsening of their condition. Of the 1066 patients surveyed by the National\nRosacea Society 81% found exposure to the sun the most common triggering factor,\nwith emotional stress coming in a close second at 79%, and hot weather, 75%, a close\nthird. However, the cumulative effect of dietary influences was also significant.\nAlcohol consumption and spicy foods were reported by a large percentage of those\ninterviewed as triggers, 52% and 45%, respectively. Other foods figured as common\ntriggers but for much less of this population of rosacea sufferers. Dairy products\nwere found to be trigger foods in 8%, certain vegetables 9%, certain fruits 13%,\nand marinated meats 10%. Such polling cannot replace the research necessary to identify\nunderlying causes, but it may provide some guidance for coping with the condition.\nOf the foods that patients in this survey found to be a trigger, the consumption\nof liver is interesting for its value as a source of iron in the diet. A three-ounce\nserving of beef or chicken liver supplies 7.5 mg or 7.3 mg, respectively, nearly\nmeeting the Recommended Daily Allowance for non-vegetarian and post-menopausal women\nof 8 mg/day. Iron is also a nutrient assimilated from spinach, kidney, soy and lima\nbeans, raisins, and prunes. Each of these has been described by rosacea patients\nas a possible trigger to their flare-ups. Iron that is misplaced or misused in the\nbody increases systemic oxidative stress, decreases antioxidant capacity, and contributes\nto expression of ferritin, an iron-storage protein found in high concentrations\nin rosacea lesions. Excess or misplaced iron can be a risk factor in a large number\nof conditions that include rosacea, as well as supporting infection from bacteria,\nfungi and some viruses.\nInflammation in the Gut and Rosacea\nOther interesting connections between diet and rosacea have come to light from research\ninto the causes of this affliction. Inflammatory gastrointestinal tract disorders\nhave been associated with rosacea. It has been hypothesized that intestinal flora\nmay influence thekallikrein-kininsystem of proteins in the blood, which\ninfluence inflammation and blood pressure, as well as other processes, through the\nactions of the mediatorsbradykininandkallidin, vasodilators that\nact on cell types throughout the body. This hypothesis is supported by evidence\nof the beneficial role probiotics and prebiotics play in modulating the flora that\ninhabit the human gut.\nThe Food and Agriculture, and the World Health Organizations of the United Nations\ndefine probiotics as \"live microorganisms which when administered in adequate\namounts confer a health benefit on the host.\" Prebiotics, in contrast, are\ndefined by the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics\nas \"non-digestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively\nstimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of bacteria that\ncan improve the host health.\" In short, probiotics supplement the flora already\nactive in the gut, while prebiotics nourish both native flora and any probiotic\nflora added by means of supplements.\nWork has shown that in the healthy intestine, microorganisms, which vastly outnumber\nthe eukaryotic cells of the host in a symbiotic relationship, communicate with the\nhost's mucosal immune system embedded in the lining of the intestine. The inseparable\nnature of this relationship allows for proper digestion and efficient energy extraction\nfrom food, while maintaining vigilance against pathogenic bacteria. This beneficial\neffect extends far beyond the mucosal lining of the gut to influence systemic immunity\nand the inflammatory response. Immunomodulating effects include stimulation of immunity\nthrough promotion of antibody production, boosting pro-inflammatory cytokine expression,\nand enhancement of hostdefensinproduction, an antimicrobial peptide. Suppressive\neffects include down-regulating systemic inflammation, decreasing cytokine expression,\ncell proliferation, and increasing \"cell death,\" the controlled elimination\nof unnecessary and redundant cells, orapoptosis.\nPrebiotics are seen to exert similar systemic benefits beyond simply supporting\nthe gut flora. Prebiotics selectively stimulate beneficial bacteria that generate,\namong other things, lactic and acetic acid, which in turn can be digested by other\nbeneficial bacteria. This role is thought to help out-compete potential pathogens.\nAnother benefit of prebiotic fermentation in the gut is the down-regulation of inflammatory\nAlthough not yet extensively well-documented, the direct effect of probiotics on\ninflammatory skin conditions is suggested by the many studies that show the direct\neffects they exert on systemic immunity and inflammatory responses. Atopic dermatitis\nis reduced in children whose mothers use probiotics during pregnancy. In the case\nof inflammatory skin disorders, probiotics are thought to regulate the types of\nimmune system cells known as T cells and lymphocytes. Certain kinds of T cells become\nconfounded in autoimmune diseases, where they start to fail to recognize and destroy\nthe body's own cells and tissues. Effector lymphocytes are cells able to mount very\nspecific immune functions, that are also believed to be influenced by the actions\nof probiotics in the diet.\nStress, Inflammation, and Rosacea\nAnother factor that must enter any discussion of inflammatory skin conditions, including\nrosacea, is the role stress plays. The skin, endocrine, nervous, digestive, and\nimmune systems do not act in isolation of one another. Stress ramps up activity\nalong both the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and gut-brain axes. This has a significant\noverall effect in contributing to inflammation and the release of pro-inflammatory\nThough the complexities of these various interactions are not always well understood,\nthe effect each one has upon the others is coming to light and must be relevant\nto treatment options. In the case of rosacea, strategies to reduce emotional stress\nare likely to exert a positive influence in the management of this condition.\nMaking a deliberate effort to learn about and maintaine a healthy diet, being mindful\nof triggers to rosacea flare-ups, and including supplements beneficial to digestion\nand immunity are three natural, safe ways to relieve the stress that managing rosacea\nmight generate. While there may not be a cure as yet for rosacea, treatment options\nthat get closer to the heart of the problem are available.\nMost Visited Articles on Rosacea\nMore Articles >>\nRosacea Diet (1800 calories)\nThe DermaHarmony rosacea diet emphasizes anti-inflammatory foods that work to reduce vascular flushing. Anti-inflammatory foods are generally plant-based, mineral dense, and minimally processed.\nNatural Treatment for Rosacea\nFinding effective treatments for rosacea can be a difficult and frustrating journey.\nSome treatments seem to work for a while, but then the rash returns. The natural\ncourse of the disease consists of calm times followed by flare-ups, which further\ncomplicate trying to figure out if treatments actually worked or if the disease\nwas just going into a quiet period.\nCharacterized by redness, inflammation and pimple-like bumps on the face, rosacea\nis frequently mistaken for adult acne. Due to the location and severity of rosacea,\nsufferers frequently experience intense emotional distress and embarrassment.\nAlkaline Diet & Rosacea\nSkin diseases are reflections of overall health. It is well-known, for example,\nthat people who eat a non-Western diet have fewer skin diseases: including rosacea,\nacne, eczema and others. This is because non-Western diets focus on more fruits\nand vegetables and fewer sugars, grains, and processed foods. People eating a non-Western\ndiet are healthier than the average American and their skin shows it.\nHow We Help\nAt DermaHarmony, our goals are to educate chronic skin care suffers about dermatology, share what contributes to health and wellness, and support our readers in any way we can.

{"question":"Could you explain the key differences between indicative and subjunctive moods in both English and Spanish grammar? I'm particularly interested in how they handle uncertainty and hypothetical situations.","answer":"The indicative mood is used to express what is completely true, false, clear, or concrete in both languages. In English, the indicative appears in statements like 'If I was at home, I ate dinner by five o'clock' describing real, factual situations. The subjunctive mood, on the other hand, expresses uncertainty, doubt, emotional reactions, or hypothetical situations. In Spanish, it's used in constructions following words like 'querer' (to want) or 'esperar' (to hope) where the outcome is uncertain. In English, the subjunctive appears in hypothetical statements like 'If I were at home, I wouldn't have to drive after dinner.' While English rarely marks subjunctive mood visibly, Spanish consistently uses distinct conjugations for subjunctive verbs.","context":["Normally — meaning under the most usual readings — the first one would be wrong and the second right. There is a way to read it that makes the first one also correct, but it is a rare reading. Because English doesn’t have its notional tenses clearly marked as inflectional ones, I’m going to change the verb to be, which is the only place the distinction can be seen in the orthrography.\n- If I was at home, I ate dinner by five o’clock, but if I was at work, I never ate before seven o’clock.\n- If I were at home, I wouldn’t have to drive after dinner.\nThe difference is that in the first sentence, there is no question that the verb in the if clause is in the indicative. In fact, there you can change out the two instances of if for when or even whenever, because it represents customary or repetitive action. If this were a Romance language, one would use an imperfect tense not a perfect one, because the action in the if clause is continuous, not completed.\nIn the second sentence, the mode of the verb shifts into fantasy-land. It is a hypothetical. It no longer takes an indicative mode, but rather (in Romance terms, at least), a (past-)subjunctive one. And the corresponding then clause now takes a conditional tense.\nAlthough some people don’t like applying terms derived from Romance sequence of tenses to English, I think it can help clarify things. Just because you don’t have a visible inflection in most cases doesn’t mean that it is not a ‘tense’ or ‘mood’; those concepts do not require an orthographic shift in the verb’s inflection to have the sense of the clause shift from known, real, and true to some other situation.\nYou can make the sentences more complex by shifting the verbs into perfect tenses, but the essential indicative-vs-subjunctive nature, or if you must, real vs unreal, remains.\n- If I was at home that night, I must have eaten alone.\n- If I had been at home that night, I would have eaten alone.\nHere it is becoming less clear, but the same distinction still applies. One final possibility, which is the rare one, I think, is when both clauses are in the simple past indicative. Because English doesn’t distinguish completed action as clearly as Romance languages do, this can be a bit fuzzy to look at, but the idea is the same.\n- If I was at home, the office was dark.\n- If I ate early, you ate early.\n- If I called you, you answered right away.\n- If I gave you grief, you gave me cheers.\n- If I am at home, I always have a snack around o’clock.\n- If I am at home, I answer my own calls.\n- If I am at home, I will take out the trash before the garbage trucks arrive.\n- If he has shown up early, I shall not be pleased.\n- If he has shown up early, he can’t come in.\n- If he has shown up hearly, I’m leaving.\n- If I put down the pencil, will you stop nagging me?\nNone of those has any subjunctive or conditional in either clause. Even the last one has (what a classicist would call) the present perfect in the first clause and the future perfect in the other, but they are both still indicatives of one sort or another, not subjunctive or conditional. These, in contrast, are not:\n- If I were you, I would say nothing.\n- If I called, would you answer?\n- If I had called, would you have answered?\n- If I put down the pencil, work would grind to halt.\n- If I had put down the pencil, work would have ground to a halt.\n- Unless it were for a good cause, I would not donate my time and energy.\nThe only time you still have a mix of indicative and subjunctive is with a lest clause, which still demands a subjunctive mood in English.\n- He will say nothing at all, lest it be misconstrued as criticism.","What is subjunctive? The present subjunctive is a mood in Spanish. It is used to express uncertainty, doubt, emotional reaction, or future actions. The subjunctive conjugation of a verb is usually used in the second part of a sentence. For example, I may say, I want you to study. You may or may not do it, so the word to study would be conjugated in the present subjunctive. The subjunctive is the opposite of the indicative mood, which has all of the tenses that you already know. The indicative is used to express what is completely true or false, what is clear, or what is concrete. This module is only an introduction to the concept of the subjunctive. Its uses are vast! Home\nSetup Words querer (ie) = to want sugerir (ie) = to suggest recomendar (ie) = to recommend insistir en = to insist esperar = to hope ojalá que = hopefully / its hopeful These words, used in the first clause of a sentence, set up the use of the subjunctive in the second clause. What is said after these words may or may not happen, so the conjugation of the second verb is not the present tense as you know it.\nSetup Words I may want you to do something, but you may not do it. I may suggest that you read the rest of this, but… Your parents might recommend that you wash the dishes right away, but you might not do it at all. A friend may insist that you go with him, but you might not want to go. You might hope that something happens, but it may not happen. Home\nHelpful Links Colby This site is AWESOME!

Home\nSubjunctive in Context To set up the subjunctive there are three things that must be in the sentence. 1.One of the setup words 2. The word que 3. A subject change\nSubjunctive in Context Sugerimos que ellos duerman más. Setup word: we suggest que: that ellos: subject change duerman = they sleep This is the subjunctive conjugation. They may or may not do it, even though we suggest that they do it.\nSubjunctive in Context Recomiendo que tú hagas la tarea. Setup word: I recommend que: that tú: subject change hagas = you do This is the subjunctive conjugation. You may or may not do it, even though I recommend that you do it.\nSubjunctive in Context Ella quiere que yo viva en España. Setup word: she wants que: that yo: subject change viva = I live (subjunctive) I may or may not do it, even though she wants me to. Note: In English this would be, She wants me to live in Spain. In Spanish the infinitive is not used, even though it sounds like it should be.\nSubjunctive in Context In the examples that you see on the next slide, remember that the subjunctive is used in the second half because it may or may not happen. If this sounds strange to you, its because we dont recognize the present subjunctive in our spoken English. Please also remember that the examples that use querer are going to sound different in their English translations than the others. Consider the following example. I want you to go to the store. Many students want to say:Te quiero ir a la tienda. The right translation is:Quiero que vayas a la tienda. The red example is not Spanish grammar, even though it sounds or looks like it should be. Use the subjunctive after querer with que and a subject change.\nSubjunctive in Context Ojalá que entiendas bien esta lección. (Hopefully you understand this lesson.) Insistimos en que vosotros regreséis a tiempo. (We insist that you all come back on time.) Mi madre quiere que pongamos la mesa. (My want wants us to set the table.) ¿Sugieres que yo se lo dé a ellos? (Do you suggest that I give it to them?) ¿Esperáis que los Brown ganen el Super Bowl? (Do you guys hope that the Browns win the Super Bowl?) Home\nForming the Subjunctive Verb Formation Menu The Basics Stem Changing Verbs Irregular Verbs Spelling Changes Home\nForming the Subjunctive In order to conjugate a verb in the present subjunctive, you have to know well the conjugations of the present indicative (the present tense that you already know). First:Use the yo form of the verb in the present tense. hablocomovivo Next:Drop the o habl_com_viv_ Last:Add an opposite ending. This means for -ar verbs, use -er endings, and for -er/-ir verbs, use -ar endings. hablecomaviva\nForming the Subjunctive It doesnt really mater what the yo form of the present is. If there is a stem change or other spelling change in it, the change will be seen in the subjunctive. Consider the following. Present Indicative me acuesto digo me divierto duermo entiendo pongo prefiero río vengo Present Subjunctive me acueste diga me divierta duerma entienda ponga prefiera ría venga Infinitive acostarse (ue) decir divertirse (ie) dormir (ue) entender (ie) poner preferir (ie) reírse (i) venir Verb Menu\nForming the Subjunctive -ar and -er stem changing verbs still have no stem change for nosotros and vosotros in the present subjunctive. However, certain -ir verbs do. Note the following. acostarse (ue) me acueste te acuestes se acueste nos acostemos os acostéis se acuesten preferir (ie / i) prefiera prefieras prefiera prefirimos prefiráis prefieran poder (ue) pueda puedas pueda podamos podáis puedan\nForming the Subjunctive A note about -ir verbs Stem changing verbs ending in -ir have multiple stem changes. They are the only verbs that have stem changes in the preterit and present participle. Whenever you see two choices after an infinitive the first is for the present indicative and four conjugations of the subjunctive. The second is for the nosotros / vosotros form of the subjunctive, the preterit, and the present participle. See the following examples. present indicative me diviertonos divertimos te diviertesos divertís se diviertese divierten preterit me divertínos divertimos te divertisteos divertisteis se divirtióse divirtieron present subjunctive me diviertanos divirtamos te diviertasos divirtáis se diviertase divierten present participle divirtiendo divertirse (ie / i)\nForming the Subjunctive Here are some other -ir stem changing verbs that have changes in the present indicative, present subjunctive, preterit, and present participle. dormir (ue / u) = to sleep medir (i / i) = to measure mentir (ie / i) = to lie morir (ue / u) = to die pedir (i / i) = to aks for preferir (ie / i) = to prefer reírse (i / i) = to laugh servir (i / i) = to serve vestirse (i / i) = to get dressed Verb Menu\nForming the Subjunctive Spelling Changes for Pronunciation Words ending with -gar / -car / -zar will have spelling changes in the present subjunctive in order to maintain pronunciation. For example, what is the subjunctive of pagar? If you follow the earlier steps, you would say page. The problem with that is that the hard G sound is lost. The word should sound like PA-gay. The combination of ge makes it PA-hey. A similar problem arises with -car verbs. ce sound like say, but the sound should be kay.\nForming the Subjunctive Spelling Changes for Pronunciation To solve this problem verbs that end with -gar have gue in their endings. You may remember a similar change in the first conjugation of the preterit. However, in the subjunctive the spelling change is throughout all of the conjugations. pagar pague paguemos pagues paguéis pague paguen\nForming the Subjunctive Spelling Changes for Pronunciation To solve this problem with -car verbs que is in their endings. Again, you may remember a similar change in the first conjugation of the preterit. However, in the subjunctive the spelling change is throughout all of the conjugations. clasificar clasifiqueclasifiquemos clasifiquesclasifiquéis clasifiqueclasifiquen\nForming the Subjunctive Spelling Changes for Pronunciation The problem with -zar verbs is that the letters ze are never combined in Spanish. Whenever that happens, the z changes to c. bostezar bostece bostecemos bosteces bostecéis bostece bostecen Verb Menu\nForming the Subjunctive The following verbs are irregular in the subjunctive. Only the yo form of the subjunctive is shown, but the other conjugations will follow the same pattern as the regular verbs. Present Indicative doy estoy he voy sé soy Present Subjunctive dé esté haya vaya sepa sea Infinitive dar estar haber ir saber ser Verb Menu\nThings to Keep in Mind If there is no subject change, then there is no subjunctive. I want to go with you. Quiero ir contigo. I want you to go with me.Quiero que vayas conmigo. The second example uses the subjunctive because there is a subject change. I can, I should, I need to, I have to, I want to, Im going to, etc. All of these are followed by an infinitive in Spanish if there is no subject change. Dont over think this. You knew how to do this in Spanish I.\nThings to Keep in Mind If there is no subject change, then there is no subjunctive. Using a phrase with hope in it can be tricky. Ellos esperan que tú hagas bien.They hope that you do well. (subjunctive) Ellos esperan que yo haga bien.They hope that I do well. (subjunctive) How would you say, They hope that they do well.? Theres no subject change, right? Could the same sentence be said in English, They hope to do well.? They hope that they do well. = Ellos esperan hacer bien. (infinitive)\nThings to Keep in Mind There is no future subjunctive. Again, using esperar (to hope) or ojalá (hopefully) can be tricky. Ella espera que vengan. She hopes that they (will) come. (subjunctive) Ojalá que él aprenda. Hopefully he (will) learn. (subjunctive) Even though in English we would use the future tense, it isnt used in these cases in Spanish. You can see that the two sentences above have two possible translations. Basically, if everything else tells you that you should use the subjunctive (setup verb / que / subject change) you should use it. But dont forget... We hope that well be able to go.Esperamos poder ir. (infinitive) If there is no subject change, dont use the subjunctive.\nThings to Keep in Mind Be careful with querer. As mentioned on previous slides, when a subjunctive sentence that uses querer is translated into English, the subjunctive verb is an infinitive. This confuses many students. In fact, its probably the #1 mistake that students make with the subjunctive. Note the following. Quiero que ellos estudien más.I want them to study more. Queremos que los niños se acuesten ahora.We want the kids to go to bed now. ¿Queréis que yo os lo dé?Do you guys want me to give it to you? Sus padres quieren que ella saque la basura.Her parents want her to take out the trash. Mi mamá quiere que sepamos la verdad.My mom wants us to know the truth. Él quiere que tú seas simpático.He wants you to be nice. Ellos no quieren que ella vaya.They dont want her to go. Mi papá quiere que yo ponga la mesa.My dad wants me to set the table.\nThings to Keep in Mind Be careful with querer. It may help to think that youre saying, I want that they study. or We want that the kids go to bed. It sounds a little funny, but it may keep you from using the infinitive when the subjunctive should be used. The examples below are WRONG. Im showing them to you so that you can see how, to many, it makes sense to write sentences this way. Los quiero estuiar.(I want them to study.) Queremos los niños asostrarse.(We want the kids to go to bed.) ¿Me queréis dároslo?(Do you guys want me to give it to you? These sentences are right:Quiero que ellos estudien. Queremos que los niños se acuesten. ¿Queréis que yo os lo dé?\nThings to Keep in Mind Be careful with querer. Its not always wrong to use an infinitive after querer. Remember: If there is no subject change, there is no subjunctive. I want to call them.Quiero llamarlos. She wants to come.Ella quiere venir. They want to have fun.Ellos quieren divertirse. We want to laugh.Queremos reírnos Home\nYour consent to our cookies if you continue to use this website."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a1de4bf0-cace-4ff9-b765-5727bd4a2d70>","<urn:uuid:8e36451f-50f6-4177-bb2d-e3f8de802e54>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which poses a greater challenge for measuring rotation periods - Neptune or Saturn?","answer":"Saturn poses a greater challenge for measuring rotation periods than Neptune. While Neptune undergoes differential rotation with its equatorial zone rotating in 18 hours and polar regions in 12 hours, its rotation patterns are consistently observable. In contrast, Saturn's rotation has been more difficult to determine, with different areas rotating at various speeds and measurements varying significantly - Voyager 2 measured 10h 39m 22s while Cassini found it eight minutes longer. Scientists needed to develop a special statistical method analyzing gravity and mass to finally determine Saturn's accurate rotation period.","context":["As a gas giant (or ice giant), Neptune has no solid surface. In fact, the blue-green disc we have all seen in photographs over the years is actually a bit of an illusion. What we see is actually the tops of some very deep gas clouds, which in turn give way to water and other melted ices that lie over an approximately Earth-size core made of silicate rock and a nickel-iron mix. If a person were to attempt to stand on Neptune, they would sink through the gaseous layers.\nAs they descended, they would experience increased temperatures and pressures until they finally touched down on the solid core itself. That being said, Neptune does have a surface of sorts, (as with the other gas and ice giants) which is defined by astronomers as being the point in the atmosphere where the pressure reaches one bar. Because of this, Neptune’s surface is one of the most active and dynamic places in entire the Solar System.\nComposition and Structure:\nWith a mean radius of 24,622 ± 19 km, Neptune is the fourth largest planet in the Solar System. But with a mass of 1.0243 × 1026 kg – which is roughly 17 times that of Earth – it is the third most massive, outranking Uranus. Due to its smaller size and higher concentrations of volatiles relative to Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune (much like Uranus) is often referred to as an “ice giant” – a subclass of a giant planet.\nAs with Uranus, the absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue, although Neptune’s is darker and more vivid. Because Neptune’s atmospheric methane content is similar to that of Uranus, some unknown atmospheric constituent is thought to contribute to Neptune’s more intense coloring.\nAlso like Uranus, Neptune’s internal structure is differentiated between a rocky core consisting of silicates and metals; a mantle consisting of water, ammonia and methane ices; and an atmosphere consisting of hydrogen, helium and methane gas. It’s atmosphere is also divided into four layers, consisting of (from innermost to outermost) the lower troposphere, the stratosphere, the thermosphere and the exosphere.\nThe two main regions of Neptune’s atmosphere are the two innermost ones: the lower troposhere, where temperatures decrease with altitude; and the stratosphere, where temperature increases with altitude. Within the troposphere, pressure levels range from one to five bars (100 and 500 kPa), hence the surface of Neptune is defined as being within this region.\nNeptune’s “surface” can therefore be said to be composed of about 80% hydrogen and 19% helium, with a trace amount of methane. The surface layer is also permeated by roving bands of clouds with varying compositions, depending on altitude and pressure. At the upper-level, temperatures are suitable for methane to condense, and the pressure conditions are such that clouds consisting of ammonia, ammonium sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and water can exist.\nAt lower levels, clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are thought to form. Deeper clouds of water ice should be also found in the lower regions of the troposphere, where pressures of about 50 bars (5.0 MPa) and temperature of 273 K (0 °C) are common.\nFor reasons that remain obscure, the planet’s thermosphere experiences unusually high temperatures of about 750 K (476.85 °C/890 °F). The planet is too far from the Sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation, which means another heating mechanism is involved – which could be the atmosphere’s interaction with ion’s in the planet’s magnetic field, or gravity waves from the planet’s interior that dissipate in the atmosphere.\nBecause Neptune is not a solid body, its atmosphere undergoes differential rotation. The wide equatorial zone rotates with a period of about 18 hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet’s magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12 hours.\nThis differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System, and results in strong latitudinal wind shear and violent storms. The three most impressive were all spotted in 1989 by the Voyager 2 space probe, and then named based on their appearances.\nThe first to be spotted was a massive anticyclonic storm measuring 13,000 x 6,600 km and resembling the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Known as the Great Dark Spot, this storm was not spotted five later (Nov. 2nd, 1994) when the Hubble Space Telescope looked for it. Instead, a new storm that was very similar in appearance was found in the planet’s northern hemisphere, suggesting that these storms have a shorter life span than Jupiter’s\nThe Scooter is another storm, a white cloud group located farther south than the Great Dark Spot. This nickname first arose during the months leading up to the Voyager 2 encounter in 1989, when the cloud group was observed moving at speeds faster than the Great Dark Spot. The Small Dark Spot, a southern cyclonic storm, was the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter. It was initially completely dark; but as Voyager 2 approached the planet, a bright core developed and could be seen in most of the highest-resolution images.\nFor reasons that astronomers are still not clear on, the interior of Neptune is unusually hot. Even though Neptune is much further from the Sun than Uranus and receives 40% less sunlight, its surface temperature is about the same. In fact, Neptune gives off 2.6 times more energy than it takes in from the Sun. Even without the Sun, Neptune glows.\nThis high amount of interior heat matched with the coldness of space creates a huge temperature difference. And this sets the winds blasting around Neptune. Maximum wind speeds on Jupiter can be more than 500 km/hour. That’s twice the speed of the strongest hurricanes on Earth. But that’s nothing compared to Neptune. Astronomers have calculated winds blasting across the surface of Neptune at 2,100 km/hour.\nDeep down inside Neptune, the planet might have an actual solid surface. At the very core of the gas/ice giant is thought to be a region of rock with roughly the mass of the Earth. But temperatures at this region would be thousands of degrees; hot enough to melt rock. And the pressure from the weight of all the atmosphere would be crushing.\nIn short, there is simply no way one could stand on the “surface of Neptune”, let alone walk around on it.\natmosphere, atmosphere layers, atmosphere of neptune, core, gas giant, great dark spot, ice giant, Jupiter's great red spot, mantle, Neptune, scooter, small dark spot, surface, surface of Neptune, surface temperature of Neptune, Voyager 2","When astronomers measure the rotation speed of planets, like the Earth, it is an elementary task. To do this, they see how long it takes for a certain point on the surface to come into view again. Though, the gas giants in the Solar System, like Jupiter and Saturn, are a little more difficult for planetary scientists, due to their lack of a solid surface. This hinders direct visual observations by space telescopes. Saturn presents an even greater challenge. Different areas on Saturn are known to rotate at various speeds. Atmospheric currents on the bulbous hydrogen and helium gas giant rise and fall, creating makeshift weather patterns on the planet. Therefore, Saturn has a precarious speed, unlike the Earth, which rotates on an axis and has aligned magnetic poles.\nA new study published in the most recent issue of the journal Nature, proposes a new way to identify Saturn’s rotation period, offering new information into the inner structure, atmospheric patterns, and how the planet formed. Dr. Ravit Helled, a researcher at Tel Aviv University, along with a team of scientists, stated their new method has measured the planet’s gravitational field and axis, which was found that its north to south axis is longer than its east to west axis. The team discovered that one day on Saturn is the Earth equivalent of 10 hours, 32 minutes, and 44 seconds. When they applied their method to measure Jupiter’s rotation period, they arrived at an identical conclusion. Thus, realizing the accuracy and consistency of the method.\nFor the last few decades, scientists have had problems calculating the exact measurement of Saturn’s rotation. The accepted rate previous to this study, measured by Voyager 2 in the 1980s, was 10 hours, 39 minutes, and 22 seconds. Dr. Helled stated when the Cassini probe passed by Saturn three decades later, the measured rotation period was eight minutes longer – giving Saturn a precarious rotational quality. Though, it has now been discovered that the rotation period of the gas giant cannot be surmised from fluctuations in radio wavelength measurements linked to the planet’s magnetic field, considering it is different than others.\nSince these findings came out, scientists have been hard at work trying to find the best way to calculate the planet’s rotation. Helled stated the best way to do this is based on a statistical optimization method, involving the reproduction of Saturn’s observed properties, its gravity and mass, juxtaposed with the best correlation of rotation period. By doing this, Helled’s team accurately calculated that the rotational period of Saturn is 10 hours, 32 minutes and 44 seconds.\nWithout this new method, finding the rotational period for a planet like Saturn would be daft, considering the mass of a solid, rocky surface affects planetary rotation, thus giving it a more stable quality. Therefore, this narrows the margin of error when looking at gaseous bodies. Researchers now hope to apply the same method to other gas giants in the Solar System, such as Uranus and Neptune. Moreover, this could be applied to hitherto precarious planets similar to Saturn found throughout the Milky Way Galaxy and further into the cosmos.\nBy Alex Lemieux\nPhoto by Kabsik Park – Flickr License"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:150e5e94-8a31-43dc-975b-51e8b9274210>","<urn:uuid:bbc9e6ed-f555-4a97-903f-ac10a3e1f1d3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What was the relationship between Jules Bastien-Lepage and Marie Bashkirtseff in their final years?","answer":"Jules Bastien-Lepage and Marie Bashkirtseff developed a friendship in 1882, during their final years. Bashkirtseff was influenced by Bastien-Lepage, as evident in how she rendered both her portraits and street scenes. Their relationship was cut short by their tragic early deaths, with Bashkirtseff dying of tuberculosis at age 25 in October 1884, followed by Bastien-Lepage's death less than two months later in December 1884 at age 36.","context":["Biography of Jules Bastien-Lepage\nChildhood and Education\nJules Bastien-Lepage was raised in a close family unit that included both parents, his beloved grandfather, and a younger brother (Émile, who would also become a professional artist). His parents owned a modest farm in the idyllic village of Damvillers in Northern France, close to the France/Belgium border. This setting proved to be the key influence on his paintings of rural life.\nBastien-Lepage's father was a keen amateur artist, and nurtured his sons' aptitude for drawing. According to his biographer André Theuriet, his father \"required that Jules should draw with pencil on paper the various articles in use upon the table - the lamp, the jug, the inkstand, etc. It was to this first education of the eye and of the hand that Bastien-Lepage owed that love of sincerity, that patient seeking for exactness of detail, which were the ruling motives of his life as an artist\". That being said, his father was not comfortable with the idea of his son's interest developing beyond a hobby and was unhappy when he declared his desire to pursue art as a profession. To fulfil his father's wishes, and with a great strain being put on the family resources, Bastien-Lepage attended the College of Verdun from the age of eleven. It was hoped that the young Jules would harness his sublime drawing ability and pursue a career as a draftsman. However, Bastien-Lepage showed little aptitude for draftsmanship and preferred to fill his drawing pads with scenes of rural life.\nAged 19, his college education complete, Bastien-Lepage expressed his desire to travel to Paris to study art. His ambition was beyond the financial reach of the family and, on the advice of a family friend, he took up a job with the Central Postal Administration. Though he earned barely enough to live on, the post meant he was able to attend art classes at the Ecole des Beaux Arts where he registered under his given name, Jules Bastien (he soon added Lepage, his mother's maiden name, as a way of sounding more distinctive). For six months he balanced both roles. He worked at the post office from 3:00 to 7:00 am in the sorting office, before delivering mail till noon. He attended school in the afternoons and, with the added burden of homework, his double life became impossible to maintain. After six months Bastien-Lepage resigned his post at the Post Office and entered art school as a full-time student.\nArmed with a letter of recommendation from the academic painter William Bouguereau, Bastien-Lepage approached Alexandre Cabanel who took him under his wing and schooled him in the traditions of academy painting. Realizing his potential, Bastien-Lepage's supported their son as best they could. His mother sent him a small sum of money every month and this, with an allowance of 600 francs from the Council General of Meuse, covered his bed-and-board. Bastien-Lepage's threw himself into his studies, but his ambition was interrupted with the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 when he enlisted in a company of volunteers. According to Theuriet, \"One day in the trenches a shell burst near him and sent a clod of hardened earth straight at his chest. He was taken to the ambulance, where he remained during the last month of the siege, while another shell fell upon his studio, and there destroyed his first composition, a nude nymph with her arms clasped over her blonde head, and bathing her feet in the waters of a spring\". He would spend the majority of 1871 recuperating in Damvillers before returning to Paris in 1872.\nBastien-Lepage had first submitted work to the Paris Salon in 1870. In these early works he copied the landscapes of Jean-Antoine Watteau and inserted fashionable young women into the scenery. These pieces went largely unnoticed but in 1874 he painted his grandfather in the family garden. It proved to be a turning point in his career. His grandfather, with his proud beard and black velvet beret, was illuminated against a rich green backdrop of trees. The painting perfectly captured humble country life, and it delighted the Parisian public. It won him a third-place medal and the name Bastien-Lepage started to feature in Salon literature and reviews.\nThe following year, Bastien-Lepage entered The Communicant, and a portrait of the politician and industrialist Simon Hayem, to the Paris Salon. The Communicant in particular showed the artist's ability at revealing his subject with a frank realism that touched the public in a way that academic art could not. According to Theuriet, \"this young girl's simple awkward bearing, as she stands out from a creamy background, with all the stiffness of her starched white veil, naively opening her pure hazel eyes, and crossing her fingers, ill at ease in the white gloves, is a marvel of truthful painting [...] It is interesting, as being the first of those small, lifelike, characteristic portraits, in a style at once broad and conscientious, which may be reckoned among the most perfect of this painter's works\".\nLike other exceptional students at the time, Bastien-Lepage was entered into the prestigious Prix de Rome competition. Having been tipped to win, he took his first defeat in 1875 to heart, but having failed to win on a second occasion (in 1876), he realized that he had no real interest in travelling to Italy to study and had only entered the competition because that was the path elite academy students were expected to follow. Indeed, Bastien-Lepage began to question the true value of academic training and vowed to produce a more personal body of work. He said later, \"I learned my business in Paris, I shall not forget that; but my art I did not learn there. I should be sorry to undervalue the high qualities and the devotion of the masters who direct the school. But is it my fault if I have found in their studio the only doubts that have tormented me? When I came to Paris I knew nothing at all, but I had never dreamed of that heap of formulas they pervert one with. In the school I have drawn gods and goddesses, Greeks and Romans, that I knew nothing about, that I did not understand, and even laughed at. I used to say to myself that this might be high art; I wonder sometimes now if anything has resulted from this education\".\nBastien-Lepage's preference for the sombre tones of Naturalism clearly distinguished him from the light and colorful Impressionists who were gaining popularity in France at the time. Indeed, historian William S. Feldman stated that Bastien-Lepage saw himself \"as heir to the Realist tradition of Millet and Courbet\" and espoused the philosophy that \"'Nothing is good but truth [and] I come from a village in Lorraine [and] mean, first of all, to paint the peasants and landscapes of my home exactly as they are'\". While he kept an apartment and studio in Paris, Feldman observed that the artist remained \"True to his credo [and] conceived a continuing series of monumental plein air compositions focused in this direction, and executed in a highly personal, eclectic style\". Even when he took on bigger subjects, such as his painting of French martyr Joan of Arc, he placed her in the Damvillers countryside and used a local teenager as his model. Historical figures aside, he conceived of a series of large plein air paintings that evoked his own upbringing and saw him produce what were arguably his most important works, Haymakers (1877) and Potato Gatherers (1878).\nBoth paintings were exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1879 where they attracted attention for their candid realism. Identical in size and shape, and featuring the same model, Bastien-Lepage's cousin, Marie-Adéle Robert, it was Potato Gatherers that drew direct comparisons with Millet, and especially his 1857 painting, The Gleaners. Both Potato Gatherers and The Gleaners celebrated the beauty of the land, and both exalted the virtues of manual labor, but Bastien-Lepage's painting was considered much less sentimental in tone. Both Haymakers and Potato Gatherers were a success but it was the latter that became the key attraction, winning over both the public and the Salon jury.\nAs the painter and writer Cathy Locke observed, along with Haymakers and Potato Gatherers, Bastien-Lepage also exhibited a portrait of the rising French actress Sarah Bernhardt. \"Painted in high key values\", Locke noted that \"this small gem of a portrait\" was made when both Bernhardt and Bastien-Lepage were rising stars, and since both were \"making the rounds with the social elite of Paris, it would have been only natural for [Bernhardt] to sit for this portrait\". Locke adds that at the age of just thirty-one, Bastien-Lepage was awarded the prestigious Legion of Honor for the three Salon entries, and thereby confirmed the painter's \"official arrival on the French art scene\".\nBastien-Lepage's rising star brought him financial security. According to Theuriet, \"he took his mother to a large shop and had silks for dresses spread out before her. 'Show some more,' cried he. 'I want Mama to choose the best'\", and even though she was disinclined to wear such finery, \"She was obliged to give way\". He was also comfortable enough to purchase land adjacent to the family farm. As Theuriet explains, Bastien-Lepage, \"employed his gains in adding to the paternal domains. [including the purchase of] an orchard situated in the old moat of the town, which had belonged to an unfrocked priest\".\nWhile peasant and nature scenes brought him success and personal satisfaction, Bastien-Lepage had also made his name as a painter of beautiful, and highly realistic, portraits. His reputation spread beyond France to the English nobility and he received the important commission to paint the portrait of the Prince of Wales which he rendered in 1879. According to Crastre, \"to Bastien-Lepage portrait painting was only a side issue, a form of relaxation between two landscapes; his predilection, his one object in life, so to speak was to return constantly to his peasants, his scenes of toil, his fields of Lorraine\". That his work appealed to the young artists of the day can be seen in the friendship he developed with the Russian Maria Bashkirtseff in 1882. His influence is evident in the way she rendered both her portraits and her street scenes. While they shared a love of art, they were also both fated to tragically short lives with Bashkirtseff dying of tuberculosis at the age of twenty-five, less than two months before Bastien-Lepage's own death.\nAt the beginning of 1881, Bastien-Lepage made painting excursions to Switzerland and Italy. Sadly, serious illness would make these the Frenchman's last overseas tours. In 1883, Bastien-Lepage developed intense kidney pains and, as Crastre describes, \"he became melancholy, nervous, irritable; he shut himself up in his studio [...] and even his best friends could not gain admittance\". Eventually his doctor was able to convince him to travel to the coastal region of Brittany in the hope that it might aid his recovery. For a brief period the beautiful nature and sunshine helped him to forget his troubles and he was able to paint freely. Soon, however, his condition worsened and he was forced to return to Paris to receive treatment. Writing to a friend, he complained that his, \"digestive tube is always kicking up a row\".\nThe Paris doctors informed the artist of the gravity of his situation and this time encouraged him to travel to Algeria believing that the North African climate might help his condition. He was in such poor health that he could not make the journey alone so his mother accompanied him in the capacity of his nurse. At first he seemed to be on the road to recover and, inspired by the new sights and sounds, he began painting in earnest. Focused only on his art he stated, \"I am not afraid of death. Dying is nothing - the important thing is to survive oneself, and who can be sure of establishing a claim upon posterity? But there! I am talking nonsense! So long as our work is true, nothing else matters\". Sadly, his health continued to deteriorate and, as Crastre put it, \"before long the ravages of the disease began to make headway; the kidneys no longer performed their function, and he suffered atrocious agonies which stretched him for days at a time on his back. Even the burning heat of the African sun no longer had strength enough to animate his shattered physique; the brush, which the artist from time to time attempted to take up, fell from between his fingers\".\nA seriously ill Bastien-Lepage returned to Paris in May of 1884. He still longed to paint and, as Crastre describes, \"as long as he could hold a brush, Bastien-Lepage continued to work, in spite of the sufferings which racked him\". He eventually grew so weak that he could barely hold a brush. He stated, \"If I was told: They are going to cut off your two legs, but after that you will be able to paint again, I would willingly make the sacrifice\". Having put up a brave fight, Bastien-Lepage succumbed to his illness six months after returning to Paris. He was aged just thirty-six. The Musée d'Orsay records on its website that \"The day after Jules Bastien-Lepage died at his Paris studio on rue Legendre, on the 10th December 1884, the world press announced his premature death and burial in the family cemetery in Damvillers in the Meuse region of France. In just ten productive years, this son of a modest farming family had won an eminent place in the French and international art scene\".\nThe Legacy of Jules Bastien-Lepage\nAlthough his career lasted no more than a decade, Bastien-Lepage made a profound impact on the French art world. Referred to as \"the grandson of Millet and Courbet\" by French novelist Émile Zola, he captured the beauty of the French peasantry and countryside by rendering his subjects with an authentic realism. Speaking of the impact of his work, author George Clausen acknowledged the artist's, \"love of nature and resolute determination not to depart from the strict literal truth as he saw it\", and in so doing, \"he brought to us what was in some ways a new view of nature - one whose truth was at once admitted\".\nBastien-Lepage offered a challenge to the prevailing Impressionist style though this was not a conscious move on the part of the artist. As author Fr. Crastre explains, \"as painter of the open air, he became in a certain sense the founder of a school, without meaning to be; for his conception of the painter's art won over a whole group of young artists who united in hailing him as their master\". Author William S. Feldman added, \"for a younger generation of painters disenchanted with the excesses of both conservative and radical camps, the 'juste milieu' ['middle ground'] approach of Bastien-Lepage represented the viable alternative. Consequently, a school of Bastien-Lepage followers emerged virtually overnight, attracting practitioners from France, Great Britain, and throughout Europe\".\nHe had (albeit inadvertently) suggested a new way for future generations and directly influenced artists such as James Guthrie, John Lavery, and William York Macgregor who, as members of The Glasgow Boys, followed Bastien-Lepage's lead in painting rural Scotland. His style was also influential on a group of Australian Impressionist artists who adapted his techniques to capture the beautiful nature of their country and included artists Charles Conder, Fred McCubbin, Tom Roberts, and Arthur Streeton. His influence can still be felt today in the work of contemporary artists such as John Felsing, Steve Kestrel, and Ron Kingswood all of whom work in the style of Naturalism.\nContent compiled and written by Jessica DiPalma\nEdited and revised, with Summary and Accomplishments added by Anthony Todd\nContent compiled and written by Jessica DiPalma\nEdited and revised, with Summary and Accomplishments added by Anthony Todd\nFirst published on 20 Feb 2021.

(1887). Though her diary is justly responsible for her reputation, she was also a highly talented visual artist and a high-spirited feminist.\nBashkirtseff was the daughter of Russian minor nobility, and she spent a peripatetic childhood with her mother—her parents had separated after two years of marriage—in Germany and on the Riviera until they settled in Paris. She was fluent in Russian and French and learned Italian and English as well. She began to study art seriously in 1876. Her earliest artistic inclination, toward a singing career, was permanently closed to her when, in 1877, she lost her voice while suffering from the effects of tuberculosis misdiagnosed as chronic laryngitis. She then turned her full efforts to visual art, and in 1877 she moved to Paris so that she could study at the Académie Julian. She also studied painting at the Robert-Fleury studio in Paris, and in 1880 her painting Young Woman Reading “The Question of Divorce” (1880) was accepted for exhibition in the Salon. Another painting, a portrait of the women students in Julian’s studio, was accepted in 1881, and a pastel portrait (Portrait of Dina Babanine) and two oil paintings Portrait of Irma and Jean and Jacques) were exhibited in 1883; the pastel won an honourable mention. Among her best-known works are the paintings The Umbrella (1883) and A Meeting (1884) and a bronze statue, Nausicaa’s Pain (1884). A Meeting was shown in the Salon of 1884, shortly before Bashkirtseff died of tuberculosis. Between 1877 and 1884 she made some 230 works of art, chiefly paintings and drawings.\nBashkirtseff’s diary, begun in her early adolescence, offers a frank picture of her artistic and emotional development and a strikingly modern psychological self-portrait of a young, gifted mind in the process of development. The earliest version of the diary, edited by André Theuriet—the edition first translated into English in 1890—contained her mother’s redactions and additions. Not until the late 20th century was a copy of the full manuscript of the diary obtained from the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. The complete translation was published in two volumes as I Am the Most Interesting Book of All: The Diary of Marie Bashkirtseff (1997) and Lust for Glory (2013); the latter volume is available only in electronic form.\nLearn More in these related Britannica articles:\nTuberculosis (TB), infectious disease that is caused by the tubercle bacillus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

{"question":"What are traditional farming practices in subsistence agriculture, and how do modern agricultural methods impact greenhouse gas emissions? I need specific info about crops and environmental effects.","answer":"Subsistence farming focuses on growing food for the farmer's family and livestock, typically using multiple cropping or mixed cropping practices. In contrast, modern agricultural practices, particularly in industrialized countries, employ intensive cultivation and mechanized farming. These current dominant agricultural practices have significant environmental impacts. They can emit between 800 and 2,000 kg CO2 ha-1 year-1 through various activities including plowing, planting, harvesting, irrigation, and application of agrochemicals and fertilizers. The establishment and use of irrigation accounts for 47-63% of the carbon footprint, while fertilization and limestone application contribute 35%. Agriculture and land use change currently contribute 24% of greenhouse gas emissions, with projections indicating this could increase by 30-40% by 2050.","context":["What is Cash Crop Farming?\nAlso called commercial farming and cash cropping, it is a type of farming in which cash crops are grown. Cash crops are those which are produced for the purpose of generating cash or money. The products are therefore intended to be marketed for profit.\nIndividual farmers just naturally grow cash crops as a livelihood and to generate cash for the family's needs. An extra profit is needed to fund the next cropping activities.\nThe farming methods employed\ndiffer from farmer to farmer and from country to country. In developing\ncountries, many traditional farmers continue to adopt their customary\npractices. But in highly industrialized countries, intensive\ncultivation and mechanized farming are common. This is so with large\nplantations operated by multinational companies and by individuals\nhaving sufficient capital.\nMonocropping or sole cropping, which is the growing of a single crop on a piece of land, is common with cash crop farming while subsistence farming usually practices multiple cropping or mixed cropping.\nCash cropping is distinct from subsistence farming. In contrast to the aim of cash cropping, subsistence farming is practiced for sustenance, that is, for the food of the farmer and his family. Subsistence crops are also grown for feed of the farmer’s livetock including working animals.\nWhile there are many advantages to cash crop farming such as source of living for the farmer, salaries and wages for the employees and farm workers, and government revenue through taxes, it may also have adverse effects.\nAs a result of monocropping, which is commonly practiced in growing cash crops in plantation scale, the production of certain food crops may become limited. Continuous monocropping is likewise associated with soil degradation and proliferation of insect pests and disease pathogens.\nAn example is that of potato. Following its introduction, it became the staple crop of Ireland. In 1845-1846, the crop was devastated by a serious disease which resulted to mass starvation.\nExportation, if not regulated, may likewise result to short supply but high prices of locally available food. It is known, however, that exportation is always regulated.\nWhen cash cropping started cannot be established with certainty. It’s historical evolution can only be deducted using logic as related to the history of agriculture and civilization.\nBefore the advent of agriculture, the primitive man obtained food by hunting wild animals and gathering fruits and nuts from natural stands. Even in the most recent time this practice has survived.\nBut the discovery that certain plants can be grown from seeds caused a gradual transformation from hunting-gathering to farming. The primitive man began to domesticate plants and so there was no longer any reason for him to maintain his nomadic way of life in search of food.\nGroups of men lived in villages, and soon the populace was divided into two groups: urban and rural. The urban people engaged in the processing and trading of the raw materials which the rural people supply. This gave rise to the modern civilization which is characterized by an advanced agricultural technology, long-distance marketing, and occupational specialization among the populace.\nThis must be how cash crop farming evolved.\nBased on archaelogical records, farming or agriculture started at least 10,000 years ago. The when and where are continuously debated. However, the credit for the first civilization to be established goes to the Sumerians.\nBy 5000 BC the Sumerians had developed special agricultural techniques including intensive crop farming in large-scale, monocropping, organized irrigation, and the use of labor with specialized skills. They invented the plow.\nThey grew barley, chickpeas, lentils, wheat, dates, onions, garlic, lettuce, leeks and mustard. They also raised cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. They used oxen as their primary draft animal and donkeys or equids for transport.\nArchaeological artifacts indicate that they were engaged in trading with neighboring regions centered around the Persian Gulf.\nThe land of the Sumer is located in what is now called Fertile Crescent. It lies between two great rivers, the Euphrates and Tigris. Modern-day countries within the Fertile Crescent are Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Israel and parts of the Palestinian Territories, besides Turkey and Iran.\nChapman, S.R. and L.P. Carter. 1976.

Bareja. 2010)","Agriculture and land use change contribute 24% of greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers estimate that this share will increase by 30 to 40% by 2050. The challenge is therefore to counterbalance this with greater carbon sequestration in order to transform agrosystems into greenhouse gas sinks.\nTo determine this role, it is sufficient, in broad terms, to take into account the gases drawn from the agrosystem and to compare them to those emitted by the same agrosystem. To do this, it is necessary to measure the accumulation of carbon in the soil, the quantities of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) released into the atmosphere, as well as all the CO2 coming from agricultural practices: plowing, planting, harvesting, installation and use of irrigation, application of agrochemicals, fertilizers and lime.\nKnowing that CH4 and N2O are greenhouse gases 34 and 298 times more potent than CO₂ respectively, it is sufficient to convert all these emissions into CO2 equivalent to estimate the net global warming potential and compare between different agricultural management methods.\nTo calculate the carbon cost of today's dominant agricultural practices, one must also consider their direct CO2 emissions. According to studies conducted in southern Brazil and the United States, the carbon cost of agricultural practices represents a significant amount of CO2, up to 800 and 2,000 kg ha-1 year-1.\nDiagram showing how to estimate whether an agrosystem is a source or sink of greenhouse gases: measure carbon fixation in the soil, the amount of CH₄ and N₂O released into the atmosphere, and all the CO₂ from agricultural practices: tilling, planting, harvesting, irrigation installation and use, and application of agrochemicals, fertilizers, and lime.\nBased on this observation, the first thing to do is to determine which agricultural practices to adopt in order to transform the soil into a greenhouse gas sink - and not a source.\nThe first element to take into account is that the soil can become a source of greenhouse gases when there is an excessive input, because telluric microorganisms feed on all these inputs and spit them out in the form of GHG.\nEven more so when the land is saturated with water by irrigation and compacted by machinery, as oxygen availability becomes scarce, leading to methanization (a process responsible for the production of CH₄) and denitrification (one of the processes responsible for the production of N₂O). Nevertheless, these methane fluxes remain low or even sometimes negative if the soils have a good structure and are not flooded.\nIn addition, the establishment and use of irrigation accounts for 47-63% of the carbon footprint while fertilization and limestone application rise to 35%. These proportions vary according to the inputs used and their annual input. To mitigate the climate change caused by agriculture, the most obvious solution seems to be the reduction of inputs, with more reasoned spreading.\nAgroforestry and legumes\nOther agricultural practices are just as important in moving from a source to a sink for greenhouse gases.\nThis is particularly true of agroforestry, which has been adopted by some farms. It consists of using cover crops, for which carbon storage exceeds its CO₂ equivalent released into the atmosphere in terms of N2O emissions, and improves soil structure with negative CH4 emissions.\nTwo contrasting agricultural systems, behaving as source (left) and sink (right) of greenhouse gases, according to CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O emissions as well as soil carbon sequestration. Murilo Veloso\nThis is also the case for the use of legumes. As these plants associate with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, they promote carbon storage in the soil and make it possible to substitute part of the mineral fertilization, thus reducing nitrous oxide emissions.\nFurthermore, by maintaining soil moisture and structure, practices such as agroforestry and cover crops provide an alternative to decrease irrigation.\nHowever, transforming an agrosystem into a greenhouse gas sink is not always obvious. For example, plowing, the practice of turning over the soil before seeding, does not necessarily have the same impact on GHGs.\nIn temperate environments, plowing has little effect on soil carbon stocks because low temperatures in early spring slow down microbial activity and the decomposition of soil organic matter.\nIn contrast, in tropical environments where temperatures remain favorable, soil destructuring by tillage stimulates microorganisms to decompose soil organic matter, which releases GHGs.\nExample of conventional agriculture and its practices such as monoculture, tillage and heavy reliance on inputs that contribute to increased greenhouse gas emissions and reduced soil carbon sequestration, making the agricultural system a source of greenhouse gases (left). Example of agroecological practices such as cover crops, no-till, intercropping, legumes and agroforestry that contribute to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and increase soil carbon sequestration, making the agricultural system a greenhouse gas sink (right).\nFor no-till farming practices, N2O emissions are largely offset by CO2 storage, counterbalancing the 375 to 616 kg of carbon equivalent emitted per hectare per year by the 2063 to 3940 kg of carbon equivalent fixed in the soil per hectare per year. This represents nothing less than a carbon storage five to six times higher than the emissions! Ploughing, on the other hand, clearly reduces the soil's capacity to draw carbon from these tropical zones.\nOn the other hand, plowing also constitutes an additional cost of CO₂ when the use of diesel for machinery is taken into account (35.3 kg of carbon equivalent per hectare per year in conventional and 5.8 kg in direct seeding).\nFrom field to plate\nLet's not forget that greenhouse gas emissions do not stop at production, but also continue during transportation, processing, packaging and redistribution of products.\nIt is therefore necessary to radically change agricultural practices, starting with the fields. The practices mentioned above - the use of cover crops, legumes, intercrops, agroforestry, and the abandonment of tilling the soil - would have a triple effect: strengthening an organic and sustainable agri-food system, respecting biodiversity, allowing a balanced cohabitation between agriculture and the environment, while making farmers less dependent on large industrial companies"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6986a59d-44d7-414e-a001-7dcceac0ef71>","<urn:uuid:af9dd96c-4d30-4a93-9431-853dd63dbf04>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the main functions of RNA polymerase III, and how is its transcription regulated through different types of gene promoters?","answer":"RNA polymerase III transcribes transfer RNA (tRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and other small RNAs vital for normal cell functioning. It has 14 or more distinct subunits with a mass of approximately 700 kDa and is located in the nucleus. Its transcription is regulated through four different types of gene promoters: Type 1 genes (like 5S RNA) have an internal control region where TFIIIA binds; Type 2 genes (mostly tRNA genes) have an intragenic promoter with A and B binding sites for TFIIIC; Type 3 genes (like U6 snRNA) have only upstream promoters; and Type 4 genes (like 7SL RNA) have both internal regions for class III transcription factors and 5' promoters for regulatory transcription factors.","context":["Figure: RNA polymerase. Image Source: Wikipedia. Image created with biorender.com.\nRNA polymerase definition\nRibonucleic Acid (RNA) Polymerase (RNAP) enzyme is a multi-subunit enzyme that applies its activity in the catalyzation of the transcription process of RNA synthesized from a DNA template.\n- And therefore, RNA polymerase enzyme is responsible for the copying of DNA sequences into RNA sequences during transcription.\n- The function of RNA polymerase is to control the process of transcription, through which copying of information stored in DNA into a new molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA.)\n- During transcription, the RNA polymer is contemporary to the template DNA that is synthesized in the direction of 5′ to 3′.\n- The enzyme RNA polymerase interacts with proteins to enable it to function in catalyzation of the synthesis of RNA.\n- The collaborator proteins assist in enabling the specific binding of RNA polymerase, assist in the unwinding of the double chemical structure of DNA, moderate the enzymatic activities of RNA polymerase and to control the speed of transcription.\n- The RNA polymerase enzyme has an interrupted mechanism whereby it continuously synthesizes RNA polymers of over four thousand bases per minute but they pause or stop occasionally to maintain fidelity.\n- RNA polymerase is an enzyme that is responsible for copying a DNA sequence into an RNA sequence, during the process of transcription. As a complex molecule composed of protein subunits, RNA polymerase controls the process of transcription, during which the information stored in a molecule of DNA is copied into a new molecule of messenger RNA.\n- RNA polymerases have been found in all species, but the number and composition of these proteins vary across taxa.\n- For instance, bacteria contain a single type of RNA polymerase, while eukaryotes (multicellular organisms and yeasts) contain three distinct types.\n- In spite of these differences, there are striking similarities among transcriptional mechanisms.\n- For example, all species require a mechanism by which transcription can be regulated in order to achieve spatial and temporal changes in gene expression.\nTypes of RNA polymerase\nProkaryotic (Bacteria, viruses, archaea) organisms have a single type of RNA polymerase that synthesizes all the subtypes of RNA, while eukaryotes (multicellular organisms) have 5 different types of RNA polymerases which perform different functions in the synthesis of different RNA molecules.\nProkaryotic RNA polymerase\n- The prokaryotes have a single type of RNA polymerase (RNAP) which synthesizes all the classes of RNA, i.e mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, sRNA.\n- The RNA Polymerase molecule is made up of 2 domains and 5 subunits:\n- Core and holoenzyme\n- Subunits (β, β’, α (αI and αII), ω,)\n- The promoter is the sequence of DNA that is required for accurate and specific initiation of transcription, and also, it is the sequence of DNA to which RNA polymerase binds accurately to initiate transcription.\n- The ‘a’ subunit is made up of two distinct domains. The N-terminal domain (a-NTD) and the C-terminal.\n- The N-terminal is involved in dimerization forming a2 and further assembly of the RNA polymerase.\n- The C-terminal domain functions such as binding to the Upstream Promoter (UP) DNA sequence at promoters for rRNA and tRNA genes and in communication with several transcriptional activators.\n- Each of the subunit structure is as follows:\nProkaryotic RNA Polymerase Subunits\n|β||150.4 kDa||The β’ + β form the catalytic center, responsible for RNA synthesis.|\n|β’||155.0 kDa||The β’ + β form the catalytic center, responsible for RNA synthesis.|\n|α (αI and αII)||36.5 kDa||It is made up of the enzyme assembly, and it also binds the UP sequence in the promoter.|\n|ω||155.0 kDa||It confers specificity for promoter; and binds to -10 and -35 sites in the promoter.|\nEukaryotic RNA polymerase\n- There are 5 known types of RNA polymerases each responsible for the synthesis of specific subtypes of RNA. These include:\n- RNA polymerase I that synthesizes a pre-rRNA 45S (35S in yeast), which matures and forms the major RNA sections of the ribosome.\n- RNA polymerase II synthesizes precursors of mRNAs and most snRNA and microRNAs.\n- RNA polymerase III synthesizes tRNAs, rRNA 5S, and other small RNAs found in the nucleus and cytosol.\n- RNA polymerase IV and V found in plants are not well understood, however, they make siRNA. The plant chloroplast encodes the ssRNAPs and uses bacteria-like RNA Polymerase.\n- Each of the nuclear RNA polymerases is a large protein molecule with about 8 to 14 subunits and the molecular weight is approximately 500,000 for each.\n- They commonly have 3 subunits, a, b and b’. The largest subunits being b and b’.\n- These subunits are used as catalytic promoters and for assembly of proteins.\n- Each of these polymerases has a different function:\nRNA polymerase I\n- This enzyme is located in the nucleolus of the cell.\n- It is a specialized nuclear substructure where the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is synthesized by transcription and assembled into ribosomes.\n- The rRNA are component elements of the ribosomes and are important in the process of translation.\n- Therefore, RNA polymerase I synthesize almost all rRNAs except 5S rRNA.\n- In yeast, the enzyme has a mass of 600kDa and 13 subunits.\nRNA polymerase II\n- This enzyme is located in the nucleus.\n- Most organisms that possess RNA polymerase II have a 12-subunit RNAP II (with a mass of about 550 kDa)\n- It is structurally made up of holoenzyme and mediators, with General Transcriptional factors (GTFs).\n- They contain transcription factors and transcriptional regulators.\n- It functions by synthesizing all proteins that code for the nuclear pre-mRNAs in eukaryotic cells (mRNAs in prokaryotic cells).\n- It is responsible for transcribing most of the eukaryotic genes and especially found in human genes.\nRNA polymerase III\n- It is located in the nucleus.\n- The RNA polymerase III has 14 or more distinct subunits with a mass of approximately 700 kDa.\n- Its function is to transcribe transfer RNA (tRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and other small RNAs.\n- Some of its target points are important for the normal functioning of the cell\nRNA polymerases IV and V\n- They are exclusively found in plants, and they perform combined action in the formation of small interfering RNA and heterochromatin in the cell nucleus.\n- In Plants, the RNA polymerase is found in the chloroplast (plastids) and mitochondria, encoded by the mitochondrial DNA.\n- These enzymes are much more related to bacterial RNA polymerase than to the nuclear RNA polymerase.\n- Their function is to catalyze specific transcription of organelle genes.\nFunctions of RNA Polymerase\n- Generally, the RNA molecule is a messenger molecule that is used to export information that is coded in DNA out of the cell nucleus, to synthesize proteins in the cell cytoplasm.\n- RNA polymerase is used in the production of molecules that play a wide range of roles, of which one of its functions is to regulate the number and type of RNA transcript that is formed in response to the requirements of the cell.\n- The RNA polymerase enzyme interacts with different molecular proteins, transcription factors, and signaling molecules on the carboxyl-terminal, which regulates its mechanisms, which play a major role in gene expression and gene specialization in multicellular (eukaryotic) organisms.\n- The RNA enzyme also ensures irregularities and errors during the conversion of DNA to RNA (transcription). Such as ensuring that the right nucleotide is added to the newly synthesized RNA strand, inserting the right amino acid-base which is complementary to the template of the DNA strand.\n- When the right nucleotides have been inserted, the RNA polymerase can then catalyze and elongate the RNA strand, at the same time, proofread the new strand and remove incorrect bases.\n- RNA polymerase is also involved in the post-transcription modification of RNAs, converting them into functional molecules that facilitate the transportation of molecules from the nucleus to their site of action.\n- Besides its role in the synthesis of proteins, RNA performs other functions such as\n- Protein coding\n- Regulation of gene expression\n- Act as enzymes\n- Formation of gametes by the non-coding RNA (ncRNA)\n- Production of regulatory molecules.\nReferences and Sources\n- 5% – https://healthjade.com/rna-polymerase/\n- 4% – https://wikimili.com/en/RNA_polymerase\n- 3% – https://biologydictionary.net/rna-polymerase/\n- 2% – https://zeusbiologicalfacts.blogspot.com/2013/10/rna-transcription-by-rna-polymerase.html\n- 2% – https://www.coursehero.com/file/62664703/RNAdocx/\n- 2% – https://healthjade.net/rna-polymerase/\n- 2% – https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Genetics/Book%3A_Working_with_Molecular_Genetics_(Hardison)/Unit_III%3A_The_Pathway_of_Gene_Expression/10%3A_Transcription%3A_RNA_polymerases\n- 1% – https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/rna-polymerase-iii\n- 1% – https://quizlet.com/20545728/rna-transcription-flash-cards/\n- 1% – https://pediaa.com/difference-between-prokaryotic-and-eukaryotic-rna-polymerase/\n- 1% – https://firstname.lastname@example.org/Book%3A_Biology_for_Majors_I_(Lumen)/13%3A_Module_10%3A_DNA_Transcription_and_Translation/13.4%3A_RNA_Polymerase\n- 1% – https://bio.libretexts.org/Courses/Manchester_Community_College_(MCC)/Remix_of_Openstax%3AMicrobiology_by_Parker%2C_Schneegurt%2C_et_al/06%3A_Mechanisms_of_Microbial_Genetics/6.03%3A_Structure%2C_Function_and_Production_of_RNA\n- 1% – http://www.bx.psu.edu/~ross/workmg/TxnRNAPolCh10.pdf\n- <1% – https://www.thoughtco.com/normal-cells-versus-cancer-cells-373383\n- <1% – https://www.slideshare.net/vinaypatel17/rna-polymerase\n- <1% – https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/biology/microbiology/dna-and-gene-expression/protein-synthesis\n- <1% – https://studenthomeworks.com/subunit-structure-of-rna-polymerase/\n- <1% – https://quizlet.com/19375916/biochem-t1l11-flash-cards/\n- <1% – https://microbenotes.com/rna-properties-structure-types-and-functions/\n- <1% – https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Principles_of_Biochemistry/Cell_Metabolism_I:_DNA_replication","There are five different kinds of RNA polymerase in eukaryotes. Each of them is responsible for transcription of a different class of gene [Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases]. RNA polymerase III transcribes a heterogeneous class of genes that give rise to small RNAs.\nThe class III genes can be subdivided into four types depending on the location of the promoter regions. Type 1 genes possess an internal control region (ICR) that functions as the promoter. What this means is that the site of binding of the pol III transcription complex is within the gene. 5S RNA genes are the only kind of type 1 gene.\nA cartoon drawing of the pol III transcription complex on a 5S RNA gene is shown above (Moran, Scrimgeour et al. 1994). The transcription factor TFIIIA binds to the internal control region (ICR). Another transcription factor, TFIIIC, binds TFIIIA and it, in turn, interacts with TFIIIB and RNA polymerase III. Transcription is initiated at a site (+1) upstream from the internal control region. Note that when the 5S RNA is produced it will contain the binding sites for TFIIIA. The significance of this fact will become clear in a few minutes.\nThe type 2 genes have an intragenic promoter with two binding sites, A and B. TFIIIC binds directly to this promoter causing the assembly of a transcription complex upstream in the same manner as the type 1 genes. Most of the transfer RNA (tRNA) genes are type 2 genes.\nType 3 genes have an upstream promoter and no internal promoter. In this sense they resemble the typical class II genes (transcribed by RNA polymerase II), such as those that encode protein. The U6 snRNA gene, a component of the spliceosome [RNA Splicing: Introns and Exons] is the prototype gene of this category.\nFinally, type 4 genes have both an internal region where the regular class III transcription factors bind and a promoter at the 5′ end of the gene where regulatory transcription factors bind to control transcription. The 7SL RNA gene is a type 4 gene.\nRecall that 7SL RNA is the major component of Signal Recognition Particle (SRP). There are three genes for this RNA located on human chromosome 14 [Human Genes Involved in the Signal Hypothesis Pathway]. Since 7SL RNA is one of the small RNAs present in most cells it should not come as a surprise that its gene is transcribed by RNA polymerase III.\nThe RN7SL promoter has been characterized by Englert et al. (2004). The main features are shown in the diagram above. The solid blue box represents the gene—the DNA sequence corresponding to the 7SL RNA. There's a start site for transcription (+1) that's determined by the positioning of RNA polymerase III upstream. The transcription complex is assembled when TFIIIC binds to an internal control region specified by box A and box B. These are short DNA sequences (10 bp) that resemble the binding sites in tRNA genes. The upstream promoter region consists of a TATA box where RNA polymerase III binds and a regulatory site where unknown transcription factors (TF) bind.\nTranscription terminates at a short stretch of thymidylate residues (T) at the 3′ end of the gene.\nAll four regulatory sites have to be present for maximum rates of transcription but—and this is important—there will still be low levels of transcription if only the A box and the B box are present.\nFrom time to time cellular RNAs are copied by an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to create a DNA:RNA double-stranded molecule. On occasion this hybrid molecule will become integrated into the genome through a nonhomologous recombination event. (Sometimes the RNA strand will be replaced by DNA synthesis to create double-stranded DNA corresponding to the 7SL sequence.) This creates something called a processed pseudogene. Most genomes have hundreds of these pseudogenes derived from hundreds of different genes. They have arisen from accidental events over the course of millions of year of evolution and since there's no pressure to eliminate them, they are retained in the genome as junk.\nIf the processed pseudogene is derived from a class III gene there's a good chance that it will retain prompter activity because a good part of the promoter sequence was present in the RNA molecule. This is the case with 7SL pseudogenes and tRNA pseudogenes. They are often transcribed at low levels. The production of additional RNAs from the processed pseudogenes increases the probability that more pseudogenes will be created. More significantly, if the processed 7SL or tRNA pseudogenes happen to integrate near certain mobilization sequences they will be converted to retrotransposons because they can direct transcription of themselves—a necessary step in transposition. When this happens the pseudogenes will spread rapidly throughout the genome. We call this selfish DNA.\nMore than 10% of your genome consists of degenerate 7SL genes. That's where some of the junk DNA in your genome comes from.\nEnglert, M., Felis, M., Junker, V. and Beier, H.

{"question":"Which has more severe effects on brain function - chronic stress or temporary stress episodes? 🤔","answer":"Chronic stress has more severe effects on brain function than temporary stress. Research shows that major chronic stress can reduce brain tissue in areas controlling emotions and self-control. Additionally, through sustained high cortisol levels, chronic stress can impair cognitive performance, leading to poor concentration and inability to complete tasks. While temporary stress can actually improve memory functions through short bursts of cortisol, long-term exposure to cortisol damages cells in the hippocampus, creating impaired learning ability and inhibiting retrieval of stored information.","context":["Stress and Your Body: What's Really Happening?\nStress and Your Body: Think stress is just feeling anxious? Think again. Stress is a whole chain reaction of chemicals that flood your system - which is good in the moments when your fight or flight response is necessary. But over your lifetime when you deal with chronic stress, those chemical reactions can take a toll on your health and well-being. Below are just a few of the ways you can see stress in your body, in the short and long term.\nStress and Your Body:\nStress and your body: Unhealthy Food Cravings\nFind yourself reaching for that pint of ice cream when you’re stressed? There’s a scientific reason for that! Cortisol, a hormone released by your body when it’s stressed, is linked to cravings for sugar and fat.\nStress and your body: Fat Storage\nStress can actually increase the amount of fat that your body stores and enlarges the size of fat cells. This can lead to weight gain and increase your risk for obesity, high blood pressure and high cholesterol – key risk factors for cardiovascular disease [link to health screening for heart disease). Exercise, however, can help combat fat storage, in addition to reducing your overall stress level. So find a regimen that works for you and stick to it.\nStress and your body: Heart Problems\nIf you suffer from chronic stress, it could be affecting your heart health. While an exact link between chronic stress and heart attacks isn’t clear, studies have shown that individuals who suffer from job related stress have a 23% more likely to have a first heart attack vs. people with no job related stress.\nStress and your body: Sleep Habits\nStress may occasionally keep you up at night, but if you have long-term stress it can disrupt your sleep pattern and potentially cause a disorder.\nStress and your body: Hair Loss\nSevere stress can harm your locks. Stress can trigger hair loss from an autoimmune condition known as alopecia areata. If stress is coupled with anxiety, it can contribute to a mental disorder that gives people an urge to pull their own hair out.\nStress and your body: Blood Sugar\nStress can raise blood sugar, and if you have type 2 diabetes, you may notice that your blood sugar levels are higher if you are stressed.\nStress and your body: Raises Blood Pressure\nBeing in a stressful situation can raise your blood pressure by constricting your blood vessels and speeding up your heart rate. While in most cases this is temporary, it’s unclear if chronic stress can cause long-lasting effects.\nStress and your body: Brain Tissue\nResearch now shows that major stress can actually reduce the amount of brain tissue in areas that regulate emotions and self-control.\n~ parts adapted via www.lifelinescreening.com\nStress and your body: More Symptoms Of A Stressed Out Life\nSome symptoms of stress are small and fairly easy to ignore - like eye twitches or mild acne - but others, like blood pressure or IBS, are far more serious. Whether your outward symptoms are mild or severe, seeing stress effects on your body means that it’s time to address the anxiety in your life and start getting back control!\nStress and your body: Stomachaches\nThe brain's nervous system is linked to the gut's, so mental stress can wreak havoc on your GI tract, says Bincy Abraham, M.D., a gastroenterologist at Baylor College of Medicine. Depending on your situation, your doctor may treat your tummy troubles with over-the-counter drugs (stool softeners), prescriptions (such as anti-nausea meds), or dietary changes (fiber can restore your gut's stress-ravaged helpful bacteria).\nIn the meantime, the best natural remedy for stress-caused constipation, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting is. . .exercise. It may sound like the last thing you want to do when your stomach is aching, but heading out for a run can boost endorphins that make the mind and gut feel better.\nStress and your body: Eyelid Twitching\nThese annoying muscle spasms typically occur around one eye and last for a few minutes. Stress is one of their most common causes, though doctors aren't quite sure why.\nWhen a twitch strikes, close your eyes, try to relax, and breathe deeply. Inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, then exhale for eight seconds. Repeat this four times while using a fingertip to put mild pressure on the lid that's twitching.\nOver-the-counter artificial tears can also help ease the spasms, which dry eyes can exacerbate, says Anne Sumers, M.D., of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. If the twitching spreads to other parts of your face, see a physician—it could be a more serious type of spasm.\nStress and your body: Acne\nJust like your hair, your skin is sensitive to those higher-than-normal androgens, which can bring on breakouts, says Sengelmann. Talk to your dermatologist if your zits keep coming back—the chronic inflammation can lead to scarring.\nOral and topical prescription medications, as well as certain soaps, can help unplug pores and wipe out the bacteria that cause acne. Your dermatologist might also suggest you go on birth control, or switch up what you're already on, to balance out your hormones. And be sure to stick to non-comedogenic (i.e., non-pore-clogging) makeup, moisturizers, and sunscreen.\n~ parts adapted via Women's Health\nWhat stress symptoms can you see in your own life?\nStress and Your Body: Love Your Body","Stress is how the body reacts to a real or imagined stressor — a stimulus that causes stress. Acute stressors affect a bodily organ in the short term; chronic stressors over the longer term. Chronic stress is the state of prolonged tension from internal or external stressors which may cause various physical manifestations such as asthma, back pain, arrhythmias, fatigue, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcers, and suppression of the immune system. Chronic stress takes a more significant toll on the body than acute stress. It can raise blood pressure, increase the risk of heart attack and stroke, and induce symptoms of anxiety and depression.\nThe Three Stages of Stress – From Acute to Chronic\n- Alarm: In this first stage, when the threat or stressor is first identified or realized, the body’s stress response is in a state of alarm. During this stage, adrenaline is produced in order to bring about the flight-or-fight response, causing sweating, raised heart rate, etc. The body’s resistance to the stressor drops temporarily below the normal range and some level of shock may be experienced. There is also some activation of the HPA Axis, producing cortisol, as discussed in our last post.\n- Resistance: If the stressor persists, the body must find some means of coping with the stress. Although it begins to try to adapt to the strains or demands of the environment, the body cannot keep this up indefinitely, so its resources are gradually depleted. As it attempts to cope with the condition that is causing the stress, the mind may try to focus on the problem, which can actually exaggerate the awareness of the problem and make it seem difficult to overcome.\n- Exhaustion: third stage. At this point, all of the body’s resources are eventually depleted and the body is unable to maintain normal function. The initial symptoms may reappear (sweating, raised heart rate, etc.). Long-term damage may result, as the body’s immune system becomes exhausted, and bodily functions become impaired. The result can manifest itself in obvious illnesses such as ulcers, depression, diabetes, digestive system problems or cardiovascular problems. It can also manifest as a chronic pain syndrome, guarding/avoidance behavior, and/or sleep disturbance. Hopelessness can set in.\nChronic Stress and Cortisol\nWhen the body’s HPA-axis cannot overcome a challenge and/or is chronically exposed to a threat, this system becomes overtaxed and can be harmful to the body and brain. An increased level of cortisol is one of the most dangerous outcomes of chronic stress.\nCortisol is an important hormone in the body, secreted by the adrenal glands and involved in some of the following functions: proper glucose metabolism, regulation of blood pressure, insulin release for blood sugar maintenance, immune function and inflammatory response. Normally, cortisol is present in the body at higher levels in the morning and is at its lowest level at night. Although stress is not the only reason that cortisol is secreted into the bloodstream, it has been termed “the stress hormone” because it’s also secreted in higher levels during the body’s ‘fight or flight’ response to stress, and is responsible for several stress-related changes in the body. Small increases of cortisol have some positive effects: a quick burst of energy for survival reasons, heightened memory functions, a burst of increased immunity, lower sensitivity to pain, and helping to maintain homeostasis in the body.\nPeople are biologically ‘wired’ to react differently to stress.\nWhile cortisol is an important part of the body’s response to stress, it is important that the body’s relaxation response be activated so the body’s functions can return to normal following a stressful event. Unfortunately, in our current high-stress culture, the body’s stress response is activated so often that the body doesn’t always have a chance to return to normal, resulting in a state of chronic stress, thus producing high chronic cortisol levels.\nHigher and more prolonged levels of cortisol in the bloodstream like those in chronic stress have been shown to have negative effects, such as:\n- Impaired cognitive performance (loss or poor concentration, inability to complete tasks or heightened confusion in mildly stressful situations\n- Suppressed thyroid function\n- Blood sugar imbalances such as hyperglycemia\n- Decreased bone density\n- Decrease in muscle tissue\n- Higher blood pressure\n- Lowered immunity and inflammatory responses in the body, slowed wound healing, and other health consequences\n- Increased abdominal fat, which is associated with a greater amount of health problems than fat deposited in other areas of the body.\nWhen people feel stressed, stress hormones can be over-secreted, dramatically affecting the brain. Cortisol also plays a large part in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and memory. In a 2002 article in Biological Psychiatry regarding cortisol, PTSD and memory1, cortisol was noted to work with epinephrine (adrenaline) to create memories of short-term emotional events. This effect may serve as a means to help a person remember what situations to avoid in the future. However, long-term exposure to cortisol damages cells in the hippocampus and can create impaired learning ability. It has been shown that cortisol inhibits memory retrieval of already stored information.\nCortisol secretion varies among individuals. People are biologically ‘wired’ to react differently to stress. One person may secrete higher levels of cortisol than another in the same situation. Studies have shown that people who secrete higher levels of cortisol in response to stress also tend to eat more food, and food that is higher in carbohydrates, than people who secrete less cortisol.\n1“Depression.

{"question":"请问新西兰的奶牛一年中有多少天可以在牧场上放养?","answer":"Based on data from the 2017-18 dairy season Farm Dairy Records, cows in New Zealand spend on average 97% of their non-milking time outside on pasture, which is more than 350 days of a year. This is significantly more than other major dairy exporting countries, with Ireland for example only allowing pasture access for about 255 days per year.","context":["No Products in the Cart\nWell, this is the problem you see. People think that 120 days, or 200 days or 300 days of access to the outside means \"grass-fed\". Or that eating silage in a barn means \"grass-fed\". What are the cows eating when they're not on the grass...it could be corn or grain....who knows! Is silage or hay as good as fresh pasture...of course not! So why should any animal that is not raised on pasture 24/7, 365 days per year, be considered grass fed? Simply put, it shouldn't, because anything less is rubbish.\nYes, if it's too cold for them, and it puts them in danger. But NZ isn't like parts of the US where it gets freezing cold. It is a temperate to subtropical climate so the cows can stay outdoors all year, roaming freely and eating as much grass as they please.\nYes, it does. Cows are ruminants which means that they are made to eat and digest grass and other pasture plants. When they are put onto a diet of grain or corn, they get sick more often which leads to unhealthy and unhappy animals and increased use of antibiotics. While those antibiotics don't end up in your food (all milk is tested and must be free of antibiotic residues), what it can cause is an increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria in animals, which has a knock on effect to other animals and therefore can impact our food chain and eventually, us.\nThere is no international standard that defines the term ‘Grass-fed’. For our suppliers, ‘Grass-fed’ means that our cows in New Zealand have access to pasture year-round and their diet consists predominately of grass and grass products such as grass silage, hay and forage crops (mainly legumes and brassica). For our suppliers cows in NZ, 96% is the current grass-fed percentage on a ‘as consumed’ basis. This data is reviewed annually and the average is measured over the previous three seasons data and subject to minor variation.\nBecause our suppliers farm the way that nature intended, they are subject to environmental conditions and there are times when grass growth is low e.g. if New Zealand experience a drought. During these times, pasture management practices and/or feeding of supplements may be used. Supplementary feeding ensures cows receive adequate nutrition and animal welfare requirements are met. Supplementary feeds mainly used on our supplier's New Zealand farms are maize silage, concentrates and palm kernel extract.\nTo substantiate the Access to Pasture Claims our supplier has compared their dairying system in New Zealand to major dairying competitor countries. Our supplier identified the top 15 dairy exporting countries (including New Zealand), based on their annual dairy product export volumes in 2017. Of these top 15 dairy exporting countries, only Ireland operates a similar pasture-based model to New Zealand. Other countries with non-pasture grazed farming systems will not compete with New Zealand or Ireland in terms of time on pasture due to the amount of time spent in housed environments. Our supplier has data that supports that their dairy cows in New Zealand spend more time on pasture than dairy cows in Ireland. Based on Irish data presented in O’Brien et al. 2018, dairy cows in Ireland have access to pasture, on average, 255 days per year. In New Zealand, data from our supplier 2017-18 dairy season Farm Dairy Records show that our our suppliers New Zealand cows spend, on average, 97% of their non-milking time outside on pasture which is more than 350 days of a year.\nIt's printed on the underside of the canister. Because our powder products are low in fat, they will typically last for about 2 years.\nWe recommend a 30g serve, which is approximately 2 tablespoons. There is a scoop in the canister but sometimes if gets buried in the powder, so you might have to take a fork and dig around for it!\nYes, please follow our link to our store if you prefer to buy off Amazon.\nWe recommend that Pounamu Protein products are kept in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight (i.e. your pantry!), and ideally are stored at temperatures not exceeding 25c/77F. However, we have not seen any issues where temperature has impacted the product quality to date.\nFor our Whey Protein Concentrate and Isolate, you can find it here.\nIt’s a question we get asked quite a lot….and the answer is “it depends”.\nOther than rare sources of raw milk (e.g. raw milk cheese) that aren’t relevant to Pounamu Protein products, all commercially available milk and dairy products in the USA are heat treated for food safety reasons. This process is called pasteurization and is done to remove pathogenic (i.e. harmful) bacteria with a quick heat treatment of 161°F for 15 seconds. Food law also requires milk and dairy products to be pasteurized to be exported from New Zealand. Pasteurization is a heat step, but it has very little impact on milk proteins and all major milk proteins remain in their original/native state.\nOur supplier of whey proteins has a variety of ingredients specially designed and processed for optimal nutrition and functionality in the finished products you receive. For ready to mix powders the processing is as gentle and cool as possible to ensure optimal solubility so you can enjoy a smooth shake. On the other hand, whey protein for nutrition bars makes for a more enjoyable eating experience with higher heat processing, hence in our bar proteins the processes are hotter, but the nutritional benefits remain the same.\nThe “Cold Processed” question seems to arise from a belief that heating denatures (or unravels) protein molecules, and that it may impact its nutritional goodness. Some extreme heat steps will lead to amino acid loss (and therefore nutrition loss), but these are not used in the dairy industry today and so are not applied to our ingredients.\nFor more about protein denaturation, see our comments in the next Q&A post…\nThis is another question we get asked quite a lot….and the answer (again) is “it depends”.\nProtein denaturation is the term used to describe a change in the form of a protein from its original ‘native’ state, to a new form. Imagine a ball of string unravelling. This can be caused by many things, including acid, agitation, and heat.\nMilk protein is made up of 2 types of proteins– casein and whey. Casein is unstable and gels (i.e. denatures) when exposed to acid (like when you add lemon juice to milk, or when fermentation produces acid to make delicious, nutritious yogurt), however it is heat stable. In the case of whey proteins, they are sensitive to heat, and that is the main cause of whey protein denaturation. You may have seen this already when you heat a cup of milk and there is a skin left on the top as it cools – that is the whey protein denaturing with heat.\nOur supplier makes a whole range of different whey proteins for different purposes. Some are not denatured (aka “native proteins”) and some are highly denatured. Each has different benefits depending on the application that they are being used in i.e. powdered drink mixes vs bars, and all are still highly nutritious.\nDenaturation of protein impacts the solubility of the protein i.e. how it dissolves when added to liquid. Heavily denatured protein is often insoluble, meaning that if you mix it in water, it won’t dissolve. If a heavily denatured protein is used in an RTM shake, it wouldn’t be very nice to drink. That doesn’t mean that your body can’t digest it or use the nutrients and amino acids that it provides. It may change the speed at which your body digests it, but a lot of the time that remains the same too, which is the case for our proteins.\nMany common proteins are denatured to provide a more enjoyable eating experience – think about cooking a steak, or frying an egg where the texture and the taste both change when you cook them. They both are still nutritious and the cooking process provides the key to unlocking the nutritional benefits of that protein by making it more desirable to eat. Controlled denaturation is a good thing in some applications as the highly denatured protein provides enhanced texture, a better flavor, or makes the product more digestible. For example, the protein that is typically used in bars is often highly denatured so that it retains the soft texture and structure of the bar over time, where a regular WPC goes much harder and is much chewier, making the bar less enjoyable to eat.\nYes our dairy protein is tested for Heavy Metals via a national testing program NZ and also periodically tested in independent labs in NZ and in the US.\nBelow is further information on the NZ testing program:\nNew Zealand's raw milk supply is monitored through the National Chemical Contaminants Program (NCCP), operated by New Zealand's Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI). The program has been effective in confirming that dairy products are free of chemical residues at levels that could pose a threat to human health or to international trade. NCCP testing has shown that raw milk is very low in heavy metal contaminants and provide assurance that the entire NZ Dairy Industry being free of harmful levels of heavy metals.\nOur dairy protein is periodically tested by IANZ accredited external laboratories for heavy metals and other elements of interest. Our products have shown to be very low in these contaminants. Pounamu Protein confirms that no heavy metals are added to products and any levels detected are naturally occurring in milk.\nLink to general information about the program: here\nLink to the elements tested under the NCCP and the limits allowable: here\nYes, the mono and di-glycerides in our product are plant-derived.\nYes, our cocoa/cacao provider is committed to sustainable and transparent sourcing of cocoa. They have a program in place that tracks the exact name and location of the farms that the product comes from. They are also members of the Cocoa and Forest initiative and are RSPO certified.\nThey have commitments focusing on the following three areas:\nPeople: including efforts around women's empowerment, child protection and family health to enhance the overall living conditions of their farming partners. They respect human rights and promote a safe and decent work environment throughout the supply chain.\nPlanet: safeguarding the environment, addressing climate change, and preserving the planet for future generations. They promote reforestation, water conservation, and the improvement of soil fertility.\nProsperity: Creating economic opportunities by improving farm management, supporting skills development, encouraging entrepreneurship, providing literacy trainings and increasing access to village savings and loan associations.\nWe have thoroughly reviewed their programs and feel it is a good approach to the issues that can surround cocoa farming in developing countries.

{"question":"Can you explain how Eureka moments represent scientific breakthroughs, and what environmental concerns surround modern technological innovations like cryptocurrency mining?","answer":"Eureka moments in science represent sudden breakthroughs that come after accumulating knowledge and observations, as exemplified by Archimedes' discovery of water displacement and Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. These moments don't appear out of thin air but occur when the brain makes connections between existing knowledge. As for environmental concerns in modern innovation, cryptocurrency mining exemplifies this challenge, consuming massive amounts of energy (estimated at 128.84 TWh annually for bitcoin alone, more than Argentina's consumption) and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions due to its reliance on non-renewable energy sources like coal and natural gas for powering its computational processes.","context":["Looking for the Saint Louis Science Center’s new blog? Well, “Eureka!” – You have found it! Now that you’re here, you can find all sorts of things, from what’s going on at the Science Center to what’s going on in space. Take a look around and see for yourself!\nSo you probably have a few questions. Why is our blog named Eureka!? And who is that weird old man?\nLegend has it that over 2,200 years ago King Hieron of Syracuse (in Sicily) gave a goldsmith a bar of gold and ordered him to fashion it into a gold crown. Once the crown was made, it appeared to weigh the exact same amount as the bar of gold the king had provided, but Hieron had some doubts. He thought the goldsmith had cheated him by pocketing some of the gold, then mixing some silver into the crown to make up for the lost weight. But how could the king prove it?\n|Archimedes, the man behind the inspiration for the Saint Louis Science Center blog, Eureka!|\nBy making a scientist figure it out, of course! Hieron tasked Archimedes (mathematician, astronomer, scientist, engineer, and inventor extraordinaire) with figuring out if he had been robbed by the goldsmith. But here’s the kicker – Archimedes was not allowed to take the crown apart or damage it in any way. Archimedes had absolutely no clue how to do this. The crown looked gold and weighed exactly what it ought to have weighed. How on earth was he supposed to figure this out without melting it down and seeing if there was some silver in there?\nArchimedes was stumped. And apparently, also dirty. So he went to take a bath. (Hygiene is important.) Supposedly, as Archimedes stepped into the bath, he noticed that the water level rose as more of his body was submerged. All of a sudden it hit him – the volume of an object could be determined by placing the object in a tub filled to the brim with water, then measuring the amount of water that spilled over. And since silver is less dense than gold, it would occupy more space than an equivalent weight of pure gold.\nWith this flash of brilliance, Archimedes supposedly leapt out of the bath and ran (naked!) through the streets of Syracuse to find the king, shouting, “Eureka!” – “I have found it!” (He also, according to legend, found that the goldsmith was in fact a thief.)\nSo there you have it! Our blog is named after the exclamation made by an old man running naked through town. (Kids, don’t try this at home unless the local king has offered you a get-out-of-jail-free card.)\nThe Eureka Effect\nBut of course, that’s not really true. Eureka! is named after the excitement of scientific discovery, not a naked old scientist. Because Eureka! is more than just this one story. Eureka! is a celebration of that moment when you suddenly understand something that was previously incomprehensible. Many scientific discoveries have been attributed to this “Eureka Effect.” Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity supposedly came to him in a moment of inspiration following a discussion with friend Michele Besso. Fourteen-year-old (!) Philo Farnsworth allegedly had a Eureka! moment while plowing a potato field – while watching the back and forth motion of the till, Farnsworth realized that an electron beam could scan an image line by line, thus leading to his invention of the image dissector and then the television.\n|Trying out the tangrams at the Math Cart!|\nBut Eureka! moments don’t just happen to famous scientists and inventors. Have you ever spent hours trying to solve a particularly troubling puzzle, only to have the answer pop into your head suddenly? (This happens to me all the time when I try to solve the tangram puzzles on the Science Center’s Math Cart. Those things are tough!) Or have you ever suddenly just “gotten” a concept you’ve been struggling to understand forever? (Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion? Not as unfathomable as my high-school-self thought…)\nEureka! moments are about more than a sudden flash of discovery. These moments don’t appear out of thin air. People can only have these epiphanies after creating a warehouse of observations and knowledge in their brain. Eureka! moments are those special times when your brain makes connections between things you maybe didn’t even know you already knew.\nSo keep exploring, keep trying new things, and keep paying attention – you never know when your next Eureka! moment may hit.\nWritten by Betsy, Research & Evaluation","As the world becomes more conscious of sustainability, the environmental impact of industries and businesses is under the microscope.

In this article, we will explore the environmental concerns of cryptocurrency and ways to mitigate its impact while continuing to promote its benefits.\nRead more: Silvergate Collapse Dragging Down Bitcoin Volume\nCryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses encryption techniques to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds. It is decentralized and operates on a peer-to-peer network that enables secure, fast, and anonymous transactions. Cryptocurrency has gained popularity in recent years, with bitcoin being the most well-known example. However, the process of generating cryptocurrency, known as mining, requires significant computational power, which consumes a massive amount of energy.\nThe amount of energy consumed by cryptocurrency mining has sparked concerns about its environmental impact. According to a 2021 report by the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the annual energy consumption of bitcoin mining alone is estimated to be around 128.84 TWh, which is more than the energy consumption of Argentina. The high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, as the majority of the energy used comes from non-renewable sources like coal and natural gas.\nThe Environmental Impact of Cryptocurrency\nCryptocurrency mining is a highly energy-intensive process that requires specialized computer equipment and software. The process involves solving complex mathematical problems to verify transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. The first miner to solve the puzzle is rewarded with a certain amount of cryptocurrency.\nTo mine cryptocurrency, miners need to use powerful computers, which consume a considerable amount of energy. The energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is a function of the computing power used and the time it takes to solve the problem. As the difficulty of the problem increases, more computing power is required, which leads to a higher energy consumption.\nThe high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has a significant impact on the environment. Most of the energy used to power cryptocurrency mining comes from non-renewable sources like coal and natural gas. The combustion of fossil fuels leads to the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming and climate change. The increase in greenhouse gas emissions from cryptocurrency mining is a concern as it undermines global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.\nMitigating the Environmental Impact of Cryptocurrency\nThe environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining can be mitigated by adopting sustainable practices. Some of the ways to reduce the energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining are:\nUsing renewable energy sources: One of the most effective ways to reduce the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining is to use renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Some cryptocurrency mining companies are already using renewable energy to power their operations. For example, the cryptocurrency mining company, Square, has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030.\nDeveloping energy-efficient mining equipment: Cryptocurrency mining companies can reduce their energy consumption by developing energy-efficient mining equipment. For example, some companies are developing ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) that are designed to consume less energy than traditional computer processors.\nImplementing proof-of-stake consensus mechanism: Another way to reduce the energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is to implement the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Proof-of-stake is an alternative to proof-of-work, which is the current consensus mechanism used by most cryptocurrencies. Proof-of-stake does not require miners to solve complex mathematical problems to verify transactions. Instead, it relies on a random selection process to choose a validator who is responsible for verifying transactions. Validators are required to hold a certain amount of cryptocurrency, which acts as a stake. If a validator acts maliciously, their stake is forfeited. The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is less energy-intensive than proof-of-work, making it a more sustainable alternative.\nCarbon offsetting: Cryptocurrency mining companies can offset their carbon emissions by investing in renewable energy projects or purchasing carbon credits. Carbon offsetting is a way to neutralize the carbon emissions associated with cryptocurrency mining by investing in sustainable projects that reduce carbon emissions.\nBalancing Sustainability and Innovation\nCryptocurrency has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry by providing financial democratization and decentralization. However, this cannot come at the expense of the environment. The challenge is to balance sustainability with innovation. The cryptocurrency industry needs to take responsibility for its environmental impact and take steps to mitigate its carbon footprint. It is essential to recognize that sustainability and innovation are not mutually exclusive goals, but rather complementary.\nSustainability is a key factor in the long-term success of cryptocurrency. As the world becomes more conscious of the environment, consumers are looking for sustainable products and services. The cryptocurrency industry needs to recognize this trend and take steps to reduce its carbon footprint. By adopting sustainable practices, the cryptocurrency industry can attract a more environmentally conscious audience.\nCryptocurrency has the potential to transform the financial industry by providing financial democratization and decentralization. However, the high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has sparked concerns about its environmental impact. To balance sustainability and innovation, the cryptocurrency industry needs to take responsibility for its carbon footprint and adopt sustainable practices. By using renewable energy sources, developing energy-efficient mining equipment, implementing proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, and carbon offsetting, the cryptocurrency industry can mitigate its environmental impact. Sustainability is not a trade-off for innovation, but rather a complementary goal that is essential for the long-term success of the cryptocurrency industry."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2b863c7b-807a-41e8-9c6b-bb98436944b0>","<urn:uuid:16d423b7-32cb-493a-822d-c068233478c4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you explain what makes a contract condition 'independent' versus 'dependent', and why is this distinction important in contract law?","answer":"A contract condition's classification as independent or dependent determines whether breach of one obligation excuses performance of the other. With independent conditions, breach of one covenant does not excuse performance of the other. With dependent conditions, both parties' obligations are linked - neither party is in default until one party performs or tenders performance. This distinction can be crucial in determining whether parties must fulfill their obligations despite the other party's breach.","context":["A condition in a contract is a fact, the happening or nonhappening of which creates or extinguishes a duty on the part of the promisor. If the promisor makes an absolute or unconditional promise, he must perform when the time arrives. But if the promisor makes a conditional promise, he must perform only if the condition precedent occurs. The promise may be dependent upon the performance of another condition, in which case they would be dependant and concurrent conditions. In this case neither party is in default until one party performs or tenders performance. In the typical real estate contract seen by Sacramento real estate attorneys, delivery of the deed and payment of the purchase price are dependent and concurrent conditions. There must be performance or tender thereof by one party to put the other in default. In a recent decision, the court agreed with the swindled would-be buyer, who argued that return of their $3 million dollar deposit was an independent condition\nIn Rutherford Holdings, LLC v. Plaza Del Rey, Rutherford contracted to buy a mobile home park from Plaza, and provided a deposit of $3 million dollars. The agreement provided that the deposit was nonrefundable unless Plaza materially breached the purchase agreement or failed or refused to close.\nPrior to the closing date, Plaza told the buyer that Plaza could reduce its property tax bill for the year if it was not in this contract for sale. The contract would increase the value that the tax was based on. If they did not close by the closing date, the tax would be based on a lesser value. Plaza promised the buyer that they would sell the property after the closing date, and after Plaza filed it tax returns. The buyer agreed! The closing date came and went and neither party performed; Plaza never tendered the deed to Rutherford, and Rutherford never tendered the full purchase price to Plaza. Plaza paid less in taxes, then said they would not sell the property to Rutherford, plus they were keeping the deposit, ha ha! This suit followed.\nThe court first noted that in a contract for the sale of real estate the delivery of the deed and the payment of the purchase price are dependent and concurrent conditions. Where the parties’ contractual obligations constitute concurrent conditions, neither party is in default until one party performs or tenders performance. However, here, the buyer argued that the seller’s obligation to return the deposit was independent of the Buyer’s promise to pay the full purchase price. If the two covenants are independent, breach of one does not excuse performance of the other. The buyer’s failure to place the money in escrow did not excuse Plaza’s failure to return the deposit.\nIn this case the Court was looking at whether the Complaint sufficiently described a legitimate claim. Where an ambiguous contract is the basis of an action, the parties are expected to provide their own interpretation of its meaning. If their interpretation is not clearly incorrect, the court accepts as correct plaintiff’s allegations as to the meaning of the agreement.\nHere, the purchase agreement can be reasonably interpreted to mean what the Buyer has claimed. “While [that] interpretation … ultimately may prove invalid,” at the pleading stage, it is sufficient that the agreement is reasonably susceptible of this meaning.” Thus, the Buyer had properly made the claim that return of the deposit was an independent condition, and should have been returned. It’s too bad this buyer had to go through the appeal process at this stage of the lawsuit. The seller seems to be a real con artist, convincing the buyer to let the contract lapse with a promise to sell on the same terms, then keeping the $3 million dollar deposit."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:44290366-106f-4fbe-a958-07c238955dc1>"],"error":null}

It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.\nAll medicines and vaccines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of your child having INFANRIX-IPV against the benefits they expect it will have.\nIf you have any concerns about your child receiving this vaccine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.\nKeep this leaflet with the vaccine. You may need to read it again.\nWhat INFANRIX-IPV is used for\nINFANRIX-IPV is a vaccine used in infants from 6 weeks of age and over to prevent four diseases, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough) and poliomyelitis (polio). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these diseases.\nDiphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis are all serious life-threatening diseases caused by bacterial infection. Poliomyelitis is an infectious disease caused by viral infection.\nDiphtheria mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin. Generally the airways become inflamed (swollen) causing severe breathing difficulties and sometimes suffocation. The bacteria also release a toxin (poison), which can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and death. The risk of serious complications and death is greater in the very young and elderly.\nTetanus bacteria enter the body through wounded skin. Wounds that are especially prone to infection are burns, fractures, deep wounds or wounds contaminated with soil, dust, horse manure or wood splinters. The bacteria release a toxin (poison), which can cause muscle stiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and death. The spasms can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine. The death rate is 30-40% of cases.\nPertussis (Whooping cough)\nPertussis is a highly infectious illness. The disease affects the breathing tract causing severe spells of coughing that may interfere with normal breathing. The coughing is often accompanied by a ‘whooping’ sound. The cough may last for 1-2 months or longer. Pertussis can also cause inner ear infections, long-lasting bronchitis, pneumonia, fits, brain damage and death. The risk of severe complications and death is greatest in infants under 6 months of age. The death rate is 0.5% for infants under 6 months of age.\nPolio is a viral infection that can have variable effects. Often it causes only a mild illness but in some people it causes permanent injury or death.\nIn its severest form, polio infection causes paralysis of the muscles, including those needed for breathing and walking. Polio infection can leave a person unable to breathe without the help of an iron lung machine, unable to walk without leg braces, or confined to a wheel chair. The limbs affected by the disease may be painfully deformed.\nVaccination is the best way to protect against these diseases. INFANRIX-IPV cannot give your child diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis or polio infection. The vaccine will not protect against diseases caused by other types of bacteria, viruses or organisms.\nAsk your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed. Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason.\nThis vaccine is available only with a doctor's prescription.\nThere is not enough information to recommend the use of this medicine for children under the age of 6 weeks.\nBefore your child is given INFANRIX-IPV\nWhen your child must not be given it\nDo not have INFANRIX-IPV if:\n- your child has had an allergic reaction:\n– to INFANRIX-IPV, or any ingredient contained in this vaccine. The ingredients in INFANRIX-IPV are listed at the end of this leaflet\n– to any other vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis or inactivated polio (such as Infanrix®, Triple Antigen™, Tripacel™ or Ipol™ vaccine)\nSome of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include:\n– shortness of breath\n– wheezing or difficulty breathing\n– swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body\n– rash, itching or hives on the skin\n- your child experienced a disease of the brain within 7 days after previous vaccination with a pertussis containing vaccine.\nINFANRIX-IPV should not be given after the expiry date printed on the pack or if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering. If it has expired or is damaged, return it to your pharmacist for disposal.\nIf you are not sure whether your child should have INFANRIX-IPV, talk to your doctor or nurse.\nBefore your child is given INFANRIX-IPV\nTell your doctor if your child has any of the following medical problems:\n- after having INFANRIX-IPV or another pertussis-containing vaccine (such as Infanrix® or Triple Antigen™) your child had any problems, especially:\n– a high temperature (40.0°C) within 2 days of vaccination\n– a collapse or shock-like state within 2 days of vaccination\n– crying lasting 3 hours or more within 2 days of vaccination\n– convulsions (seizures/fits) with or without a fever within 3 days of vaccination\n- brain disease or central nervous system (CNS) disease (ie. epilepsy etc.)\n- a tendency to febrile convulsions (seizures/fits due to a fever or high body temperature)\n- a family history of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)\n- your child has a severe infection with a high temperature. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor or nurse about this before vaccination\n- a bleeding problem or bruises easily\n- allergy to the antibiotics neomycin sulfate and polymyxin sulfate.\n- lowered immunity due to medical treatment or a medical condition\n- your child has breathing difficulties. This may be more common in the first three days following vaccination if your child is born prematurely (before or at 28 weeks of pregnancy)\n- your child fainted with a previous injection. Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection.\nTell your doctor if your child has allergies to any other medicines, foods, preservatives or dyes.\nIf you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell him/her before your child is given INFANRIX-IPV.\nTaking other medicines\nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if your child is taking any other medicines, including any that you get without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop. Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid when your child is given INFANRIX-IPV.\nHaving other vaccines\nTell your doctor or nurse if your child has received another vaccine recently.\nSome vaccines may be affected by other vaccines. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will be able to tell you what to do if INFANRIX-IPV is to be given with another vaccine.\nHow INFANRIX-IPV is given\nThe doctor or nurse will give INFANRIX-IPV as an injection.\nIf you have any concerns about how this vaccine is to be given, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.\nHow much is given\nThe dose of INFANRIX-IPV is 0.5 mL.\nHow it is given\nINFANRIX-IPV will be injected into the upper leg muscle in infants under 12 months of age. In children over 12 months of age the injection may be given in the upper arm muscle instead.\nEach dose of INFANRIX-IPV is for single u\nAny residual vacc\nine must be discarded.\nThe vaccine should never be given intravenously.\nWhen it is given\nINFANRIX-IPV is usually given as a total of three doses as follows:\n- First dose: 2 months of age\n- Second dose: 4 months of age\n- Third dose: 6 months of age\nEach dose is given on a separate visit.\nINFANRIX-IPV should not be given at birth.\nIt is also recommended that children up to 6 years of age receive a single booster (follow up) dose of INFANRIX-IPV.\nIt is important to return at the recommended times for follow up doses.\nYou should discuss with your doctor what is needed for your child.\nIf a dose is missed\nIf your child misses a scheduled dose, talk to your doctor or nurse and arrange another visit as soon as possible.\nIf you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.\nWhile being given INFANRIX-IPV\nThings you must do\nKeep your child’s follow up visits with the doctor or clinic. It is important the follow-up doses of INFANRIX-IPV are given at the correct times. This will ensure the best effect of the vaccine in protecting your child against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and poliovirus infection.\nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist as soon as possible if your child does not feel well during or after having had INFANRIX-IPV.\nINFANRIX-IPV helps protect most children from diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and poliovirus infection, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few children. All medicines and vaccines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious; most of the time they are not. Some side effects may need medical attention.\nThe chance of your child having a serious side effect is very much less than the chance of your child having a permanent injury from the natural infections.\nDo not be alarmed by the following lists of side effects. Your child may not experience any of them.\nAsk your doctor, nurse or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.\nMost unwanted effects with INFANRIX-IPV are mild and usually clear up within a few days. These effects, as with other vaccines, generally occur around the injection site.\nTell your doctor if your child has any of the following that are troublesome or ongoing:\n- pain, redness, swelling, a hard lump around the injection site\n- fever between 38°C and 39.5°C, generally feeling unwell, runny nose or loss of appetite\n- unusual crying (for more than 1 hour), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache\n- sleepiness, tiredness, nervousness, restlessness, fussiness or difficulty sleeping\n- skin rash, bruising, or purple or red-brown spots visible through the skin (purpura).\nMORE SERIOUS EFFECTS\nTell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following:\n- fever greater than 39.5°C\n- crying for 3 hours or more\n- collapse, or periods of unconsciousness or lack of awareness\n- seizures (convulsions) or fits.\nContact your doctor immediately or take your child to the casualty department of your nearest hospital if any of the following happens:\n- sudden sign of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of limbs, face, eyes, lips, mouth, throat or other part of the body\n- shortness of breath, breathing or swallowing difficulties\n- unusual tiredness or weakness that is sudden and severe.\nThese are signs of an allergic reaction. As with all vaccines given by injection there is a very small risk of such reactions. Allergy to INFANRIX-IPV is rare. Any such severe reactions will usually occur within the first few hours of vaccination.\nOther events reported after INFANRIX-IPV vaccination, but not necessarily related to the vaccine include:\n- coughing, respiratory infections, bronchitis or viral\n- infection of the middle ear that may cause earache and temporary hearing loss\n- toothache, sore throat.\nOther side effects not listed above, can also occur during or soon after a dose of INFANRIX-IPV.\nCheck with your doctor or nurse if your child has any other side effects.\nHow to store INFANRIX-IPV\nINFANRIX-IPV is usually stored at the doctor’s clinic or surgery, or at the pharmacy.\nIf you need to store INFANRIX-IPV always:\n- Keep INFANRIX-IPV in the refrigerator stored between +2°C and +8°C\nTHE PACK SHOULD NEVER BE FROZEN. FREEZING DESTROYS THE VACCINE\n- Keep the vaccine out of the reach of children\n- Keep INFANRIX-IPV in the original pack until it is time for it to be given.\n- INFANRIX-IPV should be used immediately after opening.\nIf the expiry date has passed, ask your pharmacist what to do with any vaccine that is left over.\nWhat it looks like\nINFANRIX-IPV comes in a prefilled syringe. It is a white, slightly milky liquid.\nThe active ingredients of INFANRIX-IPV are non-infectious substances from tetanus, diphtheria bacteria, purified proteins of pertussis bacteria and inactivated poliovirus.\nThe vaccine cannot cause these diseases.\nEach 0.5 mL dose contains:\n- 30 IU (25 Lf U) of diphtheria toxoid\n- 40 IU (10 Lf U) of tetanus toxoid\n- 25 micrograms of pertussis toxoid, 25 micrograms of filamentous haemagglutinin and 8 micrograms of pertactin\n- 40 D-antigen units of poliovirus Type 1, 8 D-antigen units of poliovirus Type 2 and 32 D-antigen units of poliovirus Type 3.\nThe inactive ingredients in the vaccine are: aluminium hydroxide, medium 199, sodium chloride (salt) and water for injection.

{"question":"What's the difference between normal performance nerves and stage anxiety, and how do vocal soloists prepare to convey emotions in their performances?","answer":"According to Professor Knight, nerves are a natural part of performing since musicians want to do their best, while anxiety involves deeper worry and uncertainty. To manage this, performers need clear technical foundations and musical knowledge. For vocal soloists specifically, there's an additional challenge of conveying emotions, as demonstrated by Hillsdale performers Sarah Schutte and Katherine Scheu. They must tell a story even when songs are removed from their original operatic context. For instance, Scheu performs two contrasting arias - one tragic from Puccini's 'Tosca' and one comic from Strauss' 'Die Fledermaus' - requiring different emotional portrayals and technical control.","context":["Orchestra concerts are always team events. But at the Hillsdale College symphony orchestra’s two spring concerts, four virtuosos will get the chance to shine solo.\nLast Monday, the Music Department announced the winners of their annual concerto and aria competition. Out of the 23 hopefuls who auditioned, sophomore violinist Tova Forman and junior mezzo soprano Sarah Schutte were tapped to perform at the concert on March 9, while junior pianist Micah Heinz and junior soprano Katherine Scheu will perform on May 11.\nJunior flautist Heather Woodhouse and junior cellist Greg Farison tied for first runner-up.\nA concerto is a composition written for solo instrument and orchestra, making it one of the best showcases for individual talent in an orchestral setting. Hillsdale’s orchestra has performed concertos at their concerts since the early 2000s, giving the college’s best virtuosos a spotlight to strut their stuff.\nForman, a student of Professor of Music Melissa Knecht, will perform Bela Bartok’s “Romanian Folk Dances” on the violin.\n“I enjoy the challenge of stepping out of the classical, to a degree, and imitating the shepherd’s pipe,” Forman said. “You don’t get that strain of haunting wildness in classical music, I think. The more I play Bartok, the more I want to share him.”\nIn addition to the technical difficulty, the vocalists will face an extra challenge in their performances: summoning their audience’s emotions with a song plucked from its operatic context.\n“You’re still trying to tell a story with the song,” Schutte said. “When people come to the concert, you’ll get program notes, but for the audition you just have to sell it. You know the context that you’re trying to portray, you need to figure out how to portray that emotion, too. You need to pick something, you need to act it out, you need to be that character. It may not be what that scene says, but it’s what you are trying to convey.”\nSchutte will sing “Hör’ ich Cymbalklänge,” a “Lied und Csardas” (song and dance) from Franz Lehár’s “Zigeunerliebe” and an aria from Wolfgang Mozart’s “Così fan tutte” entitled “Smanie implacabili.”\nScheu will perform arias from a pair of operas: “Vissi D’Arte” from Giacomo Puccini’s “Tosca” and “Klangë der Heimat” from Johann Strauss’ “Die Fledermaus.” One aria is comic; the other tragic.\n“They couldn’t be more different from each other,” Scheu said. “In the ‘Vissi D’Arte,’ the protagonist finds out that her boyfriend’s going to be executed unless she sleeps with this guy, the antagonist. In the second, on a different note, a woman decides that she thinks her husband is cheating on her, so she goes to a party that he’s going to and dresses up as a different woman, to woo him and prove that he’s cheating on her — with her.”\nOne thing they do have in common with each other and with the other performers’ pieces — they’re hard.\n“Both of the songs are total workouts,” Scheu said. “The first one is very controlled … Basically, I hold a super high note for a really long time as loud as I can, and then in the same breath start to decrescendo and come down a couple notes. Then I just hold it there for a long time. So it’s really hard; it takes a ton of control and a very mature voice to sort of master it. I haven’t mastered it yet, but I’m getting close, which is fun.”\nHeinz will perform the first movement Camille Saint-Saens’ Concerto No. 5 in F Major, nicknamed “The Egyptian.”\n“I first heard the piece in early 2016 when Professor Blackham suggested that I listen to Saint-Saens’ concertos to get ideas for this competition,” Heinz said. “I fell in love with the piece and became immediately obsessed with it. The composer does a masterful job of weaving the piano and orchestra parts together to emphasize the strengths of both, requiring them to depend on each other to create something beautiful.”\nNow that the winners have been announced, the performers have a few months to get acquainted with performing with the orchestra — and the orchestra can use that time to learn the music. It’s a process they’re looking forward to.\n“I’m really excited about this opportunity to perform with the orchestra,” Heinz said. “I’ve competed in similar competitions before, but never won, so this is definitely a first for me.”","The Violin Channel member Janet Johnson, from the United States was keen to know: ‘What are your best tips for overcoming stage anxiety?’\nWe threw Janet’s question over to British cellist and Royal Academy of Music Professor, Ms Josephine Knight:\nFirstly there is a big difference between nerves and anxiety. Nerves are a natural part of a musician`s life. As performers we care very much and want to do our best, and part of playing well is to be nervous. Anxiety is more complex and tricky. Anxiety equals worry and uncertainty. Take away the uncertainty and there is less place for anxiety.\nAs a teacher I do have students who wish to discuss nerves, but interestingly I find that once technical foundations are established and musical knowledge and ideas activated, there is less talk of nerves. Having no ‘grey’ area of how you achieve your best, but clarity of thought enables you to channel those nerves into positives and ultimately allows yourself to become free and at one with the music. The mind can play tricks on you, fear of perhaps failing and messing up; but it’s training the mind to focus.\nI often discuss preparation tactics with my students; making sure they have practised intelligently, implementing formulas and with clear musical intent. Feeling in control, knowing you have prepared well, can only be a positive mantra for a successful concert.\nVisualising the moment of walking on stage has also proved very helpful, picturing the venue, or stage of the concert hall will already increase your heart rate and therefore enable the brain to get used to the feeling and take away any shock. I remember when I gave my BBC Proms concerto debut at the Royal Albert Hall in London which seats around 6,500 people and was going out `Live` on BBC Radio 3. I made time to go and play in the hall early one morning to give myself a taste of what it would feel like to fill such a huge space with sound. How one draws the bow across the string in such a huge hall as this, is completely different from a practise room scenario. Hearing the sound drifting away into this vast area, was invaluable for me before such an important concert. Also the experience of travelling down through the dark narrow corridor before walking on to this magnificent stage, the history present from years of other musicians, conductors and orchestras who had walked the same path, who perhaps would of had the same anticipation and nerves, was both humbling and inspiring.\nFor me, to practise well and prepare myself both mentally and physically enables me to enjoy the important aspects of the performance. When I`m nervous I will go into a zone of thinking about what I want to say musically and try not to get tied up with technical thoughts as this would of been covered in my practice. Even down to what you eat and how much you exercise can make a difference to how you feel. I always have a fixed routine on the day of a performance, musicians love routine and I have the same one (if it would make a difference if I didn’t follow the routine who knows!) but my performance day always allows time for a sleep, my preferred meal before a concert is a honey sandwich and a banana and lastly I always try to jog on the spot for about 5-6 minutes about half an hour before walking on stage as this will raise your heart rate and improve circulation which helps warm the fingers and increase oxygen to the brain.\nUltimately it’s about emotionally feeling something and sharing this with your listeners.\nProfessor Josephine Knight currently serves the Alfredo Piatti Chair of Cello at the Royal Academy of Music in London. She has performed concertos with leading orchestras in Europe and the U.K. – and has appeared as a soloist at the BBC Proms. She has recorded CDs for Deutsche Grammophon, EMI and Chandos.\nDo you have a burning question for one of the Pros?

{"question":"How do the professional conduct standards compare between IT audits and the Annual Filing Season Program?","answer":"Both IT audits and the AFSP have professional conduct standards, but they focus on different areas. IT audit conduct standards focus on evaluating system integrity, availability and confidentiality through IT General Controls and IT Application Controls. The AFSP's conduct standards, detailed in Circular 230, are more tax-preparation specific, requiring preparers to be diligent in preparing accurate returns, avoid unconscionable fees, return client records, avoid conflicts of interest, avoid deceptive advertising, and follow best practices in tax preparation. While IT audits aim to protect organizational IT infrastructure, AFSP standards aim to protect clients and ensure ethical tax preparation practices.","context":["In 2020, an IT audit is important for all organizations. It provides insights into the business’s IT infrastructure and how it can be improved. People are usually not familiar with the term and this article will help them realize the importance of an IT audit.\nIn general, an audit sounds quite scary.\nWho wants to get a letter from the IRS about opening an audit into your financial accounts?\nHowever, an IT audit is different. Organizations hire IT auditors to analyze their organization’s IT infrastructure to see if everything is up to par. It’s mostly the executives, in particular, the CEO, COO, and CFO that request an IT audit.\nIT audits are mostly conducted because people on an executive-level don’t know what exactly is happening in their IT department. Whether the business is outsourcing its IT tasks or have an internal IT team.\nIf things are not looking up in the IT department lately, or there have been a lot of downtimes, then it’s time for an IT audit!\nIn the IT audits guide, we will discuss:\n- What is an IT audit?\n- Importance of an IT audit\n- Components of an IT audit\n- How to prepare for an IT audit\n- IT audit process\n- What is the outcome of an IT audit?\nWhat is an IT Audit?\nIT audit, also known as, information system audit is the examination of an organization’s IT infrastructure, policies, and procedures.\nIT audits started in the mid-1960s and have gone through several changes. They play an important part in keeping an organization’s IT policies and procedures up-to-date.\nImportance of An IT Audit\nEvery business needs an IT department. It may be an internal team, remote team, or maybe you outsource your organization’s IT tasks.\nIn any case, the threat of cyber-sabotage is real. A cybercriminal can steal your data, and ruin your enterprise’s reputation leading to a major loss. If your organization’s employees and executives understand the importance of IT audit, it also means they understand the concept of cybersecurity.\nIn the information age, data is your biggest asset. Unlike physical assets, you cannot protect data by building walls and safes. Cyber threats are like Trojan horses, appearing friendly, but holding surprises.\nHowever, the threat does not necessarily come from outside. It can also be internal. Like an employee misusing or mishandling IT equipment. For example, a phishing attack can happen if an employee clicks on an insecure link on their work computers.\nIn conclusion: technology is vital AND vulnerable!\nWhat your business needs, is someone to analyze the complete IT infrastructure and make sure that your assets are safe.\nRemember, the integrity of your IT system can be the difference between success and failure!\nComponents of an IT Audit\nIT audit can be broadly divided into two types:\n- IT General Controls (ITGC): they exist to assure the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of data. These are the basic controls applied to IT systems including applications, operating systems, databases, and support.\n- IT Application Control (ITAC): it’s a security measure put in place to restrict unauthorized applications from putting the system and data at risk. The ITAC includes identification, authorization, authentication, input controls, etc.\nMore specifically, the five categories of IT audit are:\n- System and Application: this audit focuses on the system and application in an organization. It verifies that the system and all applications are efficient, appropriate, reliable, up-to-date, and secure on all levels.\n- Information Processing Facilities: It verifies that all processes are working efficiently, accurately, and timely, in both normal, and rather disruptive conditions.\n- System Development: this audit verifies that the under-development system is aligned with the organization’s objectives. It also makes that the system is made per the generally accepted standards for systems development.\n- Management of IT and Enterprise Architecture: it ensures that IT management is structured and the information processing environment is efficient and controlled.\n- Client/server, Telecommunication, Intranet, and Extranet: this audit focuses on telecommunication controls. It ensures that proper measures are in place for the server, client, and network connecting the server and the client.\nPurpose of IT Audit\nThe purpose of an IT audit is to evaluate the effectiveness of an organization’s IT system.\nInstalling controls keeps everything in check, but is not enough in the long-term. It’s important to make sure that the proper controls are installed and working as intended. If it’s not, then how can we handle the situation and prevent future breaches.\nWith the way technology is advancing, we also need to consider its impact on information security. It’s important to check if the controls put in place a few years ago, is still efficient and enough.\nIn an IT audit, all these questions are answered by an unbiased and independent entity. The auditors are auditing the information system. In an information systems environment, the audit is the evaluation of the information system, inputs, processing, and output.\nAn IT audit evaluates three major aspects of an information system:\n- Availability: will the information system be available when the users need it?\n- Integrity: will the information system be reliable, accurate, and prompt?\n- Confidentiality: will the information in the system be restricted to authorized parties?\nHow to Prepare for an IT Audit?\nIn organizations, people often ask how to prepare for an IT audit. If there is anything we can do to make the process go smoothly.\nIf you have an upcoming Audit and want to prepare for it, then here are a few steps to ensure a stress-free IT audit.\nNotify All Internal and External Partners\nThe first step in an IT audit is to notify the external and internal partners that an audit is coming. It includes all the stakeholders, management, and support. The whole team should be ready to provide any documentation or details that the auditors request. Make sure that everyone in the enterprise understands the importance of an IT audit for your business.\nYou should notify all departments and ensure that everyone’s ready to make the process go smoothly.\nA great way to make the audit process go smoothly is to make a list of all IT individuals and management who can be relied on to deliver. individual beforehand that you might need assistance during the audit.\nYou can also conduct surveys to ask the staff about any IT-related issues and their severity.\nStep 1: Create An IT Asset Inventory\nAn IT audit is all about IT assets and securing them. Creating an Inventory of all IT assets in your organization can put everything into perspective. The IT assets include both hardware and software resources that are used in everyday operations.\nAlong with IT assets inventory, you should also keep the access linked list handy. It should be easier for auditors to have immediate access to your system.\nTo make this work, create a list of login credentials for all software and hardware resources involved in the audit process. Also, in terms of physical access in the building, auditors should be able to freely visit various parts of the property.\nStep 2: Ask Your Auditor for a Document Checklist\nDuring the IT audit, the auditors will request various documents at different stages. keeping a list of all important documents in your organization will come in handy.\nAsk your auditors to provide a list of all documents that they may need and get your documentation right. Having all important documents in a central location can save both you and your auditor a lot of time and trouble.\nThe documentation entails all contracts with third-party service providers and external vendors. The list should also include purchase and warranty documents of your IT infrastructure. Knowing how old your equipment is crucial in several ways.\nYou should also have a log of the administrative written policies and procedures in one place.\nStep 3: Prepare Your Financial Statements\nA primary reason why most organizations conduct an IT audit is to reduce the operational cost of their IT infrastructure. To reduce costs, you must create a financial statement covering all expenditures related to the IT setup.\nWhen the auditors have a complete picture of your finances and expenditures, they can make suggestions about reducing operating costs and increase profit.\nStep 4: IT Policies and Procedures\nBefore conducting an IT audit you need well-documented IT policies and procedures. A softcopy and hardcopy of the policies and procedures ready for the auditors to review.\nThis will save you time and trouble that would otherwise be spent scrambling through the policies and procedures looking for something specific.\nOn the other hand, the auditors will save time otherwise spent asking for various documents at various stages.\nStep 5: Ensure a Written Information Security Plan\nNext to the IT policies and procedures, you should also have a written information security plan in place.\nAll firms that are registered with the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) are required to have a written information security plan. A written ISP (Information Security Plan) can help prepare the organization for IT-related risks and measures to handle it.\nRegarding an information security plan, a lot of organizations have no idea where to start. this leads to unnecessary and time-consuming work. Automated tools and processes should be used to make the process effortless. You can also hire an expert auditor to help you through the process.\nStep 6: Create a List of Controls and Safeguards\nWhether big or small, in an IT infrastructure, controls and safeguards are one of the most important aspects. You must have proper controls at strategic points to keep the applications and software secure. Create a list of all controls and save that you have in place for the IT system.\nStep 7: Conduct a Gap Assessment\nBeing aware of the gaps in your IT infrastructure can make the IT audit go more smoothly. You should also have a grasp on apps and services to better understand and secure them.\nNo system is entirely fool-proof, and as a user, you’re best-equipped to find vulnerabilities in your system.\nStep 8: Perform a Self-assessment\nAuditors are definitely the best for an audit but no one knows the system better than you. A self-assessment of your system will help you get a better understanding of your organization.\nA self-assessment will also give you confidence about your system’s performance and help you understand the audit results better.\nStep 9: Findings from Previous Audits\nIf this is your first IT audit, then you can skip this step. However, if it’s not, then make sure to present the auditors with the findings from the previous audit.\nAny issues found in the previous audits that were not addressed before should also be mentioned.\nStep 10: Schedule Tests or Deliverables\nStarting an IT audit with all your test and deliverables scheduled for after the audit can show in a negative light. Perform some basic tests and have deliverables beforehand.\nIt makes the auditors see that you understand the importance of an IT audit.\nStep 11: Be Prepared for Anything\nAfter the audit may not like the findings. Be prepared for anything. Going into the audit with the proper mindset can help prepare you for any kind of results.\nStep 12: Get A Second Opinion\nGetting a second opinion about the findings of the auditor is not a bad thing. With a second opinion, you can easily prioritize the findings and begin the remediation process.\nIT Audit Process\nAn IT audit guide is not complete without the audit process, which includes five steps.\n- Planning the IT audit\n- Studying and evaluating controls\n- Testing and assessing controls\n- Reporting and documenting the results\nWhat is the Outcome of an IT Audit?\nNow that we understand the importance, purpose, and process of the IT audit. You might be wondering:\nWhat will be the outcome of the IT audit?\nWhat will be the IT audit deliverable?\nThe last thing we will discuss is the audit deliverable, which includes the following:\n- Planning of the audit scope and objectives\n- Descriptions of the criteria\n- Audit program\n- Audit steps and evidence\n- Contributions of other auditors and experts\n- The final audit findings, conclusions, and recommendations\n- Audit documentation\n- Audit work to put\n- Evidence of the audit supervisory review\nThe audit report shall include the following:\n- Introduction (executive summary)\n- Finding and results\n- Any reservation (with regards to the audit)\nDon’t you have the documentation, you need to make sure that:\n- The facts presented in the document complete\n- Recommendations are realistic\n- Implementation dates are agreed-upon and flexible\nWe have discussed the complete process of an IT audit and the importance of an IT audit in an organization. if you’re considering an audit or just want to update your IT policies and procedures, make sure to check out IT procedures template for ready-made IT templates for all your needs.","The Annual Filing Season Program (AFSP) is a voluntary credential for tax professionals offered by the IRS. The AFSP is right for tax preparers who are not already enrolled agents, certified public accountants, or attorneys. IRS issues a Record of Completion to tax preparers completing 18 hours of tax education and meeting other requirements.\nWhat the Annual Filing Season Program Is\nThe AFSP is a voluntary credential for tax professionals offered by the IRS. Tax professionals who meet the requirements obtain a Record of Completion, are listed for one year in the public directory of tax preparers published by the IRS and can represent their clients (with limitations) before the IRS.\nHow the Annual Filing Season Program Works\nBoth first-time applicants and renewing tax preparers need to meet three requirements to participate in the AFSP and receive their Record of Completion. First, they take 15 or 18 hours of continuing education on federal tax topics. Second, they maintain an active preparer tax identification number (PTIN). Third, they agree to follow rules for professional conduct such as not giving false or misleading information to the IRS.\n1. Meet the Annual Filing Season Program Continuing Education Requirements\nInterested tax professionals will need to take 15 or 18 hours of continuing education from IRS-approved continuing education providers each year. Both first-time and renewing participants need to complete the six-hour Annual Federal Tax Refresher (AFTR) course, plus two hours of ethics, and 10 hours of other courses of your choice on federal tax topics.\nFind a Continuing Education Provider & Classes to Take\nVarious professional societies, companies, and colleges offer continuing education for the AFSP. Many continuing education courses are delivered online in a self-study format. You can browse a list of IRS-approved continuing education providers. The six-hour AFTR course is titled the same by all continuing education providers. Check the category your classes fall under, as you will need at least two hours of ethics courses. The remainder of your courses can be on any federal tax topic.\nRemember that Only ‘IRS Continuing Education’ Counts Toward the AFSP\nSome providers offer continuing professional education courses for certified public accountants, which are often labeled as “CPE,” as well as continuing education for the AFSP, often labeled as “CE.” Check what type of credits a course offers carefully as only courses that are approved for IRS continuing education will count towards the AFSP.\nKeep in Mind You Might Qualify for an AFTR Exemption\nSome tax preparers, such as those who have a state-issued credential from California, Oregon, and Maryland, do not need to take the six-hour AFTR course. Also, they need to complete 15 hours of continuing education instead of 18 hours.\n2. Obtain or Renew Your Preparer Tax Identification Number Annually\nTax professionals must obtain and annually renew a preparer tax identification number (PTIN). In fact, anyone who gets paid to prepare tax returns must have an active PTIN. Tax professionals obtain a PTIN for free directly from the IRS. PTINs must be renewed annually before filing tax returns for the new tax season.\n3. Agree to Comply With the AFSP IRS Professional Conduct Standards\nTo qualify for the AFSP, tax professionals must agree to follow certain rules of professional conduct such as being diligent to prepare accurate tax returns and avoiding deceptive advertising. The full list of standards for professional conduct are spelled out in two sections of Circular 230: Subpart B details duties and restrictions, and section 10.51 covers rules regarding incompetence and disreputable conduct.\nBy committing to these standards of professional conduct, you are protecting yourself, your reputation, and your clients from harm caused by unethical behavior. We spoke to Curt Lee, an accredited tax adviser, and business owner in Raleigh, North Carolina, who told us that tax preparers should not fear these rules. He said:\n“When you voluntarily enter into the Annual Filing Season Program, it does require higher demands. Circular 230 is another set of standards you have to hold yourself to, and some people don’t understand it. When they read 230, it scares them, and they become afraid of doing something wrong. Remember, the IRS already has rules in place [for due diligence and preparer penalties], 230 is just another level.”\n― Curt Lee, Owner, C B Lee & Company\nThe standards of professional conduct to which AFSP tax preparers agree include:\n- Be diligent in preparing accurate tax returns\n- Promptly complete tax projects\n- Avoid charging unconscionable fees\n- Cannot notarize tax returns they prepare\n- Return client’s records to the client\n- Avoid conflicts of interest\n- Avoid deceptive advertising\n- Not to ever deposit a client’s tax refund check in the preparer’s bank account\n- Follow best practices in preparing tax returns\n- Avoid signing tax returns that are false or unreasonable\n- Avoid giving false or misleading information to the IRS\n- Avoid encouraging their clients to violate federal tax laws\n- If a client hands you money for the purpose of paying the client’s taxes, pay that money promptly to the government and not steal the money\n- Avoid bribing or harassing or threatening any IRS employee\n- Must sign tax returns that you prepare\n- Avoid preparing tax returns if one does not have a valid PTIN\nWho the Annual Filing Season Program Is Right For\nAFSP is right for people who want to prepare tax returns professionally and want to receive a Record of Completion from the IRS. AFSP is appropriate for people who do not already have a professional credential such as enrolled agent, certified public accountant, or attorney. These professionals are already permitted to practice before the IRS and have already demonstrated a higher level of knowledge that is required for the AFSP.\nWhy the AFSP IRS Certification Is Beneficial\nThe AFSP benefits applicants in three ways. First, AFSP Record of Completion holders are included in the public directory of tax preparers published on IRS.gov. Second, the Record of Completion demonstrates that you voluntarily took continuing education on tax topics. Third, AFSP participants can represent clients whose tax returns they prepared when dealing with IRS audits, with IRS customer service representatives, or with the Taxpayer Advocate Service.\nTax preparers benefit from having the AFSP Record of Completion along with other professional credentials because credentials visibly demonstrate your knowledge to clients and potential clients. Additionally, we spoke with Eric Hansen, an accredited tax preparer and owner of Hansen Accounting, who said:\n“It’s always nice to have a third party who has put together a test, you pass the test, and you earn a professional credential that you can put on your business card and letterhead.”\n― Eric R. Hansen, Owner, Hansen Accounting\nAdditional details for the three benefits of AFSP certification include:\n- Listing in tax preparer directory: AFSP participants can choose to be listed in the public directory of tax preparers published on IRS.gov; potential clients can use this public directory find you and to verify your professional credential\n- Record of completion: Issued by the IRS Return Preparer Office, the Record of Completion is suitable for framing; you could also display it on your website\n- Client representation: AFSP participants can deal with the IRS on behalf of clients but only if they prepared the client’s tax return; the limited circumstances where AFSP participants can represent clients are when dealing with IRS customer service, with IRS auditors, or with the Taxpayer Advocate Service.\nAnnual Filing Season Program Costs\nThe only costs for AFSP are for taking continuing education (CE) courses. Each CE provider determines fees for their courses. TheTaxBook.com, for example, offers a bundle of 20 hours of continuing education in a self-study format for $169. Fast Forward Academy, another self-study provider, charges $99 for the 18 hours of continuing education needed for the AFSP. The IRS does not charge any fee for participating in AFSP or for the PTIN.\nTax preparers can obtain their 18 hours of continuing education for free by taking classes from and volunteering for the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) programs operated by the IRS.\nHow to Get an AFSP IRS Record of Completion\nThere is a three-step process for getting an AFSP IRS Record of Completion. First, the IRS will send you an e-mail about a week or two after you have completed the required continuing education courses. You then log into the IRS PTIN system, consent to the Circular 230 standards of professional conduct. About 24 hours after consenting, check your mailbox on the PTIN system for your Record of Completion, which can be downloaded or printed.\nIf you have not received your Record of Completion, the first thing you should do is check if all your continuing education credits have been posted to the PTIN system. If any of your tax courses have not been posted, you should contact the continuing education provider to make sure you get credit for the classes you took.\nPros & Cons of the Annual Filing Season Program\nBefore taking investing time and effort, tax preparers should carefully evaluate whether the advantages and disadvantages of participating in the AFSP. The pros of the IRS AFSP include limited representation rights, inclusion in the public directory of tax return preparers, and recognition of your professional knowledge. Cons of the IRS AFSP include the not having full representation rights, the cost of continuing education, and the higher scrutiny that comes with the standards of professional conduct.\nPros of the Annual Filing Season Program\nBenefits of the IRS AFSP include:\n- Limited representation rights: You can talk to the IRS to resolve audits on tax returns you prepared and signed. Without an AFSP Record of Completion, you won’t be able to talk to the IRS to resolve audits or customer service issues relating to tax returns you prepared.\n- Inclusion in the directory of tax return preparers: The IRS’s public database of tax preparers is searchable. Potential clients can search the directory to verify your professional credential.\n- Recognition of your professional knowledge: AFSP participants receive a Record of Completion, which can be displayed in your office or on your website.\nCons of the Annual Filing Season Program\nDisadvantages of the IRS AFSP include:\n- You don’t have full representation rights: AFSP participants can represent clients only if they prepared and signed the tax return. If you want to represent clients whose tax returns you did not prepare, then the better option is to become an enrolled agent, CPA, or attorney.\n- Cost of continuing education: While continuing education isn’t expensive, the costs and time commitment can still add up. Expect to spend under $200 and about 18 hours each year to meet your continuing education requirements.\n- Potential fines and disciplinary action: AFSP applicants can be fined or disciplined for violating the standards of professional conduct. Fines can be as much as 100% of the income you earned by violating the standards. IRS can also suspend your credential temporarily or permanently disbar you from preparing tax returns.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About the Annual Filing Season Program\nThis article covers the major aspects of the AFSP. Below we highlight some of the more common questions preparers ask about the AFSP IRS program.\nHow Do I Tell the IRS That I’m Applying for the AFSP?\nYou don’t. The IRS will reach out to you. After you complete the required continuing education and renew your PTIN, the IRS will send you an e-mail if you are eligible for the AFSP Record of Completion. That e-mail will contain instructions for how to log back into your PTIN account and complete the steps necessary for the Record of Completion.\nCan an Unenrolled Tax Return Preparer Participate in the Annual Filing Season Program?\nThe AFSP is specifically designed for unenrolled tax return preparers to demonstrate their tax knowledge and professional ethics. An unenrolled tax return preparer is any person who is not already enrolled to practice before the IRS, which includes enrolled agents, certified public accountants, attorneys, enrolled retirement plan agents, and enrolled actuaries.\nWhat Is an Exempt Tax Preparer?\nThe AFTR course is not required for AFSP applicants who meet exemption requirements. Exemptions include passing part one of the Special Enrollment Examination or being registered as a tax preparer with the states of California, Maryland, or Oregon. Exempt tax preparers need 15 hours of continuing education instead of 18 hours.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe AFSP is a voluntary professional credential issued by the IRS to tax professionals who demonstrate competency in federal tax by completing continuing education requirements. AFSP participants agree to hold themselves to the same high standards of professional conduct as enrolled agents and certified public accountants."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c93bae11-3d80-44ec-8508-dec63c920e52>","<urn:uuid:59a03bef-84a2-4337-b6fc-7dbe60f2ddba>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's difference between Quality Score and Conversion Rate? They both seem important for websites marketing! 😕","answer":"Quality Score and Conversion Rate are different metrics used in digital marketing. Quality Score is specifically used in pay-per-click advertising, ranging from 1-10, and measures ad quality based on click-through rate, ad relevance, keyword relevance, landing page experience, and historical performance. Conversion Rate, on the other hand, measures the percentage of website visitors who complete a desired action (like purchasing a product or filling out a form) and is calculated by dividing the number of conversions by total visitors and multiplying by 100. While Quality Score helps determine ad costs and positioning in ad networks, Conversion Rate helps understand overall website effectiveness in achieving business goals.","context":["Last updated Sep 18 2020\nThe user-centric approach to Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)\nForget about best practices and quick hacks: to increase website conversion rate, your best move is to understand your visitors, users, and customers, and give them what they need.\nIn this guide, we dispel a few myths about conversion optimization, talk to 20+ conversion experts, and give you a free, downloadable 3-step CRO plan to help you gather the data you need to improve your conversion rates over and over again.\nWhat is conversion rate optimization (CRO)?\nConversion rate optimization (CRO) is the practice of increasing the percentage of users who perform a desired action on a website. Desired actions can include purchasing a product, clicking ‘add to cart’, signing up for a service, filling out a form, or clicking on a link.\nA more user-centric definition of CRO\nStandard definitions of CRO, like the one we just wrote above, place their focus on conversion percentages, averages, and benchmarks. This emphasis on a numerical approach comes with a downside—the more you look at spreadsheets full of conversion data points and actions, the less you think of the individuals behind them.\nHere is an alternative, more holistic and user-centric way of defining CRO: think of it as the process of focusing on understanding what drives, stops, and persuades your users, so you can give them the best user experience possible—and that, in turn, is what makes them convert and ultimately improves your conversion rate.\nWhy do we think this second definition works better? Because focusing on the final action—the conversion—is obviously important, but in reality, a lot happens before that point:\n- Specific DRIVERS bring people to your website\n- Specific BARRIERS make them leave\n- Specific HOOKS persuade them to convert\nWhen you’re working to improve conversions, not every problem is quantifiable, backed by hard numbers, and with a clear-cut answer. Yes: sometimes, an obvious bug is blocking 80% of your users from doing something, and fixing that one bug will save your entire business; other times, your website functions perfectly and yet people still are not converting. When this happens, you’ll need to dig deeper to understand the why beyond the data you have—you’ll need, in other words, to focus on your users first. And that’s what we at Hotjar think CRO is actually about.\nWhether you own an ecommerce site or manage online marketing or SEO (search engine optimization), CRO will constantly be a top-of-mind topic to help your organization grow.\nHow to calculate conversion rate\nConversion rate is calculated by dividing the number of conversions (desired actions taken) by the total number of visitors and multiplying the result by 100 to get a percentage.\nFor example, if your web page had 18 sales and 450 visitors last month, your conversion rate is 18 divided by 450 (0.04), multiplied by 100 = 4%.\nWhat is the average conversion rate?\nDepending on what you read, the average conversion rate is anywhere between 1% and 4%.\nBut let us come out and say it: this figure is sort of meaningless, since:\n- Conversion rates differ wildly depending on the conversion goal (ad clicks, checkout completions, newsletter signups, etc.)\n- Every website, page, and audience is different\n- Most people don't share their conversion data publicly anyway\nAverages may be useful as starting points for benchmarking, but what do they really have to do with YOUR website?\nThere is no actual, ultimate industry figure you can rely on or compare yourself against with 100% confidence. Obsessing over an average percentage figure, and trying to squeeze as many conversions as possible just to stay in line with it, is not the best way to think about conversion rate optimization. Once again, you’re better off focusing on developing an in-depth understanding of what actually matters to your users, so you can give it to them—and then, conversions will naturally follow.\nConversion optimization best practices—and why they’re dangerous\nIn the world of digital marketing, a CRO best practice is a commonly-held belief that a particular optimization action will guarantee an increase in conversion rate, for example:\n- Use a strong color for all CTA (call-to-action) buttons\n- Place CTAs above the fold\n- Use urgency (e.g., time-limited offers) to drive sales\n- Always display testimonials\n- Use fewer form fields on your forms\nAre these best practices good for improving YOUR conversion rate? Debatable.\nFirst of all, best practice is—by definition—past practice: it's something that worked in the past for someone else. You can’t guarantee it’s going to work today.\nSecond, just because it worked for someone else, doesn’t mean it’s going to work for you.\nBlindly applying existing best practices puts companies in a perpetual state of playing catch-up—while more progressive and experimental businesses are busy improving and making the changes that will be recognized as 'best practices' in a few years.\n📚Useful extra reading: here is our philosophy about best practices, and how following them blindly can end up being counterproductive and hurt business.\nThere is, however, one core principle we can recommend as always valid: spend time understanding your users and customers—or, as we like to say around here at Hotjar, build a customer-centric culture by obsessing over your users and customers. They are the people who matter to your business and have the answers you need to improve it. Fixate on their needs and desired outcomes, learn as much as you can about their concerns and hesitations, and then deliver solutions that address them.\nIn the long term, what leads to growth is not blindly applying best practices that you see on other blogs or hear from your boss(es). The winning approach is investing in understanding and learning from your users and using the insight to build an optimization strategy that continuously improves your business.\nHow to do this in practice is covered in the 3-step CRO program chapter of this guide; before then, let’s take a rapid look at the tools that will get you there.\nThe best conversion rate optimization tools\nIt may sound weird coming from a company that sells a tool that helps people optimize websites—but, as a principle, we believe that the best optimization tools are free.\nYour brain, ears, eyes, and mouth are the primary tools you need to understand your customers, empathize with their experience, draw conclusions based on the data, and ultimately make the changes that improve your conversion rates.\n(Sidenote: here is a great example of what can happen when you don’t use these tools, make assumptions about what people need, and build something that nobody uses.)\nHow do you use these free tools?\n- Listen to what your users have to say about your website\n- Watch how people use your website\n- Immerse yourself in the market\n- Talk to whoever designed and built your site (and your product/service)\n- Speak to the staff that sell and support your product/service\n- Draw connections between different sources of feedback\nAll the other, traditional optimization tools are simply the means that help you do it. And they help in three ways:\n1. Quantitative tools to uncover what is happening\nQuantitative tools allow you to collect quantitative (numerical) data to track what is happening on your website. They include:\n- General analytics tools that track website traffic (e.g., Google Analytics)\n- Website heat map tools that aggregate the number of clicks, scrolls, and movement on a page\n- Funnel tools that measure when visitors drop off from a sales funnel\n- Form analysis tools that track form submissions\n- Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) tools that measure customer satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 10\n- Tools that use the Net Promoter System to measure the likelihood of people recommending your website/product to someone else on a scale from 0 to 10\n2. Qualitative tools to uncover why things happen\nQualitative tools help you collect qualitative (non-numerical) data to learn why your website visitors behave in a certain way. They include:\n- Website feedback tools (on-page polls, pop-ups, surveys) where visitors are asked questions about their experience\n- Website session recording/replay tools that show how individual users navigate through your website\n- Usability testing tools where a panel of potential or current customers can voice their thoughts and opinions on your website\n- Online reviews where you can read more about people’s experience of your brand and product\n3. Tools to test changes and measure improvements\nAfter you’ve collected quantitative and qualitative feedback and developed a clear sense of what's happening on your website, testing tools allow you to make changes and/or report on them to see if your conversion optimization efforts are going in the right direction. They include:\n- A/B testing tools that help you test different variations of a page to find the best performer (recommended for high-traffic sites, so you can be certain your results are statistically valid)\n- Website heat map + session recording tools that allow you to compare different variations of a page and the behavior on it\n- Conversion-tracking analytics tools that track and monitor conversions\n- Website feedback tools (like visual feedback widgets or NPS dashboards) that help you collect qualitative feedback and quantify it, so you can compare the before/after response to any change you made.\nThe remaining chapters of this guide cover:\n- Our 3-step CRO program\nA free, downloadable 3-step plan that helps you understand the drivers that bring people to your site, the barriers that stop them from converting, and the hooks that persuade them to stay.\n- Landing page CRO: a case study\nA practical case study on how to use the 3-step CRO plan to optimize a landing page and drive conversions effectively.\n- 20+ expert CRO tips\n20+ expert CRO practitioners answer the question: What's the one thing you recommend to people working on improving their conversion rate?\n- CRO glossary\nAn explanation of the most commonly used terms in CRO\nCommon Conversion Rate Optimization FAQs\nConversion rate optimization can live throughout your website. You can optimize your homepage, product pages, checkout process, and anything else on your website. When making CRO improvements, it's always important to measure, test, and adjust so you can continuously improve over time.\n1. How do you improve my conversion rate?\nIf your conversion rate is low (or isn’t as high as you’d like), you should analyze the pages that are underperforming to see what could be stopping customers from checking out. You should also analyze your highest converting pages to see what exactly is pulling customers to the finish line.\n2. How do you measure conversion rate optimization?\nTo measure and calculate your conversion rate, divide the number of conversions by the total number of visitors, multiply that times 100 and you have your conversion rate percentage. You should measure your conversion rate fairly often, so you can see if your CRO actions have resulted in true improvement.\n3. What can help you analyze conversion rate optimization?\nTools such as Hotjar enable you to analyze your conversion rate and optimization efforts. With applications such as heatmaps, scrollmaps, and multivariate or A/B testing, you can improve your conversion rate easier than ever.","What is Adwords Quality Score and What It means for You\nWhat is a Quality Score?\nThe general concept of a Quality Score was first introduced by Google. It is an aggregated estimate of PPC ad, keyword, and landing page quality based on past performance. Scores range from 1-10 (10 being the highest) and is influenced by these factors:\n- Click-through rate (keywords and display URL)\n- Ad relevance and performance (ad copy relevance, ad performance on specific sites and sites in the Display Network, and ad performance on targeted devices)\n- Keyword relevance (as an ad group in context with keyword search matches)\n- Landing page experience (relevant and original content, navigability, load time, etc.)\n- AdWords account historical performance (including geographic performance)\nWhy Do Ad Networks Need a Quality Score?\nGoogle and other major search engines cite user experience as the primary reason for their implementation of a Quality Score rating. The quality of ads, after all, affect how users interact with them and of course, the advertising revenues.\nTo understand how this strategy works, a better understanding of the different monetization models used by ad networks is needed. There are different ways in which advertisers bid for ads. In the nascent years of online advertising, the most popular is the CPM (cost per mille or thousand) model. Until now, ‘impression’ is still used as the primary unit of ad inventory even though the CPC (cost per click) is now the model of choice by many ad networks.\nThe shift from CPM to CPC has obvious benefits for advertisers but the implication for ad networks are much more significant. In competitive markets, there is a convergence between an ad inventory’s pre-defined price and the price that advertisers bid. Because of this, ad networks can predict the profits they can gain through the expected sale value of each ad inventory.\nIn the CPM and CPC models, the same ad auction process occurs, and the two models can even compete in the same ad auction. The difference is that viewable CPM (vCPM) campaigns only target the Display Network. Advertisers pay for every 1,000 ad appearance and viewable instances. With the CPC model, advertisers pay every time an ad is clicked. Google can set minimum bids – different amounts for different advertisers for the same keywords. Advertisers then set the maximum cost-per-click bid or the highest amount they are willing to pay for a single click.\nThere’s no assurance though that the highest bidder would win the auction. Any bidder can win the auction at a lower price if his keywords and ads are more relevant than the others. All he needs to do to keep his ad’s position is to have a slightly higher bid than the one behind him. But isn’t this counter-intuitive? Nope. It actually makes more sense.\nAd Rank determines if an ad can compete in an auction. Ad ranking signals that are taken into account are CTR (click-through rate), ad relevance, and landing page experience. But the main determinant for ROI and the ad quality is the CTR. It can determine how much Google can earn for a thousand impressions of a PPC (pay-per-click) ad. Let’s have an example.\nAdvertiser A bids for $3 for each click, advertiser B bids for $2, and lastly, advertiser C bids for only $1. The expected CTR for advertiser A’s ad is 1%, for advertiser B it’s 2%, and for advertiser C it’s 5%. Calculating this we get 10 expected CTR for advertiser A, 20 for advertiser B, and 50 for advertiser C. If we multiply this to the bid, Google would earn $30 from advertiser A; $40 for advertiser B; and for advertiser C it would be $50. This example shows that even if advertiser A and B had higher bids, their low CTR downplays the expected ROI. Google would select the ads that have the highest chance of performing better or risk running low performing ads – that’s where Quality score comes in.\nAd Rank is keyword-based and is triggered in real-time whereas Quality Score is an aggregate of past performances. Google reiterates that Quality Score isn’t used to determine auction-time Ad Rank but it can actually improve ad position. It quantifies the relevance of an ad based on its performance – performance that can’t be quantified unless the ad had been clicked by the user. This makes CTR as one of the most important signals for ad relevance. The more relevant the ad is, the more likely it is to be clicked.\nOn an economic standpoint, Quality Score aids ad networks in managing the risk of poor performance and optimizing profit from every advertiser. Without a Quality Score, advertisers can win ad auctions based on bids alone. Poor performance could mean a lesser expense since the advertiser would only pay for whatever few clicks his ad generates, yet the ad network still delivers one thousand impressions. A Quality Score is an assurance that no ad slot is wasted. This is since low performing advertisers will have to pay a higher CPC to account for the impressions delivered. If the ad’s low performance continues, the ad campaign would stop running until the Quality Score improves and the ad’s expected CPC converges with the pre-defined price or minimum bid.\nWhat is the Implication of a Quality Score for Advertisers?\nWe briefly discussed the implications of a low Quality Score and its implications on the ad’s CPC. But it is also evident from an advertiser’s – your perspective that ad relevance isn’t only about user experience, or even about the ad network’s profits, but also about the effective monetization of ad impressions. Aside from that, Quality Score has a direct (or indirect) correlation with the following:\n- Lower cost per click.\n- Lower cost per conversion. Cost per conversion is usually higher than the cost per click since not every click results into conversion.\n- Higher ad ranks.\n- Impression share.\nThe following approaches can help optimize Quality Score:\n- High CTRs should not be your main goal. The increase of CTRs to optimize the Quality Score doesn’t necessarily maximize ROI. It is erroneous to believe that more clicks equal more sales. It can happen, but not on the same ad budget. You should pay attention to key performance metrics like cost per sale and/or cost per lead.\n- Craft ads according to campaign goals. Aside from paying attention to the key performance metrics, you should know your ‘ideal prospect’, prospective customers that you want to optimize your ads for. This is to increase the response rate of these prospective customers.\n- Organize keywords in tight themes for different ads. Also, focus on testing ads for your top keywords until you see an improvement in the Quality Score. You may need to pause low-performing keywords so that your CTR history would be good.\n- Adplexity Coupon Code $80 Off and Walkthrough - September 23, 2019\n- SiteGround vs GoDaddy: WordPress Hosting Comparison - September 13, 2019\n- SiteGround vs Inmotion: WordPress Hosting Benchmark - August 31, 2019"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c6757460-d5f3-44af-88c5-db0e5a9e29fe>","<urn:uuid:646f0ebf-2df2-44f1-8352-1e86d2d4ff28>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Looking at ancient legal systems - what's the key difference between how Hammurabi's laws and King David/Solomon's defensive structures were preserved and rediscovered? 🔍","answer":"The preservation and rediscovery of these artifacts followed very different paths. Hammurabi's Code was inscribed on a stele that was plundered by the Elamites and taken to their capital Susa, where it remained until its rediscovery in 1901, and is now housed in the Louvre Museum. In contrast, the defensive structures from David and Solomon's time were gradually uncovered through multiple archaeological excavations, including Kathleen Kenyon's discoveries after 1961 of the Stepped Stone Structure, and later excavations by others that revealed various walls and gates at sites like Megiddo and Hazor.","context":["The stele was discovered just as the debate concerning whether David and Solomon had ever existed was reaching an initial crescendo among scholars. While some scholars argued that it was indeed a mighty capital city, as described by the Bible, others believed that it was simply a small “cow town.” In fact, it is still not clear where David is positioned along the continuum from tribal chieftains to mighty kings and just how large the city itself was during his time.At a single blow, the finding of this inscription settled the question of whether David was an actual historical person, at least in the minds of most scholars. Temple Mount and City of David Aerial - photo Bible During her excavations in Jerusalem after 1961, Kathleen Kenyon discovered the remains of what archaeologists call the “Stepped Stone Structure” in an area that is just outside the walls of the Old City.Gila Cook, the expedition’s surveyor, discovered the first fragment from the stele. This is sometimes thought to be part of the defensive system erected by the Jebusites from whom David captured the city.She had gone out to the site one day in the early afternoon and noticed that one of the rocks in a wall that had recently been excavated had letters inscribed upon it. More recently, excavations by Eilat Mazar of the Shalem Center in Jerusalem within this same area suggest that this Stepped Stone Structure may be connected to a much larger building.Yadin, at various times during his career, was chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, deputy prime minister in the government of Menachem Begin, and a prominent archaeologist on the faculty of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.His excavations at several sites uncovered archaeological remains which he attributed to Solomon; they remain essentially the only sites to date which contain such remains outside of Jerusalem. Yadin’s first substantial excavations took place at Hazor, located in the north of Israel.Throughout the 1990s and into the new millennium, Finkelstein proposed a re-dating of the traditional chronology—which places the dates of the reigns of David and Solomon in the tenth century BCE—and suggested instead that much of the pottery and other materials that had been dated to the tenth century and thus assigned to the time of David and Solomon should in fact be assigned instead to the ninth century or later and to other kings.\nInstead, they assert, on the basis of construction techniques and structural differences, in addition to pottery and other finds, that the walls unearthed by Mazar do not belong to a single building but rather to several, and that the pottery and other remains indicate that the Stepped Stone Structure represents at least two phases of construction—with the lower part possibly dating to the ninth century BCE and the upper part dating to the Hellenistic period.The British archaeologist John Garstang had already dug there in 1928, but it was Yadin whose excavations from 1955 to 1958 brought the site to life.Yadin’s staff members were among the best available; many of his area supervisors went on to become established professors of archaeology or key figures in the Department of Antiquities.Megiddo Excavation with Yigael Yadin Photo David Bivin, Lifeinthe Holy Yadin dated the walls and gates at Megiddo and Hazor, as well as Palace 6000 at Megiddo, to the time of Solomon in the tenth century BCE.In large part this was because of one passage from the Bible—a passage from 1 Kings that describes the building activities of Solomon at the sites of Megiddo, Hazor, Gezer, and Jerusalem: “And this is the account of the forced labor which King Solomon levied to build the house of the Lord and his own house and the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and Hazor and Megiddo and Gezer” (1 Kings ).\nIt seems that the original inscription, which had been inscribed and erected at Tel Dan in about 842 BCE, had later been taken down and broken into fragments, some of which were eventually reused in the wall. Her excavations have uncovered massive walls, which she identified as the remains of a building that she called the “Large Stone Structure” and which she said was part of a complex that included the Stepped Stone Structure on the slope.","|Born||c. 1810 BC\n|Died||1750 BC middle chronology (modern-day Jordan and Syria)\n(aged c. 60)\n|Known for||Code of Hammurabi|\n|Title||King of Babylon|\n|Term||42 years; c. 1792 – 1750 BC (middle)|\nHammurabi (c. 1810 BC - 1750 BC) was the sixth king of the First Babylonian Dynasty, reigning from 1792 BC to 1750 BC (according to the Middle Chronology). He was preceded by his father, Sin-Muballit, who abdicated due to failing health. He extended Babylon's control throughout Mesopotamia through military campaigns. Hammurabi is known for the Code of Hammurabi, one of the earliest surviving codes of law in recorded history. The name Hammurabi derives from the Amorite term ʻAmmurāpi (\"the kinsman is a healer\"), itself from ʻAmmu (\"paternal kinsman\") and Rāpi (\"healer\").\nReign and conquests\nHammurabi was an Amorite First Dynasty king of the city-state of Babylon, and inherited the power from his father, Sin-Muballit, in c. 1792 BC. Babylon was one of the many largely Amorite ruled city-states that dotted the central and southern Mesopotamian plains and waged war on each other for control of fertile agricultural land. Though many cultures co-existed in Mesopotamia, Babylonian culture gained a degree of prominence among the literate classes throughout the Middle East under Hammurabi. The kings who came before Hammurabi had founded a relatively minor City State in 1894 BC which controlled little territory outside of the city itself. Babylon was overshadowed by older, larger and more powerful kingdoms such as Elam, Assyria, Isin, Eshnunna and Larsa for a century or so after its founding. However his father Sin-Muballit had begun to consolidate rule of a small area of south central Mesopotamia under Babylonian hegemony and, by the time of his reign, had conquered the minor city-states of Borsippa, Kish, and Sippar.\nThus Hammurabi ascended to the throne as the king of a minor kingdom in the midst of a complex geopolitical situation. The powerful kingdom of Eshnunna controlled the upper Tigris River while Larsa controlled the river delta. To the east of Mesopotamia lay the powerful kingdom of Elam which regularly invaded and forced tribute upon the small states of southern Mesopotamia. In northern Mesopotamia, the Assyrian king Shamshi-Adad I, who had already inherited centuries old Assyrian colonies in Asia Minor, had expanded his territory into the Levant and central Mesopotamia, although his untimely death would somewhat fragment his empire.\nThe first few decades of Hammurabi's reign were quite peaceful. Hammurabi used his power to undertake a series of public works, including heightening the city walls for defensive purposes, and expanding the temples. In c. 1801 BC, the powerful kingdom of Elam, which straddled important trade routes across the Zagros Mountains, invaded the Mesopotamian plain. With allies among the plain states, Elam attacked and destroyed the kingdom of Eshnunna, destroying a number of cities and imposing its rule on portions of the plain for the first time. In order to consolidate its position, Elam tried to start a war between Hammurabi's Babylonian kingdom and the kingdom of Larsa. Hammurabi and the king of Larsa made an alliance when they discovered this duplicity and were able to crush the Elamites, although Larsa did not contribute greatly to the military effort. Angered by Larsa's failure to come to his aid, Hammurabi turned on that southern power, thus gaining control of the entirety of the lower Mesopotamian plain by c. 1763 BC.\nAs Hammurabi was assisted during the war in the south by his allies from the north such as Yamhad and Mari, the absence of soldiers in the north led to unrest. Continuing his expansion, Hammurabi turned his attention northward, quelling the unrest and soon after crushing Eshnunna. Next the Babylonian armies conquered the remaining northern states, including Babylon's former ally Mari, although it is possible that the 'conquest' of Mari was a surrender without any actual conflict.\nHammurabi entered into a protracted war with Ishme-Dagan I of Assyria for control of Mesopotamia, with both kings making alliances with minor states in order to gain the upper hand. Eventually Hammurabi prevailed, ousting Ishme-Dagan I just before his own death. Mut-Ashkur the new king of Assyria was forced to pay tribute to Hammurabi, however Babylon did not rule Assyria directly.\nIn just a few years, Hammurabi had succeeded in uniting all of Mesopotamia under his rule. The Assyrian kingdom survived but was forced to pay tribute during his reign, and of the major city-states in the region, only Aleppo and Qatna to the west in the Levant maintained their independence. However, one stele of Hammurabi has been found as far north as Diyarbekir, where he claims the title \"King of the Amorites\".\nVast numbers of contract tablets, dated to the reigns of Hammurabi and his successors, have been discovered, as well as 55 of his own letters. These letters give a glimpse into the daily trials of ruling an empire, from dealing with floods and mandating changes to a flawed calendar, to taking care of Babylon's massive herds of livestock. Hammurabi died and passed the reins of the empire on to his son Samsu-iluna in c. 1750 BC, under whose rule the Babylonian empire began to quickly unravel.\nCode of laws\nThe Code of Hammurabi was inscribed on a stele and placed in a public place so that all could see it, although it is thought that few were literate. The stele was later plundered by the Elamites and removed to their capital, Susa; it was rediscovered there in 1901 in Iran and is now in the Louvre Museum in Paris. The code of Hammurabi contained 282 laws, written by scribes on 12 tablets. Unlike earlier laws, it was written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylon, and could therefore be read by any literate person in the city.\nThe structure of the code is very specific, with each offense receiving a specified punishment. The punishments tended to be very harsh by modern standards, with many offenses resulting in death, disfigurement, or the use of the \"Eye for eye, tooth for tooth\" (Lex Talionis \"Law of Retaliation\") philosophy. The code is also one of the earliest examples of the idea of presumption of innocence, and it also suggests that the accused and accuser have the opportunity to provide evidence. However, there is no provision for extenuating circumstances to alter the prescribed punishment.\nA carving at the top of the stele portrays Hammurabi receiving the laws from the god Shamash or possibly Marduk, and the preface states that Hammurabi was chosen by the gods of his people to bring the laws to them. Parallels between this narrative and the giving of laws by God in Jewish tradition to Moses and similarities between the two legal codes suggest a common ancestor in the Semitic background of the two. Fragments of previous law codes have been found.[Note 1] However David P. Wright argues that the Covenant Code of the Biblical Book of Exodus is 'directly, primarily, and throughout' based upon the Laws of Hammurabi.\nSimilar codes of law were created in several nearby civilizations, including the earlier Mesopotamian examples of Ur-Nammu's code, Laws of Eshnunna, and Code of Lipit-Ishtar, and the later Hittite code of laws.\nExample laws in Hammurabi's code\n- (Text taken from Harper's translation, readable on wikisource)\n- § 8 – If any one steal cattle or sheep, or an ass, or a pig or a goat, if it belong to a god or to the court, the thief shall pay thirtyfold therefor; if they belonged to a freed man of the king he shall pay tenfold; if the thief has nothing with which to pay he shall be put to death.\n- § 21 – If a man make a breach in a house, they shall put him to death in front of that breach and they shall thrust him therein.\n- § 55 – If a man open his canal for irrigation and neglect it and the water carry away an adjacent field, he shall measure out grain on the basis of the adjacent fields.\n- § 59 – If a man cut down a tree in a man's orchard, without the consent of the owner of the orchard, he shall pay one-half mina of silver.\n- § 168 – If a man set his face to disinherit his son and say to the judges: \"I will disinherit my son,\" the judges shall inquire into his antecedents, and if the son have not committed a crime sufficiently grave to cut him off from sonship, the father may not cut off his son from sonship.\n- § 169 – If he have committed a crime against his father sufficiently grave to cut him off from sonship, they shall condone his first (offense). If he commit a crime a second time, the father may cut off his son from sonship.\n- § 195 – If a son strike his father, they shall cut off his fingers.\n- § 196–201 – If a man destroy the eye of another man, they shall destroy his eye. If one break a man's bone, they shall break his bone. If one destroy the eye of a freeman or break the bone of a freeman he shall pay one mana of silver. If one destroy the eye of a man's slave or break a bone of a man's slave he shall pay one-half his price. If a man knock out a tooth of a man of his own rank, they shall knock out his tooth. If one knock out a tooth of a freeman, he shall pay one-third mana of silver.\n- § 218–219 – If a physician operate on a man for a severe wound with a bronze lancet and cause that man's death; or open an abscess (in the eye) of a man with a bronze lancet and destroy the man's eye, they shall cut off his fingers. If a physician operate on a slave of a freeman for a severe wound with a bronze lancet and cause his death, he shall restore a slave of equal value.\n- § 229–232 – If a builder build a house for a man and do not make its construction firm, and the house which he has built collapse and cause the death of the owner of the house, that builder shall be put to death. If it cause the death of a son of the owner of the house, they shall put to death a son of that builder. If it cause the death of a slave of the owner of the house, he shall give the owner of the house a slave of equal value. If it destroy property, he shall restore whatever it destroyed, and because he did not make the house which he built firm and it collapsed, he shall rebuild the house which collapsed from his own property (i.e., at his own expense).\nLegacy and depictions\nDuring his reign Babylon usurped the position of \"most holy city\" in southern Mesopotamia from its predecessor, Nippur, for the final time (Babylon had also previously enjoyed this status under the Akkadians, before it was restored to Nippur in the \"Sumerian renaissance\").\nUnder the rule of Hammurabi's successor Samsu-iluna, the short-lived Babylonian Empire began to collapse. In northern Mesopotamia, both the Amorites and Babylonians were driven from Assyria by Puzur-Sin a native Akkadian-speaking ruler, circa 1740 BC. Around the same time, native Akkadian speakers threw off Amorite Babylonian rule in the far south of Mesopotamia, creating the Sealand Dynasty, in more or less the region of ancient Sumer. Hammurabi's ineffectual successors met with further defeats and loss of territory at the hands of Assyrian kings such as Adasi and Bel-ibni, as well as to the Sealand Dynasty to the south, Elam to the east, and to the Kassites from the northeast. Thus was Babylon quickly reduced to the small and minor state it had once been upon its founding. The coup de grace for the Hammurabi's Amorite Dynasty occurred in 1595 BC, when Babylon was sacked and conquered by the powerful Hittite Empire, thereby ending all Amorite political presence in Mesopotamia. However, the Indo-European-speaking Hittites did not remain, turning over Babylon to their Kassite allies, a people speaking a language isolate, from the Zagros mountains region. This Kassite Dynasty was to rule Babylon for over 400 years, adopting parts of the Babylonian culture, including Hammurabi's code of laws.\nBecause of Hammurabi's reputation as a lawgiver, his depiction can be found in several U.S. government buildings. Hammurabi is one of the 23 lawgivers depicted in marble bas-reliefs in the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives in the United States Capitol. A frieze by Adolph Weinman depicting the \"great lawgivers of history\", including Hammurabi, is on the south wall of the U.S. Supreme Court building.\n- Finet, André (1973).

{"question":"In a computer science context, what is the key difference between a stack and random access memory (RAM)?","answer":"The key difference is that stack data structures can only be accessed sequentially in a Last In, First Out order, while RAM allows any part of the memory to be accessed at any time (randomly). This means with RAM you can jump directly to any piece of data you want, while with a stack you must access data in sequence.","context":["Algorithms and Data Structures (Part 1)Article index:\nFor the last 20 years, Google has been the main search engine used on the internet, accounting for over 90 percent of the market share internationally. (StatCounter.com, 2020.) But how does it work? A Google search works by a set of rules called an algorithm.\nAn algorithm is a set of rules or instructions for completing a task. This applies to human beings as well as computers. The vast amount of data that is available on the internet poses a challenge to anyone who would want to search through it. Google has established a method to search through this data with excellent results.\nAccording to Google, there are actually several algorithms working together to achieve the results for an internet search. One of these is used to determine meaning: Google can substitute synonyms for words in its search such as “move” and “relocate” to find similar matches. Another algorithm is used to analyze relevance. The keywords typed in the search are matched to the page—the better the match, the higher the search results. The search algorithms for Google also incorporate a quality assessment of the website itself in terms of expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness on a given topic (Google, n.d.).\nThis seems like a good start, but the algorithms go even further. The page will also be ranked for “usability,” which means how well the page displays in different browsers and how quickly the pages load. Finally, the algorithm includes personal information about the user that is searching. If that user lives in Barcelona and searches for “fútbol,” Google will prioritize local teams and FC Barcelona would be a higher result compared to results for someone in Berlin.\nOf course, the exact details of Google’s algorithms are secret, like the secret spice recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken. It is, after all, the most popular search engine in the world, and Google would not want anyone stealing their market share by implementing the same algorithms.\nIs the algorithm perfect? No. New sites take a while to start to appear in search results. There is also a chance that a good site match for a particular search does not come up in the first page of searches. However, it is a good enough algorithm that it is the top choice of most web searchers around the world.\nOften in data processing, there will be a data space that is extensively large, like the internet, that poses a challenge. Certain mathematical problems also have a vast number of solutions and can be difficult to manage. Often, it is impossible even for a computer to search through every possibility (at least, if quick results are desired) and an algorithm will be designed to give a “good” result quickly instead of a “perfect” result that takes much longer.\nAlgorithms and Flowcharts\nAn algorithm at its most simple definition is a set of instructions. This works for computing applications as well as human beings. Let’s say that you want to tell someone how to fix a broken lamp. You’d probably ask the usual questions like, “Is it plugged in?” and “Did you replace the light bulb?” However, to put these into a set of instructions, you’d have to organize things a bit more. You’d do something like this:\n- Check to see if the lamp is plugged in. If it isn’t, plug it in. If it works, you’re done. If not, go to step 2.\n- Check the lightbulb. Is it burned out? If so, replace it. If it works, you’re done. If not, go to step 3.\n- The lamp is broken. Buy a new lamp.\nThis is a perfect example of an algorithm. Computer algorithms are especially useful for solving recurrent problems.\nFlowcharts (Flow Diagrams)\nTo translate human instructions into computer instructions, coders have used flowcharts for many years. These charts make it easy to observe the structure of an algorithm and create it with a programming language. They use standard symbols to indicate different types of instructions, as shown below.\nA terminator symbol (oval or rectangle) is used at the beginning of a flowchart and at all the endings. They represent the external nodes of flowcharts. A rectangle represents a process, for instance, some type of data calculation or filtering. The diamond is a decision—a decision has multiple pathways that can be taken. A parallelogram in a flow chart represents input or output, where data are sent into or out of the process. Finally, the arrows represent the flow from beginning to end of the sequence.\nThere are many other symbols that can be used in a flowchart, but these will suffice for now. If we return to our example about fixing a lamp, we can use a flowchart to illustrate that process.\nThe flow starts at the beginning; from there we just follow the arrows along the pathway chosen. You can see that the beginning is a terminator with our starting point: “Lamp doesn’t work.” From there we go to a decision asking if the lamp is plugged in. There are “yes” or “no” options here. These represent binary thinking in computers where a “yes” can be symbolized by a one and a “no” by a zero.\nLet’s take a look at a computer-based example of a flowchart. For this example, we will use a simple key code door lock. The lock works like this: the user has three attempts to enter the correct four-digit code to unlock the door; if they fail three times, the door will be locked for ten minutes and will not take any more input.\nThis illustrates the algorithm for our door lock. At the beginning, when the lock is activated we move from start to the processing step. This is where the counter variable, attempts, is set to zero. Then the input step shows that the four-digit code is entered by the user. Then a decision is made: is the four-digit code correct? If so, the door is unlocked. So far, so good. If it’s not correct, what happens next? It flows to the next decision. To a human, we would ask the question, “Is this the third failed attempt?” However, a computer is different. We have to use the variable “attempts” to count them. We check the value of attempts to see if it is “3.” If it is, then the user is out of attempts and the door will lock for ten minutes. If they haven’t reached three, the flow will loop back to where they enter the code again. Notice that every time they enter the code, the counter is incremented by one. This flowchart, which represents an algorithm, can be used as a guide to create programming instructions for a computer.\nSimple Data Structures\nData are often entered into a computer sequentially, meaning in a specific order. Think of this process as similar to what you are doing now; you are reading letters and words in sequence. Simple data types such as “integer” and “char” will store one unit of information, but to store them in a sequence they must be arranged in a series. There are different ways to do this in computer memory and each has its advantages and drawbacks.\nA stack is a data structure that works under a specific philosophy: Last In, First Out. This is often abbreviated as LIFO. Imagine you are inputting data to a computer program—in this case, we will say it is a card game simulator. It will use a standard deck of 52 cards, and they will be randomized and placed into the stack.\nJust like in real life, when you are playing cards, you can only draw the card from the top of the deck. That is the last card that was placed on top, so it is the last in, but the first out. Once the game is started, the order cannot be changed, the next card in play is always the one on top of the deck—or in our simulation, the stack.\nA stack in computer programming allows for two basic operations: push and pop. Pop will take the top piece of data from the stack, which removes it. Push will add a new item to the top (and only the top) of the stack.\nTo populate the stack with data, we use the push operator, one element at a time. Once all of the data has been entered, it is read by using the pop operator. Note that the pop operation returns the value of the element and removes it from the stack. This is a very simple and efficient way to store data. Pushes and pops can be performed at any time to add or remove elements from the top of the stack. This structure has the advantage of taking up less space than more complicated data structures—however, it cannot be searched randomly.\nRAM is called “Random Access Memory” because any part of it can be accessed at any time. This might seem obvious, but initially computer storage was only accessible in a sequence. This means that any time you wanted to read some data, you had to start at the very beginning until you got to the part you wanted. This is similar to reading a book. Last night you were on page 77 in the book. The next day you wanted to read it you’d have to start at page 1 and read your way all the way back to 77. Obviously, this isn’t very efficient. Random access means you can jump right to whatever page you want, in this case page 77. You could also skip ahead even to parts you haven’t read yet, if you wanted. Stack data structures can only be accessed sequentially, not randomly. Not only that, but the sequence is LIFO, giving you the last element first (imagine reading a book backwards!). There are times that this order might be useful (such as our deck of cards example) and times when it is not. Stacks are used because they take up less memory that other data structures. Basically this means that when you can use a stack for your purposes, you should.\nA linked list is also a sequential data storage structure. Instead of being stored in a simple stack of data, each element is linked to the next. In other words, an element in the data structure linked list contains two pieces of information, the data and the link.\nThe last element in the linked list structure does not have a pointer to the next value, instead it points to null, which indicates that there are no more elements. Null is often used to end a series of data. The link in each list is a pointer, which is a memory location. It identifies the part of memory that contains the next element.\nIn many computer implementations, a linked list is unbounded. This means that there is not a specific number of elements that it is restricted to. (Of course, the size would have an upper limit based on the computer memory or the programming language structure.) This is useful when you are working with a series of data that you do not know the length of, including one that has a continually changing length.\nOne thing that linked lists can do that stacks cannot is insert data into the middle of the sequence. If you imagine the linked list as a chain, the chain could be temporarily broken and have a new link inserted, making it whole again. To do this with the data, we can simply change the pointers to include the new element.\nLet’s say you have a linked list of integers.\nhe list is comprised of the elements 83, 23, 12, 99, 52, and 94. That means that the element containing the 12 also points to the next one containing 99. If we wanted to insert a new node with 37 (a link in the chain) into the list, we would simply have 12 point to 37, and then 37 point to 99 and now we once again have an unbroken chain.\nLinked lists work well if you need speedy access to sequential data with the ability to insert new data into any part of the list.\nOne of the most useful and common data structures is the array. Though it takes up more memory than a stack, for instance, it provides random access for reading and writing data. Usually, when arrays are declared in a programming language, they are “bounded,” meaning that they have a set size. Linked lists offer similar functionality with an unbounded size. However, linked lists do not allow random access to elements. This means that, while arrays are more costly in size, they offer the most functionality of the sequential data structures.\nThe data in an array is arranged in elements, just like our other sequential types. However, each element in the array is given a specific index—a number that identifies it. The index is ordinal and starts at zero (in most programming languages.) This means that the first element is element zero. It may take a while to remember that computers start counting at zero, but there’s a good reason for it. When you are working with small amounts of data and fail to use zero as a counter, you are basically wasting that piece of memory. So, to be more efficient, zero is used as the first number when counting.\nLet’s say you were going to store a list of customer names in an array. It would look something like this:\nThe array name is CustomerName, which will hold all of the elements. The first element is element zero  in the list. The number after the array name is called the index. The value stored in element zero is “Sandra Whitehall.” The advantage of this array is that you can access any element immediately. If you want to read or write to element 3 (the fourth element), you can go directly to it without having to read 0, 1, and 2 first.\nAnother advantage of arrays is that they can be multi-dimensional. If you think of a list of items, for instance, you think of a linear progression from start to end—a line, or one dimension. Adding a second dimension means that the list can be read in two directions. One way to imagine this is to think of a checkerboard. A standard checkerboard is 8 by 8 squares, giving us a total of 64. If you are playing checkers, the squares can have three possibilities for their contents: a red checker, a black checker, or no checker. Let’s store these as RED, BLACK, and NULL.\nThe top left square is the first one at 0,0—remember computers start counting at zero. This means there is a row zero and a column zero on the board. This array references the squares similar to coordinates. The square at 3,5 for example means column 4, row 6 (remember to think like a computer!). Let’s say we simply called this array “checkerBoard.” If a red checker was in square 3,5, we could say:\ncheckerBoard[3,5] = “RED”\nWe could store information for the entire checkerboard using this array, where every square would have RED, BLACK, or NULL stored in it as data. Then we could implement algorithms to move the checker on the board.\nThere are two types of moves, a regular move and a “capture” where you take one piece (or more) of your opponent’s. The checkers must only be on the black squares and therefore must move diagonally. If we have a red checker on 3,5, and we are facing the opponent (we are on the bottom of the board), then the valid regular moves are to go to 4,4 or 2,4. The algorithm would look something like this:\n- Player inputs move choice.\n- Can you move right?\n- Move right is +1 X and -1 Y (Where X and Y are array indices.)\n- Can you move left?\n- Move left is -1 X and -1 Y\nYou would have to test if you could move by checking to see if you are at the edge of the board, and also check whether there was an opposing piece in the way. In other words, if the destination number for X or Y is larger than 7 or less than 0 you are not on the board. If the space you want to move into contains a NULL, it is fine, but if it contains a RED or BLACK piece, you cannot move there.\nOf course, this would just be an algorithm for using a regular move on one piece. There would be a larger algorithm for what happens during a player’s turn, for example, which would include the rules for both a regular move and a capture move. Arrays make it easy to map out coordinates in two or three-dimensional space, like with checkers on a board.\nMore dimensions in arrays\nThere is no need to stop after only two dimensions, but keep in mind that for every dimension you add, you are raising the complexity of the data by an exponent. For instance, our checkerboard takes up 8 x 8 elements of space, for 82 or 64. If we made it a three-dimensional cube, 8 x 8 x 8, it would be 83 or 512 elements. As a\nThere is no need to stop after only two dimensions, but keep in mind that for every dimension you add, you are raising the complexity of the data by an exponent.

Researchers tend to be also building BCIs now to bring back memory.\nBCIs implanted within the brain's engine places can capture the electric indicators that represent particular moves. A pc decodes the signals and uses them to manage some type of computer cursor or prosthetic limb. During the worldwide Future 2045 congress, designers José Carmena and Michel Maharbiz regarding the University of Ca, Berkeley described their particular work to produce steady, lasting, totally wireless BCIs.\nIn addition within summit, neural professional Theodore Berger regarding the University of Southern California in la talked about establishing a memory prosthesis. The unit would replace part of the brain's hippocampus, in which temporary memory is converted to lasting memory. To date Berger has had success in rats and monkeys, and he's presently testing the device in people.\nDarth Vader's robotic body may be closer to truth than men and women believe. Today's prosthetic limbs are remarkably higher level. The so-called Luke arm — named after Luke Skywalker's prosthetic arm in celebrity Wars and made by creator Dean Kamen's business DEKA — is one of the most advanced bionic limbs offered. The arm is managed via a foot-operated joystick, and offered vibration comments towards hand's grip strength.\nIn the worldwide Future 2045 congress, Englishman Nigel Ackland demonstrated his Bebionic 3 artificial hand, which rivals the Luke arm for the reason that it utilizes indicators right from top arm muscle tissue to control the hand, as opposed to a foot joystick. Ackland, just who lost their real turn in a commercial accident, said his Bebionic hand has actually improved his life immensely.\nCompliment of brain-computer interfaces, some bionic arms are now able to be controlled straight because of the brain. Another challenge is delivering physical comments from prosthetic limb, researchers say. [Bionic Humans: Top 10 Technologies]\nOptogenetics is a recently created technique for managing the activity of individual neurons. One of several technique's very early developers, Ed Boyden of MIT, described how it works in a talk at Global Future congress.\nNeuron signals tend to be set off by the motion of recharged atoms, or ions, through stations within their cell membranes. Some forms of algae and other organisms possess light-sensitive channel proteins, encoded inside their DNA by certain genes. Using techniques through the area of gene therapy, scientists can inject these genes into an animal's neurons, making the cells switch on or turn off in response to light. Utilizing optogenetics, scientists can go beyond observing mind activity to actively manipulating it. For-instance, by-turning on olfactory neurons, scientists might lead to an animal to smell light — put differently, neurons generally activated by smells today responded to a light signal.","Brain-to-brain communication was achieved recently using brain-computer interfaces, computer-brain interfaces, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings and the internet. The developers of this brain-to-brain communication system demonstrated the transmission of information between conscious human brains without use of motor or peripheral sensory systems. This means that the information was sent from one mind to another mind without talking or reading.\nElectrical signals emitted by one brain were picked up by electrodes on the scalp, and this information then went to a computer to be converted to binary code. The computer then sent out the information over the internet to another computer. The second computer sent the information to the skull of another person in the form of light flashes, and the brain of this person was consciously able to interpret the signals as information. The computer-to-computer information was transmitted over the internet similarly to how emails are sent. In essence, one brain emailed information to another brain.\nThe scientists who developed this brain-to-brain communication system were from the University of Barcelona in Spain, Axilum Robotics in France, the Berenson Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation of Harvard Medical School and Starlab Barcelona in Spain. A report on the technology was published in the journal PLOS One.\nExperiments were carried out to test the system. One person was designated as the emitter, who transmitted the thoughts, and another person was designated as the receiver, who received the thoughts. The emitter and receiver were separated by a great distance. That is, from India to France or Spain to France, so that there could be no confounding transmission of information. Initially, the emitter said “hola” or “ciao.” The words that were transmitted were encoded by pseudo-random binary streams.\nThe internet mediated brain-to-brain communication was initiated with voluntary imagery-controlled EEG changes. The receiver then had conscious perception of light flashes transmitted through robotized transcranial magnetic stimulation. The receiver did not visually see anything but just received the information in consciousness. Tactile, visual or auditory sensations were blocked.\nIn one part of the experiment, in which thoughts were transmitted from Spain to France, the researchers found a total error rate of 15 percent. The encoding side error rate was five percent and the error rate on the decoding side was about 11 percent. This was considered to be a good rate given the primitive state of the technology.\nBrain wave sensing technology has been developing for a while. It has been reported that EEG headsets were used to record electrical activity on the scalp in such a way that allowed someone to use their mind to control a toy helicopter. Computer technology is always a component in this type of “telepathic” communication system.\nThe authors of the report stated that this technology could have a profound impact on the social structure of human civilization and that ethical issues will need to be considered. The brain-to-brain communication system that works like email is likely to be used to study human consciousness, and can open many new arenas of research in neuroscience. The researchers were reported to have said that clear telepathic communication that is mediated by computers will become routine in the near future.\nBy Margaret Lutze"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2e24b995-1346-4b22-92ed-4a04d44dab0f>","<urn:uuid:918fe784-3bf0-449f-99fc-a63af4740e59>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you compare the duration of a professional NBA basketball game with the length of an Underwater Hockey (Octopush) match? What's the actual gameplay time for each?","answer":"An NBA basketball game consists of 48 minutes of actual gameplay divided into four quarters of 12 minutes each, while an Underwater Hockey (Octopush) match has 15 minutes of gameplay. However, both sports typically last longer in practice - NBA games usually take 2-2.5 hours due to fouls, half-time breaks, and potential overtimes, while Underwater Hockey has natural breaks due to players needing to surface for air approximately every 30 seconds.","context":["There’s hockey. There’s ice-hockey. And then there’s Underwater Hockey, originally known as ‘Octopush’, the sport was invented in 1954 by Alan Blake of the Southsea ub-Aqua Club. It was first put to test at that very club by divers John Ventham, Frank Lilleker and Jack Willis. This is a quirky sport devoted to having fun in the water. It is also highly egalitarian given the fact that just about anyone can play with great flair. Another motivation to create such a hybrid sport was probably to maintain the clientele base at the club even during winter when it was too cold to dive into the sea.\nThe original rules required a team of eight players, thus supplying the first part of the name, ‘Octo’, a heavy bat called ‘pusher’ was used and also provided the latter part of the name ‘push’. An uncoated lead puck christened ‘squid’ and lastly a goal initially known as a ‘cuttle’ but soon after renamed ‘gully’ were what were required to play the game. The first Octopush competition between clubs was a three-way play-off between teams from Southsea, Bournemouth and Brighton in early 1955. Southsea proved victorious in the submerged sport and are still a force to reckon with at a national level.\nOctopush is defined as a non-contact sport in the same vein as basketball. The rules of the game thwart the use of brute force. Play is conducted solely on the bottom of the pool so efficacy is determined by how much time a player can spend at the bottom of the pool. With exertion plummeting bottom time to an average of 30 seconds, Octopush is a true mascot of team spirit bar none. Since no player can stay below for long stretches and is dependent on his team members to pick up slack when one goes up for air.\nUnderwater hockey can be played as a casual sport and even as a serious competition. Whether the players are horsing around in the water or being fiercely competitive, Octopush provides incredible exercise to improve free diving skills and diving muscles.\nA player must work his/her way through a mildly extensive list of equipment that are specifically chosen to aid the sustainability of the game. A small volume free diving mask, large bore snorkels, ear plugs, soft free diving fins, heavy weight gardening gloves covered with aquaseal and a specially designed stick are not only tools, some are explicitly recommended to protect the player from any untoward course taken by the puck which may cause substantial physical damage.\nPlunged into a 25m x 15m and 2m deep all the way across, players aim for lead weights 3 meters of rope that can be used for goals, but professionals testify that the ‘thunk’ of the puck against the metal goal is tremendously gratifying. With the teams lined up at either end and the puck in the middle at the start of the game, teams play zones as in basketball with forward offensive players and back defensive players.\nAn offensive player, the Centre tries to get the preliminary possession of the puck. Wings (right and left) take it upon themselves to score goals and steal the puck from the opposing team’s defense. Burdened with the task of limiting the other team’s offense, Halfbacks follow the play closely in order to be in a rewarding position so as to do his/her role justice. Playing the ‘pivot point’ the entire defense is played out by the Swingback. With game play lasting 15 minutes, Octopush is refereed by a total of three referees, two in the water and one on the pool deck to track time and penalties.\nExtensive change in equipment, team size and other supplementary factors have made Octopush the international sport it is today. Vastly popular in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, the Netherlands and France along with Japan, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and many others, World Championships are held every two years. At the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS) 14th World Underwater Hockey Championship held in 2006 in Sheffield, England, 44 teams competed in six age and gender categories.\nDefinitely not a spectator sport, Octopush is indeed a fascinating sport that should be fun for those willing to experiment with a sport that thrills!","How long does a high school basketball game last? A general high school basketball game lasts approximately 32 minutes. The National Federation of State High School Associations announced that high school basketball game should be at least 32 minutes long. A high school basketball game is comprised of four quarters with eight minutes each so the time taken is 32 minutes.\nĐang xem: High school basketball game time\nMost of the basketball fans don’t care of the time when they watch their favorite team play. For them the game is so interesting that they don’t think about how much time they spend watching. It’s just pure entertainment, mostly if your team wins. But it will not be entertaining if your favorite team loses.\nWhat is the Basketball game and it’s various Types?\nIn basketball game two opposite teams mostly with five players play on a rectangular court and it is a team sport game. The field goal is significant two points unless when it takes place past the three point-point line.\nThe time vary that it takes to play basketball matches. By various degrees of basketball games the difference is brought about. For example, for high school, college, NCAA, NBA, and professional players the basketball time differ. Besides, each of the above levels uses the extra time whenever there’s a draw once the game ends.\nIt is the higher learning organizations additionally play b-ball. The National Collegiate Athletic Association is the most necessary body in the basketball. This basketball game is so unique that it only stops for one break as there are only two-halves. It takes two 20 minutes parts, dissimilar to the four quarters utilized in other ordinary matches.\nSimilar to the National Basketball Association half-time break takes 15 minutes. Broadcast school games approximately last for 2 hours, 10 minutes.\nNCAA Basketball Game\nNational Collegiate Athletic Association is actually the assemblage of school b-ball. This game is viewed as so long. Various breaks practically take 30 minutes of the game. When the ball hits any of the basket edges or it alters the team possessing the ball, shot checks come in and the ball is shot. That time differs. The shot clock ranges 30 seconds for women and 35 seconds for men according to the NCAA.\nNBA Basketball Game\nNBA basketball game is divided into four quarters and each quarter takes 12 minutes so this game totally takes 48 minutes. If a tie happens among the teams playing then the time of the game will increase. A tie in the basketball game leads to the overtime and in this way the game is played many times until a winner is decided.\nA tie takes the overtime of approximately 5 minutes. Also fouls, half-time and ball out-of-bound results to a lot of guidance that the time of the game increases and the half-time usually take 15 minutes. This game includes 5 minutes overtime so the usual NBA game takes 2-2.5 hours.\nHigh School Basketball Game\nIn the secondary schools basketball game is among the most frequently played games. Secondary school games take 32 minutes at an estimate. High school basketball games on average range from one hour and a half to more than two hours. Basketball games length may hugely vary because of the different styles of the play, the level of the competition, the number of fouls called in the game and many more.\nProfessional Basketball Game\nProfessional Basketball game depends on the affiliation managing it. The complete time taken to play a particular professional game is more than 2 hours and 15 minutes. The time includes the time interruptions such as fouls and breaks. Unlike Olympic and FIBA games NBA games have various breaks.\nHow long do various basketball games last?\n|Professional Basketball Game||48 minutes-2 hours 15 minutes|\n|High School Basketball Game||32 minutes|\n|NBA Basketball Game||48 minutes|\n|College Basketball Game||2 hours 10 minutes|\n|NCAA Basketball Game||2 hours|\nActual length of a High School Basketball Game?\nAs mentioned above high school basketball games on average range from one hour and a half to more than two hours. Basketball games length may hugely vary because of the different styles of the play, the level of the competition, the number of fouls called in the game and many more.\nEvery high school or other basketball games must have a winner. Overtime will follow if the score is tied at the end of regulation time and another 5 to 6 minutes are added to the game. However, before the overtime begins some extra seconds or even minutes are spent for the preparation of coaches, referees and players.\nIf at the end of the first overtime the game’s score is still tied, other overtime will follow. This process will go on until a particular team wins. In a high school basketball game it is unusual to have 4-5 OTs. In fact, on record the most number of OTs is 13.\nOn Live TV How long is a High School Basketball Game?\nIf you plan to watch your favorite high school basketball team on TV, be prepared to spend more than two hours because television coverage of a high school basketball game will be even longer. Pre- and post-game reviews are typically conducted by the TV hosts with the basketball analysts, players and so forth. Generally, time for these reviews adds up on top of the actual game time.\nThe pre-game show usually starts 30 minutes before the game begins. To predict what could happen in the upcoming match typically the host will interview a basketball analyst.\nThe post game show is generally a bit shorter and will take approximately 10-15 minutes. The host will interview the leading player of the game as well as the MVP of the game. The analyst may also attempt to break down what happened in the just ended match involving its implication on the respective team’s forthcoming games. To the actual time the game finished to arrive at the total time taken by that particular game we have to add the times allotted for the pre- and post game show.\nThat’s why if the average game time is somewhere between one and a half hours to two hours, on TV a high school basketball game will take around two hours and 15 minutes to 2 hours and 45 minutes.\nThan the regular season ball games high school basketball playoff games are even longer. In high school basketball games on average playoff games are 15-20 minutes longer than the regular games.\nThis is because in the playoffs, there are many free throws, more in-game and post-game reviews, more timeouts and more substitution etc. That’s why ready to spend at least more than two hours or even three hours or more if you want to watch a high school basketball match on TV.\nXem thêm: All Island Basketball Camp\nHow long is a basketball quarter?\nBasketball games are played in phases. These phases are referred to as quarters. The time of the quarters depend on the type of the game. Different sports associations have different time for their games. That’s why the game will rely on the competition level.\nThe correct time for any quarter according to NBA is 12 minutes. International Basketball Federation for its games has a 10 minutes quarter. NCAA game takes 20 minutes as it is divided into two halves and high school basketball game takes 8 minutes per quarter.\nIn a High School Basketball Game how Is Time Counted?\nIn a sports match the clock is the most critical tool mostly in a basketball game. During a basketball match as soon as the clock kicks in, it will continue running until one of the following things happen:\nThe ball goes out of bound\nA time out is called either by a coach or a referee\nA foul shooter is shooting his free throws\nA referee calls a foul\nThe clock kicks back in as soon as the ball gets inbound and a player receives the ball. The short clock is activated and the time countdown begins. In the USA there are states that do not require shot clocks, they follow the 35-second shot clock utilized by the NCCA.\nThe Shot Clock\nTo improve the game pace the shot clock is incorporated by some of the states. Players without the shot clock tend to prolong their shots as part of their game strategy. If the ball does not go down the hole but hits the rim, the shot clock starts again at 35 seconds. The shot clock will continue to wind down if the ball does not hit the rim.\nOvertime will follow if a player shoots a ball and sinks it in the last minutes of game, resulting in a tied score. In a basketball game there is no tied game unlike other sports. To the time clock extra 5 minutes will be added. There should always be a winner no matter how long a high school basketball game will last.\nFor the basketball teams the timeouts are important. To strategize their plays in response to what is happening on the floor they utilize these breaks. Extra breathing time to rest and recover from the physicality of running to and fro is provided to the players by these breaks.\nA team is allowed a maximum of 5 timeouts in high school basketball game. For a timeout the coach or any active player on the team can call. Full timeouts are known as the three of the five timeouts, with each being 60 seconds. Two timeouts are only 30 seconds each and they can only be called at the beginning of the game.\nIn just one quarter teams are permitted to utilize all their timeouts or save them up until the last quarter. Each team will have one full timeout if there is overtime. During the regulation time any unused timeouts will be carried over to the prolonged period.\nWho determines the length of a High School Basketball Game?\nA governing body that sets the rules of high school basketball games is the National Federation of State High School Associations. This organization sets the length of a high school basketball game. In the entire 50 states as well as Washington, DC, for girls and boys the National Federation of State High School Associations makes the rules of Basketball games.\nThere are around 1800 member schools that follow their rules. This body ensures that in United States there is consistency in sports competition in all high schools.\nDifferent Factors affecting the length of a High School Basketball Game?\nThere are some factors that affect the length of a high school basketball game and to know how long high school basketball games last, you need to know that factors. Here is a list of all those factors that can occur during a basketball game between two high school teams involving the general time one basketball game lasts.\n1. Timeouts: Each team is permitted five timeouts per game. For the basketball teams the timeouts are important. To strategize their plays in response to what is happening on the floor they utilize these breaks. Extra breathing time to rest and recover from the physicality of running to and fro is provided to the players by these breaks.\nA maximum of the 5 timeouts are allowed to the team in high school basketball game. For a timeout the coach or any active player on the team can call. Full timeouts are known as the three of the five timeouts, with each being 60 seconds. Two timeouts are only 30 seconds each and they can only be called at the beginning of the game.\n2. Ball Possessions: The 35-second shot clock kicks in when there are changes in ball possessions or when the ball hits the rim. This shot clock rule is only followed by the eight states in the NFHS. This rule is not followed by the rest of the states. That is the reason why their matches are generally long.\n3. Team Fouls: For every quarter five team fouls are allowed.\n4. Halftime Break: There is a 10 minutes long halftime break during the game.\n5. Four Quarters: In four quarters a high school basketball game is played. For the varsity level each quarter has eight minutes and for the junior varsity level has 6-7 minutes.\n6. More Fouls: The lagging team may perform more fouls to stop the 35-second shot clock. It will provide them more time to catch up, making the game considerably longer.\nThe factors explained above are some of the things that make high school basketball games last longer. Only eight states follow this rule tha’s why Most high school basketball associations have no standing shot clock rule\nThe shot clock stops if any of the above things happen for those who follow this rule, If there are 10 seconds or less left in the shot clock, it will be persisted when the shot clock starts again."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:525c4057-efcb-4332-a468-5b4015b7d8e8>","<urn:uuid:8b3e828f-bf4b-49ba-8107-b745f30259f1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you explain the geography and climate of Hubei province? What are its notable features in terms of mountains, rivers, and temperature?","answer":"Hubei province is surrounded by mountains on its west, north and east, with 55% of its area covered by mountains and 25% by lower hills. Its highest point is Shennong Peak at 3,105 meters. The province has over 1,300 lakes and 1,193 rivers, with the Yangtze River being the largest, flowing 1,061 km through the province. The region experiences extreme temperatures, particularly in Wuhan, which is known as one of the furnaces of the Yangtze, with summer temperatures regularly reaching 40°C in July and August.","context":["Located in the heart of China, Hubei is bordered by Chongqing Municipality to the west, and by Shaanxi to the northwest, Henan to the north and northeast, Anhui to the east, Jiangxi to the southeast, and Hunan to the south. At an area of 187,500 km2, Hubei is slightly larger than Syria. Its name means ‘North of the Lake’ referring to its location north of Dongting Lake as compared to Hunan which means ‘South of the Lake’.\nDuring China’s Zhou Dynasty (1046-221BCE) Hubei was ruled by the Kingdom of Chu which at its fullest power controlled most of the present-day Hubei and Hunan, as well as parts of Chongqing, Guizhou, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. Hubei first fell under Chinese rule during the Qin Dynasty (221-206BCE) but Chu resistant to Qin rule remained. Hubei was finally fully assimilated into the Chinese state during the Han Dynasty (206bce–220ce).\nFrom the 1850s onward, the history of Hubei grew increasingly tumultuous. The Taiping Rebellion spread into Hubei by 1852, devastating the province for more than a decade. After China lost the second 1856-1860 Opium War, the Hubei cities of Hankou, Yichang and eventually Shashi were opened to trade with the West, bringing not only new commerce into the province, but also western ideas and influence. Much of western trade was based first on tea, and then expanded to include tobacco and other food products.\nTurmoil continued after the turn of the century when a group of Wuchang-based revolutionaries, secretly stockpiling ammunition for a revolt, accidentally let one of the bomb explode. Realizing the game was up, they declared war on the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and took control of the city. As word of the revolt spread, many imperial troops joined the rebels as opposed to fighting for emperor. The Qing Dynasty looked to its top military leader Yuan Shikai to suppress the rebellion. Instead, he effectively negotiated the end of imperial rule in China and the Republic of China was born. During the 1937-1945 Sino-Japanese war, much of Hubei came under Japanese control, and fighting swept the area. Even after the war ended in 1945, chaos, banditry and fighting continued to plague the province until the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949 and the People’s Republic of China was founded.\nIn 1954, the province, especially Wuhan city, was devastated when high volumes of rain and an unusually long rainy season caused catastrophic Yangtze River flooding, resulting in the deaths of approximately 33,000 people. As a consequence of this and other flooding, China began a spree of dam building on the Yangtze starting with the Gezhouba Dam located in the western suburbs of Hubei’s Yichang City and culminating with the famous Three Gorges Dam 38 kilometers upstream from the Gezhouba Dam Lock. China also built a number of smaller dams on the Yangtze’s tributaries. These dam projects caused the resettlement of millions of people in western Hubei.\nIn 2017, Hubei had a population of approximately 59 million people, making it the 9th most populous region in China. The majority Hubei’s residents are Han. The few minorities living in Hubei are mostly Hui, although some Tujia and Miao peoples live in Hubei’s southwestern hills. About half Hubei’s population is rural, mostly living in the plains running alongside the Yangtze and Han Rivers. About a third of its urban population- close to 10 million people -live in Hubei’s capital of Wuhan, which itself is an amalgam of the three former cities of Hankou, Hanyang, and Wuchang. Other large cities in Hubei include Huangshi, Shashi, Yichang, and Xiangfan.\nAccording to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, in 2018 Hubei’s GDP was approximately $588 billion, the 7th largest in the country. Its per capita GDP was approximately $9,943. Overall, its GDP accounts for 4.5% of China’s total which was generated by 4.2% of China’s population. Its GDP per capita is ranked 10th out of China’s 33 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. Hubei’s primary industries accounted for approximately 10.3% of GDP, secondary industries 44.5% of GDP and tertiary industries 45.2% GDP.\nOften called a ‘Land of Rice and Fish’, its fertile Jianghan Plain is one of China’s most important agricultural and aquaculture producing regions. Hubei is a leading rice-producer. It also grows wheat, barley, broad beans, cotton, sesame, peanuts, rapeseed, ramie, hemp, fruit, and tea. Hubei also produces the forest product tung oil and raises pigs and poultry.\nApproximately 138 different types of minerals have been identified in Hubei, with 89 of these minerals having some level of reserves. Hubei’s deposits of phosphorus ore, silica, hongshiite, wollastonite, garnet, marlstone, iron, phosphorus, copper, gypsum, rock salt, gold amalgam, manganese, and vanadium are some of the largest in China. It is also known for its turquoise and green faustite. Hubei has limited energy minerals with only small deposits of coal, petroleum and natural gas. That said, due to the large number of dams in the province, Hubei has excellent hydroelectricity capacity.\nIts abundant hydroelectricity capacity has helped drive the growth of its heavy industry, Industrially, Hubei has a relatively comprehensive iron and steel industry that engages in all aspects of production from geological prospecting to smelting and rolling. The Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation is famous throughout China. Hubei is also an important center for automobile production and assembly and it has a robust automobile parts manufacturing industry. It also engages in petroleum and chemical processing and ship building as well as the production of chemical fertilizers, machinery, textiles, foodstuffs, high-tech commodities, optical-electronics, telecommunications and laser equipment.\nIn 2017, foreign direct investment in the province reached $11 billion.\nLay of the Land\nSituated north of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Hubei is surrounded by Wuling, Wushan, Daba, Wudang, Tongbai, Dabie and Mufu Mountains on the west, north and east. 55% of Hubei is covered by mountains while another 25% is blanketed by lower hills. At 3,105 meters, Hubei’s highest point is Shennong Peak in the Daba Mountain range.\nThe rest of Hubei is made up of plain, lakes and rivers. The Jianghan Plain extends through central and eastern Hubei southward to join in Hunan with Dongting Lake Plain and Dongting Lake. This plain area is dotted with lakes, giving Hubei the name ‘the province of a thousand lakes’. In total, there are more than 1,300 lakes in the region. The largest of these are Lake Liangzi and Hong Lake.\nHubei is traversed by 1,193 rivers of different sizes, their combined lengths totaling 37,000 km. Among these rivers, 42 course more than 100 km. The Yangtze River is the largest and flows 1,061 km, entering western Hubei through the Three Gorges; the eastern half of the Three Gorges lies in Hubei, while the western half is in neighboring Chongqing. Prior to completion of the Three Gorges Dam, the Yangtze ran down quickly into the Hubei Plain. The spring and summer rains radically increased its volume; during years of exceptional rains, the Yangtze flooded catastrophically. Today, its flow down to the plain is largely regulated, and much of the Three Gorges region is inundated by the dam’s massive reservoir. While flowing through Hubei, the Yangtze receives waters from of two major tributaries, the Han and the Qing Rivers. Running 878 km in Hubei from northwest to southeast, the Han River converges with the Yangtze at Wuhan.\nWith summer temperatures regularly reaching 40 °C in July and August, Wuhan is known as one of the furnaces of the Yangtze and is certainly one of the hottest places in China.\nInteresting Aspects for a Traveler\nMuch of interest in Wuhan has been ceded to the massive city’s relentless modernization and expansion. That said, glimpses of its past can be seen in some of its post-Opium War architecture constructed by the Europeans within the concessions they had won through fighting. This architecture is best discovered in the Yanjiang Dadao area of Wuhan. Also pleasant is the stroll along Wuhan’s Hankou Bund running along the Yangtze or around Wuhan’s East Lake. Interesting Wuhan museums include the: Hubei Provincial Museum which show cases the world’s largest musical instrument – 64 double tone bronze bells; Hubei Museum of Art, displaying modern and more ancient works as well as travelling exhibitions; Revolution of 1911 Museum, telling the story of the fall of the Qing Dynasty and the birth of modern China. Wuhan’s important temples include the Guiyuan Temple, which showcases a 350 year old collection of Buddhist statues of enlightened disciples, and the Changchun Temple, a Daoist temple dating back to the Han Dynasty, although it has since been heavily restored.\nJingzhou, the capital of the ancient Chu kingdom, is still surrounded by its defensive city wall which can be circumnavigated either by bike of foot. Around its South and East Gates, there is a festive feel as fortune tellers, entertainers, food hawkers, haircutters and others selling goods and services – including custom hire – congregate. Many old temples are close to the wall or are close by including the Kaiyuan, Guandi, Tienu, Xuanmiao and Confucian Temples.\nThe farmland surrounding Jingzhou is home to several Chu kingdom burial sites which are at different stages of excavation. The 2300 year old Xiongjia Zong site, for instance, is the largest collection of Chu kingdom tombs ever discovered. Much of which has already been excavated is on display at the Jingzhou Museum, including a large collection of jade artifacts. Visitors to the site can also see the skeletal remains of two horses drawing an ancient chariot. Due to concerns about adequate preservation, many of the tombs still remain untouched.\nLocated close to Hubei’s northern border, Wudang Shan Mountain is an important sitefor Daoist pilgrims and is famous in martial art circles as the birth place of Tai Chi. The mountain makes for good, although often quite steep, climbing. A popular trek is the Heavenly Pillar Peak which passes by the Purple Could Temple and the Chaotian Temple – replete with a statue of the Jade Emperor who in the Chinese traditional religion pantheon is one of the most important Gods – ruler of Heaven and all realms of existence below including those of Man and Hell. The path then divides between the shorter, steeper Ming Dynasty route which climbs through the Three Heaven’s Gates to the Second Gate of Heaven, and between the easier, 100 stair Qing Dynasty path. Located near the top of the climb are the Forbidden City and the 1416 bronze Golden Hall.\nYichang offers an opportunity to visit the Three Gorges Dam which can be seen from a tourist viewing platform. There is also a small informational museum and gift shop on the site.\nLocated in Hubei’s far western region, Shennongjia National Park is one of Hubei’s most beautiful national park offering good hiking, camping, monkey viewing and an opportunity to learn about many of China’s traditional medicinal plants."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:19cf55ff-6c76-47c8-a40a-4e8b320d0962>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the role of thought experiments in personal identity discussions, and how does animalism challenge traditional views of human identity?","answer":"Thought experiments play a key role in exploring personal identity, as seen in scenarios like brain transplants and cloning that help examine core philosophical questions. However, these thought experiments can oversimplify complex moral and identity issues by artificially eliminating variables. Meanwhile, animalism presents a direct challenge to psychological theories of identity by arguing that we are fundamentally human animals whose identity is determined by biology rather than psychology or memories. This creates tension with common intuitions about personal identity, as animalism implies we cannot survive brain transplants or exist in an afterlife since we cannot exist independently of our biological organism.","context":["If you read a bit further in the link to the trolley car problems that I put up, then you'll notice that there is a lot of discussion on exactly why the moral answer changes through apparently irrelevant changes in the question. For example, quoting wikipedia:\nUnger also considers cases which are more complex than the original trolley problem, involving more than just two results. In one such case, it is possible to do something which will (a) save the five and kill four (passengers of one or more trolleys and/or the hammock-sleeper), (b) save the five and kill three, (c) save the five and kill two, (d) save the five and kill one, or (e) do nothing and let five die. Most naïve subjects presented with this sort of case, claims Unger, will choose (d), to save the five by killing one, even if this course of action involves doing something very similar to killing the fat man, as in Thomson's case above.What's interesting about this difference is that most people will avoid choosing to kill the fat man above when the choices are phrased as being between killing the fat man or letting 5 die. But when you phrase the question this way, with a continuum of answers, people seem to choose killing the fat man (or a situation analogous to killing the fat man). Does the moral calculus change? Not from what I can see. But the answers do.\nAs the wikipedia article states, Unger draws the conclusion that these questions don't enlighten moral questions, but rather just explore psychology. I don't think we need abandon the philosophical merit of these discussions (after all, there's an argument for the idea that morality is derived from the way human beings are inclined to treat each other and wish to be treated by others), but Unger's problem is illuminating. When we do philosophy, we often try to seek at deep truths. We do this by trying to discover a pertinent question and drive towards it, isolating it and discovering why it's important. Philosophy is packed full of such thought games, ranging from the trolley car problem to discussions about what it would mean to copy one's self and how that relates to the identity of the mind.* But all these thought games, while allowing us to drive deep at an aspect of a problem, have another aspect which we need to keep in mind as philosophical inquirers: the limitation of perspective.\nWhen we use a thought game, we explicitly throw out variables and questions that we don't want to think about in a given experiment. One example (the one brought up by my interlocutor) is this: \"Why push the fat man? Why not jump off in front of the bridge yourself?\" My immediate response was \"Well, pretend you can't jump off; we're trying to focus on the difference between the choice of throwing the fat man off and letting the workers die.\" But in doing that, I was shutting down a path of inquiry. In deciding not to explore that other option, I was getting myself closer to discussing what I found interesting about the thought game, but I was also distancing myself from the reality of the choice. Another example of where this has happened is when I was discussing a problem of voting (Do you cast your votes for the policies which would best benefit you, or do you cast them for the policies which you feel would best benefit society?). Talking with my brother, I asked him that question and he responded with \"Well, you cast your votes for yourself, since most people are ill equipped to know what's best for all of society but better equipped to understand what's best for themselves. If everyone votes for their own interest, then it will aggregate out to be best for society.\" This didn't address the problem I wanted to talk about, so I responded with \"Well, just ignore that for a moment. As a voter, are you supposed to use your vote as a shareholder of society's welfare, or as a representative of yourself?\" To which my brother replied \"What's the point of the distinction?\" Obviously, if you don't accept as a premise the idea that your vote could be different voting for yourself than for society, then the distinction will seem pointless. My brother's first answer showed that he didn't accept my premise, and thus couldn't see the point of the rest of my inquiry. The restrictions I wanted to put on it seemed too artificial.\nIt frustrated me at the time, but I realized that his question, and the question of my reader about the trolley problem, are both very important. What they serve to do is remind the philosopher that the inquiry can be made to look at the problem from any perspective I want to, given arbitrary parameters. I can certainly eliminate possible perspectives as much as I please, but each time I do that I distance myself further and further from a broader understanding. Moral choices are always more complicated than kill 5 men or kill the fat man. We as philosophers need to be careful that we don't lose sight of that complication in our search for the fascinating nuggets of philosophical dilemma.\n*This is a little bit complicated, but the idea is to refute Locke's theory of identity, which is based on the idea that a person is identical to the person they remember being. The idea for Locke is that a person's identity is not a matter of their body being the same (as person X grows older and the body changes, does person X not share a continuous identity with himself? While some would argue for a radical identity that person X is a different person every time anything changes about person X, most believe that there is some kind of continuity which transcends physical change). If it's not a bodily matter, then perhaps it has to do with memory? Locke argued that since you remember being you in the past, you're the same person (allowing changes). However, one way to argue against Locke here is to propose the thought game of cloning. If I were to be put in a replicator machine and a clone of me were to be made, having all my memories and physical characteristics, we both be identical to the me before cloning under Locke's rules, but we couldn't be identical to each other, since we were having different unshared experiences now that we were clones. This is a logical impossibility, as can be shown using variables. Call me before the replication X. Call the two me's after replication Y and Z. If both Y and Z are identical to X, that's represented as Y=X and Z=X. But then Y must be identical to Z, which can't be true if we're separate clones having separate unshared experiences. Since Y /= Z, then the contradiction disproves Locke.","Author: Kristin Seemuth Whaley\nCategory: Metaphysics, Philosophy of Religion\nWord Count: 995\nWhat are we? Philosophers often look for answers that capture what we are fundamentally—what makes us who we are.\nMaybe we’re non-physical souls or minds. Maybe we’re our thoughts and our memories. Or, perhaps we’re physical things like bodies or brains.\nAccording to a view called animalism, we’re human animals. This view is the focus of our discussion here.\nAnimalism is the view that each of us is a human animal: a biological organism of the species Homo sapiens. Animalists acknowledge that human animals typically exhibit rationality and levels of intelligence that other animals don’t, but hold that we are animals nonetheless.\nAnimalism has implications for our identity over time, how we’re still us through the past, present, and future, despite the many ways we change. If we’re human animals, then we can’t exist independently of those animals; what’s often called personal identity depends on our being the same animal over time—it’s a matter of biology.\n2. Animalism vs. Psychological Theories\nAnimalism departs from views according to which our identity over time is a matter of our psychology, on being psychologically connected to our past and future selves through our thoughts, memories, and self-conceptions: e.g., if you remember not liking broccoli as a kid but like broccoli now, you’re still the same person because you remember being that kid.\nTo see how animalism and psychological theories diverge, imagine this:\nYou are diagnosed with an untreatable illness. Your doctor proposes a cutting-edge procedure to transplant your brain into another body, and your body will be kept alive long enough to salvage any remaining healthy organs for other patients awaiting transplants. After the procedure, the patient with your brain wakes up and thinks, “Amazing! I have a new body and no illness!”\nWhere are you: with your brain or with your body?\nAccording to psychological theories, the patient with your brain, who is psychologically connected to your earlier self, who remembers being you, is you.\nAccording to animalism, this patient is not you: identity is a matter of biology, not psychology. You are the animal with the illness but no brain, since this biological organism continues to live the same biological life that you were living before. Your brain is joined up with a different animal living a different biological life.\nAnimalism entails that even a human animal on life support with no possibility of conscious activity is still one of us. And we can’t outlive these animals in an afterlife or—if technology ever enables this—by uploading our consciousnesses to a virtual reality, or getting new bodies through brain transplants. So animalism denies some common views about our identity through time.\n3. The Case for Animalism\nWhy do some people accept animalism? The best case for it is the Thinking Animal Argument, directed at a seated reader:\nPremise 1: There is a human animal sitting in your chair.\nPremise 2: The human animal sitting in your chair is thinking.\nPremise 3: You are the only thinking being sitting in your chair.\nConclusion: Therefore, you are the human animal sitting in your chair.\nThe being in your chair is a biological organism, a human animal; this living human organism with (right now) a functional brain, is thinking; you are the only thinker there, no other thinking being is also in your chair.\nIf successful, the argument establishes that you are that human animal. It’s not that you and the animal occupy the same space, thinking the same thoughts. There’s just one thinker there, you, which establishes identity between you and the animal. Therefore, you are a human animal. And, if so, your identity depends on being the same human animal over time.\n4. Resisting Animalism\nRejecting the argument requires denying a premise.\nDenying premise 1—that there is a human animal sitting in your chair—is hard to defend.\nDenying premise 2—that the human animal sitting in your chair is thinking—requires claiming that the human animal isn’t thinking: the organism is not what literally thinks, but it is intimately related to a mind or a soul that does think. But if human animals don’t think, then either other intelligent organisms like dolphins or chimpanzees are not actually intelligent, or they, too, are intimately related to minds that think.\nIf we are thinking minds, not thinking animals, this might challenge some of our everyday judgments about ourselves and our relationship to physical things: e.g., you never actually see yourself in the mirror (you see the organism); if you take a road trip with your dog, Spot, where we normally judge there to be two things are actually four (the human animal, the canine animal, you, and Spot); and you and Spot never snuggle (only the organisms do).\nDenying premise 3—that you are the only thinking being sitting in your chair—instead requires claiming that you are not the only thinker: you’re a thinker, and so is the human animal, with thoughts exactly like yours. But if there are two thinkers in your chair, you won’t know that you’re not the animal. Even if you think, “I’m not the animal; I’m the thinker that’s not the animal,” the animal will think the exact same thing. So, denying premise 3 doesn’t provide any assurance that you’re not an animal.\nAnother way to resist is with a parallel Thinking Brain Argument about the brain located where you are. The argument has analogous support, but its conclusion contradicts animalism: you are a brain not an animal. So we might have equally good evidence for a competing conclusion. At the least, it warrants more discussion of what it takes to be a thinker.\nSo, what are we, fundamentally? Animals? Brains? Minds? Souls? Some combination?\nAny answer has consequences for our self-understanding and raises further philosophical questions: When do we come into, and go out of, existence? Who counts as one of us, and what moral obligations do we have toward them? There’s a lot at stake when considering “What are we?”\n Descartes (1641) argues that each of us is an immaterial thing, a soul or a mind, rather than a physical thing, like a body. For an overview of his argument, see Meditation 6: The Existence of Physical Things and Substance Dualism in Descartes’ Meditations 4-6 by Marc Bobro.\n Olson (1999) is a major proponent of animalism. For additional presentations of animalism and its various forms, see Bailey (2015), Thornton (2016), and Blatti (2019).\n For an explanation of biological identity, continuing to live the same biological life, see Blatti (2019, §1.2); for an opposing view, see Madden (2016). The relationship between animalism and our identity over time is a matter of current debate; see Duncan (forthcoming) and Bailey, Thornton, and van Elswyk (forthcoming).\n Locke (1690, II.xxvii) argues that personal identity is a matter of psychology. For an introduction to psychological theories of personal identity, see section 3 of Personal Identity by Chad Vance.\n Another option is that neither patient is you, even if the procedure is successful. But, at most, you either follow your brain or stay with your body. Perhaps both patients survive as individuals very closely related, but not identical to, you. For discussions of survival as opposed to identity, see Parfit (1984).\n For fictional representations of what this might be like, see Amazon’s Upload series or Black Mirror’s “San Junipero.”\n The general challenge of the afterlife is that if you gain a new body or exist unembodied after physical death, you don’t appear to be the same animal. Some animalists, such as van Inwagen, try to preserve the possibility of an afterlife by arguing that God transports the human organism into a physical afterlife and puts a corpse in its place on earth; see discussion in Hasker and Taliferro (2019). Other animalists suggest different strategies for preserving the possibility of an afterlife, see, for example, Thornton (2019).\n This is a reconstruction of Olson’s argument (2003). For other arguments for animalism, see Blatti (2012) and Bailey (2016).\n If, later, this human animal has its brain removed for a brain transplant, then this human animal would no longer be thinking. But premise 2 is about what’s happening right now.\n Philosophers of personal identity will go to great lengths to preserve the idea behind this premise; theories of personal identity should not lead to the conclusion that there are multiple thinkers where you are. For discussion, see Hershenov (2013).\n Some philosophers would deny premise 1 and endorse mereological nihilism, according to which there are no composite physical objects, such as animals (or chairs, for that matter). For discussion of this view, see Wasserman (2017, §4).\n Chimpanzees and dolphins, like humans, communicate, develop social relationships, use tools, work together cooperatively, and recognize themselves in the mirror, all of which provide evidence of thought and intelligence (Bearzi and Stanford 2010).\n If we were to give an inventory of everything in the car, we’d typically mention things like luggage, Spot’s toys, road trip snacks, water bottle, etc., you, and Spot. But, once we’ve accounted for you and Spot, we would likely fail to account for two things that are very obviously in the car: the human animal and the canine animal.\n Denying premise 3 also requires denying some everyday judgments: there would be twice as many thinkers as we normally recognize; the person and the animal are both thinking. If you do something nice for a friend, you’ve brought happiness to both your friend and the animal located where your friend is. If you say something that hurts their feelings, you’ve actually done it twice over: once to the person and once to the animal.\n The Thinking Brain Argument proceeds as follows:\nPremise 1′: There is a human brain located where you are.\nPremise 2′: The human brain located where you are is thinking.\nPremise 3′: You are the only thinking being located where you are.\nConclusion’: Therefore, you are a human brain.\nBlatti, Stephan (2012). “A New Argument for Animalism,” Analysis (72)4, 685-690.\nBlatti, Stephan (2019), “Animalism,” Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.\nBailey, Andrew (2015). “Animalism,” Philosophy Compass 10(12), 867-883.\nBailey, Andrew (2016). “You are an Animal,” Res Philosophica (93)1, 205-218.\nBailey, Andrew, Allison Krile Thornton, and Peter van Elswyk (forthcoming), “Why Animalism Matters,” Philosophical Studies.\nBearzi, Maddalena and Craig Stanford (2010). “A Bigger, Better Brain: Observations of Chimpanzees and Dolphins Strengthen the Notion that Humanlike Intelligence may not be Uniquely Human,” American Scientist.\nDescartes, René (1641).

{"question":"Can you compare John Williams' and Stephen Warbeck's biggest awards achievements en una lista?","answer":"Here are their major awards: John Williams has received 51 Academy Award nominations and 5 Oscar wins (including for Fiddler on the Roof, Jaws, and Schindler's List). Stephen Warbeck has received 1 Oscar win for Shakespeare in Love, 4 BAFTA nominations, 1 Grammy nomination, 1 European Film Award nomination, 1 BMI Film Music Award, and 1 Jury Prize at Cannes Film Festival.","context":["John Williams & American Film Music\nHaving written over 100 film scores, as well as other symphonic and chamber works, John Williams is among the most prolific and celebrated composers of our time. His film scores, particularly those involving large-scale, orchestral forms, have earned him 51 Academy Award nomination and countless other honors. In addition, he has greatly influenced American symphonic repertoire and practices, as his work as both composer and conductor has helped bridge the gap between popular culture and classical music.\n- Music has been part of film since the beginning of cinema in the 1890s. Silent films were accompanied by live performance, and synchronized sound in film emerged in the 1920s. By the 1930s, music was an important part of the Hollywood film industry, with classical Hollywood film music involving large, orchestral scores, typically in the style of 19th century Romanticism.\n- By the time John Williams began working in TV and film in the late 1950s, film music had branched out to include all styles of popular music and modernism.\nWilliams quickly demonstrated versatility as a composer; his first Academy Award nomination was in 1967, and his first win was for his musical adaptation of Fiddler on the Roof (1971). His second Oscar came for Jaws (1975), directed by Steven Spielberg, with whom Williams has collaborated ever since. A departure from trends of the time, Jaws was scored for large orchestra with music structured around the now-iconic, two-note theme that represents the shark.\n- Williams became known for such narrative, large-scale, orchestral film scores that reference the classical Hollywood style. This can be heard in Star Wars (1977) and other films in the series. Often called a “space opera,” the Star Wars films feature recurring musical themes for characters and ideas (leitmotifs), musical effects to complement the action (called “Mickey-Mousing”), and vivid orchestration.\n- He has written several other heroic, orchestral scores (e.g., Superman, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T.), yet has a remarkable capacity to adapt his music to different types of films and stories. One such notable achievement is Schindler’s List (1993), for which he won his fifth Oscar and features poignant, Hebraic melodies and violin solos performed by Itzhak Perlman. Also noteworthy are the first three Harry Potter films (2001, 2002, and 2004), which musically transport the audience to a magical and mystical world.\n- Even though some criticize Williams’ music for being rooted in 19th century idioms, a particular hallmark of his film music is how well it can stand on its own as concert music. His compositions as well as work as a conductor (Boston Pops) have brought symphonic music into popular American culture, and also advanced and revitalized symphonic repertoire.\n- What are some of the musical devices that Williams uses to create musical narratives in films?\n- How does Williams adapt his musical style to different types of films and narratives? For example, what are some of the stylistic differences between Star Wars and Schindler’s List?\n- In what ways do the musical themes in the Star Wars movies represent the characters and ideas? How does Williams interweave these themes throughout each film, and across films? How does he do this in other films, such as Jaws or Harry Potter?\n- Even though Williams’ orchestral style is based on 19th century musical idioms, why does his music resonate so well with audiences today?\n- What are some other trends in contemporary film music? Who might follow in Williams’ footsteps?\nMore to Explore\n- Biography of John Williams Click here\nBooks for Further Reading & Listening\n- Audissino, Emilio.

{"question":"When comparing band saws and circular saws for woodworking precision, which tool is better suited for making clean, accurate cuts in wood projects?","answer":"Band saws and circular saws have different strengths in terms of precision cutting. The band saw is specifically noted as the most accurate tool for cutting curves in wood, using a single looping blade guided by blocks. However, for straight, clean cuts, the circular saw is superior as it provides precise, smooth cuts with clean edges. The circular saw's disc-like blade with carbide or diamond-coated teeth enables it to make cross-cuts, angular cuts, and plunge cuts with high accuracy, though it cuts slower than other tools. While both tools are valuable for woodworking, the circular saw is generally better for achieving clean, accurate cuts in standard woodworking projects, especially when working on a flat surface.","context":["Many woodworking projects require curved cuts in one or more pieces of wood to build the project. While many carpenters and construction workers on a job site might reach for a jigsaw, for fine woodworking within a woodshop, a better choice is to use a band saw. A band saw uses a single looping blade that is tautly-strung around two drive wheels, one above and one below the saw table. The blade is held in place by guide blocks on either side of the blade as well as the tension on the blade.\nIf you're a beginner getting started in woodworking and want to learn the basics of using a band saw, the following articles will give you a good start.\n01 of 06\nThe band saw is the most accurate tool for cutting curves in wood. To use a band saw, the wood is placed on the saw table and the wood is maneuvered through the saw blade, rotating the wood to follow the desired curve line. However, a band saw can do a lot more than just cut curves. Learn the basics of the band saw and what else it can be used for in the woodshop in this woodworking article.\n02 of 06\nBecause the band saw can make such a wide variety of cuts, there are a number of different sizes of band saw blades. In this article on how to cut with a band saw, learn about the most common sizes of band saw blades and when to use them. Additionally, find tips for making straight cuts, cutting veneers out of a large block of wood, resawing thick boards into more manageable thicknesses of stock and more!\n03 of 06\nCutting curves in thick stock can be a bit challenging. Using a jigsaw, the blade can deflect, causing the finished cut to be angled. Using a router with a jig may result in a burned router bit, even if you make the cut in a few passes. Using a band saw is probably the best choice, as long as you use a blade that is thick enough. In this article, get some tips for making curved cuts in thick stock.\n04 of 06\nOf all of the woodworking machines commonly used in a woodshop, the band saw is likely one of the safer tools (at least from a statistical sense). However, it still can cause a significant injury if used incorrectly. To help reduce the chance of an issue, this article can help you to understand how to safely set up and use your band saw, regardless of the type of cut you need to make with your saw.Continue to 5 of 6 below.\n05 of 06\nOnce you fully understand a bit about how your band saw works and how to make a few types of cuts safely and effectively, you can expand your knowledge with these band saw usage tips like how to cut a circle out of a piece of stock or how to prevent saw blade burns on the wood when cutting.\n06 of 06\nIn order to cut a tight curve on a band saw, you'll need a thin blade. However, thin blades can break if used for making larger cuts, so in that case, a larger blade is a better choice. In that event, you'll need to know how to change the blade on your band saw. Here are the steps you need to know to change the blade on any cabinet-style band saw.","If you are in the market for a new saw, it can be a bit overwhelming trying to decide which would be the best option for you! There seem to be so many different options available, and if you are still new to the hobby, it becomes even more confusing.\nThe two saws which most people have a problem deciding between are reciprocating saws and circular saws. Both are great for different uses and have their own advantages and disadvantages depending on what you are using them for.\nWhat is the difference between a reciprocating saw and a circular saw? A circular saw is a good option to achieve a clean, accurate cut, whereas a reciprocating saw will offer you power and good flexibility. A reciprocating saw is generally used for rough-cutting jobs and demolition, and a circular saw is mostly used for household woodworking.\nWe have listed all the differences between reciprocating saws and circular saws which are worth knowing, to help you decide which would be the best option for you!\nThe Differences Between Reciprocating Saws And Circular Saws\nIf you are planning on doing quite a bit of woodwork, or if you are taking on new projects at home, it would help to have both types of saws.\nHowever, if your budget only limits you to one for now, take a look at the below differences to work out which saw would be better to start with.\nThe blade types between reciprocating saws and circular saws are quite obviously different. A circular saw has a disc-like blade that has many carbide or diamond-coated teeth around the edge. A reciprocating saw has a knife-like blade instead.\nThe different types of blades mean that either saw is suited for a different type of work.\nA reciprocating saw and a circular saw have different shapes and sizes. A circular saw has a circular, disc-like blade in the center of the tool with a serrated edge. A reciprocating saw looks almost similar to a chainsaw, where the knife-like serrated blade extends from the handle of the machine.\nBoth saws require two hands to operate them safely, but the two saws, due to their shape and size, are held very differently from each other when being used.\nThe cutting and sawing abilities between the two saws are very different, due to the different blades that each has.\nA reciprocating saw can easily slice through a piece of wood in next to no time, but in doing so, it will leave a rough cut edge. A circular saw, on the other hand, offers clean and precise cuts but cuts slower than a reciprocating saw.\nFor rough jobs where clean lines are not an issue, a reciprocating saw is best, however, where you need clean, well-placed lines, you should use a circular saw.\nGenerally, reciprocating saws are lower in price than circular saws. This is because a circular saw has more versatility and offers better performance, while a reciprocating saw does not offer the most refined results.\nReciprocating Saws: All You Need To Know\nReciprocating saws work with a push and pull motion to roughly cut through wood and other materials. The knife-like blade has jagged teeth along the edges, which makes for easy work through the wood.\nA reciprocating saw is also able to cut through metal or plastic if it is of good quality.\nWhen using a reciprocating saw, you would need to use both hands to keep it stable. All reciprocating saws will have a handle that allows you to have a good hold of the machine.\nYou will not be able to achieve angled cuts with reciprocating saws. As it is powerful, it creates quite a vibration when in use, which means that you cannot always create straight lines or even predict the outcome.\nYou can, however, rely on a reciprocating saw to cut through dense material, and even if a rough edge is left behind, you will easily be able to break material down when demolishing a project or looking to break wood down into smaller pieces.\n- A reciprocating saw is versatile enough to give you both horizontal and vertical cuts. The knife-like blade allows you to cut solid lines through many materials.\n- You can find corded and cordless reciprocating saws, and both are travel-friendly. This means you aren’t very limited to where you can use the saw.\n- Most reciprocating saws allow you to adjust the speed to suit the material you are cutting. You can also control the vibrations that the saw creates by adjusting the speed as well.\n- Does not give smooth cuts and edges, always leaves rough edges.\n- You are not able to achieve angled cuts when using a reciprocating saw, only straight cuts.\n- Most reciprocating saws do not have a blade guard, which can make them fairly unsafe to use if handled incorrectly.\nA reciprocating saw is best used for rough work. It is great to use to cut down hedges and branches and is ideal to use in the yard.\nYou can also easily demolish different materials with a reciprocating saw, such as old doors, furniture, and waste. You can also use a reciprocating saw to make flush cuts and size down pieces of wood before shaping them properly with a circular saw.\nCircular Saws: All You Need To Know\nCircular saws are your best bet to achieve a precise, clean, and smooth cut. They feature a disc-like blade that has many teeth along the edge.\nThese teeth are often coated with diamond or carbide, making them insanely strong. This means the blade can cut through timber, metal sheets, or even granite.\nUsing a circular saw, you can make cross-cuts, angular cuts, and plunge cuts. There is so much versatility that a circular saw has to offer, making it ideal for home projects and woodworking.\nThere are different types of circular saws to choose from, including corded, cordless, battery-powered, and even gas-powered. They can also be rotated upside-down, and even attached to a table to be used as a table saw.\nThe one problem with circular saws is that they do not have the raw cutting power of a reciprocating saw, and are more for finishing touches and smooth edges.\n- Gives a precise, smooth cut with clean edges.\n- Circular saws are very versatile; they can create straight, rip-cut, angular, and cross cuts.\n- Use a circular saw to create effortless angular cuts on wood.\n- Attach a circular saw to a work table to create a table saw.\n- Can be hard to use as they tend to be heavy.\n- Does not cut as quickly as a reciprocating saw.\n- Not as suited to demolishing work.\n- Need a flat surface to be used.\nCircular saws are ideal for creating clean and accurate lines, with beautifully smooth edges. They can help to create both straight and angular cuts with ease, even on dense materials, such as wood or metal.\nYou will enjoy quite a bit of versatility with circular saws, with the number of materials they are able to cut through, and the cuts that they can give. Just keep in mind that a circular saw needs to be used on a flat and stable surface.\nReciprocating Saw Vs Circular Saw\nTo summarize, a circular saw will give you smooth and clean lines and cuts, whereas a reciprocating saw will give you a rough cut, but will provide power and flexibility with cutting materials down.\nCircular saws are best used for woodwork and daily projects around the house, but a reciprocating saw is best used for demolition projects and to roughly cut wood and other materials.\nIn the long run, it would be worth having both a reciprocating saw and a circular saw in your tool kit, but to choose which would be best, you need to consider the project that you would be working on first. If you need to break wood and materials down, opt for a reciprocating saw, but if you need to cut the wood down cleanly for a project, then a circular saw should be on your buying list!\nAre reciprocating saws loud?\nReciprocating saws can be very loud. As they are powerful and create a lot of vibration, they can create quite a bit of noise, but the amount of noise they create also depends on the material that is being cut.\nHow loud the saw is will also depend on how powerful it is, and the speed setting that it is on.\nWhat is the difference between jigsaws and reciprocating saws?\nJigsaws have long, slim blades which are ideal for delicate cuts and more smooth edges. Reciprocating saws are designed for rougher cut edges and cutting wood more aggressively.\nUp Next: Can You Sandblast Wood?"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4bb7df48-78c6-44c1-9388-e1f88b98f563>","<urn:uuid:5d901629-5bda-49cd-94bf-46ba6eb10c38>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Qué beneficios tiene el juego físico y locomotor para el desarrollo de los niños pequeños?","answer":"Locomotor play and exercise play (running, climbing, etc.) have several key benefits for young children's development. It helps with physical training of muscles for strength, endurance and skill. This type of play increases from toddler age to early primary school, which is a crucial period for developing neural and muscular coordination. Additionally, active playground-type breaks can help young children focus better on subsequent sedentary tasks, as it allows them to space out cognitive demands that they may not yet have mature capacities for.","context":["We outline Perform, review the leading varieties of Participate in as well as their developmental Rewards in various regions.\nSubject: Exactly what is Engage in?\nParticipate in is usually described as action finished for its have sake, characterized by usually means as opposed to finishes (the procedure is more critical than any end level or aim), adaptability (objects are put in new mixtures or roles are acted out in new techniques), and beneficial impact (little ones often smile, giggle, and say they delight in it). These criteria distinction Perform with exploration (targeted investigation as a kid gets more accustomed to a whole new toy or atmosphere, that will then guide into play), perform (that has a definite purpose), and online games (extra organized routines by which there is some intention, typically winning the game). Developmentally, games with guidelines are usually widespread immediately after about six years of age, Whilst Participate in is very frequent for two- to six-calendar year-olds.\nThe Research Context\nJust about all small children play, except those who are malnourished, deprived, or have serious disabilities. Among 3% and 20% of younger children’s time and Electricity is often invested in Participate in,one extra so in richly provisioned niches.two If youthful small children are quickly deprived of Participate in opportunities, for example being kept in a classroom, they play for longer and more vigorously Later on.1\nAs children commit time and Strength in play, and there are alternatives for Discovering every time they do Enjoy, there appears to be a need for Perform. This really is true of youthful mammals frequently, While other mammals display much less a number of Enjoy kinds than human youngsters. These findings propose that Perform has developmental benefits. Rewards may be immediate, extensive-expression, or each. However, the precise position of Participate in in Finding out continues to be debated. A prevailing “play ethos”three,4 has tended to exaggerate the proof with the crucial role of Participate in. However, correlational and experimental evidence suggest significant benefits of Participate in, whether or not some Advantages will also be acquired in other strategies.\nLocomotor Perform, together with exercising play (jogging, climbing, etc.), consists of big entire body exercise and is generally considered to assistance Bodily coaching of muscles, for power, endurance, and talent. Physical exercise Participate in raises from toddlers to preschool and peaks at early Principal faculty ages, once the neural and muscular basis of Actual physical coordination and healthful advancement is very important, and vigorous Engage in obviously gives superior opportunities for this;5 later on, it declines. There is certainly proof that Lively, playground-kind breaks can assist youthful young children focus far better at subsequent sedentary jobs,one in step with the cognitive immaturity speculation the “ought to exercising allows young kids to Room out cognitive requires for which they may have much less mature capacities.”six\nSocial Participate in refers to playful interactions between youngsters and fogeys or caregivers in children nearly 2 a long time old, but progressively with other little ones as social play raises dramatically from 2 to 6 several years of age. To start with, fidgeting with a person lover is complex more than enough, but by three or four several years previous a play group can consist of three or even more individuals, as young children purchase social coordination capabilities and social scripts.\nParallel Enjoy, prevalent in two- and three-calendar year-olds, is when small children play next to others with out much interaction. Some play is solitary.seven This type of play can be physical, integrate objects or language, be faux, or incorporate every one of these features. Tough-and-tumble Participate in, including Participate in battling and chasing, can look like genuine fighting, but in Engage in combating small children will often be laughing, kicks and blows are usually not tricky or never make Speak to, and it is usually done with friends.\nItem Enjoy refers to playful utilization of objects such as setting up blocks, jigsaw puzzles, cars and trucks, dolls, and many others. With infants, this Perform is mouthing objects and dropping them. With toddlers, this is sometimes just manipulating the objects (e.g., assembling blocks), but sometimes involves faux Engage in (e.g., building a house, feeding a doll). Perform with objects enables children to try out new combinations of steps, freed from external constraint, and should aid develop dilemma solving skills. Any great things about object play should be balanced in opposition to Those people of instruction, bearing in your mind the ages of the children, the character in the endeavor, and whether Discovering is for distinct competencies, or a far more common inquisitive and artistic Perspective. The greater marked Added benefits could be for impartial and artistic imagined,eight although the evidence is equivocal.9\nLanguage Perform -- At around 2 years previous, toddlers typically speak to on their own before gonna sleep or on waking up. This is playful, with repetition and often laughter. Kids use language humorously at three and 4 many years previous. (“I’m a whale. That is my tail.” “I’m a flamingo. Take a look at my wingo.”) Language techniques--phonology (speech sounds), vocabulary and indicating (semantics), grammar (syntax), and pragmatics (using language properly in social predicaments)--are quickly building while in the preschool decades. Some phonological skills might be formulated in the solitary monologues when young children babble to them selves within their cot, but most advantages of language Discovering most likely can be found in sociodramatic Enjoy.\nFake Perform includes pretending an item or an motion is another thing than it really is. A banana is actually a phone, such as. This Perform develops from 15 months of age with uncomplicated steps, such as pretending to rest or putting dolly to mattress, establishing into for a longer period story sequences and function Perform. Sociodramatic Engage in, prevalent from all-around 3 many years of age, is pretend Perform with Other folks, sustained purpose having, and a narrative line. It could involve understanding Other people’ intent, refined language constructions, and growth of (from time to time) novel and intricate Tale strains. Little ones negotiate meanings and roles (“You be daddy, ideal?”) and argue about appropriate behavior (“No, you don’t feed the newborn like that!”).\nLots of learning capabilities are actually Highly developed for faux and particularly sociodramatic Perform.10 One hypothesis is that it's handy for producing preliteracy techniques, for instance recognition of letters and print, and the objective of publications.11,twelve,thirteen The narrative framework of sociodramatic Engage in sequences mirrors the narratives of story books. For these Advantages, some structuring by adults is useful (in retaining a story line, getting suitable products like plastic letters, publications, and so on.).\nAn additional speculation is always that pretend play boosts psychological safety. A baby who is emotionally upset, such as, by moms and dads arguing or perhaps the sickness or Demise of someone during the relatives, can operate with the anxieties by performing out these kinds of themes in faux play, with dolls such as. Enjoy therapists use this sort of methods that will help fully grasp youngsters’s anxieties; and most therapists think that it helps the kid function toward a resolution of them.fourteen\nA relatively the latest hypothesis is usually that faux Engage in enhances principle of brain improvement. Idea of brain ability usually means with the ability to fully grasp (symbolize) the knowledge and beliefs of Some others; which is, that some other person can have a unique perception or state of data from oneself. This doesn't happen until eventually the age of late three or 4 yrs aged. Social interaction with age-mates is apparently essential for this, and social faux Participate in (with siblings or with other age-mates) could be Primarily helpful, as young children negotiate different roles and understand that distinctive roles entail distinct behaviors.fifteen Though these Rewards are plausible, You can find small experimental proof; the correlational proof implies that social pretend Engage in is useful but is only one route to getting idea of mind.16 A new review indicates that additional high-top quality scientific tests and proof are needed just before we could be self-confident of what benefits pretend Perform has.seventeen\nCritical Exploration Questions and Gaps\nWe lack descriptive information on time and Electricity used in numerous types of Perform. With no this we are unable to understand the putative benefits of Engage in. Even more, when Participate in may have many good Positive aspects, this isn't constantly so. Enjoy battling is seen ambivalently by nursery personnel as a lot of personnel come across it noisy and disruptive, and consider it generally causes serious fights. In actual fact, research implies that all through the first faculty decades, only about one% of tough-and-tumble Enjoy bouts change into authentic preventing. Even so, this is much more Regular for some children who deficiency social competencies and they are turned down by playmates. These young children typically respond to rough-and-tumble play aggressively.eighteen-19\nA linked spot of worry is war Perform (play with toy guns, weapons, or beat superhero figures).twenty Carlsson-Paige and Levin21 contrasted a developmental look at that Engage in which includes war Perform is a Most important auto for kids to express them selves, that has a sociopolitical look at that youngsters discover militaristic political principles and values by way of war Perform. There is not a significant investigation base on which to make educated judgments about whether the concerns are justified. Dunn and Hughes22 observed that 4-12 months-old, hard-to-take care of young children showed Recurrent violent fantasy along with the extent of this was relevant to poorer language and Perform skills, additional antisocial behaviour, and fewer empathic comprehension in the age of six a long time. This does counsel worries for the effects of these Engage in on disturbed children.\nIn up to date societies, adults are frequently involved in little ones’s Perform, furnishing Engage in environments and toys. Preliteracy great things about Perform is usually Improved by giving paper, crayons, and plastic letters. Workout great things click here about Perform is often enhanced by delivering challenging kinds of climbing equipment. Inventive Enjoy can be Improved by giving lego-kind bricks to promote creative building functions.\nNursery staff can operate with small children to construction their Enjoy and provides it much more academic benefit by such as pursuits which include jigsaw puzzles, color and pattern matching online games, and products like water, sand, and clay that youngsters can manipulate and by boosting sociodramatic Participate in.10 This kind of Enjoy tutoring will involve supplying ideal props (Enjoy dwelling, clothes for part Enjoy, healthcare facility equipment, and so on.), using young children on visits to encourage their creativity (to a hospital, zoo, and so on.), and suggesting Engage in themes and serving to small children to develop them.

{"question":"How do successful sustainable businesses balance honesty in green marketing with competitive pressures, and what challenges do they face in maintaining credibility?","answer":"Successful sustainable businesses maintain credibility by being specific and honest in their marketing claims, even when facing competitive pressures. For instance, Boomerang Water demonstrates this by refusing to make BPA-free claims without 100% verification, following Ball Corporation's advice. Similarly, Plaine Products maintains transparency by avoiding vague terms like 'sustainable' and 'natural' since these aren't regulated and can mean different things to different people. However, these companies face significant challenges. As shown in fashion industry research, the regulatory context is uncertain, with guides like the Federal Trade Commission's Green Guide lacking enforcement power as they are not formal rules or regulations. Companies also struggle with competitors who may have less strict moral codes - for example, Plaine Products had to reluctantly adopt Google ad words because competitors were buying them. This creates a challenging environment where maintaining honest marketing practices while staying competitive requires careful balance.","context":["What’s the secret to effective green marketing? Honesty.\nBy Stephanie Monmoine | August 20, 2021\nReusable systems are undeniably a win for humans and the environment. And, as it turns out, they can also provide a unique opportunity for marketers… along with a few challenges.\nTo highlight some of the lessons learned by businesses that are disrupting entire industries with their innovative reuse models, Roundpeg interviewed Shaun Zaken from Boomerang Water and Lindsey McCoy from Plaine Products. We explored some of the struggles and major wins they have experienced while navigating the complex world of green marketing to identify any common themes.\nConsumers and governments are increasingly holding companies accountable for their packaging waste, so reuse systems and other business models that “close the loop” on waste have emerged as the most sustainable solution.\nBoomerang Water was founded by Jason Dibble in Davidson, N.C., as an innovative reuse solution for establishments looking to shift away from single-use plastic water bottles. Another disruptor in single-use plastic bottles — this time targeting the bathroom — is Plaine Products. The company’s two founding sisters set out to eliminate single-use plastics from the personal care industry by providing non-toxic products in aluminum containers that can be returned to the facility, reused, and redistributed. Founded in Cincinnati, OH, Plaine Products was the first of its kind at its inception in 2017.\nAcross industries, It’s clear that embracing a plastic-free purpose inherently bolsters a company’s credibility when it comes to sustainability, but there are still a few things to keep in mind to market reusables effectively and ethically.\nShow that you understand the complexity of the problem — and how your purpose addresses it.\nEvery company these days expects to be applauded for simply using recycled materials, but Plaine noted some of the other issues with recycling (you know—beyond just getting people to throw things in the right bin). For instance, a major downside of recycling plastic is that it’s usually “downgraded” every time it’s recycled, resulting in less valuable material with each use, so it can only be recycled a couple of times. It’s just that reality that led Dr. Max Liboiron, director of the Civic Laboratory for Environmental Action Research (CLEAR) in Newfoundland, Canada, to make the pithy but discouraging remark that “Recycling is like a Band-Aid on gangrene.“\nLindsey McCoy, CEO of Plaine Products, knows that the problem extends far beyond recycling, which is why she spreads awareness of plastic pollution as an environmental justice issue. Plaine Products works with the Louisiana Bucket Brigade to support the residents of Cancer Alley, a stretch along the Mississippi River from New Orleans to Baton Rouge where the predominantly minority population suffers from dramatically higher rates of cancer and respiratory diseases. These health impacts result from the concentration of more than 150 oil refineries, plastics plants, and other chemical facilities in that area.\nProducing recycled plastic uses two-thirds of the energy required when using raw materials, but only 9% of plastics produced globally have ever been recycled. In stark contrast, approximately 75% of all aluminum ever produced is still in use, and producing a recycled aluminum can requires only 5% of the energy it takes to extract and process virgin aluminum.\nNot only is bottled water contributing to the plastic pollution crisis—poisoning human and environmental health—but the truth is that most of it is just glorified tap water. In fact, bottled water is even less regulated than tap water and often sourced from drought-plagued or distant and marginalized communities.\nThe disturbing reality is that it takes 1.63 liters of water to make every liter of Dasani. Yeah, you read that right. But the good news is that Boomerang Water is changing the game.\nBoomerang Water demonstrates a dedication to long-term solutions by identifying the problem — in this case, the single-use model — instead of simply demonizing one material. The company created an on-site purified water bottling system that can clean, purify, fill, and cap reusable glass or aluminum bottles at the point of use. This eliminates the plastic waste and the resources necessary to manufacture single-use bottles and the emissions produced by transporting them.\n“The distribution channel has been completely upended, and as such, no one’s product is fresher, healthier, or more sustainable than ours. Any aisle, any bottle, any material — we are more sustainable.”\nDon’t forget that reusables present a unique marketing opportunity.\nWhile it’s indisputable that reusing is infinitely better when it comes to environmental impact, it also has unique marketing benefits that were not lost on Zaken, who is responsible for Boomerang Water’s branding efforts.\n“We are localizing and customizing water — we can actually message with our water.”\nFrom colleges and coal mines to luxury hotels and golf courses, Boomerang Water has big plans to eventually provide customizable bottle designs and on-site purification/reuse systems to any establishment that currently relies on single-use bottles.\nThe company’s first customized branding endeavor was dedicated to the community that has been supportive of Boomerang Water since day one. To celebrate Earth Day and engage the local community, Boomerang Water asked K-12 students in and around Davidson, N.C., to submit designs for a commemorative Earth Day bottle. The winning design (see image, right) was selected by a local artist and used on 2,000 custom bottles that “live on in the community because they’re being reused and put back into our system,” said Zaken. The hand-drawn buildings in the design are representative of real buildings around the community.\nPlaine Products approaches the marketing power of sustainable products from a different angle. With an overwhelming majority of global travelers currently seeking to reduce their environmental impact, Lindsey realized that many — including her — would rejoice at the thought of a green filter for travel booking websites. The proposed Airbnb Green Filter identifies homes offering amenities — such as composting, recycling, renewable energy services, and plastic-free or reusable products — that are sought by more eco-conscious individuals. To demonstrate its commitment through action, Plaine Products launched a campaign to push for this green filter. If you support the idea of an Airbnb Green Filter, you can sign the company’s open letter to Airbnb here.\nPackaging waste is a major red flag for consumers.\nWhen it comes to sustainable packaging, Plaine Products knows actions speak louder than words.\n“We try — by showing the changes we’ve made with our boxes or talking about lessons that we’ve learned — to demonstrate that we’re not perfect.”\nLindsey McCoy finds that the most successful social media posts are usually the ones providing a direct view into the reuse process — such as photos of the bottles being collected, washed, and redistributed. She also emphasizes the importance of encouraging customers to ask questions and leaving those conversations out there for other people to learn from.\nPackaging is typically the first part of your brand that customers engage with, so it’s essential that it reflects your brand’s values. If a brand has made sustainability or environmental impact a central part of its value proposition, it won’t go over well to include unnecessary packaging waste, regardless of material.\nBe specific and honest… even when your competitors are not.\nPlaine Products adheres to ethical marketing standards, avoiding common marketing practices, such as retargeting, that can be problematic. Lindsey lamented that it can be a losing battle, competing against other companies with less strict moral codes. “We tried to avoid Google ad words but finally had to cave because other companies bought it.”\nThe challenge with green marketing is that words like “sustainable” and “natural” aren’t regulated, so they can be used to mean essentially anything. That’s why specific language is more credible, but it can be hard to avoid wordy explanations, given the complexity of environmental issues.\n“Those words mean so many different things to so many different people,” said Plaine. “Natural, chemical-free, sustainable — they’re so loaded and everyone has different priorities of what’s most important to them.”\nAnother challenge is the confusion between “plastic-free” and “single-use-plastic-free.” Plaine Products employs the latter, providing plastic pumps and encouraging customers to use the same pump with each new (well, reused) bottle.\nWhen Boomerang Water was faced with its own ethical marketing challenge, the company stuck to its values and took the high road. According to Zaken, many competitors claim that their bottles are BPA-free or have a BPA-free liner, but Boomerang Water followed Ball Corporation’s (the aluminum supplier) advice against making that claim because it cannot be ensured 100% of the time, depending on where the water is sourced.\nCommitting to 100% verifiable claims benefits your company by providing peace of mind, ensuring legal protection, and fostering consumer trust. That’s the level of stringency we need to see more often in green marketing claims.\nUse your messaging to educate and empower, rather than discourage, customers.\nThe marketing content from both companies emphasizes educating and empowering consumers to be a part of the solution. That was clear as Lindsey described her feelings about the term “zero-waste.”\n“We try to focus on progress, not perfection. For instance, I don’t love the term zero waste because it sets an unachievable goal. We like to focus on doing what you can, starting in one place, and expanding from there,” she said. “Don’t try to do it all at once.”\nSpreading awareness of environmental issues while also acknowledging the struggles your company has faced and overcome in its efforts to be part of the solution can be seen as the ultimate display of authenticity. It’s right for your company, and it makes good marketing sense.","The importance of the environmental credentials of fashion brands has grown and, increasingly, marketing functions recognise the need for a convincing and trustworthy approach to the way they conduct business and communicate this with consumers (Goldsmith el al., 2000: 44-45; Ginsberg and Bloom, 2004: 83-84). Coppolechia (2009: 1356) states that over half of the United States ‘baby boomers’ consider themselves to be environmentally conscious consumers and businesses undoubtedly feel the pressure to fulfil their customers’ expectations. In relation to the fashion industry, the green segment of this market is willing to pay more for ecologically responsible products (Laroche et al., 2001: 514; Meyer, 2001: 327-328). The increase in consumer knowledge on environmental sustainability and the preference for strong environmental credentials of products, services and companies has led to the increase in fashion organisations communicating their environmental credentials through marketing activities which has contributed to the creation of the term ‘greenwashing’. Greenwashing is clearly defined by Delmas and Burbano (2011: 65) as ‘the intersection of two firm behaviors: poor environmental performance and positive communication about environmental performance’. Delmas and Burbano (2011) state that three of the key drivers behind firms’ greenwashing is the regulatory context, consumer and investor demand, in addition to limited or imperfect information on a company’s environmental performance, as well as uncertainty about the regulatory punishment for greenwashing in marketing campaigns.\nThe brand comparison website ‘Rank a Brand’ found that fashion and clothing brands are becoming more adept at developing their sustainability communications highlighting an issue that many brand consumer communications regarding green credentials do not match up with efforts to improve their environmental sustainability. The study found that out of the 368 brands investigated, 63% communicate about their environmental credentials on their website however, only 20% publish a sustainability report (Sweet Skins, 2016). To help support marketers with effectively communicating an organisation’s environmental approach and achievements, the Federal Trade Commission updated their Green Guide in 2012; however, as Fernandez (2016) highlights, the major limitation is that they are guides not ‘rules or regulations’ which supports Delmas and Burbano’s claim that uncertainty about regulatory punishment is a key factor which allows greenwashing to continue to proliferate. As the number of companies using green marketing campaigns in the fashion industry continue to grow, this will mean that, firstly, green brands’ messages will become diluted amongst competitors green messages, secondly, it will be increasingly difficult for marketers to achieve significant environmental differentiation, if this is the brand’s aim and, thirdly, consumers will start to becoming wary as the green marketing overload means consumers are unsure which messages to believe.\nThe frustration for fashion brands such as Patagonia and Esprit, who take their sustainability approach seriously and have invested significant resources to achieve this, is that direct competitors can still make environmental marketing claims potentially without having to support these through verified evidence. The Green Washing Index (2017) claims that ‘When properly trained, consumers see right through this “green screen”. Then greenwashing backfires, damaging the company’s reputation and, ultimately, their sales’. Therefore, a recommendation for clothing companies, such as Patagonia and Esprit, is to develop marketing and educational campaigns to educate current and potential consumers within their target market on environmental sustainability and on how to recognise potential greenwashing messages and organisations. This could be achieved through collaborating with industry-specific organisations such as the Ethical Fashion Forum or the Green Washing Index and would help consumers make more informed choices.\nIn relation to marketers attempting to improve fashion brand recognition and preference through green marketing, it is important for a pro-environmental culture and brand identity to be developed. Also, importantly, the environmental claims need to be substantiated through externally verified sources which will improve the credibility of the claims and avoid accusations of greenwashing. Goldsmith et al. (2000: 43-44) and Kim and Damhorst (1999: 20) state that the credibility of the advertiser significantly influences the extent to which the consumer perceives the claims to be made as ‘truthful’ or ‘believable’. Therefore, from a marketing perspective, if significant improvements are desired from green marketing campaigns, it is equally important to focus on internal marketing in collaboration with other functions, for example, sustainability, supply chain management and human resource departments, to embed an environmental sustainability approach into operational decision making. Without a cultural focus (or shift, if this is not the current managerial paradigm) towards a holistic approach to improving environmental sustainability across the organisation, there will be an increased risk that the external green messages do not match, crucially, the consumers’ experience or the internal organisational behaviour.\nCoppolecchia, E.

{"question":"What role did forced relocation play in shaping both Mongolia and Kazakhstan's population patterns?","answer":"Both regions were affected by forced relocations but in different ways. In Kazakhstan's Karaganda oblast, many Russians, Ukrainians, Germans, Tatars and Belorussians were forcibly deported from their European homelands by Soviet authorities. The region also contained KARLAG and had a concentration camp in Spassk for German, Japanese, Italian and Romanian captives after World War II. In Mongolia's case, while there wasn't forced relocation historically, climate change and economic pressures are now forcing many pastoralists to relocate to cities, leading to overcrowding and loss of traditional nomadic culture. It's predicted that by 2030, only 5% of Mongolia's population will be rural.","context":["The country of Mongolia, sandwiched between Russia and China, is located in Northern Asia. Since ancient times, Mongolians have been engaged in pastoralism (Marin, 2008). Today, half of the inhabitants of the country still rely on pastoralism as both an economic activity and a way of life (National Statistics Office of Mongolia, 2009). Approximately 74 percent of land in Mongolia is used for pastoralist purposes, with most of the excluded land being forest and desert (MEGDM, 2014). The most common livestock used in this practice are camels, sheep, cows, goats, and horses (Neupert, 1999). A geographically diverse country, Mongolia, and the pastoralists within its borders, face an immense number of threats. The ways in which these threaten those that live off the land are numerous, but so are numerous the number of ways in which these hazards can be adapted to.\nHazards & Pastoralist Exposure\nIn Northern Asia, it is predicted that temperature has already risen by over 2℃ in the past 50 years, and is expected to increase 6℃ by the end of the 21st century (Hijioka et al., 2014). Landlocked countries like Mongolia are more likely to experience increases in temperature because they lack the temperature regulation that oceans provide land masses (Hijioka et al., 2014) and because of polar amplification due to high elevation and latitude of the country (Wang et al., 2014).\nTemperature rise can have a plethora of impacts on pastoralists. For instance, it has already decreased rangeland productivity by 20-30% in the past fifty years (Angerer et al., 2008). The decline in productivity has caused the average weight of livestock to decrease and thus both the animals' economic value and use value to the pastoralists (Asian Development Bank, 2014). Higher temperatures in the winter also cause ice sheets to form over rangeland which prohibits animals from grazing which further deteriorates livestock health (Batima et al., 2005).\nMongolia is naturally susceptible to extreme winter weather events known as dzuds. These events are attributed with heavy snow, frozen groundwater, severe drops in temperature, and high winds (MEGDM, 2014). While dzuds occur naturally, an increase in these events can be attributed to changes in precipitation caused by climate change (Rao et al., 2015). Droughts in the summer before a dzud makes the event much more deadly to livestock because they are more weak due to lack of resources (Marin, 2010). Even without a preceding drought, dzuds can cause massive die off because the severe weather prevents access to food and water (MEGDM, 2014). Specifically, the extreme weather prevents livestock from foraging, weakens the animals, and makes water accessibility difficult (Rao et al., 2015).\nDzuds over two winters alone have been attributed to the mortality of 20 million livestock (Rao et al., 2015).\nChange in Precipitation\n- To the west and east precipitation is increasing, while it decreases in the south and central areas of the country (Batima et al., 2005).\n- In the northern, mountainous region of Mongolia aridity and droughts are expected to increase (Hijioka et al., 2014).\n- Mongolian pastoralists in the southern desert steppe reported “patchier rains” and an increase in droughts over their lifetimes (Marin, 2010).\nThis is a concern for pastoralists because they rely on precipitation patterns for their own migration patterns (MEGDM, 2014). Rain that occurs in patches creates islands of good foraging land that can be difficult to access which creates the risk of livestock mortality (Marin, 2010). The timing of precipitation has also changed to be later in the summer which means that pasture plants that herders rely on are not present during the expected season (Marin, 2010). Overgrazing coupled with decreased precipitation and rising temperatures causes desertification of previously fertile lands (MEGDM, 2014). For example, in the southern part of the country, the Gobi desert expands 150 kilometers every 20 years (Vernooy, 2011).\nSurface water in Mongolia is already drying up as a result of increased temperature and decreased precipitation (Wang & Zhang, 2012). Groundwater, the source of 80% of Mongolia’s water supply, is at risk of drying up due to overuse and climate change (Hasiniaina et al., 2010). The alternative to groundwater is the use of wells; however, pastoralists find that this limits mobility and prevents fattening of livestock (Wang & Zhang, 2012). Alternatively, the other major source of water for pastoralists are glaciers which have decreased by 30% in Mongolia since the 1940s (MEGDM, 2014). The finite nature of the glaciers supply poses a threat for future flows of freshwater once the glaciers and permafrost have entirely melted away (Hasiniaina et al., 2010).\nVulnerability of Pastoralists\nEconomic pressure on pastoralists is a recent concept in Mongolia. Prior to 1990, Mongolia was a communist country during which there was an abundance of state resource support for pastoralists and animals were under collective ownership. This limited the number of animals on the livestock to sustainable amount. Under capitalism Mongolia privatized herds which resulted in a significant increase in herd size (Rao et al., 2015). Simultaneously most government support for pastoralists was ended as the government shifted its focus on urbanization and industrial activities (Janes, 2010). The government has also began to encourage pastoralists to enter other activities and fail to acknowledge the key role pastoralism plays in the country's identity (Marin, 2008). Due to lack of support, inequality amongst pastoralists became more apparent as poorer pastoralists had a more difficult time obtaining necessary permits (Rao et al., 2015). Increased herd size has exacerbated desertification and increased water use, which further contributes to the hazards of climate change (Janes, 2010).\n“This is our life. We and our pastures are one body.”\n- One Khazakh herder on the importance of pastoralism (Fernández-Giménez et al., 2017)\nPastoralists are heavily reliant on the climate sensitive resource of livestock as both a food and cash source. Livestock die off as a result of climate change hazards such as dzuds, shifting precipitation, water scarcity, and temperature rise not only means that there is less food, it also results in less income. This income is necessary to pay for education, health care, and other basic needs, and without it, public health is severely threatened (Janes, 2010). It has been found that, among the poor pastoralists, there has been a decrease in height in children and an increase in emotional and physical problems among adults (Janes, 2010).\nPastoralism in Mongolia traces back to the Bronze Age of humanity, approximately 3000 BC, a heritage that is the pride for many pastoralists (Fernández-Giménez et al., 2017). The hazards of climate change, in conjunction with capitalist pressure on pastoralists, pose a risk to the continuance of the practice of pastoralism. Interviews with pastoralist parents have revealed their desire for their children to pursue ambitions outside of livestock husbandry (Fernández-Giménez et al., 2017). This loss of a pastoralist livelihood could be detrimental to the culture that has developed around a spiritual connection to the land (Fernández-Giménez et al., 2017). Thus, not only is a livelihood vulnerable to effects of climate change, but the culture that is intrinsically tied to it is too. More positively, this connection to the land can play a role in the resilience of the country as well.\nCoping with a Changing Landscape\nIn the face of climate change, more and more pastoralists are coping by seeking economic prospects in cities rather than in their native areas. This strategy has not only caused overcrowding and a significant rise in air pollution, but a loss of the pastoralist culture. The pastoralist life is a nomadic one, and so being settled in one place does not serve the traditions built around following the animals from season to season (Sarlagtay, 2004). Urbanization is only expected to increase and by 2030 it is predicted that only 5% of the country's population will be rural (Fernández-Giménez et al., 2017). The image to the left depicts the sprawl that has come with rapid urbanization (Batima et al., 2005).\nAdaptation and Resilience\nImprove breeding practices of livestock to select for animals that are best adapted to varied precipitation and decreased range productivity (ADB, 2014).\nCapture and store snowmelt and rainwater through use of small dams to help save precious water supplies (ADB, 2014)\nDecentralize rangeland decisions to give the power to control these decisions over the communities that are most affected by them (Fernández-Giménez, 2000)\nThe federal government must allocate more funds to rural communities to support development and capacity to maintain control over rangeland (Ahearn, 2018). These resources can also be used to recover from disaster such as dzuds (Fernández-Giménez, 2000)\nPractice sustainable pasture use by using rotational grazing methods (ADB, 2014) and by practicing co-management of rangeland (Vernooy, 2011)\n\"Together, we collect hay and forage for the winter. We grow vegetables, comb goats, sheer sheep and ensure our river remains clean. These activities are quicker when carried out together.\"\nBatkhuyag Tseveravajaa, head of the Uvurkhangai community in southern Mongolia, on the importance of pooling community resources in the face of climate change (DW, 2017).\nThe resilience of pastoralist people in Mongolia comes from the strength of immense local knowledge of the land that is at risk of being lost to the need to continue to grow herd size to reduce economic hardship. When outsiders call to preserve a cultural practice like pastoralism, it is important to not romanticize an ancient version of it but to preserve the practice in a way that is determined by the community (Marin, 2008). Based on this, an adaptation plan should focus on strengthening the resilience of the people through empowerment. Finance of the rural economy would allow local power over risk management to develop (Ahearn, 2018). Decentralizing decisions and money can also allow for co-management of communities over pasture lands. This would allow the decisions to be in the hands of those with the most ecological knowledge and thus restore a more sustainable system of livestock ownership (Vernooy, 2011). Additionally, more local management would allow for the most vulnerable, low-income pastoralists to be more resilient to the effects of extreme weather events and shifts in precipitation (Ahearn, 2018).\nAbout the Author\nEliza Gillilan graduated from St. Lawrence University in 2019 as an Environmental Studies and Sociology combined major with minors in Biology and African Studies. Her interest in pastoralism was first piqued after learning about the Maasai during a semester abroad in Kenya. Thanks to Dr. Jon Rosales' Adaptation to Climate Change course, she was able to continue to explore her interest in pastoralists across the world who are connected to the Maasai by their fight to preserve a way of life in the face of climate change.\nAhearn, A.

From Kazakh people language “karaganda” is a place rich in acacia. The capital city of the region is Karaganda city.\nAt present Karaganda oblast is the largest oblast in its territory and industrial potential, rich in minerals and raw. This is a powerful industrial center. The region is the leading one in Kazakhstan in its economic, cultural, scientific potential and developed infrastructure.\nKaraganda oblast has the population of about 1,344,000 (2009) on the territory of 428,000 sq. km.\nKaraganda oblast facts\nKaraganda oblast was formed on March 10th, 1932. First Petropavlovsk city was the center of the oblast. Since August 3rd, 1936, the center is located in Karaganda. Within its current boundaries the oblast was formed in May 1997, Zhezkazganskaya oblast was joined to it.\nThe major cities of Karaganda oblast, after Karaganda, the capital, are Shakhtinsk, Saran, Satpaev, Balkhash, Temirtau, Abay and Karkaralinsk.\nThe population of Karaganda region is about 85 percent urban, with the Kazakhs predominating. Russians, Ukrainians, Germans, Tatars and Belorussians also living there. A lot of people of the last four groups were deported from their European homelands by Soviet authorities.\nKaraganda oblast nature views\nKaraganda oblast nature view\nKaraganda oblast, Kazakhstan nature\nKaraganda oblast features\nThe climate of Karaganda oblast is of sharp continental type: hot, dry summers, severe winters with little snow but with winds and snowstorms. There are over 200 large and small rivers in the oblast. The main waterway in the oblast - the river Nura crosses the oblast from east to west and flows into one of the largest lakes in Central Kazakhstan - Tengiz. In the south the largest lake in Kazakhstan - Balkhash - is located. It is unique as water in its eastern part is salty, in western part - it’s fresh.\nThe oblast is linked with cities in CIS, Germany, China through railway. The international airport “Sary-Arka” carries out direct flights to Russia, Germany, Arab Emirates and other countries. Karaganda oblast is crossed by the highway linking Almaty with Astana - the capital of Kazakhstan.\nKaragandinskaya oblast is famous first of all by the fact that its territory was crossed by the northern branch of ancient Silk Way. Historically the region was a trade way, an area of economic and cultural exchange between Kazakhstan and other countries.\nIn 30-40s of 20th century Karaganda oblast was an area where peoples repressed by Stalin were deported. It is the place where KARLAG was located. After World War II in Spassk there was a concentration camp for German, Japanese, Italian and Romanian captives. At present there is the Memorial to Victims of Stalin’s totalitarianism there.\nKaraganda oblast pictures\nKaraganda oblast, Kazakhstan picture\nKaraganda oblast, Kazakhstan view\nKaraganda oblast economics\nKaraganda oblast takes an important place in mineral and raw complex of Kazakhstan. The principal economic resource of the region is Karaganda coal basin, also manganese, tungsten, molybdenum, lead and zinc are mined. Other mineral resources of Karaganda region include barite, nickel, iron ore and copper. Karaganda coalfield is the main coking coal supplier to the plants of metallurgical industry of Kazakhstan Republic.\nIn 2006 Karaganda oblast produced 100% of Kazakhstan manganese ore; 99,5% - of copper ore, 99% - of coke, 95% - of copper, 93% - of steel, 79% - of silver, 53% - of limestone, 29% - of coal, 16% - of iron ore.\nKaraganda oblast is one of the leading industrial regions in Kazakhstan. The industry of the region specializes in power- and material-consuming industries: ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, coal mining as well as a number of natural deposit ores. There are fairly well developed plants of food industry, machine-building and metal-working, chemical industry, rubber and plastic goods production and so on.\nKaraganda oblast produces about 24% of Kazakhstan processing industry output, which is due to prevailing share of Karaganda oblast in metallurgical industry production (52,8% of the republican output), among them in ferrous industry production - 49,7%, in non-ferrous metallurgical production - 56,6%. The oblast takes an important place in Kazakhstan Republic machine-building and metal-working.\nSpring wheat and fodder grasses are grown, sheep, horses and camels are bred in more arid regions of the western part of Karaganda oblast.\nDairying, truck gardening, and the cultivation of millet are carried on around Karaganda region but must be supported by irrigation. The water being brought by Irtysh-Karaganda Canal, which also supplies the industry of Karaganda city.\nAlthough large-scale industrialization began only about 1930, partly through the use of forced labor, Karaganda is now a major industrial center of Kazakhstan."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c3c07c40-4e20-408e-8da5-286c95b2eb02>","<urn:uuid:7ed32555-918c-4828-a392-27a6865b675d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What does photosynthesis have to do with leaf drop, and how does genetic predisposition affect Parkinson's disease development? 🌿","answer":"Photosynthesis directly influences leaf drop because as winter approaches, less sunlight and water become available for the process, causing trees to shut down their photosynthetic 'factories.' Trees then recapture nutrients from leaves before dropping them to survive winter. Regarding Parkinson's disease, genetic factors alone aren't sufficient to cause the disease - only about 10% of cases are related to genetics. While mutations in genes like Parkin, PINK1, and DJ1 are risk factors, the disease's pathogenesis typically requires a combination of genetic susceptibility, environmental exposure to harmful chemicals, and aging. In 90% of cases, the disease is sporadic without any clear genetic basis.","context":["- RSS Channel Showcase 8481094\n- RSS Channel Showcase 2916348\n- RSS Channel Showcase 7758785\n- RSS Channel Showcase 5846593\nArticles on this Page\n- 10/04/17--05:01: _Scientific Rebuttal...\n- 10/06/17--03:01: _Frog Friday – Mid-M...\n- 10/06/17--05:01: _Genetic Engineering...\n- 10/09/17--03:01: _Mammal Monday – It’...\n- 10/09/17--05:01: _Overlapping Classes...\n- 10/10/17--05:01: _Stay Thirsty My Fri...\n- 10/11/17--03:01: _Winged Wednesday – ...\n- 10/11/17--05:01: _For Every Cell, The...\n- 10/11/17--05:01: _Challenging Concept...\n- 10/12/17--05:01: _Caveman to Renaissa...\n- 10/13/17--03:01: _Frog Friday – Shado...\n- 10/16/17--05:01: _The Mitochondria is...\n- 10/16/17--05:01: _Mammal Monday – Don...\n- 10/17/17--05:01: _Don’t Stress TOO Much\n- 10/18/17--03:01: _Winged Wednesday – ...\n- 10/18/17--05:01: _Reality, What’s That?\n- 10/18/17--05:01: _Fall Colors, Fallin...\n- 10/04/17--05:01: Scientific Rebuttals to Macroevolution\n- 10/06/17--03:01: Frog Friday – Mid-Metamorphosis\n- 10/06/17--05:01: Genetic Engineering: The First Pest-Resistant Seed\n- 10/09/17--03:01: Mammal Monday – It’s How Small?\n- 10/09/17--05:01: Overlapping Classes At Northwest\n- 10/10/17--05:01: Stay Thirsty My Friends\n- 10/11/17--03:01: Winged Wednesday – Azure Amazonian\n- 10/11/17--05:01: For Every Cell, There Is a Time to Live and a Time to Die\n- 10/11/17--05:01: Challenging Concept of a Cycle in Chapter Nine\n- 10/12/17--05:01: Caveman to Renaissance Man.

That means shorter days and cooler nights. And, in many parts of the United States, it means that trees are about to shed their leaves after a final colorful salute to summer.\nDid you know that a tree’s leaves are orange and yellow — even in summer? Most leaves include the pigments of all three colors. It’s just that the pigment chlorophyll (the pigment that makes the leaves green) is a much stronger pigment than the others. It covers the yellow (xanthophyll) and orange (carotene) pigments that are natural to a tree’s leaves. But, come fall, a tree’s leaves produce less chlorophyll. Now the other colors can show through in brilliant explosions of color!\nAnother pigment (anthocyanin), which produces reds and purples, isn’t present all year long in most green leaves. It only shows up as the nights get cooler. In fall when trees are breaking down and reabsorbing important nutrients from their leaves, their photosynthetic tissues are especially unstable and vulnerable to too much light and other stresses. Yet trees need the energy from photosynthesis to drive the processes that allow them to recapture as many of those nutrients as possible. Just as this process begins, leaves start producing large amounts of anthocyanins near the leaf surface. Anthocyanin pigments protect the leaves’ dwindling ability to generate energy during this period.\nBut why do leaves fall off the tree? The roots and branches of most trees are tough enough to endure freezing temperatures, but leaves are more susceptible to damage when the water inside them solidifies and expands. This kind of damage to living tissues can expose a tree’s internal plumbing system to the open air, increasing the chances of infection and speeding up water loss. To ensure the tree’s survival, any part of the plant that is unable to live through the winter must be sealed off and shed before freezing temperatures set in. As the days get shorter and the amount of available sunlight decreases, the vessels that carry water to and from the leaves gradually close off. A “separation layer” of cells forms at the base of each leaf stem. When the separation layer is completely formed, the connection to the branch is weakened and the leaf soon falls off the tree. (Interestingly, evergreen trees do not lose their needles in the winter because they are covered with a heavy wax coating and contain fluids inside that resist freezing.)\nFall is a great time of year for learning about the process that gives life to trees and most other plants. As you know, this process is called photosynthesis, which literally means “putting together with light.” As winter nears, less sunlight and less water — elements essential to the process of photosynthesis — will be available to trees. That means less food for deciduous (leaf-shedding) trees! Soon the trees’ photosynthesis “factories” will shut down, the trees will recapture nutrients from their leaves, the leaves will drop to the ground, and the tree will rest until spring when water and light return and awaken the process.","Is Parkinson’s Disease One Disease Entity?by Viatcheslav Wlassoff, PhD | March 17, 2014\nWe hear of Parkinson’s disease very often these days. This is indeed a very common neurological disorder affecting about 6 million people worldwide. The disease is characterized by a selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in certain parts of the brain. That causes muscle rigidity, tremors, bradykinesia (slowness of movement) and problems in posture.\nDecades of research brought some treatments that can delay the onset of Parkinson’s disease and try to counterbalance the endogenous dopamine deficit. Unfortunately, we still don’t have a treatment capable to stop the neuronal death and provide cure for the disease.\nThe current mainstream treatments for Parkinson’s disease were introduced around thirty years ago. They focused on dopamine systems and motor symptoms of advanced disease, and included dopatherapy with dopamine agonists and a monoamine oxidase B inhibitor selegiline. More agonists and inhibitors were introduced over the years, but the basic approach did not change. Parkinson’s disease still remains a serious condition leading to disability. Newer molecular targets, bio-markers and better understanding of molecular mechanisms of this condition are necessary.\nThe fact that our understanding of Parkinson’s disease is very limited is clearly indicated by the fact that not all patients respond to the existing treatments such as levodopa, major dopamine agonist in clinical practice. Part of the answer to the question why some patients respond to the existing treatments and others don’t lies in the fact that Parkinson’s disease is really an umbrella term for a number of conditions with similar symptoms. Diagnosis of disease is still based on the descriptive definition provided by James Parkinson almost 200 years ago. The conditions covered by this description, however, are not all the same and can be caused by very different genetic and environmental factors. This has obvious implications for the development and application of any potential drugs targeting the disease.\nSmall portion (about 10%) of all Parkinson’s cases are related to genetics. Mutations in several genes were identified as risk factors in the development of the condition. The involvement of three genes, Parkin, PINK1 and DJ1, in the disease pathogenesis seems to be linked to their neuroprotective properties. They encode proteins that counteract oxidative stress, prevent damage to mitochondrial DNA and are essential for effective work of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, this is not specific for the Parkinson’s disease. These three gene products play equally critical role in a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders. Is there anything more specific that can cause Parkinson’s disease, rather than any other neurodegeneration, in either humans or animals?\nIt seems that Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis requires not only the genetic susceptibility, but also environmental exposures to harmful chemicals and ageing. Genetic factors alone are not enough to cause the disease. In 90% of cases, the disease is sporadic without any clear genetic basis.\nCurrent evidences suggest that oxidative stress, abnormal protein aggregation and mitochondrial disfunction are possible early triggers of cell death in Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease can be induced by mitochondrial toxins MTPT and its metabolite MPP+, as well as pesticides rotenone and paraquat in both animals and humans.\nLewy bodies are abnormal aggregates of proteins observed inside the nerve cells of Parkinson’s patients. The formation of alpha-synuclein and tau inclusions in Lewy bodies in certain neurons is the most distinctive anatomical feature of the disease. Cell death in Parkinson’s disease is connected to both oxidative stress and accumulation of alpha-synuclein. Abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein can also produce oxidative damage to both mitochondria and dopamine.\nHowever, neither Lewy bodies nor alpha-synuclein and tau inclusions are exclusive for Parkinsonism. They are seen in the broad spectrum of other neurologic condition broadly classified as synucleopathies, tauopathies and Lewy body disorder on the basis of presence of the above characteristic features. In Parkinson’s disease, these individual pathological features can be present in some patients and absent in others.\nIt seems that more diagnostic categories will be required in the future to properly characterize the sub-classes of Parkinson’s disease. What is now called “Parkinsonism” can include clinical Parkinson’s Syndrome, Lewy Body Parkinson’s Disease, several Lewy Body disorders and synucleinopathies, and taupathies with various aetiology.\nThe Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders (QSBB) has issued the list of criteria that should be used for clinical diagnostics of Parkinson’s disease. It includes (a) clinical diagnostics criteria, (b) genetic testing for mutations in alpha-synuclein gene SNCA in patients with family history of disease; mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LPRK2) and glucocerebrosidase (GPA) in sporadic patients; testing of parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1 in patients with early onset of the condition, with additional testing of several genes if these come out negative, (c) panel of various tests (neuroimaging), and (d) response to levodopa. This long list alone is in itself a manifestation of the fact that Parkinson’s disease can be caused or triggered by a variety of factors and therefore cannot be considered as just a single disease entity.\nIn the diagnostics of Parkinsonism, the DNA analysis must become a compulsory element. Improved sub-typing on the basis of genetic data might improve the prediction of possible disease outcome. A red tulip, a symbol of the disease, should make researchers and clinicians to consolidate their efforts in developing and refining therapies to conquer this devastating illness.\nde Lau LM, & Breteler MM (2006).

{"question":"In what ways do capital punishment and sports institutions similarly function as mechanisms of social control through their treatment of the human body?","answer":"Both capital punishment and sports institutions serve as mechanisms for exercising power and social control through their treatment of the body. The death penalty system uses the body as a site for demonstrating state authority and power, whether through public executions or modern methods. Similarly, sports-related institutions, like other disciplinary spaces, deploy systematic techniques to organize and train bodies, including the division and arrangement of bodies, prescription of activities, and establishment of temporal controls. Both systems reflect how bodily discipline and control can be used to reinforce social order and exercise institutional power over individuals.","context":["By David Garland\nDuring the last 3 a long time, the USA has embraced the dying penalty with tenacious enthusiasm. whereas so much of these nations whose criminal platforms and cultures are quite often in comparison to the U.S. have abolished capital punishment, the U.S. maintains to hire this final device of punishment.

Several conclusions flow from this analysis. The first is that death remains a practice with extraordinary significance. Whether implemented as public spectacle or through the semi-covert protocols of lethal injection, or even if abolished, death remains singularly expressive. Its particular significance, in individual instances, depends upon the circumstances of its deployment, as well as who uses it and to what ends.","Social function and formation of the body.\nShould Physical Education and Sport be considerate?\n*Professor Adjunto na Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS),\nFaculdade de Educação Física e Ciências do Desporto (FEFID)\nPesquisador Coordenador do Grupo de Pesquisa e Estudos Sociológicos\nem Educação Física e Esporte (GPES), FEFID/PUCRS\nProfessor Adjunto na Instituição Educacional São Judas Tadeu, Curso de Educação Física.\n**Professora Adjunto na Universidade Federal de Pelotas (UFPel)\nEscola Superior de Educação Física (ESEF)\nProfessora Pesquisadora no Grupo de Pesquisa e Estudos Sociológicos\nem Educação Física e Esporte (GPES), FEFID/PUCRS\nProf. Dr. Marcelo Olivera Cavalli*\nProfª. Drª. Adriana Schuler Cavalli**\nThe main objective of the study is to analyze the social formation of the body and the social function it is enforced to assume. The body has embedded social premises of the demanded ‘physical body’. Time, space and activity are variables used to delimit the body as a unit of production. The body was conceived and used as a tool that acted in a certain place, consumed a certain amount of time and produced a certain product. PE and Sport have a tendency to reinforce this conception through its theoretical and practical approach toward the body. The paper concludes arguing that schools, factories, the army, asylums, prisons and Sport as well possess an appropriate environment to exert disciplinary control over the lives of individuals.\nKeywords: Social formation. Body. Physical Education and Sport.\n|http://www.efdeportes.com/ Revista Digital - Buenos Aires - Año 13 - Nº 130 - Marzo de 2009||\n1 / 1\n1. The social body\nDifferentiations should be made between the social function and the social formation of the body. According to what was defined by many Physical Education (PE) and Sociology of Sports scholars, the present social order is strictly based on and informed by the sportive order. Moral values and behavior as well as physical aesthetics and behavioral patterns were created and developed to cope with the social demand of the new 'physical body' model that was socially established.\nA study by Hargreaves (1986) defines the hegemonic body model of modern society. In his research the author states, \"one ritual symbol above all condenses these values – the mesomorphic image of the body – and what is connoted by this image is probably more significant than what is denoted.\" Hargreaves categorizes the human body into three different types:\nMesomorphic body type: a muscular torso and limbs, small waist and broad shoulders, in the case of males; a less pronounced musculature, yet well-built and well-proportioned frame, with more rounded contoured shape, in the case of females;\nEctomorphic body type: the thin or 'skinny' body;\nEndomorphic body type: the fat-body type.\nBody image does not stop short at its definition and neither does Hargreaves. He gives this social conceptualization of the body as an example to explain some of the rituals present in PE and in the \"investiture of power in the body.\"\nThe idea expressed here is that 'body language' contains a code or information that is diffused throughout society. This is not commonly professed. The body itself possesses characteristics and an image that may affect both the individual and society. We can observe this when Hargreaves (1986) affirms that the \"body concept is important in the process of identity-formation in the individual and is a significant determinant of social interaction.\"\nThe body is perceived through a dualistic image. Material parts act on thinking parts to establish individual characteristics such as self-confidence, self-esteem, self-identity, and other personality related qualities. At the same time, they establish social characteristics such as authoritative behavior, easiness of socially relating and interacting, and a propensity to have more 'friends'.\nThe physical self-image and how others perceive the body make a huge difference when social interaction is taking place, since there is a hegemonic model or image of the body and it is widespread in society. This not only gives its owner certain social advantages and prestige, but also fills him with confidence, social prestige and recognition.\n2. The work shaped body\nA more historical approach can be used in order to analyze the importance that was given to the body. It shows how the practice of PE was closely linked to this appropriation and manipulation of the body and of PE and Sport. A pillar of the socio-economic and political transformations took place in Europe. Especially in England from 1760, the Industrial Revolution influenced the systematization of modern PE and was responsible for different conceptualizations of the body.\nAt that time the body was delimited to the variables of time, space and activity. When these three interacted, it was the body as a result of their interaction, as a unit of production that was seen as being important. The body was conceived and used as a tool that acted in a certain place, consumed a certain amount of time and produced a certain product. Needless to say, this is still present and prevailing today. PE and Sport have a tendency to reinforce this conception through its theoretical and practical approach toward the body.\nThe body conceived and used as a means to produce something, as a ‘machine’, with no doubt, made itself one of the determinants of social stratification. If a person works in a factory, uses his hands on greasy or dirty equipment, if he works hard and for long hours, then he does not have the time, desire or reason for taking good care of his finger nails. If a farmer works on the land, plowing, seeding and harvesting, or breeding cattle, sheep and other animals, he will have a sunburned face. If a fisherman, he will have both hands and face shaped by the sun and sea. However, the owner of a company as well as people who do paperwork will likewise present characteristics on their bodies that reflect the activities in which they are involved. Consequently, social discrimination and social stratification was established based on the person's professional activity, and one of the major determining factors was the body.\n3. The disciplined and punished body\nThrough an analysis on discipline and punishment, as visualized by Foucault (1979), it is also possible to verify how emphasis has been given to the body to 'discipline' and punish the individual and to 'discipline' and set examples to society. In Cousins and Hussain’s work (1984), the authors discuss their own ideas as well as the ideas in Foucault's (1979) book – Discipline and Punish. Their major concern is analyzing the relation between discipline, punishment and the body.\nPunishment performed on the body and the discipline enforced and imposed on the individual, became an effective apparatus to diffuse and exercise power. Punishment is a technique of power that targets on the body. As Cousins and Hussain (1984) note, \"the principal argument of Discipline and Punish is that [...] imprisonment became, nonetheless, a 'natural' method of punishment because disciplinary techniques were also used in a wide variety of institutions to organize and train individuals\". These, we may observe, include the army, schools, factories, asylums, prisons and Sport-related institutions as well.\nThe analysis of punishment of the body should not be conducted based only on the judicial system, but as well on the non-legal functions performed by punishment such as exercising political power to correct and reform. Once more, Foucault (1979) is cited when he sets forth \"four protocols to guide his analysis of regimes of punishment\". This verifies how the body was targeted and used to achieve other objectives and perform other functions:\nPunishment should not be analyzed in terms of its repressive effects alone. It should rather be seen as a combination of social functions that varies from one penal regime to another.\nPunitive methods should neither be analyzed simply as consequences of legislation as is done in the legal literature, nor as indicators of social structure as is done in sociology. Rather, punishment should be regarded as a technique with its own specificity in the more general field of other ways of exercising power.\nInstead of treating the history of penal law and the history of human sciences as two separate series, one should analyze them as components of a 'juridical-epistemological' formation.\nThe shift in the target of punishment from the body of the condemned to his personality or his 'soul' should not be regarded as the elision of the body. On the contrary, the shift should be seen as the effect of new techniques of power that came to bear on the body (COUSINS and HUSSAIN, 1984, p. 174).\nWhat is embodied in all four of these protocols is that the hegemonic ideological system, represented by the penal regime, was performing its punitive action over the condemned, in the smaller sphere, and disciplining society, in the larger sphere. Equally as important, it was putting in motion a systematic apparatus embedded in exercising power. As Foucault (1979) defines the penal regime accurately when he states that it is \"a general recipe for the exercise of power over men; the 'mind' as a surface of inscription of power, with semiology as its tool; the submission of bodies through the control of ideas.\"\nExtremely interesting in Foucault's (1979) work is the connections he establishes between the origin of educational, therapeutic, remedial and punitive institutions that started proliferating at the end of the eighteenth century. According to his use of the word discipline – instruction imparted to scholars and to disciples – both used similar techniques to imply a disciplinary control. For Foucault, discipline consists in the deployment of four techniques (COUSINS and HUSSAIN, 1984, p. 185):\nThe division, distribution and arrangement of bodies. Yes, it is bodies rather than prisoners, schoolchildren, madmen or soldiers;\nA detailed prescription of activities;\nThe division of time into periods, the establishment of links between them and a sketch of the path of evolution over time;\nThe establishment of a network of links between the arranged bodies and their respective activities.\nIf this is considered as present and part of the organizational programs of public and private institutions, it can be assumed that those institutions possess an appropriate environment to exert disciplinary control over the lives of individuals. We cannot deny that school also plays a significant part in the diffusion of discipline, and, subsequently, is using the body to achieve those purposes.\nAssociated to other features and elements involved with the judicial system, the body is used to achieve a particular modality of power. Its characteristics differ from other modalities of power, because the deployment of its disciplinary techniques became a general formula of domination. How is sport conceived within this logic?

{"question":"What were the historical myths vs facts about schizophrenia that affected public perception?","answer":"Several significant myths about schizophrenia have been perpetuated by incorrect media portrayals. The main myths are: 1) That schizophrenia means having a split personality - this is false, as schizophrenia affects one's sense of reality but not personality. Split personality is actually a different condition called dissociative identity disorder. 2) That people with schizophrenia are dangerous - this is largely false, as violent episodes are rare and more often related to substance abuse rather than the condition itself. 3) That people with schizophrenia can't live productive lives - this is false, as modern treatment and support options allow many to live independently and achieve their goals.","context":["What is schizophrenia?\nSchizophrenia is a common mental health disorder worldwide, with up to 2% of the population seen as exhibiting symptoms.\nThe main factor with schizophrenia is a marked and consistent inability to differentiate between what is real and what isn’t real, generally involving hallucinations (false perceptions like voices) and delusions (a set of false beliefs about the way the world is). This muddy thinking can then lead to social withdrawal and real difficulty maintaining a routine or regular life.\nDebate still rages over the origins and contributing factors of schizophrenia, but research has shown a biological factor and often a genetic predisposition. That said, as the tendency can be triggered by psychological and environmental conditions, and some develop symptoms while others with a genetic and biological predisposition towards it do not, research is still ongoing.\nThere is no known ‘cure’ for schizophrenia. Once triggered it leads to permanent changes in the brain that affect learning, thinking, and social relationships.\nBut is a highly treatable condition. Modern treatments have a high success rate, meaning schizophrenics can lead an independent and productive life.\nMyths about schizophrenia\nThere are many myths about schizophrenia, most perpetrated by incorrect portrayals in films and the media.\nSchizophrenia does not give someone a split personality. A person with schizophrenia still has one personality, it is rather their sense of reality that splits, not their character. A spit personality is another disorder entirely, dissociative identity disorder, triggered by traumatic experience whereas schizophrenia is biological.\nHaving schizophrenia does not make you dangerous. Violent episodes can happen because of hallucinations and delusions, but it is far less common then the media would have you believe. Violent episodes involving schizophrenics is more often related to the substance abuse that too often comes hand in hand with the condition. Substance abuse, as it can with someone who doesn’t suffer schizophrenia, can trigger violent behavior.\nSchizophrenia does not mean you can’t live a productive life. While it is true that there is high incident of schizophrenics ending up homeless or living in poverty, treatment and support options now available mean that many schizophrenics can live independent lives where they set and achieve their goals.\nWhat are the signs of schizophrenia?\nSymptoms include the following:\nHallucinations – this can include hearing voices, and seeing or feeling what isn’t there\nDelusions – these are strong beliefs that are not based on any reality and often include paranoid thinking, such as believing someone is out to get you or is watching you, or that someone is trying to communicate secret messages to you.\nDisordered thinking – thoughts can become hazy and confused, and there can be a marked difficulty in concentrating. Thinking might get so disordered that speech gets muddled.\nUnpredictable behaviour – this can include a sudden difficulty with self care and usual routine as well as uncharacteristic and inappropriate behaviour.\nSocial difficulty – schizophrenia can make it difficult to have emotional responses. It can be as if a person ‘flatlines’. They can withdraw and isolate themselves.\nSchizophrenia can manifest differently in different people. Some people have episodes of psychosis and go into total remission inbetween, others might have continuous symptoms but with changes in the severity. It’s also possible to have one psychotic episode followed by recovery, or alternately to have a form of schizophrenia which never slows down or stops but increases consistently over time.\nNote that not all psychosis is schizophrenia. You can hear a voice and not be schizophrenic, for example. This can instead be caused by deep depression or drug use.\nWhat causes schizophrenia?\nAgain, it’s thought to be a combination of a biological and genetic predisposition with a set of psychological and environmental triggers.\nThis means that schizophrenia does run in families. If you have a sibling diagnosed with schizophrenia you risk of also being diagnosed is seven to nine per cent. If a parent has schizophrenia there is a ten to fifteen per cent chance their child will also develop the condition. Note that it’s not that the disease itself is inherited, but rather the susceptibility.\nEven if there is no schizophrenia in your family, there is a 1 in 100 chance of developing the condition.\nAlthough there is a genetic link, there is not one exact gene that causes schizophrenia. You cannot ‘have the schizophrenic gene’. Instead, researchers are discovering there are up to a dozen ore more genes that one can have that if damaged can then give one a predisposition for the disorder.\nTriggers for schizophrenia include:\n- complications during pregnancy and during birth (certain troubles at this time can trigger a child being susceptible to schizophrenia later in life)\n- stressful life events like bereavement, a relationship breakdown, losing a job (they do not cause schizophrenia, only trigger it in those already at risk)\n- usage of brain-altering street drugs like cannabis, amphetamines, and cocaine (again, drugs are triggers but not a cause)\nSchizophrenia is found in all cultures, races, and backgrounds. There is an estimated 2.2 million people with the condition in the U.S., up to 12 million in China, 8 million in India, and in the UK there are over 250,000 diagnosed cases.\nHow is it diagnosed?\nSchizophrenia tends to develop between the ages of 15 to 25. It’s thought that puberty can ‘trigger’ the latent potential for schizophrenia.\nThere is not one test for determining that someone suffers schizophrenia. Diagnosis instead involves assessment with a mental health specialist like a psychiatrist. Assessment generally includes psychiatric observation and evaluation, examining family history, and using blood and urine tests to rule out other medical conditions. In some cases a brain scan may also be taken.\nA diagnosis must usually involve symptoms that have lasted for at least six months, and include at least two of the main signs of schizophrenia ( hallucinations, delusions, lack of emotional response, muddy thinking). Depending on what reference is being used for diagnosis (such as the DSM or ICD) and what country the diagnoses is being made in, there might be a requirement of a psychotic episode which is at least a week in duration.\nThe earlier a person is diagnosed with the condition, the better the treatment outcome. This is because each psychotic episode can increasingly damage the brain. Medication and other recommended therapies can result in less damage. So it’s important that if you are concerned about yourself or a loved one you do seek professional guidance.\nTreatment for schizophrenia\nThere is not ‘cure’ for schizophrenia, but treatment options continue to improve for the condition. One in five stablise and can manage symptoms within five years of diagnoses.\nTreatment generally involves a combination of anti-psychotic medication combined with therapy and lifestyle support. The aim of therapy is to relieve present symptoms, prevent further psychotic episodes, and help the sufferer to maintain purpose and enjoyment in life.\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has found success with schizophrenic clients, what with its focus on gaining recognition and control of thought patterns. Family therapy is often recommended also, given the demands that the condition can put on the entire family unit and that for many schizophrenics living at home is part of their treatment (in America it’s estimated that 1 in 4 of those with the condition live with a family member).\nRelated mental health disorders\nSometimes it can appear that someone has schizophrenia but they are actually suffering something with similar symptoms. This can include:\nAcute depression – it is possible to have experience a hallucinatory or delusion related episode when suffering acute depression, and this can be exacerbated if the sufferer has the side effect of insomnia.\nBipolar disorder – this condition sees people who have it experience manic episodes which can include hearing voices or delusional thoughts of grandeur.\nSchizoid personality disorder (SPD) – this disorder involves having a complicated fantasy world and little interest in the real world or relationships with others. Like schizophrenia, someone who has this disorder can seem detached, but they do not have a split view of reality and it is a separate condition.\nWhat to do if a loved one is diagnosed with schizophrenia\nIt can be very challenging for friends and family if a loved one has schizophrenia as some sufferers refuse to believe there is something wrong with them. Their delusional thinking extending to include the idea that others are just out to get them.\nAnd it can be overwhelming to see someone you love have a schizophrenic crisis where they exhibit acute psychosis as they can seem unrecognisable. It can also be an exhausting process of recovery, as although treatment often helps considerably relapses can and do happen and it can take years in some cases to reach a sort of stability, while in a smaller percentage of cases things may not improve.\nSchizophrenia therefore requires patience, long term vision, and a good dose of realistic thinking.\nIt’s important to remember that even if someone has schizophrenia, they are still an adult with the right to make choices and it’s not their intelligence that is damaged, just their ability to tolerate stress and see things clearly. Try not to take over their lives out of concern and treat them like a child. Let them do what they can still do for themselves, and help them with what is becoming challenging.\nAt the same time don’t have expectations of them they can’t reach. Try your best to work with where they are. Remember, that on the outside looking in, schizophrenia can be an illness with symptoms, but for those experiencing it, it’s a way of life, it becomes their way of being.\nGet informed, help your loved one seek the right treatment in so far as they allow you to help, and be prepared with a good plan of action should relapses occur ( a plan which they are also aware of themselves).\nMost of all, don’t forget to take care of yourself. Schizophrenia is a very big challenge for all those involved, and the feelings of fear, frustration and helplessness it can cause can lead to stress and anxiety that can take over your life is you let it. Remember to take time for yourself, and seek the help of online forums, a support group, and/or a counselling professional as needed.\nReferences and Other Useful Guides to Schizophrenia\nThe NHS guide to Schizophrenia\nSchizophrenia Treatment and Recovery by Helpguide.org\nSchizophrenia Facts and Statistics (including new research)\nMichael Di Paolo Ph.D “Inside the Beautiful Mind of Schizophrenia” (video)\nDo you or a loved on have schizophrenia?

{"question":"Can someone compare Nancy Pearl's and Jerry Pournelle's approaches to organizing reading recommendations? So curious!","answer":"Nancy Pearl provides straightforward book recommendations grouped by theme and genre, presenting Arthurian literature options ranging from traditional to fantastical interpretations. In contrast, Jerry Pournelle's organizational system is highly complex and structured, dividing his Future History series into three distinct collections (CoDominium, War World, and Second Empire stories) with specific reading orders within each collection. While Pearl's recommendations can be read in any order based on reader interest, Pournelle's work requires careful attention to chronological order and interconnected storylines for optimal comprehension.","context":["Scott Farrell comments:\nI’m often asked for recommendations of books about chivalry and the epic adventures of King Arthur and his knights. While I enjoy talking about my favorite King Arthur books, when I saw that acclaimed librarian Nancy Pearl provided just such a list in her bibliophile’s compendium, Book Lust,» I knew I had to share her recommendations with Chivalry Today readers. (After all, when a librarian has her own action figure – complete with “amazing push-button shushing action,” — she definitely commands respect!) It’s the perfect summer reading list for chivalry fans.\nNote: See all the titles mentioned in this article at the Chivalry Today Bookshop»\nSummer Reading for the Round Table\nEver since Thomas Malory wrote his 14th century epic Le Morte d’Arthur,» the legend of King Arthur has been a powerful draw for readers of all ages, so it’s no surprise that writers, too, have found it to be a rich lode of inspiration and subject matter. Authors have taken a wide variety of approaches to the legend, from the traditional view of Arthur and his (Knights) of the Round Table as exemplars of medieval life and chivalric customs, to interpretations of the historical Arthur, to fantastical novels of witchcraft and white and black magic. In other words, there’s an Arthur for every age and taste.\nOnce you read Rosemary Sutcliff’s romantic and well-researched Sword at Sunset» (one of my very favorite novels), in which an all-too-human Arthur leads his fellow Britons in a fight to the death against the invading Saxon armies, knowing full well that a loss will mean the coming of the dark and the end of civilization, you’ll never be able to picture Arthur in any other way.\nT.H. White’s quartet of Arthurian novels, collective entitled The Once and Future King,» inspired the Broadway musical Camelot. The Sword in the Stone — aimed at young readers and filled with sly humor — opens the series. It introduces the young orphan Wart, who innocently pulls the famous sword Excalibur from the stone in a churchyard and becomes the High King. In The Queen of Air and Darkness, The Ill-Made Knight, and The Candle In The Wind, the tone grows darker, as White depicts a world in which even the most chivalrous knights and powerful wizards are unable to change their fates.\nThe Arthur legend is also the basis for other historical series, such as Jack Whyte’s Camulod Chronicles, including The Skystone» ; The Fort at River’s Bend» ; Uther» ; and others; Sharan Newman’s Guinevere» ; The Chessboard Quee» ; and others; and Rosalind Mile’s Guenevere: Queen of the Summer Country» ; and Bernard Conrwell’s darkly realistic series of men at war during the Dark Ages, The Warlord Chronicles, including The Winter King» ; Enemy of God» ; and Excalibur» .\nThe Mists of Avalon» by Marion Zimmer Bradley is one of the most enduringly popular novels about King Arthur. Bradley retells the legend from the viewpoint of the major female characters: Arthur’s mother Igraine and his half-sister Morgaine, his wife Gwenhwyfer, and the Lady of the Lake, Vivian. The central conflict here is religious — between the matriarchal Druidic beliefs and the more patriarchal, newly influential Christianity.\nAlthough Stephen R. Lawhead’s Pendragon Cycle was set in Camelot during the Middle Ages, his Avalon: The Return of King Arthur» posits a rebirth and return of Arthur in the modern world.\n©2007 Nancy Pearl\nSee all the titles mentioned in this article at the Chivalry Today Bookshop»\nAbout the Author: The New York Times calls Nancy Pearl “the talk of librarian circles.” Readers can’t get enough of her recommendations while bookstores and libraries offer standing room only whenever she visits. Since the release of the best-selling Book Lust,» in 2003 and the Librarian Action Figure modeled in her likeness, Nancy Pearl has become a rock star among readers and the tastemaker people turn to when deciding what to read next. In 2004, Pearl became the 50th winner of the Women’s National Book Association Award for her extraordinary contribution to the world of books.","This page is especially directed at people who haven't yet read Pournelle's books. While the Timeline describes the events that happen in the stories and their exact timing, this page simply tells you what order the stories should be read in!\nJerry Pournelle's Future History series is divided into three collections:\nEach of these collections can be read independently of the others.\nBut within each collection, it's best to read the stories in chronological order.\nThe situation with the Haven (\"War World\") stories is truly bizarre. There are now nine volumes of Haven stories. The order is very intricate. Some stories are relatively independent but other stories are closely related to each other. For instance, if you want to read the saga of Galen Diettinger, the last of the great Sauron commanders, you must begin with the first story in \"War World Volume II\". Next, you should read a story which appears in the middle of \"War World Volume I\". Then you move on to a story in Volume IV... and then back to Volume II... and finally you should read the the first story in Volume III, in which Diettinger finally comes to terms with exactly what he will have to do for his people to survive.\nAnd there is no hint of this craziness anywhere in the War World books! That is one reason I felt it was necessary to create this site, because otherwise this series is almost unreadable.\nOn this page, I have listed the order of the stories in each of the three collections:\nJerry Pournelle is the author of many of these stories. The later Falkenberg stories are by Pournelle and S.M. Stirling. Mote and Hand are by Pournelle and Larry Niven and are usually filed under \"N\", not \"P\", in bookstores! The War World stories are by a variety of authors, with Pournelle as overseer these are filed under \"P\" in bookstores, unless you're lucky enough to live in a city with a dedicated science fiction bookstore, in which case they may be under \"Anthologies\" or \"Shared Universes\". To determine the author of a specific story, see the complete Bibliography.\nThe CoDominium Stories\nThese are the stories of the CoDominium, the mega-state formed by the American-Soviet alliance which dominates Earth during the twenty-first century.\nThe chronological order of these books:\nIf you don't want to skip around quite this much, you can save Go Tell The Spartans and Prince of Sparta for the end, and finish the other stories first.\nIf you aren't all that concerned with chronology, these stories can be read in any order. My only strong suggestion is that you should read Go Tell The Spartans before reading Prince of Sparta.\nThe War World Stories\nAs I mentioned above, the tales in the War World books are in a complicated order, and none of the books give any clues about how these stories are connected together.\nThe nine books, and the abbreviations I've used for them, are:\nWhen stories overlap, I have put them in the best reading order rather than try to intertwine them. However, there are a few times that there was no way to avoid breaking a story up into pieces due to other intervening stories. See the Timeline for full details of the dates of each story.\nThis entire list is chronological, but I have broken it down into separate \"sagas\" to give it more structure. If you read all the stories in order you will end up with the best and broadest sense of Haven's history. But if you'd rather jump into some other point, it is best to at least keep each of these \"sagas\" intact!\nNearly every story comes with a \"prologue\", but many of these are not connected with the story itself. In some cases, I recommend reading the \"story and prologue\"; in other cases the prologues are listed separately. When just the name of the story is given, that means the story without the prologue.\nWWCD 1-6, reprinted in WWD 13-16: The Lost and the Founder.\nWWI 1-8, expanded in WWD 17-27: Discovery.\nWWCD 7-48, expanded in WWD 28-63: The Garden Spot.\nWWCD 49-109, reprinted in WWD 64-114: In Concert, prologue and story.\nWWD 115-124: The Shimmer Stone Scam.\nWWTO 11-14: 26th CoDominum Line Regiment.\nWWD 125-163: Nothing In Common.\nWWD 164-180: Hell's-a-Comin'.\nWWD 181-225: Counterpoint.\nWWD 226-228: Astronomy Lesson.\nWWD 229-262: On Jordan's Stormy Banks.\nWWCD 110-182, reprinted in WWD 263-325: Janesfort War, prologue and story.\nWWTO 15-89: To Win the Peace.\nWWD 347-369: Steppe Stone.\nWWD 326-346: Last Chance.\nWWD 370-383 only: part of Down the Rabid Hole.\nWWTO 90-115: The Raid on Purity.\nWWTO 116-128: Marching on Poland.\nWWTO 129-210: Enough Rope.\nWWTO 211-266: More Precious Than Rubies.\nWWI 9-12: Haven.\nWWCD 183-226, reprinted in WWTO 267-308: The Coming of the Dinneh, prologue and story.\nWWTO 309-314: Business As Usual.\nWWTO 315-326: Pound-Foolish.\nWWI 13-15: Dream Valley prologue.\nWWCD 227-298, reprinted in WWTO 327-393: Politics of Melos, prologue and story.\nWWTO 394-425 only: part of Atalanta.\nWWCD 299-332: Hang Together, prologue and story.\nWWCD 333-366: Sons of Hawaii, prologue and story.\nWWI 16-41: Dream Valley.\nWWI 42-53: The Toymaker and the General, prologue and story.\nWWCD 367-392: Fire and Ice, prologue and story.\nWWCD 393-396: Farewell to Haven.\nWWTO 426-431 only: part of Atalanta.\nWWI 278: Tribute Maidens prologue.\nWWII 291-292: The Field of Double Sowing prologue.\nWWII 166-167: Brenda prologue.\nWWI 227-236: Necessity prologue.\nTHE BATTLE OF SAURON, Prologue.\nWWI 55-105: The Deserter.\nWWI 106-143: Rate of Exchange, prologue and story.\nWWII 2-83: The Face of the Enemy.

And they may be hard to find.\nThe Mote in God's Eye is a truly great book, and is highly recommended with or without these two stories.\nThe Gripping Hand is the sequel to Mote. It should certainly not be read first, since that would give away much of the Mote story. Some folks were disappointed with The Gripping Hand. My view is that it's a good book, but since Mote is one of the greatest science fiction books ever written and quite an intricate story, following it with a sequel was a very difficult task. If you have a dislike for sequels in general, consider this book optional.

{"question":"What was Jackie Robinson's historic debut in Jersey City's Roosevelt Stadium in 1946, and how did his breakthrough impact the fate of the Negro League teams in subsequent years?","answer":"On April 18, 1946, Jackie Robinson made history at Jersey City's Roosevelt Stadium as the first black player in organized baseball since 1899. Playing for the Montréal Royals, he had an outstanding debut, going 4 for 5 with a three-run homer, scoring 4 runs, driving in 3 and stealing 2 bases. This breakthrough led to Robinson joining the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, becoming the first African American in Major League Baseball. His success opened the floodgates for other Black players, with approximately 150 Black players integrated into professional major league teams by 1952. However, this integration had devastating consequences for the Negro Leagues. The departure of top talent led to financial problems and declining attendance at Negro League games. The Negro National League disbanded after the 1949 season, and though the Negro Leagues continued through the 1950s, they had lost their best players and fan base, ultimately closing their doors for good in 1962.","context":["Thursday, April 18, 2013\n149. Jackie Robinson: A Great Day in Jersey City\nToday's post is a re-working of one of my oldest ones on the site. While I liked the original drawing, times change and my style has evolved a bit so when I wanted to include Jackie in my new edition of 21, I decided it was time to give him an update. Since Robinson's first appearance in 1946 was such a momentous occasion, and being from New Jersey, I wanted to show a bit of the old ballpark in Jersey City where the game took place. That's Roosevelt Stadium's distinctive scoreboard in the background. I liked this drawing so much I made it a full-page illustration in 21. I tried to depict Robinson as being full of confidence, ready to take the field for the first time, the weight of a whole race upon his able shoulders. It was an important day and I wanted to make this an important drawing.\n67 years ago today, Jackie Robinson sat in the visitor's locker room of Jersey City's Roosevelt Stadium. Suiting up with his Montréal Royals teammates, Robinson was about to do what no black man had done since 1899 - play in an organized baseball game. Johnny Wright, another black ballplayer was on the roster that day, too, but Wright was a pitcher and was not going to play. Once the bands stopped and Mayor Hague threw out the first ball, Robinson was on his own. Opening Day in Jersey City was a big deal back then, a city-wide holiday. The Hague political machine that ran the city since 1917 expected every single municipal employee to purchase a ticket in order to give Jersey City the largest opening day crowd every year. Although 25,000 fans streamed through the turnstiles that afternoon, twice than number was sold. Still, with 25,000, Jersey City easily led the International League in attendance that day, and they got to witness history being made.\nFrom the story accompanying the illustration in 21:\nWhen Jackie Robinson took the field at Jersey City’s Roosevelt Stadium on April 18, 1946 he became the first black ballplayer in organized baseball since 1899. Robinson’s fame as a college athlete, his university education, and experience as an army officer made him the perfect man for a very difficult job. Many Negro League ballplayers expressed disappointment that he was to be the first to integrate the game. His manager with Montréal silently questioned whether or not a black man was even human. Bob Feller, who pitched against Robinson in 1945, thought so little of his talent said “If he were a white man, I doubt if they would even consider him big league material, except perhaps as a bat boy.” Robinson faced it all with quiet dignity and strength. In that first game in Jersey City he went 4 for 5, including a three-run homer, scored 4 runs, drove in 3 and stole 2 bases. Overcoming immense racial pressure, Jackie won over his teammates and fans with his natural physical ability and intense drive to win. Sparked by his play, Montréal won the Little World Series of 1946 and the next year he was playing for Brooklyn. Through his sheer determination Jackie Robinson not only paved the way for the desegregation of the major leagues but also the modern civil rights movement.\nDon't forget the card I posted yesterday of Happy Chandler, the Commissioner of Baseball who backed up Branch Rickey when he wanted to bring Jackie Robinson to the Dodgers.","NegroLeague and Blacks in Professional Major League Teams\nTowardsthe end of the 19th century until 1948, the Major League Baseball,also known as the Majors, MLB, or the Big Show, was segregated. Atthe time, the African Americans were drafted and played in the NegroLeagues. They were not allowed to be part of the MLB or otheraffiliate teams of the Major League (Nemec 39). During years, theNegro Leagues existed as a different entity from the MLB, and eventhough it was structured similarly to the Major League teams, therewas no equality.\nThe primary objective of this paper is to focus on why and how theNegro League teams became part of the MLB and the impact of racialintegration in MLB on some of the prominent Negro League teams. Thethesis will start with a review of a few Negro League teams, whichproduced some of the Major Leaguers, and then move on to theintegration of the Major Leagues, which allow the Negro Leagues andBlacks in professional major league teams (Nemec 43). The paper willconclude by highlighting how the teams were integrated it took awhile before every team follow suit and racially integrate to theprofessional teams.\nNegro LeagueBaseball Teams\nThe Negro League baseball became paramount to the African-Americans,which fielded teams. Because of the segregation of baseball at thetime, it was very crucial for the Negro Leagues to form an organizedentity. According to Riess (71), the Negro Leagues did this byestablishing the kind of league that was similar to that of the MLBand ended the season crowned as the World Series league winners. Backin the early 1990s, the Negro Leaguers became an organized entitywith the establishment of the Negro Southern League and the NegroNational League. These two leagues were active however, there was noactual way to tell which team, in particular, was doing well in theNegro Leagues. In 1937, many teams, which were in the Negro SouthernLeague or independent, became part of the Negro American League(NAL), and thus the Negro Leagues became two. In the end, theseleagues gave the blacks – African-Americans – a feeling of beingin the Majors.\nThe Kansas City Monarchs\nThe Kansas City Monarchs ended up being one of the most famous NegroLeague Teams, and throughout its 42 years of existence between 1920and 1942, the team fielded more than 13 future big leaguers, and mostimportant the first black in the MLB, Jackie Robinson. The Monarchswere more than a baseball team since they played a crucial role inthe entire Kansas City, and most importantly the African-Americancommunity. Because of the kind of conditions the Kansas City blackcommunity created, playing as a baseball game became a bigger fit anda dream to every Black athlete (Cash 27). Their status in the Blackcommunity appealed more to the young and aspiring athletes. Moreover,because of racists faced by the Negro League Players and the entireAfrican American Community, there was a need for these playersestablish high standards and become role models for the BlackCommunity.\nThe Monarchs ended up being one of the most successful teams in theNegro Leagues, and in the completed, a total of 14 future majorleaguers was drafted in the MLB. The team was different in the sensethat their owner was a non-Black. Throughout their run, the team hadmany different promotions becoming the team in Kansas City. JackieRobinson became the most prominent of all the great players thatdonned the Monarch`s jersey. More so, Jackie Robinson crossed thecolor barrier, becoming the first player to play in the Major LeagueBaseball, which incidentally became the end of the Monarchs. Some ofthe Monarchs players that made to the Major Leagues include EugeneWalter Baker, Elston Howard, Willard Jesse Brown, Clifford Johnson,Jr., and Curtis Benjamin Roberts.\nThe Homestead Grays\nThe Homestead Grays was another prominent and fruitful team in theNegro League Baseball. Formed in 1912, the Homestead Grays startedout in Homestead, PA, which is a steel region in Pittsburgh. Afterthe 1982 steel strike, most of the African Americans moved toPittsburgh, and most of them working at the Carnegie-Illinois SteelCompany. The Grays became successful playing against some of the mostfamous teams among other Negro League teams (Cottrell 14). Soonerthan expected, the Grays became bigger in Ohio, Pennsylvania, andWest Virginia. Their dominance saw them receive eight straightpennants between 1937 and 1945. Again, nine Gray players wereinducted into the team`s Hall of Fame. Another eight players thatonce worn the Gray jersey jumped the color barrier, becoming addedAfrican Americans playing in the Major League Baseball teams.\nAlthough Jackie Robinson never played for the Homestead Grays, hiscrossing over to play in the MLB affected the Grays significantly.The Grays having started out in the Pittsburgh`s suburbs and wentahead to gain the support they needed by the African AmericanBulletin, \"Pittsburgh Courier,\" the team continued to enjoya great following by the African Americans. The following was feltwith their move to the Washington DC having gotten help from the\"Afro-American.\" Although the team played in the stadiumthat was a segregationist, Griffith, and with the support of both theBlack and White sports writers, the team managed to produce a player– John Wright – who went ahead to play in the mixed minor leaguesin 1946. Following the footsteps of Wright, the Homestead Grayseventually produced a total of eight Major Leaguers.\nBirmingham Blacks Barons\nIn the South, the Birmingham Black Barons was the most prominent teamin the Negro League Baseball. The Black Barons had the most number offuture Major Leaguers of all the entire Negro League teams after theMonarchs and the Grays with seven African American players making itto the Big Show. Always winning against the big teams, the BlackBarons attracted large crowds, and the team ended up staying longerin the Negro League Baseball than their counterparts (NLBPA 18).Additionally, church life became a huge part of the African Americancommunity around the Birmingham area. For instance, churches aroundthe area ensured that their services ended up much earlier to allowthe members to attend the Black Barons games. It ended up being areal sign of pride in the Birmingham community.\nBy the end of their dominance in 1960, the Black Barons had turnedout to be a dominant team in the South and the entire Negro LeagueBaseball. The Black Barons became an integral part of the Birminghamway of life of the African American community. The team ended upreceiving a huge black following, especially during their homematches at the Rickwood Field (NLBM 10). It drew huge following thesame the White Birmingham Barons did, coupled with equal presscoverage. Five of the Black Barons players made it to the Hall ofFame, for example, Willie Mays, Willie Wells, Satchel Paige, MuleSuttles, and Bill Forster. The same players, at some point, crossedthe color barrier and went ahead and become an integral part in theMajor League.\nIn 1947, theMajor League Baseball was officially integrated when Jackie Robinsonpremiered with the Brooklyn Dodgers – a league professional team –on the opening day. Though it did not happen until that moment, therewas a feeling throughout the 1940s that both the Major and MinorBaseball leagues would be integrated sooner that it was expected.Some of the factors, which contributed to this, were the continuedpressured from the World War II, advocacy for integration, and JudgeKenesaw Mountain Landis`s death (Snyder (34). The baseball executivesseemed to have thought about the idea of the African-American playingin the Major League Baseball leagues. However, before theintegration, they appeared to have felt that the public was not yetready for the experience.\nIn 1939, FordFrick, the then the National League President, claimed, \"manyMLB fans think that the league does not want the African Americans,but that`s not the case.\" (Powell 21). He said that the fans aremore interested to see the Blacks in the professional leagues, buthave not gotten used to them because the general public has not beeneducated enough to place them on the same level as the White players.However, the Minor League Baseball seemed to have made progresstowards the integration of the Blacks, professionally, in 1943. Thiswas so when the Los Angeles Angels offered tryouts to three AfricanAmerican baseball players, then playing (LA Angels) on the PacificCoast (McNary 24). These players were Howard Easterling, Chet Brewer,and Nate Moreland. After the LA Angels canceled potential tryout forChet Brewer, another team, Oakland Oaks, playing in the Pacific CoastLeague, give him a possible tryout.\nThis moveappeared to be daunting for the Black baseball players who hoped tobreak through the color barrier to play in professional major leagueteams, and with the aim of proving that they were good enough to playas professionals in the White-dominated Major League teams. As muchas there was still a lot of segregation felt throughout the countryat the time, the fact that two professional baseball leaguesattempted to offer potential tryouts to Black players, it appearedthat those Black players exhibited a sign that integration was apossibility, and the process towards the objective was in theprocess.\n1944 was theyear that was more crucial towards the Black players playingprofessionally in the major leagues, and the color barrier eventuallygetting broken. That year, two major events took place, whichaccelerated hopes for most African American players that one day,they may get a chance in the Major`s (Nemec 46). The first one wasthe World War II, which was in full effect. Additionally, with boththe Major and Minor League Baseball league rosters continuing to bedepleted with the players fighting for the country (America), someleague owners looked at the chances of the African Americans fillingthe available slots in the rosters. The wars also became importantconsidering many of the Americans realized that the Blacks along withthe Whites fighting for America had to be segregated with baseball athome.\nThe secondoccurrence in 1944, which helped push for the Blacks playing for asprofessionals in the Major League Baseball was the death of Landis,the league commissioner. He was the head of the Major League Baseballbetween 1920 and 1944. He was known to be a staunch segregationist,but more often than not, stated often that there were no rules put inplace to prevent the African Americans play as professionals in theMajor League (Riess 78). When people started talking about how theAfrican American players were better set to be part of the Majors butthe commissioner was thought be standing in the way of the merger.However, Landis responded that Negroes are not blocked from playingas professionals in the Majors and never has he over the past 21years as a commissioner.\nWith thesupport of Albert Benjamin Chandler, Sr. the new MLB Commissioner, hesigned Jackie Robinson, the African-American player, making him playfor the Whites team, the Dodgers. Later on in his biography, thecommissioner wrote that even though he risked his job, he would nothave been in a clear conscience that the African-Americans could notplay with the Whites having fought them alongside in the World WarII. After the color barrier was broken, the Black media engagedextensively by playing a significant role in the involvement andintegration of the league (Cash 29). Again, with the African Americannewspapers covering the Negro Baseball Leagues extensively, therewere better understanding and strong following of the Black players.The publications, for example, the \"Pittsburgh Courier\" andthe \"Afro-American\" in Washington D.C., and \"The Call\"had some of the African American columnists covering their hotbedsextensively in baseball.\nJackie Robinson`s success in the Major Baseball League opened thefloodgates for a firm and steady streaming of the African Americanplayers in the professional major league teams. After his move to theDodgers, Robinson was shortly followed by Roy Campanella, anotherNegro League star in Brooklyn. The Cleveland Indians also announcedthat they have drafted three African American players, Joe Black,Larry Doby, and Don Newcombe becoming the first Blacks in theAmerican League (Cottrell 15). By the end of 1952, there wereapproximately 150 Black players into professional major league teams.Again, the cream of the crop had since been lured to ply their tradeaway from the Negro League rosters into the integrated ProfessionalMajor League Baseball.\nFollowing thefour years after Jackie Robinson`s debut in the Major`s the Dodgers,it became evident that all the Negro Leagues` crème de la crème hadalready moved on to greener pastures or had grown old enough toattract the unwavering attention of the scouts from the Major`s(NLBPA 19). With these dramatic and sudden departures of top talent,the owners of black teams experienced a financial devastation, whichdeclined in attendance at the Negro League games. The Black fans`attention has turned to the professional teams forever, and thehandwriting had already on the wall for all the Negro League teams.\nThe disbandmentof the Negro National League after 1949 season meant that the leaguewould never return. Following a successful run by the Blackbaseball`s circuit by the seniors, the end of the 1949 season saw theend of a viable and profitable commercial business. Although theNegro Baseball League continuity through the 1950s, the league hadirredeemably lost its bulk of talented players and virtually theentire fan base. Additionally, after a whole of the decade of theNegro League operating as the shadow of its initial glory, the entireleague eventually closed its doors in 1962, for good.\nWhat transpiredto the Negro Baseball League after the season ended in 1962 has sincebeen shadowed with mystery. Unraveling of this mystery, two of themajor areas saw the Center for Negro League and Dr. Revel focusing onthem. These involved interviewing the baseball players that played inthe 1961-1962 season and studying the newspapers at the time. Morethan a decade later, no article in the paper showed that there was aNegro Baseball League in 1963 (NLBM 12). The players who took partuntil the season were interviewed to get their personal recollectionof what could have happened to this league after the end of 1962season.\nFrom theinterview, and apart from the few Blacks drafted in the professionalmajor league teams, some of them went their way to do other things.Henry Elmore, a Black Baron player in 1962 said that the entire teamand the league disintegrated, and most of the players went to playand work in the Birmingham Industrial League. He emphasized thatthere was no Black Baron team after the 1962 season. For Elmore, hewent ahead to play for the Stockham from 1963 up to the 1980s.\nAll the players that were interviewed gave the same story, and fromthe interview, there was no Negro Baseball League after the 1962season. The players` consensus is that they appeared to bebarnstorming rather than playing. No single player interview was in aposition to remember that the Negro Baseball League existed 1963.According to Snyder (35), all the Black players were in an entirelyemphatic mood that at the season`s end, the teams were simplybarnstorming.\nThe baseballgame knows no barriers regarding color, age, and other limitingfactors. For instance, if one knew how to play the game, it did notmatter what age one were or the color a player had. However, it longfor the African Americans to be accepted into the professional majorleague teams. But in the Negro league teams, it did not matter, andit saw baseball become number one in America (Powell 23). Prior tointegration, baseball played a bigger part in the black community asa social interaction tool. Larger towns had some clubs playing in theindustrial league baseball. Again, many companies offered theirsponsorship to the black teams. Additionally, there were weddings andbeauty pageants before the game, and in short, baseball games werebiggest in towns across the country.\nIntegration of Negro Baseball League players into two majorprofessional teams was no longer a subject of discussion after JackieRobinson had been signed to play with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Beforethat, the Major League Baseball was closed to people of colorhowever, baseball was already integrated into all areas of semiproand amateur baseball teams (McNary 28). For instance, both White andBlack baseball players often engaged together on the town and localteams at the college and university level. It had reached a timewhere the black players were allowed to interact and play asprofessionals in the Majors.\nThe AfricanAmerican baseball players suffered long enough before eventuallytaking in the Major League Baseball as professionals. Even though theBlacks played a part in the Majors briefly after the Civil War, itwas until Jackie Robinson became integrated into the Major`s in 1945that the color barrier was finally broken. Of importance to note isthat the Negro League Baseball provided a sense of organization tothe Negro Leagues. In these leagues, the Blacks played full seasonsthe same way the Major Leagues were structured. A taste ofprofessional teams was when the Blacks engaged in barnstorm with theMajor Leagues making extra money. During this time, the Blacks andWhites would come up together to play by creating all-star teams.\nAdditionally, the integration of the Blacks in the Major`s wasbecause of Landis, the MLB commissioner who moved swiftly to advocatefor owners of the Major`s to sign players from the Negro LeagueBaseball. He was known to be a segregationist, and during his tenure,a lot of Black players moved to play in both the Major and MinorLeagues. Although no actual rule had been drafted against the AfricanAmericans to play in the Majors, the commissioner, and other ownersexercised a gentleman`s agreement to make sure baseball, as apopular game, remained segregated as long as possible.\nCottrell, Robert C.

{"question":"What are the main symptoms someone might experience after tearing their eardrum?","answer":"After tearing an eardrum, a person might experience several symptoms including: mild to severe pain that may increase before suddenly decreasing, drainage from the ear that can be clear, pus-filled, or bloody, hearing loss, ringing or buzzing in the ear (tinnitus), dizziness or vertigo that can cause nausea or vomiting, and in some cases weakness in the facial muscles.","context":["Darren lost his balance while waterskiing. As he fell sideways, his head slapped against the water and he felt a sharp pain inside his ear. When Darren put his fingers to his ear he saw blood. He also realized he couldn't hear as well from that ear.\nDarren's parents called the doctor and got him an appointment right away. The doctor looked in Darren's ear and told him he had a perforated eardrum.\nWhat Is a Perforated Eardrum?\nA perforated eardrum is a tear or hole in the ear's tympanic membrane (the medical name for your eardrum). A perforated eardrum is also sometimes called a ruptured eardrum.\nA perforated eardrum can really hurt. And if you can't hear as well as usual, it can be pretty scary. The good news is, most people who have a perforated eardrum get all their hearing back eventually.\nIf you think you have a perforated eardrum, see a doctor. A tear in the eardrum can allow bacteria and other things to get into the middle ear and inner ear. If that happens, an infection could develop that can cause more hearing loss.\nMost perforated eardrums heal in a few weeks. Sometimes, though, doctors need to do surgery to repair the tear.\nHow the Eardrum Works\nThe eardrum is a thin piece of skin-like tissue that's stretched tight — like a drum — across the opening between the ear canal and the middle ear.\nThe outer ear funnels sound waves into the ear canal that hit the eardrum and make it vibrate. The middle ear and inner ear convert the vibrations to signals that the brain interprets as sounds.\nIf there is a hole in the eardrum, it can't always vibrate as well as it should. This can make a person's hearing worse.\nCauses of a Perforated Eardrum\nYou've probably already know not to stick cotton swabs or other things into the ear canal when cleaning your ears. But eardrums can get ruptured a number of ways, and not all of them involve puncturing them with a swab.\nHere are some things that may cause perforated eardrums in teens:\n- Sudden pressure changes (barotraumas). Most of the time, the air pressure in the middle ear and the pressure in the environment are in balance. But some things — like flying in an airplane, driving on a mountain road, or scuba diving — can cause a sudden change in pressure that may rupture an eardrum.\n- Loud noises (acoustic trauma). Really loud noises, like an explosion, can produce sound waves that are strong enough to damage the eardrum. Luckily, this doesn't happen often. Loud noise also can cause temporary or permanent damage to the cochlea.\n- Foreign objects. Thinks like cotton swabs or bobby pins may poke through the eardrum if pushed into the ear.\n- Head trauma. A direct blow to the ear or a severe head injury from something like a car accident can fracture (break) the skull bone and tear the eardrum.\n- Direct trauma to the pinna and outer ear canal. A slap on the ear with an open hand or other things that put pressure on the ear can tear the eardrum.\n- Ear infections. An infection of the middle ear or inner ear can cause pus or fluid to build up behind the eardrum. This can make the eardrum burst open.\nWhat Are the Symptoms?\nThe first sign of a perforated eardrum will probably be pain. Here's what someone might notice after tearing an eardrum:\n- mild to severe pain that may increase for a time before suddenly decreasing\n- drainage from the ear that can be clear, pus-filled, or bloody\n- hearing loss\n- ringing or buzzing in the ear (tinnitus)\n- dizziness or vertigo (a feeling that the room is spinning) that can cause nausea or vomiting\n- weakness in the muscles of the face (this doesn't happen a lot)\nTalk to a parent or call a doctor right away if you have any symptoms of a perforated eardrum. You should also see a doctor if you continue to have symptoms after getting treatment for a perforated eardrum. Even though most perforations heal on their own, you want to take steps to make sure any hearing loss you experience is only temporary.\nGo to the emergency room right away if you have severe symptoms. Examples of severe symptoms are bloody discharge from your ear, extreme pain, total hearing loss in one ear, or dizziness that causes vomiting.\nDiagnosing a Perforated Eardrum\nTo check for a perforated eardrum, a doctor will most likely examine your ear canal with a lighted instrument called an otoscope. Often, a doctor can see the tear and may even be able to see the tiny bones of the middle ear. Other times it can be hard to see the eardrum at all because of fluid draining from the ear.\nA doctor might order additional tests. Some of these are to check the eardrum for a rupture, others help doctors learn more about hearing loss. The doctor may want you to get an audiology exam to measure how well you hear at different pitches and volumes.\nIf there is fluid coming from the ear, a sample of the fluid might be tested in a lab. This can help doctors decide which antibiotic is best for treating the infection.\nWhat's the Treatment?\nUsually, a perforated eardrum will heal on its own within a few weeks without any treatment. While the eardrum is healing, over-the-counter pain relievers can help ease any pain. Ask your health care professional or a parent which pain relievers are best for you.\nTo help prevent infections (or treat any existing infections), a doctor may prescribe antibiotics. Antibiotics are usually a pill that you'll swallow, but sometimes can be ear drops.\nHere are three things to avoid doing if you have a perforated eardrum:\n- Never use over-the-counter ear drops unless your doctor specifically tells you to. If there is a hole in the eardrum, some kinds of ear drops can get into the middle ear or cochlea and cause problems.\n- Avoid getting water inside the ear canal. Your doctor might recommend that you keep your ear dry during water activities to prevent infection while the eardrum heals. This can be done by gently placing a waterproof earplug or cotton ball coated with petroleum jelly in your ear when you shower or take a bath.\n- Don't clean your ear or forcefully blow your nose. Wait until the tear in your eardrum is completely healed.\nIf your eardrum doesn't heal on its own, an ear-nose-throat (ENT) specialist may recommend an eardrum patch. During this procedure, a doctor puts a paper patch over the hole. Doctors may need to do this procedure a number of times until the eardrum is fully healed.\nIf all other treatments fail, the ENT specialist might have to do a kind of surgery known as a tympanoplasty. The surgeon will attach a small patch of your own tissue to close the tear on your eardrum.\nPreventing a Perforated Eardrum\nSometimes you can't prevent a perforated eardrum (like when an eardrum ruptures because of infection, for example). But a lot of eardrum perforations are 100% preventable.\nTo make the chances of a rupture very unlikely:\n- Call your doctor right away if you notice any signs of an ear infection.\n- Never stick anything in your ear, even to clean it. If you get something stuck in your ear, have it removed by a health care provider — don't try to get it out at home as this could damage your ear.\n- Try to avoid flying on airplanes if you have a cold or sinus infection. If you have to fly, chew some gum during takeoff and landing. You can also try to equalize the pressure in your ears by yawning or swallowing. But don't try that trick of blowing your nose while pinching your nostrils shut. Doctors don't recommend this.\n- Get lessons and a certification if you plan to go scuba diving. Make sure you learn how to equalize the pressure in your ears. Don't scuba dive if you have an ear infection, sinus infection, or cold.\nPerforated eardrums can be scary at first, so it helps to remember that most clear up on their own. But you'll still want to see a doctor and get the right advice on how to make this happen.\nShare this page using:\nNote: All information on TeensHealth® is for educational purposes only.

The death toll is rising in what is now the largest outbreak of food-borne illness in more than a decade.\nSuddenly the spotlight is on listeria. What is it? Where is it? Who’s at risk? What are the symptoms? What are the best ways to avoid contamination?\nWhat is listeria?\nLike the famous mouthwash Listerine, Listeria monocytogenes was named after antiseptic pioneer Joseph Lister. It’s a very common bacterium with an unusual trait: It can grow at refrigerator temperatures. And it can build up in food-processing plants, where it can survive for years.\nWhere is listeria found?\nListeria is found in soil, groundwater, animal feed, sewage, and even dust. It primarily lives in soil, where the bacterium eats decaying plants. But once it makes its way into the food supply and is eaten by a human, listeria transforms into a very different bug — one that can live inside human cells.\nWhat foods are often most contaminated with listeria?\nBecause listeria can grow at refrigerator temperatures and high salt concentrations, cured meats kept in the refrigerator can support listeria growth. Unpasteurized milk, unpasteurized milk products, refrigerated smoked seafood, and raw sprouts have also been implicated in listeria outbreaks. But listeria can grow on many different foods, particularly if they are stored in a contaminated refrigerator. The nationwide U.S. listeria outbreak of 2011 — the largest in more than a decade — was traced to cantaloupes.\nWhat should I do if I bought a suspect cantaloupe or other food?\nAll of the cantaloupes in the current listeria outbreak came from Jensen Farms, a Colorado-based company. Although some of these cantaloupes carry a distinctive sticker, not all contaminated fruit will be marked. Ask your grocer if the cantaloupe you bought is from Jensen Farms.\nIf you suspect that you have a contaminated cantaloupe, do not try to wash off the listeria. Griffin of the CDC notes that it’s not clear whether a listeria-contaminated melon carries listeria on the inside as well as on the outside.\nSo dispose of suspect cantaloupe in a sealed bag, and make sure it will not be eaten by animals or other people.\nIf there is a recall or any suspicion that there is listeria in your food — be it lettuce, cheese, or hot dogs — throw it out. Do not try to wash the food because there is no way to ensure that the listeria is just on the surface. Listeria cannot be seen and it does not change the way the food looks, so always play it safe. Officials also ask that you wrap the food in a plastic bag before throwing it out to prevent another person or an animal from eating it.\nAs for all other produce, the FDA advises to wash all fruits and vegetables under running water just before eating, cutting, or cooking, even if you plan to peel the produce first. Scrub firm produce such as melons and cucumbers with a clean produce brush.\nIs there anything else I should do if I’ve bought listeria-contaminated food?\nOne study found that once a listeria-contaminated food product was in a person’s home, 11% of all food samples in their refrigerators also were contaminated. Nearly two-thirds of people with listeria infections turn out to have listeria growing in their refrigerators.\nSo clean your refrigerator if you think you may have purchased a contaminated cantaloupe. Wash the fridge thoroughly with soap and water. Then wipe it down with a diluted solution of chlorine bleach.\nWho is most at risk from listeria?\nThe healthy immune system usually keeps listeria in check. Healthy people usually get only mild diarrhea from listeria, if they get any symptoms at all. But immunity wanes each decade after age 60, so the elderly are at risk. Pregnancy, especially the third trimester, makes a woman vulnerable to listeria. And people with diseases (such as HIV or diabetes) or who take medications that lower immunity are at high risk.\nWhy is listeria so deadly?\nIn most healthy people, the immune system eliminates listeria-infected cells before the infection can spread. But when listeria escapes the gut, it gets into the blood. From there it can spread throughout the body, causing a disease called listeriosis. Listeriosis can cause deadly encephalitis and meningitis, killing some 20% of patients. Listeria causes about 19% of all U.S. deaths from food-borne infections.\nWhy are pregnant women at high risk from listeria?\nPregnant women usually do not develop serious listeriosis themselves, just a mild flu-like illness. But once listeria gets into a pregnant woman’s blood, it seeks out the placenta. From there it can infect the fetus and cause stillbirth, miscarriage, or preterm birth. During birth from a woman carrying listeria, the bacteria can infect the newborn. Neonatal listeriosis can cause fatal or disabling meningitis.\nWhat are common symptoms of listeriosis?\nListeriosis may start with diarrhea or other intestinal symptoms. But serious disease starts with fever and muscle aches. Other symptoms often include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions.\nHow long after eating listeria-contaminated foods do severe symptoms appear?\nThe time between eating listeria-contaminated food and having listeriosis symptoms ranges from three days to two months. Most people seem to get symptoms within one to three weeks.\nWhat is the treatment for listeriosis?\nBecause it is so deadly, listeriosis is treated with intravenous antibiotics. Treatment lasts two weeks if the central nervous system is not infected, four weeks if it is. Nearly all patients are hospitalized for at least a few days.\nHow can you avoid listeria infection?\nHere’s the FDA’s advice on how to prevent listeriosis:\n• Do not consume unpasteurized milk or milk products.\n• Wash hands and any other contacted surfacs after handling raw foods.\n• Rinse raw produce thoroughly.\n• Keep uncooked meat, poultry, and seafood separate from all other foods.\n• Thoroughly cook meat, poultry, or seafood.\n• Eat perishable and ready-to-eat foods as soon as possible.\n• People at risk should heat hot dogs, cold cuts, and deli meats before eating them.\nIf you suspect that you may have contacted listeria, seek medical treatment immediately."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:71be5c36-2394-45aa-b958-05fa9fb1e824>","<urn:uuid:fd168a38-cd62-4f22-a02a-c12937bcd9eb>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What is the relationship between the 'Least Effort Principle' in software architecture and Lean Software Development's approach to team collaboration?","answer":"The Least Effort Principle in software architecture states that developers should not change existing software unless there's an easier way to accomplish the same task, following the path of least resistance. In contrast, Lean Software Development takes a more collaborative approach, focusing on empowering team members rather than constraining them. LSD emphasizes creating a collaborative environment that maintains balance under tight deadlines and heavy workloads, especially when integrating new team members. While both approaches aim for efficiency, the Least Effort Principle focuses on individual developer actions and maintaining existing solutions, while LSD promotes team cohesion and shared responsibility to optimize workflow and improve overall team performance.","context":["Architecture lays out a firm foundation for any software project. A sound architecture defines the technical standards, design, delivery, and support framework of the software product. While designing software architecture, a skilled practitioner will keep in mind the development and technology goals and ensure everything is logical, scalable, and cost-efficient.\nSolutions architects play a significant role in designing system architecture, with an understanding of technical standards like platforms, technologies, and infrastructure. Their analysis directly helps to successfully define the product, perfect the design, and provide on-time, cost-efficient delivery and lifetime support. Therefore, they have to understand the technology goals of the organization along with the client’s business needs.\nTo make a software project successful, software architects must follow a set of basic rules, guidelines, and principles. These are the three key principles of software architecture that you should never forget.\n1. SOLID Principles\nSOLID is an industry-standard framework or a set of principles every developer must follow while working on Object Oriented Programming System (OOPS) projects.\nIntroduced for the first time in a technical paper—Design Principles and Design Patterns by Robert C. Martin—these five principles are essential for object-oriented design and architecture. SOLID principles focus on enhancing the understandability of software design, boosting scalability, and maintenance.\nThe underlying SOLID principles are:\n- Single Responsibility Principle – This principle states that each module or class should be exclusively responsible for only a single functionality. The original principle states that responsibility is a “reason to change” and each class should have only a single reason to change.\n- Open-Closed Principle – The open-closed principle states that each software entity should be open for enhancements and extensions, without having to modify them. This is in line with the polymorphism concept followed by OOPS.\n- Liskov Substitution Principle – This principle states that each derived class should be the substitute for its base class. To illustrate, let’s take an example. If A is a subclass of B, then objects of type B may be substituted with objects of type A. Altogether, it means that objects within a software program should be replaceable with examples of subtypes without meddling with the program.\n- Interface Segregation Principle – This principle is one of the core things you must follow for enhanced efficiency. It states that existing interfaces should not be topped up with additional functionality by appending new methods into them. What it means is that each interface must be client-specific, and each class should implement multiple interfaces.\n- Dependency Inversion Principle – This principle states that a high-level module should never depend on a low-level module. Both modules should depend on abstraction. Also, abstraction should not depend on details, but the details should depend on abstractions. By following this principle, one can remove the dependencies between higher-level and lower-level modules by introducing an interface abstraction.\nWith continuous use and following the guidelines, SOLID—all five principles together—will give a scalable, modified, tested, and reusable software solution.\n2. Principles of Economics\nThese principles focus on achieving cost-efficiency in a software development project. Essentially, they consist of the following:\nOpportunity Cost Principle\nThis principle is based on the common economic premise that each alternative has the inherent value that we place on that particular alternative. This value can be the cost of the alternative chosen and the benefits thereof. Opportunity costs define what we have to give up in getting that value. For the highest value, we should always opt for the option that offers maximum benefits at the lowest cost.\nIn the software architecture context, this principle means that one should always weigh down different options against one another. One should only choose a path that adds maximum value to the project.\nLast Responsible Moment or Cost of Delay Principle\nThis principle states that no important action or decision should be delayed until the moment when it is absolutely required. This principle allows developers to get an idea of all crucial alternatives and broaden the perspective to make an informed decision.\nSome say that this principle can lead to risks. Still, one can follow this principle by building proof of concepts (PoCs) for demonstrating to the stakeholders the advantages of delaying the decision and the benefits of using an alternative course of action.\n#3 Principles of “Least”\nThese principles focus on least or minimalism philosophy and are essential for managing various aspects of a software development project. Essentially, the “Least” principles include the following:\nPrinciple of Least Astonishment\nThis principle is also known as the “least surprise” principle and recommends that a solution should not surprise or astonish a subject matter expert when they are introduced to it the first time. This principle focuses on harnessing the existing knowledge of the target audience to eliminate the need for learning when using a particular solution.\nPrinciple of Least Effort\nAlso known as Zipf’s law, this principle states that every human tends to follow the path that requires the least effort. This means that subsequent developers should introduce no change in the software unless there is an easier way to do the same thing.\nIn principle, this means that if a solution to perform a task is found, there is no need to improve the existing method.\nSimplify Your Software Development Process\nSoftware architectural principles can streamline the entire project and improve the quality of your decision making. By following the above-mentioned core principles, you can be sure of achieving your long-term goals without deviating from your core objectives.","What is Lean Software Development (LSD)?\nLean Software Development and IT Enabled Services\nAugust 18, 2022 15:51 PM\nWhat is Lean Software Development (LSD)?\nAugust 18, 2022 15:51 PM\nLean Software Development (LSD) is an agile methodology that minimizes development time and resources, bypasses trash, and delivers only what the product needs. The Lean approach is often referred to as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach, in which a team delivers the bare-minimum version of their product to the need. The team collects feedback from customers on what they like, dislike, and like to see added, and then iterates relying on this feedback.\nLean software development is a vision that highlights optimizing efficiency and minimizing destruction in the software development process. This method has its origins in the Lean manufacturing movement of the 1980s. However, it is now considered an essential part of the Agile software development methodology.\nLSD emanates its philosophy from the manufacturing industry, which pioneered the lean development approach to optimize display and assembly lines to reduce waste and maximize customer value. Indeed, it was originally known as the Toyota Production System, an automaker Toyota developed in the mid-twentieth century to facilitate its automobile production and stop wastage of time and resources.\nOther manufacturing companies in different industries ultimately adopted this method, which was modified to Lean. In 2003, with the release of the now-famous book Lean Software Development, the concept was used in software development for the first time.\nThe principles of the lean development approach can be applied to any IT environment to enhance programming techniques. The practice is founded on seven fundamental principles:\nWaste is defined as everything that can lessen code quality, improve development time and effort, or drop provided company value. It could be in the state of redundant code or functionality, programming holds, unclear needs, or inadequate testing. Lean development concentrates on releasing these restrictions, mastering basic techniques, and developing an understanding of the user’s true requirements.\nAdditionally, by delaying judgments until the last minute, the price of change stays significantly down. Iterative development is used to create new applications or updates rapidly. Software is developed with integrity to guarantee that the architecture and system elements work together. Organizations adopt lean development practices to provide continual progress due to the quick execution of modifications.\nProject managers have regular sessions to discover and lower waste, such as redundant code, function delays, inadequate communication, quality problems, data duplication, and more jobs in the log than completed. This enables team members to recognize flaws and recommend adjustments for the following turn.\nLearning is enhanced through extensive code review and cross-team meetings. Additionally, paired programming provides that a single engineer does not collect detailed knowledge when writing a certain piece of code.\nIn traditional project management, this often happens when you create an application and find that it is completely unsuitable for the market. The LSD approach predicts this danger and allows modification by deferring irreversible judgments until all experimentations are completed. This process always flexibly creates software, authorizing the incorporation of new learning and the ability of engineers to make modifications.\nYet, long-term planning was considered essential to corporate victory. Still, it has been shown that engineers spend extreme time creating sophisticated systems with unwanted elements over time. Thus, they created an MVP method, which entailed rapidly growing products with limited functionality and launching them to market to gauge reaction. This approach enables them to enhance the product based on user feedback.\nLSD is more concerned with licensing team members than with defeating them. Establishing a collaborative environment supports a great balance when faced with tight deadlines and an immense workload. This technique evolves required when new members enter an established team.\nLSD is all about underestimating waste while keeping a priority on quality. Designers frequently use test-driven programming to validate their code before reporting it. Additionally, the quality can be improved by obtaining frequent input from team members and project managers.\nLean’s approach allows managers to break down an issue into its constituent elements to optimize the group’s workflow, foster team togetherness, and instill a feeling of shared responsibility, all of which result in improved team performance.\nLean is frequently included in meetings of Agile frameworks alongside Scrum and Kanban. The Agile methods are explained in detail in the Agile Manifesto, including models and principles that guide Agile frameworks.\nThese are a few of the problems associated with lean software development practices:Prerequisites for team training\nWhen a team is unable to cooperate and communicate effectively, development efforts are harmed. Teams and individual team members must be trained to take responsibility for one another’s position and adapt to altering initiatives. Additionally, they must be able to coordinate their work and swap roles as preferences shift.\nA regular Lean pitfall is counting the incorrect software metrics or not counting at all. Because one of Lean software engineering’s immediate purposes is to clear waste, teams must be able to recognize and quantify waste.\nIn Lean, software needs specifications to adapt in reply to user feedback. Excessive sophistication and evolution make deploying a suitable piece of software complex.\nSuboptimization happens when only a part of the value creek of a manufacturing system is optimized. This occurs when a problem is divided into parts, and each part is solved independently without regard for the influence of other components or the whole system.\nMultiple companies have found that the LSD method is a good practice for software development. It simplifies the operation and causes the team to ruthlessly stop any activity that does not straight influence the outcome. However, for this process to be successful, an organization must have an excellent development team and implied trust in that team.\ntell us about your project"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4350ec31-07dc-4b4d-ab65-d68b12aa6be1>","<urn:uuid:16de8a49-1132-4521-97bb-9f9e97bdd219>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the latest developments in respiratory virus detection methods, and how do these technological advances compare to the traditional challenges of zoonotic disease containment?","answer":"Modern respiratory virus detection methods have made significant advances through rapid screening kits that can detect multiple viruses in a single assay, offering substantial time savings over traditional methods. These include immunological techniques like immunofluorescence and enzyme immunoassay, as well as molecular methods like RT-PCR that can detect specific viral RNA sequences within 24 hours. However, these advances exist against the backdrop of continued challenges in containing zoonotic diseases, with nearly 60% of human infections originating from animals. The emergence of new diseases like Zika, Ebola, and SARS demonstrates how traditional containment efforts are complicated by factors such as changes in land use, population growth, and inadequate health services. This creates a complex situation where improved detection capabilities must contend with the ongoing challenges of preventing disease spillover from animals to humans.","context":["This article was originally published on The Conversation. It is also the third and final article in our disease evolution package. Click here to read the first: Disease evolution: our long history of fighting viruses and second instalments: Disease evolution: the origins of anorexia and how it’s shaped by culture and time.\nHumans have been “acquiring” infectious diseases from animals (zoonotic diseases) since we first started hunting wild game on the African savannahs. Indeed, nearly 60% of bugs that infect humans originated in animals.\nThese days, we seem to see more “new” diseases, such as Zika, Ebola and SARS. But there are plenty more lurking. A recent study suggests there are around 300,000 pathogens we don’t even know about and some have the potential to spread from animals to humans.\nThe world’s scientific community is focused on how to improve detection and responses to emerging diseases such as Zika virus and Ebola. So what can we learn from the most recent large-scale outbreaks?\nThe three most common factors associated with the emergence of diseases are:\nchanges in land use for agricultural practices\nchanges in human demography, such as population growth and urbanization\npoor population health and health services.\nThese factors are often interlinked and can turn a small “spillover” outbreak from animals into a major epidemic, as seen in the most recent Ebola epidemic.\nEssentially, humans put themselves in harm’s way just by going about their daily business of growing or harvesting food and seeking shelter.\nEbola is caused by a virus thought to be carried in fruit bats that spills over into other mammals such as primates and antelope.\nHumans are infected when they hunt or butcher animals for food or consume uncooked fresh or dried bushmeat.\nHuman-to-human transmission involves close contact with bodily fluids. This often happens in health-care settings and when people care for sick relatives or perform traditional burial practices that involve direct contact with bodies.\nThe 2014 outbreak in West Africa, which caused more than 28,000 infections and 11,000 deaths, was a sudden departure from the usual picture of small, localized outbreaks in remote areas because of a “perfect storm” of factors.\nThe war-torn countries involved experienced a dramatic increase in population growth, high levels of urbanization, increases in agricultural production (especially livestock) and associated changes in land use and land clearing.\nOn top of that, they had very few health services (reportedly just 50 doctors in the whole of Liberia), especially in rural areas. This combined with the widespread consumption of bushmeat, traditional burial practices and rapid transport networks to drive the outbreak.\nIt’s not hard to see why the spread from rural areas to cities occurred so rapidly; where else would people go for help?\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the defining emerging disease of the 21st century. Caused by a highly infectious coronavirus, it was a global shock which demonstrated how quickly diseases can spread around the world.\nThe spread of SARS was greatly accelerated by geography. It was first detected in Guangdong Province in China but it spread from nearby Hong Kong via a vast network of international air travel.\nThe natural host of SARS is thought to be bats. But the jump to humans occurred via the palm civet, a small omnivorous mammal.\nCivets are a delicacy and eating them is a sign of wealth in Cantonese culture. At the time, civets were slaughtered for local consumption at restaurants specializing in wild game. One of the first cases was a cook in Shenzen.\nThe live animal markets bring together a bewildering array of animal species and are critical junctures between rural and urban communities. This is where one-third of cases originated.\nZika virus is the latest emerging disease to hit the news. It was first isolated from a rhesus monkey in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947 by scientists studying the closely related yellow fever virus.\nLike its relative the dengue virus, Zika’s usual cycle of mosquito-monkey-mosquito expanded to include humans when we entered their ecological niche to collect food or for shelter.\nThe human disease caused by Zika had remained largely invisible since its first identification in 1954. Its recent “emergence” may just be a response to its higher profile after the discovery that infection during pregnancy is associated with the birth defect microcephaly, which causes babies to be born with unusually small heads.\nZika virus will continue to quietly spread around the world via air travel and establish in more countries because its mosquito carrier, Aedes aegypti, is present in more than 128 countries including parts of Europe, the United States and Australia.\nWhy did these diseases jump species?\nThe common theme in the spillover of each of these viruses is food; they are a consequence of the human need for protein.\nOnce the viruses make the species jump, their severity is a major factor in what happens next. It is easier for a mild disease such as Zika to spread unnoticed in a population because it is unlikely to lead a person to seek medical attention.\nWhen disease is severe (think rapid hospitalization and death), such as Ebola or SARS, it tends to make itself known more rapidly, triggering an aggressive public health response that can lead to suppression of the outbreak.\nThe rapid spread of SARS by international air travel to wealthy countries with effective public health systems was a major factor in its limited duration compared with Ebola, which largely remained in a limited geographic range. Ebola may well have become a global pandemic if it had occurred in a major international transport hub.\nPreventing disease outbreaks\nThe world will not prevent the next global pandemic using “business as usual” thinking. We need to acknowledge we live in a rapidly converging world where solutions cross all sectors of society.\nMajor cross-sectoral initiatives, such as the US government’s Emerging Pandemic Threats program, are making some progress. This program attempts to create national, regional and global “One Health” networks to reduce the risk of disease emergence and improve our ability to detect and respond to these unpredictable beasts.\nBut this is not enough because the emergence of diseases is largely driven by changes in human societies. The only thing that will change the drivers of disease is a fundamental rethink about how we co-exist with our environment.\nUnfortunately, there are no easy answers to how we build and feed a global community of 9 billion and not cause an emerging disease disaster along the way.\nWe picked linked items based on the quality of products, and list the pros and cons of each to help you determine which will work best for you.

They are capable of causing a wide range of diseases, from mild self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections, such as sore throats and the common cold, to more serious infections like influenza, bronchiolitis, potentially life threatening pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Some of the most important types from a clinical point of view are shown in table 1 below.\nHistorically, some respiratory viruses, notably the influenza viruses, have been associated with highly destructive global pandemics causing millions of deaths. For example, the so-called ‘Spanish flu’ pandemic of 1918-19 is estimated to have caused many more deaths than the Great War of the preceding four years – probably at least 50 million worldwide. There are serious current concerns that the emergence of new influenza virus types in the human population, through mutation or by antigenic shift between avian and human viruses, could lead to further pandemics in the future.\nThe respiratory viruses are most often transmitted via the aerosol route by inhaling infected droplets, although mechanical transmission through the nose or eye following direct contact with an infected person may also play a significant role in some cases. Infected individuals usually produce large numbers of infective particles in their respiratory secretions, with a peak often seen soon after the onset of symptoms. Many respiratory virus infections, especially those caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the common cold viruses, are highly contagious and will spread rapidly through a population, especially in crowded conditions.\nRespiratory virus infections are extremely common worldwide. For example, acute viral nasopharyngitis – more often known as the common cold – is the most common type of human infection and children may have a many as six to eight episodes every year. RSV is the commonest cause of lower respiratory tract infection in young children and influenza viruses are also major causes of human disease carrying significant costs in terms of health care and lost economic productivity. Pandemic respiratory infections have the potential to be among the most serious threats to global human health posed by any biological agent.\n|Table 1. Some Clinically Significant Respiratory Viruses|\n|Adenoviridae||Mastadenovirus||Human adenoviruses||Pharyngitis, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis|\n|Coronaviridae||Coronavirus||Human coronaviruses, SARS coronavirus||Common colds, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)|\n|Orthomyxoviridae||Influenzavirus A||Influenza A, Avian influenza A||Influenza, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, severe lower respiratory tract infection|\n|Influenzavirus B||Influenza B||Influenza|\n|Paramyxoviridae||Metapneumovirus||Human metapneumovirus||Pharyngitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia|\n|Pneumovirus||Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)||Croup, bronchiolitis, pneumonia (in infants and young children)|\n|Respirovirus||Human parainfluenza virus types 1 & 3||Croup, non-specific upper respiratory tract infections, bronchopneumonia (mainly in children)|\n|Rubulavirus||Human parainfluenza virus types 2 & 4||Croup, pharyngitis and colds (mainly in children)|\n|Parvoviridae||Bocavirus||Human bocaviruses||Thought to be associated with a variety of respiratory infections, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia|\n|Picornaviridae||Rhinovirus||Human rhinovirus A & B||Common colds|\nDetection and isolation techniques\nDiagnostic tests for viruses in general fall into one of three categories.\n1. Direct examination of the sample – electron microscopy, antigen detection, molecular detection of viral genomes\n2. Indirect testing – cell culture techniques and animal tests\n3. Serology – detection of specific serum antibodies\nMethods for the isolation and detection of respiratory viruses in all three categories have been developed, but the preferred method depends on the individual virus. However, sampling and specimen collection are always an important factor.\nAppropriate sampling procedures are critical for the successful isolation and detection of respiratory viruses. Only clinical samples are routinely collected, and these may include nasal and throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, tracheal aspirates, broncho-alveolar lavage fluid and serum. There are established procedures for taking clinical samples for diagnostic virus testing and these should be closely followed to maximise the chances of detecting the causative organism. For example, swabs should be transported in viral transport medium and all samples should be refrigerated if there is a delay of more than 2 hours in reaching the laboratory.\nTraditional detection and isolation methods\nThe principal traditional or classical techniques for detecting and isolating respiratory viruses are indirect cell culture methods and direct electron microscopy. Most respiratory viruses can be detected by culture in common cell lines specific to the virus concerned. This allows both quantification and isolation of the virus. Cell lines used include green monkey kidney, Hep-2 and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Traditionally, cell line cultures are inoculated with the sample and then incubated for up to a week, before examination for any evidence of cytopathogenic effects (CPE), such as damaged cells, or the sloughing off of the cell monolayer. Positive and negative results are then confirmed by further passages (subculturing) in the specific cell line. Unfortunately, some respiratory viruses, notably the influenza viruses, produce little or no CPE and confirmation and identification of positive cell cultures was normally done using haemadsorption, or haemagglutination tests. More recently however, immunofluorescence, or molecular tests have been used for confirmation and identification. This improves the sensitivity and specificity of the test and gives a significant time saving.\nModified culture methods allowing more rapid detection are commonly used for isolation of respiratory viruses today. Foremost among these methods is shell vial culture, in which the clinical specimen is inoculated onto a cell monolayer that has been grown on a cover slip in a shell vial culture tube. After inoculation the tube is centrifuged at low speed and then incubated. The centrifugation process is thought to make the cells more susceptible to viral infection and thus reduce the detection time. Shell vial culture is used to identify adenoviruses, influenza A & B, parainfluenza viruses and RSV and can achieve time savings of several days, especially when used with immunofluorescence, or molecular confirmation methods. Shell vial cultures containing mixed cells lines, such as R-Mix cells, can also be used as a rapid screening test for respiratory viruses. The technique can reliably detect more than one virus type if combined with several different specific fluorescent antibodies.\nCell culture methods have some major drawbacks. They are often time consuming – although this problem has been overcome to some extent by modified culture techniques – and require highly trained staff in specialised laboratories. Interpretation of results can also be difficult and requires experienced staff. On the other hand, cell culture is relatively sensitive, will detect virus infectivity and allows the result to be quantified.\nElectron microscopy (EM) is now little used for the detection of respiratory viruses in samples or in culture. However, some types, such as parainfluenza viruses, the SARS virus and adenoviruses, have a characteristic appearance and can be presumptively identified by direct examination, using a negative staining technique, or by immuno-electron microscopy, where a specific antibody is used to agglutinate, or to capture virus particles in the sample. EM depends on there being a large number of virus particles (at least 105-106 per gram) present in the sample.\nIn general, rapid methods for the detection of respiratory viruses are based either on immunological, or on molecular techniques.\nThe majority of immunological methods for respiratory viruses are based on antigen detection and employ immunofluorescence, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), or immunochromatography technologies. Direct (DFA) and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) methods are widely used for detection of respiratory viruses. DFA uses a specific labelled antibody to probe for a viral antigen, while IFA uses an unlabelled antibody, followed by a labelled antibody specific to the first probe – allowing some amplification and improved sensitivity. Detection is performed using fluorescence microscopy. Both DFA and IFA methods are quite labour intensive and need highly trained staff, but are very useful techniques for confirming and identifying viruses in clinical samples and in positive cell cultures. A number of commercial products are available, including screening kits for the detection of up to seven different respiratory viruses in culture.\nCommercial immunoassay-based products have also been developed as easy-to-use kits that can be applied at the point-of-care. For example, a wide range of lateral flow immunochromatography test strips is available for the detection of influenza A & B viruses and RSV in clinical samples. These tests offer simplicity in operation and can be performed outside of the laboratory to provide a rapid diagnosis. Their main disadvantages are that they are usually only qualitative tests, have limited sensitivity and cannot distinguish infective viruses.\nImmunoassay methods based on antibody, rather than antigen, detection are also available for the serological detection of respiratory virus infection. For example, enzyme immunoassay kits are available for the detection of serum antibodies to adenoviruses, influenza A & B viruses, parainfluenza 1, 2 & 3 viruses and RSV.\nMost respiratory viruses, apart from adenoviruses and parvoviruses, are RNA viruses, and most molecular techniques therefore rely on detecting specific viral RNA sequences. By focusing on the viral genome, molecular methods can improve specificity and sensitivity significantly.\nThe principal amplification technique used for RNA viruses is reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR). Theoretically, this technique is capable of detecting a single virus within 24 hours. Detection of the amplified sequence may be done at the reaction endpoint, or by continuous monitoring (real-time PCR). Real-time PCR has the advantage of allowing the virus to be quantified.\nA number of commercial applications are available for detection of respiratory viruses, particularly influenza A & B viruses and RSV. Multiplex PCR methods have been developed that allow the detection of more than one nucleic acid sequence, and therefore more than one virus type, in the same assay. Other nucleic acid amplification methods have also been developed, notably nucleic acid sequence base amplification (NASBA). This technique is also known as isothermal amplification, as it does not require the repeated temperature cycling used in conventional PCR methods. A commercial application of NASBA has been developed for metapneumovirus detection.\nThe advantages of PCR and related methods are considerable. The main benefit is time saving – 24 hours to a result rather than several days for a cell culture assay. PCR also requires less operator skill and training to carry out and can be automated to process large numbers of samples. It is also extremely sensitive, although it can be vulnerable to contamination and cannot distinguish infective viruses. Most PCR methods require some costly equipment and are not suitable for use outside the laboratory. Non-quantitative PCR results may also be difficult to interpret, since low numbers of virus that do not signify an infection may be detected, but this problem is largely overcome by real-time PCR.\nThis guide has been prepared by Food Safety Info, scientific and technical information providers for the food industry.

{"question":"Could you please compare the legal implications of China's hukou system with India's domicile laws regarding how they affect children's inheritance of residency status?","answer":"In both systems, children inherit residency status, but in different ways. Under China's hukou system, children automatically inherit their parents' rural or urban status regardless of birthplace - even if born in a city to migrant workers, they still have rural hukou if their parents do. In India's domicile system, legitimate children acquire their father's domicile at birth, illegitimate children acquire their mother's domicile, and foundlings acquire the domicile of the place where they are found. Both systems create hereditary classes but India's system provides more pathways to change domicile status as an adult through domicile by choice, while China's hukou system remains more restrictive.","context":["A hukou is a permit given by the Chinese government which entitles people to live in a certain area and receive government services. It's also one of the most significant social issues in contemporary China, branded by some as a form of apartheid. Under the system, every person is broadly classed as either a rural or an urban resident, and is registered to access government services in the area of their birth and nowhere else. This means that roughly two hundred million of the migrant workers who live in cities and manufacture goods for export to the western world live as second-class citizens, unable to access schools, hospitals or public housing.\nChina's economy has developed rapidly as it has implemented market reforms, and with this development has come a growing divergence between the standard of living and opportunities available to people in the cities and the countryside. There are many advantages to dwelling in the cities, not the least of which is the opportunity to work in the modern part of the economy. Chinese factory jobs may be low-paid and hard, but clearly they're appealing to rural residents or China wouldn't have urbanized so rapidly in the last decade. On top of access to these jobs and a more modern way of life, government services also tend to be better in the cities. Far fewer rural Chinese attend university than do the children of city-dwellers, for instance.\nFactors such as these have underpinned the enormous urbanization that has taken place in China in recent decades. Roughly 50% of the country's population, who themselves make up about one-sixth of humanity, now live in cities. The hukou system is an attempt by the Chinese government to exert some control over the movement of people between the cities and the countryside by obliging rural residents who want to move to the cities to apply for residency permits.\nWe often think of China as having \"gone capitalist\", and it has in many ways. But restrictions such as these on the free movement of people within the country, which are unthinkable somewhere like Britain or the United States (but existed in the Soviet Union), highlight the hybrid system that in fact exists. The Chinese government is trying to manage an enormous process of social and economic change while maintaining Communist Party rule, and it still subordinates the free market to the interests of social stability.\nThe rationale for the hukou system is to discourage too rapid a rate of urbanization and to keep a lid on the cost of government services in the urban areas. China is undergoing one of the largest migrations in the history of humanity, and if the government had to expand its service infrastructure at the same rate then it would quickly collapse. Furthermore, it would be politically difficult to explain to long-term residents of somewhere like Beijing or Shanghai why the quality of their services and the resources available should be rapidly diluted in an attempt to cater to outsiders. Excluding hundreds of millions of new arrivals in the cities from the housing market also keeps a lid on house prices. By making life in the cities harder, it discourages too rapid a rate of migration which might lead to pervasive unemployment and corresponding instability.\nIn reality, however, the hukou system has started to fray at the edges. Technically, the hukou system mandates that Chinese live in the area for which they have a residency permit, but this system has broken down due to the need for cheap labour in the cities. Cities won't grant hukou, but nor will they enforce the residency critieria. Hundreds of millions of Chinese live on the margins of urban society, powering the factories that are pushing the economy forward but unable to access services and living in a precarious legal status that makes them liable to sanctions should they incur the displeasure of the authorities. As their children cannot attend schools in the urban areas (hukou is hereditary, meaning even if you have a child in a city - and good luck finding a hospital, by the way - they still have a rural hukou), they must either stay with relatives in the village, be home-schooled, or attend an illegal school liable to be shut down by the authorities.\nThe hukou hence also serves as a means of social control; urban migrants, a major source of potential social unrest in China, are discouraged from strikes or other actions because they can so easily be sent back from where they came. Furthermore, the Chinese authorities have used hukou as a means to blackmail people into \"good behaviour\" - after riots in the city of Zengcheng earlier this year, the authorities offered hukou to anyone informing on the rioters. The police in Beijing recently temporarily shut down many of the illegal schools used by the children of migrant workers in an apparent attempt to remind them of the precariousness of their existence and encourage them to return to rural areas as the country's economy slows, rather than have them knocking about in the cities where they might be a force for instability.\nReform of hukou has been promised for years, and the need has only grown greater as urbanization continues apace and capitalism continues to generate winners and losers and corresponding inequalities. Nor has it escaped anyone's notice that the class system hukou creates is so at odds with Communist ideology. Some cities are beginning to experiment with reform, offering permits based on a points system. As with so many things in contemporary China, however, the interests weighing against reform - business owners who benefit from cheap labour, residents with urban hukou who don't want to share their services - are formidable. As the system generates an increasing amount of social unrest and ever-more blatant inequalities, eventually something will have to give - the question is what, when, and with what consequences for China's development. Challenges of this magnitude took western economies decades to overcome; don't expect China to be any quicker.","LAW RELATED TO DOMICILE IN INDIA\nChapter 2 of the Succession Act of India describes the Concept of Domicile. It basically has been envisaged for the determination of the civil status of an individual. But the term is confused sometimes either with nationality or with the residence.\nThis article explains the concept of domicile in India.\nRoman Law is considered to be the mother of domicile in Common law. The general view about the term is ‘permanent home’ and it is defined by the case of\nLord Cranworth in Whicker v Hume\n“By ‘domicile’ we mean home, the permanent home, and if you do not understand your permanent home, I am afraid that no illustration drawn from foreign writers or foreign languages will very much help you to it. I think the best I have heard is one which describes the home as the place ‘unde non sit discessurus si nihal avocet; unde cum profectus est, peregrinari videtur.’ I think that it is the best illustration, and I use that word rather than definition, to describe what I mean.”\nIMPORTANCE OF DOMICILE\nDomicile is important for certain reasons as follows:\n- It is a connecting factor for various legal systems.\n- It can be used as a jurisdictional link for the assumption of the jurisdiction and for recognition and assumption of a foreign court’s jurisdiction.\n- It determines an individual’s certain rights like right to vote, right to hold public office, etc.\n- A person can not be without a domicile because it is necessary to connect a person with some legal system to regulate his legal relations.\nPRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE LAW OF DOMICILE\nThere are five fundamental principles which govern the law of domicile, they are as follows:\n1) Nobody shall be without a domicile– By operation of law; a domicile of origin is assigned to every person at the time of his birth, i.e. to a legitimate child, the domicile of the father is assigned, to an illegitimate child the domicile of the mother is assigned, and to a foundling the domicile of place where he is found or discovered, provided nothing is contrary to it is present. This domicile of origin continues until a new domicile i.e. domicile of choice is acquired by the person.\n2) A person cannot have two domiciles simultaneously.\n3) Domicile connects a person with a single system of territorial law but it does not necessarily signify a system that prescribes the same principles for all the classes of persons, like in India versatile rules apply to varied categories of population according to their religion, race or caste.\n4) There is a presumption in favour of the continuance of an existing domicile.\n5) Under English Common Law System, Domicile of a person is to be determined according to the English concept of domicile and not in accordance with the foreign concept of domicile, subject to certain statutory exceptions\nKINDS OF DOMICILE\nDomicile of an individual is characterized as follows:\n- Domicile by origin: Domicile vested with birth of an individual is said to be domicile by origin. There are three cases of domicile acquired by the origin. When a child takes birth, he is either legitimate, or illegitimate, or posthumous. Birth is the first medium through which a person gets in contact with law and environment. Domicile by origin is also called as domicile by birth.\nAccording to Section 7 of the Succession Act of India, 1925, a legitimate child acquires the domicile of his father and a posthumous child acquires the domicile of the deceased father. And according to section 8 of the same act, an illegitimate child acquires the domicile of the mother at the time of his birth.\n- Domicile by choice: On attaining the age of majority, one has the liberty to take and bear responsibilities. He also has the liberty to make his own choice of domicile. A person of a sound mind who is a majority by age can choose to acquire the domicile of a place of his choice when he voluntarily decides to live indefinitely in a place.\nFor an instance, if a person stays in India for one year and wishes to acquire the domicile of India, then he will have to make an official application in a prescribed manner to a designated government department expressing his desire. These instances of domicile by choice are governed by the provisions of Sections 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 of the Succession Act of India, 1925.\n- Domicile by Operation of Law: In this type, domicile of a person is determined by the domicile of another person. It is also called as a domicile by dependence. Three categories of people are recognized whose domicile has to classified by this type. Those are:\n- A minor\n- A married woman\n- A person of unsound mind\nUnder the provisions of sections 14 and 17 of the Succession Act of India, 1925, the domicile of a minor including an adopted child is recognized who are dependent on the domicile of their parents. But there are some exceptions. A child’s domicile may be different from their parents, if:\n- He is married\n- He has set up a business with the consent of his parents\n- He is under the service of the government of India.\nThe provisions of section 18 of the same act talks about the domicile of a person who are legally disabled, in particular, a person of an unsound mind, their domicile is dependent on their parents, guardians, or spouses, if married.\nIn the case of a married women, by the virtue of marriage, they acquire the domicile of their husbands. Whereas, in two instances, the domicile of a married woman may be ceased, firstly, if a court of a competent jurisdiction grants a decree of dissolution of their marriage, then the domicile of the wife automatically no longer remain depend on the husband. Secondly, when the husband serves a prison term, the reliance of the domicile of the wife on the domicile of the husband gets suspended till the time he is released from the prison.\nIt can be concluded that right from the birth of a child, he acquires domicile by any means, but a person cannot be without a domicile as it is a link between a person and Law and environment.\nAuthor: APURVA .,\n3rd Year, Fairfield Institute of Management and Technology, GGSIPU"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:973083e4-4c29-40c3-9b61-ffdfbfe8c0c0>","<urn:uuid:a48f6a77-c875-4da2-a3fa-f57558bf7b6d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do projective techniques in focus groups compare to PLM software in terms of data management and interpretation?","answer":"Projective techniques and PLM software differ in their approach to data management and interpretation. Projective techniques in focus groups face challenges with data credibility due to their inherent subjectivity and the moderator's limited time and knowledge to interpret participant outputs like collages or picture sorts. In contrast, PLM software provides a more structured approach by connecting people, processes, and data across the entire product lifecycle in a central repository, ensuring everyone from designers to end-customers shares the same up-to-date product definition. While projective techniques drift into the realm of clinical psychology with uncertain interpretations, PLM software offers a more transparent and systematic way to manage complex product information.","context":["Projective Techniques: Do We Know What They Are Projecting?\nNovember 15, 2013\nA focus group moderator’s guide will often include group exercises or facilitation techniques as alternative approaches to direct questioning. While many of these alternative tactics are not unique to the group discussion method, and are also used in in-depth interview research, they have become a popular device in focus groups, esp., in the marketing research field. These alternative approaches can be broadly categorized as either enabling or projective techniques, the difference being whether the moderator’s intent is to simply modify a direct question to make it easier for group participants to express their opinions (enabling techniques) or delve into participants’ less conscious, less rational, less socially-acceptable feelings by way of indirect exercises (projective techniques). Examples of enabling techniques are: sentence completion – e.g., “When I think of my favorite foods, I think of _____.” or “The best thing about the new city transit system is _____.”; word association – e.g., asking prospective college students, “What is the first word you think of when I say, ‘first day of college’?” or asking hospital administrators, “When I say ‘patient care’, what is the first word or words that come to mind?”; and storytelling – e.g., “Tell me a story about the last time you made something for dinner using leftovers.”\nProjective techniques serve to depersonalize the discussion by moving away from direct questions specific to the research topic and instead ask participants to project their feelings by imagining the thoughts of others, role playing, and describing visual stimuli (such as images). Completing thought bubbles on a cartoon drawing depicting genderless characters, and selecting from a stack of photographs the images that best represent how participants feel about a topic are just two examples of projective techniques.\nThe use of projective techniques is especially rampant among marketing researchers who increasingly (with the growing capabilities of online research) devise new variations of projective exercises. However, from a quality-design perspective, the use of projective techniques can be problematic and begs the question of whether or how much projective techniques bring added value to the group discussion. While enabling techniques are extensions of direct questioning that fall within the researcher’s natural skill set, the indirect method of projective exercises drifts into the little-known realm, among many social science researchers, of clinical psychology. Regardless of whether focus group participants are given the opportunity to explain their own interpretation of their thought bubble, drawing, or picture sort – or whether the interpretation is left for the researcher – the inherent subjectivity of the meanings that are ultimately associated with participants’ output threatens the validity of these techniques.\nThe credibility of qualitative research data partially rests on knowing what is being measured, yet the short duration of a focus group session – and the moderator’s limited depth of knowledge about the participants – may make true interpretations of the data (and linkages back to the research objectives) from projective techniques a challenge. What, for example, has the researcher measured from a collage exercise resulting in a collection of seemingly unrelated images from each of 10 group participants? The moderator can investigate each participant’s interpretation of their “artwork” but the reality is that the focus group moderator does not have the capability of knowing whether the collage exercise tapped into an unconscious realization important to the research objectives, or knowing if the exercise measured aspects of the participant related to (for example) motivations, cultural background, or social awareness.\nTo maximize the credibility of focus group data stemming from the use of enabling and projective techniques, researchers must carefully select which techniques to use based on their ability to interpret the results in conjunction with the in-session time the moderator will be able to give to these exercises. For instance, the researcher might opt for a smaller discussion format, such as dyads and triads, in order to accommodate the necessary time to complete a projective technique, such as a picture sort, including a thorough examination of each participant’s reasons for the photographs he or she selected as well as those that were rejected. The careful use of these techniques will not only enhance data credibility but also increase the overall quality of the research by allowing the researcher to perform necessary verification procedures (such as triangulation) in the analysis phase.","Pass on changes\nReal time Monitoring\nNew product introduction\nEngineering change management\nControl R&D Budgets\nCAD Drawing Management\nReduce developmet expenses\nMinimise financial risks\nEliminate process bottlenecks\nReduce products and service costs\nKeep system transparent\nListen to Complains\n1.

They may also be used for changes in specifications. Lastly, it can be \"a modification that will have an effect on a manufactured product or manufacturing process ECOs are also called an \"engineering change note\", engineering change notice (ECN), or just an engineering change (EC). In a typical system development cycle, the specification or the implementation is likely to change during engineering development or during integration of the system elements. These last-minute design changes are commonly referred to as engineering change orders (ECOs) and affect the functionality of a design after it has been wholly or partially completed. ECOs can compensate for design errors found during debug or changes that are made to the design specification to compensate for design problems in other areas of the system design. When improperly managed, engineering change orders can vastly increase costs.\nWhat is Reliability Engineering in PLM?.\nReliability engineering consists of the systematic application of time-honored engineering principles and techniques throughout a product lifecycle and is thus an essential component of a good Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) program.\nReliability engineering is a sub-discipline of systems engineering that emphasizes the ability of equipment to function without failure. Reliability describes the ability of a system or component to function under stated conditions for a specified period of time.\nReliability engineering focuses on costs of failure caused by system downtime, cost of spares, repair equipment, personnel, and cost of warranty claims.\nWhen repair is undertaken, the ease with which it is brought back into operation reflects, in some measure, the maintainability character of the equipment. If breakdowns are less frequent and/or maintainability is high, the availability will also be high.\nMany systems can be repaired when they fail. This brings into the fore the concepts of maintainability, system availability, time to repair etc.\nWhile quality normally refers to the specification of performance and conformance to accepted national and international codes, reliability specifically refers to how these are maintained during the service life of the equipment.\n• The overall reliability of a product consists of the following :\ni) Design/Technological reliability\nii) Manufacturing reliability\niii) Use reliability\n• Since manufacturing and end use follow the design process, they can be at best preserve the design reliability; often the reliability reduces at these stages.\n• In other words, the basic design reliability is the in-herent reliability of the product. Hence, design forms the most important part in ensuring the reliability of the product.\nWhat are benefits of implementing Reliability Engineering in PLM?.\n• Favorable company reputation • Improved Customer satisfaction\n(unreliable product would severely affect customer satisfaction)\n• Reduced Warranty costs and unwanted Negative attention\n• Repeat business\n• Lower life time cost (as the product would require fewer repairs or less maintenance)\n• Competitive advantage\n• Extended equipment life\n• Improved employee safety\n• Better process stability\n• Customer requirements (some customers may demand that their suppliers have an effective reliability program) ,\nWhat ERP should measure and give for implementing Reliability Engineering in PLM?.\n• Capability : The quality of the intended function. Determines the quality of the product or service .\n• Reliability : Performance with time The ability to perform a required function under stated conditions during a required period of time.\n• Maintainability : The ease of retaining or restoring a required function in given time. Determines necessary time and resources for maintenance\n• Maintenance support : Resources in manpower, manuals, instruments, tools , replacement units , spare parts and commodities available for maintenance.\n• Availability : The resulting operative ability to perform a required function when needed = fraction “up-time”.\n• Failure time (t): Age of the item at which some clearly defined event called “failure” occurs\n• Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) for non-repairable systems\n• Mean Time Between Failures for repairable systems (MTBF) , valid only for exponentially distributed data. Reciprocal of Failure Rate (Hazard Rate). This term is normally applied to a product.\n• Reliability Probability (survival) R(t)\n• Failure Probability (cumulative density function ) F(t)=1-R(t)\n• Failure Probability Density f(t)\n• Failure Rate (hazard rate) λ(t) or h(t) = No. of failures per unit of time of operation, expressed as a proportion of the initial population. It denotes the ratio of number of failures to the total number of operating hours (or some other unit of time). This term is normally applied to a component.\n• Mean residual life (MRL)\n• Hazard rate (or instantaneous failure rate) : No. of failures per unit of time , expressed as a proportion of the survival population."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4b38e8b6-72b0-4253-bd3c-66156dc7d7d2>","<urn:uuid:4113a4bf-a55d-4b19-beb6-61f9f48cee60>"],"error":null}

According to observations from Atlantic City Check Cashing, customers include various demographics such as Black, Latino, and white individuals who cash paychecks, government assistance checks, and wire money. The CFPB has found that consumers in low-income and majority-Black neighborhoods pay disproportionately more in credit card late fees.

In the interests of customization, firms should be free to charge more to add mushrooms to your pizza or to upgrade you to a hotel room with an ocean view. However, in recent years we’ve seen a proliferation of “junk fees” – a category of fees that serve a different purpose. They can be defined as fees designed either to confuse or deceive consumers or to take advantage of lock-in or other forms of situational market power.\nAcademic research and agency experience suggest the following fees and fee practices fall within this category:\n- Mandatory fees that often hide the full price. Some sellers publish a low price and then add mandatory fees later, at the “back-end” of the buying process or when a consumer tries to terminate the service. As the research shows, by hiding the full price, this practice can lead consumers to pay more than they would otherwise, and it also makes it hard for consumers to comparison shop. An example is the “service fees” added to the cost of a ticket to a concert or sporting event.\n- Surprise fees that consumers learn about after purchase. Surprise fees that consumers do not expect – and which may not be mandatory – similarly make it hard to comparison shop and can burden household finances. Surprise hospital bills from out-of-network doctors at in-network hospitals and airline “family seating fees” are prominent examples.\n- Exploitative or predatory fees. Excessive fees that target consumers who have limited alternative options – because they are locked into a product or service, or are otherwise economically vulnerable – can likewise impose a financial burden. As the CFPB explains, a sign of exploitative fees is that they “far exceed the marginal cost of the service they purport to cover.” Bank overdraft fees, which greatly exceed the bank’s cost of credit, and surprise “termination fees” are leading examples.\n- Fraudulent fees. Some fees involve outright fraud or misrepresentations on the part of the seller. An example is advertising a “no fee” bank account that in practice carries significant fees.\nThe economic issues with “junk fees”\nMarkets work when firms compete on an even playing field – displaying prices to consumers in a fair and transparent manner. Mandatory hidden fees risk obscuring the full price, making it harder for consumers to comparison shop – to choose their preferred product and the best deal. These fees can also create an uneven playing field for businesses, making firms that price in a fair and transparent manner seem more expensive than their rivals.\nSurprise termination and cancellation fees can harm free and fair competition by increasing switching costs – locking consumers into sub-standard products. Larger switching costs also make it harder for new entrants and more innovative firms to win over market share – reducing market dynamism.\nActions that limit or disallow junk fees have the potential to create more efficient markets by requiring firms to compete on the merits by offering a lower (actual) price or a better product or service. In cases where the junk fee is unjustified, banning the practice outright can reduce firms’ incentives to engage in “exploitative innovation” – developing new junk fees rather than improving the actual quality of the product.\nJunk Fees Hit Consumers – and Businesses – in the Pocketbook\nFees account for tens of billions of dollars in revenue – a substantial source of revenue in many industries, including transportation, banking, internet, and hospitality. A sampling of some fee categories where junk fees appear to make up significant fee revenue include:\n|Credit card late payment fees:||$12 billion in 2020 (CFPB estimate)|\n|Bank overdraft and non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees:|\n$15.5 billion in 2019 (CFPB estimate)\nHotel resort fees:\n$2.93 billion in 2018 (NYU estimate)\n|Airline baggage and change fees:||$5.97 billion in 2021 (DOT statistics)|\n|Cable hidden fees:||$28 billion in 2019 (Consumer Reports estimate)|\nStudies also show that these fees can artificially inflate total prices. In highly competitive markets where firms earn razor-thin margins, junk fees may not raise the total amount consumers pay. The reason is that firms will face competitive pressure to offset junk fee revenue with a lower upfront price. However, many markets are not highly competitive, and in these settings, junk fees can cause American consumers to pay more.\nA large body of evidence shows that mandatory fees charged at the back-end of the buying process – sometimes referred to as “drip” prices – along with other types of junk fees make it harder to comparison shop. This causes consumers to underestimate the total price of what they’re buying, often increasing total payments. Among other findings:\n- An experimental study by Rasch et al. (2020) found that drip pricing raised firm profits and resulted in consumers paying more than they would if firms were required to charge a single all-inclusive price up front. A series of experimental studies by Santana et al. (2020) similarly found that drip prices caused consumers to pick products with higher total costs.\n- An empirical study by Ellison and Ellison (2009) of online sales of computer parts found that sellers used hidden fees to obfuscate actual prices and avoid price competition.\n- A study by Agarwal et al. (2014) found that fee regulation can lower total costs if the fee is unclear – as is the case with drip pricing and other hidden fees – and the market is not perfectly competitive.\n- An empirical paper by Agarwal et al. (2015) found that regulation of credit card fees saved consumers $11.9 billion per year in borrowing costs, with the largest impact on the lowest credit score borrowers.\nConfusing or coercive fee practices risk harming not only consumers, but also small and medium-sized businesses, which can be targeted by the same kind of fee schemes – including surprise fees and unexpected cancellation charges. For example, common carrier industries – industries that provide essential services to dependent businesses – like ocean carriers sometimes use hidden and confusing fee practices to muddy the prices paid. Some shippers that rely on ocean carriers to ship their goods to market report that unpredictable fees added to a base price more than doubled the total price they paid for ocean shipping, and these costs are often ultimately passed along to consumers.\nJunk Fees Hit Low-Income Households and People of Color the Hardest\nWhile the extra costs of junk fees affect everyone, they disproportionately impact lower income households and people of color. For example:\n- A CFPB study found that consumers in low-income and majority-Black neighborhoods paid disproportionately more in credit card late fees.\n- A survey by the Financial Health Network found low- to moderate-income households incurred overdraft fees at nearly twice the rate of high-income households and that Black and Hispanic households were charged overdraft fees at substantially higher rates than white households.\n- A 2017 report by the National Consumer Law Center found that Hispanic car buyers paid more in costly add-ons – such as service contracts, insurance, and window etching – than non-Hispanic car buyers.\nThe Biden-Harris Administration is Taking Action on Junk Fees\nIn response to President Biden’s call to action, all Competition Council federal agencies are looking for ways to reduce or lower junk fees. While in some cases more work is needed to identify and understand unjustified practices, federal agencies are acting now in places where there is a compelling case to reduce or eliminate fees – and taking comment and engaging stakeholders where greater transparency and data will help to improve regulatory approaches going forward. To date, the Administration has already taken a number of actions that will save consumers and businesses billions of dollars:\n- Eliminating unfair banking fees. Today, the CFPB issued guidance explaining that two junk fee practices are unfair and unlawful – effectively banning both. First, the CFPB is making clear that surprise overdraft fees are unlawful. These are fees charged for overdrawing a checking account even though at the time the account owner made a purchase, the bank’s website or ATM terminal showed the customer that they had sufficient available funds for the purchase. Second, the CFPB is making clear that surprise depositor fees are unlawful. These are fees charged to customers who deposit someone else’s bounced check, penalizing the victim. Together, these actions will save consumers more than $1 billion annually.\n- Additional CFPB actions on bank and credit card fees. The CFPB is developing rules and guidance on other fees charged by banks and credit card companies. These fees cost consumers more than $24 billion a year combined, with the biggest impacts on low-income Americans. This builds on work CFPB began last year that successfully encouraged 15 of the nation’s twenty largest banks to drop the use of NSF charges, and Citi and Capital One ended the use overdraft fees altogether. As a result, the overall level of overdraft fees is already on track to be down 20% in 2022 from 2019 levels – $3 billion less compared to pre-pandemic.\n- Taking aim at bad junk fee practices that span industries. Last week, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) voted to launch a rulemaking process that would broadly reduce junk fee practices across the economy, including for event ticketing, hotels, funeral homes, and any other industry that uses mandatory fees. The rulemaking would address practices such as charging consumers fees they never consented to or charging mandatory fees with little or no added value, like hotel resort fees or event ticket processing fees. This action is an important step towards a future rule that would give the FTC additional information and enforcement tools to take action and seek penalties against companies adopting unfair and deceptive junk fees. This action builds upon the FTC’s work bringing multiple enforcement actions challenging junk fees across a variety of industries and returning money to injured consumers. In the auto industry, the FTC charged dealerships like Passport Auto and Napleton for tacking on junk fees for unwanted add-ons and other items. FTC took action against Benefytt Technologies to halt its practice of charging people separate fees for add-on health products that people didn’t know about or want. In First American Payment Systems, the FTC charged that the payment processing company trapped small businesses with surprise early termination fees.\n- Restricting Junk Fees Charged by Auto Dealers. This June, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a proposed rule that would restrict junk fee practices by car dealers that are costly and frustrating for consumers. The rule, if finalized, would (1) ban bait-and-switch claims by prohibiting dealers from making deceptive advertising claims to lure in prospective car buyers; (2) prohibit fraudulent add-on products (such as “nitrogen filled” tires that contain no more nitrogen than normal air); (3) prevent dealers from charging consumers surprise fees for an add-on without their clear, written consent; and (4) mandate upfront disclosure of costs and conditions by requiring dealers to make disclosures to consumers like proving a “true offering price” for a vehicle.\n- Requiring Airlines and Airline Search Sites to Disclose Fees Up Front. In September, the Department of Transportation (DOT) proposed a rule that would protect travelers by ensuring they know the full price of airline tickets before they buy. The rule, if finalized as proposed, will require airlines and online search sites to disclose up front – while you are comparison shopping – any fees to sit next to your child, for baggage, and for changes or cancellations. The proposal seeks to provide customers the information they need to choose the actual best deal, preventing surprise fees that add up quickly and prevent competition on the basis of price. This builds on previous actions the DOT has recently taken, including issuing proposed rules that would require airlines to refund fees for checked bags that are significantly delayed and for services not actually provided (like broken WiFi), and to require refunds for delayed and cancelled flights.\n- Requiring Broadband Nutrition Labels. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has issued proposed rules that would, if finalized as proposed, require internet companies to display a standardized “Broadband Nutrition Label” that discloses their monthly prices, fees, and internet speeds – so customers can see which company is cheapest and companies will have to compete for business. The FCC anticipates completing this rulemaking by the end of this year.\n- Reducing the Cost of Shipping Goods. Congress responded to President Biden’s call to crack down on excessive fees in ocean shipping by passing the bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act. The Federal Maritime Commission, which is responsible for implementing the law, recently released a proposed rule that proposes to bring more clarity, structure, and punctuality to ocean shipping fee billing practices.\n In its recent Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Federal Trade Commission defines “junk fees” as “unfair or deceptive fees that are charged for goods or services that have little or no added value to the consumer, including goods or services that consumers would reasonably assume to be included within the overall advertised price; the term also encompasses ‘hidden fees,’ which are fees for goods or services that are deceptive or unfair, including because they are disclosed only at a later stage in the consumer’s purchasing process or not at all, whether or not the fees are described as corresponding to goods or services that have independent value to the consumer.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0255ea02-654d-459f-af73-2f8eb852bb0b>","<urn:uuid:5e915f0c-9249-4c7a-a3b3-cef924906518>"],"error":null}
