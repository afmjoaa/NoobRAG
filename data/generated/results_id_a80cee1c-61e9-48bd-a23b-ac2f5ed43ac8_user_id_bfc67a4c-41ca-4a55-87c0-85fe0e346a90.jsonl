{"question":"What's the combined environmental and social impact of food waste - does this really affect both hunger and sustainability in significant ways?","answer":"Food waste has severe environmental and social impacts. In the United States alone, $218 billion is wasted on growing, processing, transporting, and disposing of food that is never eaten, while simultaneously 15 million households are food insecure and uncertain about providing adequate food for their families. The environmental burden is significant, as resources are consumed in producing and transporting uneaten food. Globally, this issue is so critical that it led to the creation of a specific SDG target for food waste reduction, recognizing that fixing the food system requires addressing food waste. The impact is particularly concerning given that new findings suggest consumer-level food waste may be twice as high as previously estimated, with 931 million tonnes of food wasted in 2019 across household, food service, and retail sectors.","context":["In the United States, 40% of the food produced is never eaten, which results in massive economic, environmental and social ramifications. According to ReFED, approximately $218 billion is wasted on growing, processing, transporting and disposing food that is never eaten. The consequences of food waste are not just economic, either; many resources were consumed in producing and transporting this uneaten food.\nThe planet is left bearing the majority of the burden on food waste. Meanwhile, 15 million households in the United States are food insecure, meaning these households are uncertain if they would be able to provide food that meets the needs of their families, due to insufficient funds or other resources. With the demonstrated consequences in food waste space and the potential to increase food security across the country, something should be done.\nPhotograph courtesy of Matthew Hollis\nThe grocery industry has come under recent fire for its food waste problem. Supermarkets discard approximately 43 billion pounds of food a year. While grocery franchises may be part of the challenge when it comes to food waste, they can also become a part of the solution. After conducting an initial waste audit, best practices for food waste-savvy grocers include benchmarking your company’s food waste to know where to prioritize efforts, initiating an imperfect produce program, standardizing date labels, and communicating with suppliers to update frequency and reduce the size of orders.\nHowever, when food has ultimately reached the end of its life span at the grocery store, grocers can still do their part in diverting this waste from the landfill by donating to local food banks or composting it. Ultimately, food waste reduction efforts will benefit the grocer’s bottom line, the food insecure and the environment.\nDo you know how much your store throws away? It’s important to do preliminary benchmarking of your waste volumes to create a baseline. Without this important data, it will be difficult to determine the efficacy of any initiatives you decide to implement. There are several online resources to help you conduct a waste audit, but be prepared to get your hands dirty to understand your company’s waste stream. With this information, you can forecast future volumes and find opportunities to reclaim the value in your waste.\nImperfect Produce Program\nMany grocers discard perfectly edible produce that does not meet visual standards. However, these items can still be eaten, rather than being wasted in a landfill. Many consumers are still willing to purchase these items at a discount. For example, Kroger recently launched an imperfect produce program through Pickuliar Picks and found that customers have no problem selecting misshapen or irregularly sized produce when given the option. Do some research and see if your grocery franchise is able to incorporate a program like this to maximize the value in your produce inventory.\nDate Label Standardization\nOne common issue that leads to food waste is the nonstandard use of date labels. Current practices on food packaging cause confusion with “Sell by,” “Best by,” “Use by,” and “Best before” dates, leading up to 90% of Americans to occasionally throw out still-fresh food. There is no mandatory governmental regulation when it comes to labeling food products. In May 2019, the Food and Drug Administration supported the voluntary use of “best if used by” to reflect the manufacturer’s estimate at optimal quality rather than safety. Confusion over the meaning of date labels is estimated to account for 20% of consumer waste of safe, edible food. This equates to approximately $29 billion of wasted consumer spending each year; 5% to 10% of this is expected to be impacted by standardized date labels.\nAs food date labels become more consistent, consumer education campaigns will become more effective with the eliminated confusion. As a grocer, supporting manufacturers that use standardized date labels will help in food waste reduction.\nWhile conventional wisdom states that consumers will buy more if the shelves are overstocked, this practice can be incredibly wasteful and is in many cases no longer accurate. In one study, when Stop & Shop analyzed its overstocking practices, the company found overfilled displays not only led to spoilage on the shelf but also could displease customers due to spoiled product and require more staff handling to sort out the damaged items. In its study, customer satisfaction actually increased when shelves were not overstocked.\nGrocers can better manage their inventory to prevent perishables from spoiling before they can be purchased by the consumer. When ordering less, grocers are not only saving themselves money but also are sparing the environment the cost to produce and ship the wasted food.\nWhile it is crucial to reduce the amount of potential food waste from the source, there will likely still be some residual food left on shelves. When these products are ending their life span in the grocery, several organizations will still accept safe, edible food. Since 1996, the Federal Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act encourages the donation of food and grocery products to nonprofit organizations for distribution to individuals in need. This law prevents individuals and organizations from liability in food donation. Food banks and other nonprofits gladly accept donations to feed America’s food-insecure households. Grocers can feel confident knowing their unsold products can be used to feed the hungry, rather than contribute to landfill volumes.\nWhen waste is considered an asset rather than a necessary byproduct of operations, stores can begin to harness the true value within their waste stream. After conducting a preliminary waste audit, stores can begin to find missed opportunities to save money in their trash. Also, an imperfect produce program can allow customers to select “ugly” fruit and decrease the amount of edible food being thrown away. Evaluate how date labels are informing consumer purchasing and disposal habits, and reduce order sizes to prevent perishables from spoiling prior to being purchased. Finally, edible food that is no longer able to be sold can still be diverted from the landfill through food bank donation.\nReducing food waste across every store in the operation requires a firm commitment from all staff members to cutting costs and finding utility in new places. In the end, food waste reduction efforts will benefit your bottom line, the food insecure and the environment.\nMatt Hollis is the founder and president of Elytus, an industry leader in food waste sustainability.","Just how much of global food production are we wasting annually?\nIt’s a simple question, but a complex topic, and the answer is, it depends. Are we talking about food loss, food waste, or both together? And what elements of each? In what sectors?\nA newly released report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the Food Waste Index Report 2021, provides a wealth of important new information on the food waste component, while at the same time reminding us of the criticality of terminology to avoid misunderstanding. Words and definitions matter, especially regarding research and conversations on global food loss and waste – and without continued focus and sharp messaging we risk confusing stakeholders despite opposite intentions.\nFor quick background, we use a lot of terms in this area, such as food loss, food waste, food wastage, excess food, excess edible food, edible parts, inedible parts, and more. And we can go further and distinguish between food waste reduction and food waste prevention, and recovery and diversion.\nGenerally, we get more specific when delving deeper into causes of food loss and food waste in seeking to develop effective, targeted solutions for them. We typically use the term “food loss” to denote the amount of annual food production that goes to waste (i.e. food that is not consumed by humans) between farm and market. Often this is discussed with a focus on less developed countries, where food is lost after harvest due to inadequate storage facilities and/or poor transportation infrastructure. To some degree this definition implies that the loss of food was beyond the control of relevant stakeholders (i.e. it was unintentional).\nSimilarly, we often speak of “food waste” with a focus on developed countries, where much food is wasted after it reaches the market – in consumer-facing businesses (ex. supermarkets, distributors, foodservice operators and restaurants) and/or in the homes of consumers. There’s a greater element of responsibility here, with a connotation that the waste of the food could have been avoided as a result of different actions or behavior on the part of consumers.\nSome use the term “food wastage” to denote food loss and food waste together, while others often simply use the term “food waste” when speaking of the combined figure.\nAnd additional terms come into play when researching and measuring food loss and waste to differentiate between edible and inedible food components.\nAll of these terms matter, especially with regard to measurement, because the clearer we can be about 1) how much food loss and waste occurs throughout the food supply chain, 2) where it occurs, and 3) why it occurs – the better we can be at devising interventions and longer-term solutions while also measuring and reporting on progress (or lack thereof).\nStepping up a level\nIt’s also important to communicate accurate, high-level measures on food loss and waste (including a combined figure) to global citizens and policymakers in order to continue to advance the progress on food waste reduction efforts over the last decade, and more importantly, to rapidly accelerate national and global plans and actions designed to achieve the Target 12.3 goal of halving global food loss and waste by 2030.\nIn many ways, the world has awakened to the gravity of the global food waste challenge, anchored by a seminal report from FAO in 2011 that estimated that roughly one-third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted across the globe, about 1.3 billion tonnes annually. Other reports suggest higher figures, but the world has largely coalesced around a figure of 33% of annual food production being lost or wasted.\nOn the plus side, high concern over the scale of that level of wastage, coupled with widespread global hunger and the extreme environmental and social externalities associated with food loss and waste, led to the creation of a specific SDG target related to food waste reduction as well as recognition that fixing the food system requires fixing food waste.\nOn the negative side, the widely cited 33% figure is so large that it can seem daunting to many individuals, leaving them feeling powerless as to what they as individuals can due to impact it. And if they feel powerless, they are unlikely to act.\nBoth reactions are important. There is no question that the world must come together to cut food loss and waste with urgency, and at the same time, we must connect with individuals (particularly in developed countries) such that they place a higher value on food – changing behavior to waste less, influencing others to do the same, and raising expectations for responsible behavior among food organizations.\nIn essence, we need to transition from our current developed-world culture of abundance which creates excessive waste to a culture of responsibility which wastes much less. And at the same time, we must address food losses – especially in less developed regions — through the transfer of knowledge, tools, technology and financing.\nNew findings, new messaging\nIn the continued quest for greater accuracy to guide research, measurement and interventions, FAO and UNEP have been working on two new indices – the Food Loss Index and the Food Waste Index – to update the “one-third” finding of the previously-mentioned FAO report.\nThe new UNEP report reflects what the authors note is “the most comprehensive food waste data collection, analysis and modelling effort” to this point. By combining estimates of food waste for every country in the world (including estimates based on extrapolations for countries without primary data), the authors determined that 931 million tonnes of available food were wasted in 2019 across the three sectors studied (61% of that waste stemmed from households, while 26% stemmed from food service operations and 13% came from the retail sector).\nSignificantly, that leads to a new estimate for global food waste of 17%.\nThe report included several other key findings:\n- Household per capita food waste was found to be similar across country income groups; significant in that it challenges the notion that food waste in the home is largely a developed world problem (and suggesting the need for further study of household food waste in lower income countries)\n- Global food waste at the consumer level could be significantly higher than prior estimates (perhaps twice as high)\n- Additional data is needed on the level of edible versus inedible food across country groups to guide food waste reduction and diversion interventions\nSo the report has indeed created valuable new learnings while laying the foundation for more detailed measurement across countries to more effectively shape national strategies and policy interventions to advance progress toward Target 12.3.\nAnd now we come back to the importance of terminology, and why it is important to clarify messaging related to the reported 17% figure for global food waste.\nUnfortunately, it may be easy for many global citizens to view the new 17% figure in an overly positive light, because most individuals are now accustomed to a 33% figure for global food waste (even though many are unaware of the combined loss and waste nature of that figure).\nFor example, shortly after the release of the new report, I was asked if the level of global food waste had suddenly been found to be half the amount of prior estimates. Further, in a subsequent call, a speaker casually used the 17% figure while seemingly referring to food loss and waste together. And headlines that once mentioned “one third of food going to waste” now have been replaced with “one fifth.” They may be more accurate in terms of “food waste” alone, but it is likely that many of the writers (and millions of readers) lack the in-depth understanding of the difference.\nAnd, significantly, while the release of the new 17% food waste figure may inadvertently convey a decline in the minds of some, the report notes that prior estimates of consumer food waste may be significantly understated. In fact, as noted above, food waste at the consumer level may be twice as high as prior estimates.\nSo what seems like less could in fact be more.\nThinking deeper, one might quickly gravitate to the idea of adding the new 17% food waste figure from the Food Waste Index report to the 14% food loss figure (from FAO’s 2019 report, The State of Food and Agriculture: Moving Forward on Food Loss and Waste Reduction) in order to come to a new combined figure for global food loss and waste. Doing so would yield a figure of 31%, which on the surface might make sense compared to the traditional one-third (i.e. 33%) combined estimate.\nBut such a compilation isn’t accurate, and as report co-author Hamish Forbes noted, the team is not encouraging it due to differences in the composition of the two figures (i.e. it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison). As the report states, there are scope differences – the food loss index (FLI) includes losses for “multiple utilizations” of food (i.e. food, feed, seed, and others), while the food waste index (FWI) focuses on consumer food waste (i.e. final food products exclusive of animal feed and seed). Further, there are differences in the definitions of the two estimates – the FWI includes inedible parts, while the FLI focuses only on edible parts.\nIdeally, we would be able to combine the two indicators, and FAO and UNEP are working on developing such a clean summation of food loss and waste. Doing so will provide a new and consistent reference point to guide the global conversation on food loss and waste, essentially replacing the 33% frame that most individuals had centered upon.\nAction from clarity\nIn the interim, despite the need for messaging on the twin components of food loss and waste (essentially to avoid an incorrect re-set to 17% as a combined figure in the minds of many), there are many positives to draw on from the new Food Waste Index. The report:\n- Provides a new, more accurate estimate of global food waste at the consumer level\n- Shows that consumer food waste is likely much higher than previously estimated\n- Indicates that consumer food waste at lower income levels warrants further study\n- Reinforces the importance of, and need for, accurate measurement of food loss and waste\n- Reflects the importance of getting increasingly granular to maximize the effectiveness of policy interventions\n- Prompts countries to develop national food loss and waste reduction strategies\n- Lays the foundation for an updated combined global food loss and waste figure\n- Highlights some data gaps for further research\nThere is an important timing element here as well, in my opinion. I believe the new report can provide a spark to re-energize food loss and waste reduction efforts globally following a challenging pandemic year which seemed to derail the momentum with which we entered this critical Decade of Action.\nMoreover, the future release of a new combined metric, perhaps with a term (food wastage?) that clearly denotes the summation of food loss and food waste components can, in my view, provide a new centering point for 1) education on the scale and impact of global food loss and waste, 2) heightened commitment for policy interventions and national reduction strategies to reduce food loss and waste, and 3) a heightened level of meaningful collaboration between nations to address food loss and waste with a focus on achieving the 50% reduction goal by 2030.\nAfter all, food loss and waste isn’t a problem unique to specific nations, it is truly a global problem with massive hunger, health, climate, and security implications. And while it is too early to predict, my bet is that if consumer food waste (which as the original ReFED report indicated is such a large portion of food waste in developed countries like the U.S.) is significantly higher than previously estimated, it is likely that the new combined figure for global food loss and waste will be higher than the prior 33% estimate.\nIn any case, as Hamish Forbes noted, one big takeaway from the report involves the notion of agency. As consumers, we can all take actions to reduce the amount of food we waste. The better we understand where and how we contribute to food waste, the better we can change our behavior. And that’s important, because as WRAP noted in this recent post, the “unpalatable truth about food waste” is that it is “everywhere.”\nSo let’s look forward to the future release of a combined figure for global food loss and waste from FAO and UNEP.\nAnd in the interim, let’s all be clear on terminology, and caution fellow stakeholders that the combined level of global food loss and waste didn’t suddenly get much better.\n2030, the date by which the world seeks to cut global food waste in half, is just nine years off.\nWe all still have a lot of hard, necessary, rewarding work to do on food loss and waste reduction.\n*Thanks to Richard Swannell and Hamish Forbes of WRAP for informative exchanges regarding the Food Waste Index report."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1e9939ea-139c-462b-bde7-5fb2e966a27c>","<urn:uuid:7dcce914-4db5-4566-9842-f66c9dcce251>"],"error":null}

This helps in choosing the right metal for different applications. So let us learn more about the properties of metals in this article. At the end of this article, you will get a link for Properties of metals PDF, which you can download for your future reference.\nWhat is properties of metals\nProperties of metals can be defined as the unique and distinctive features that every metal owns. Every material has its special quality and characteristics. Some properties are available in the raw form of metals, and different processes like heat treatment can modify some to suit process needs.\nDifferent Types Of Properties Of Metals\nFrankly speaking, the properties of metals is a very vast subject. Covering each and every property may be out of the scope of this article. So in this article, we will only focus on only basic and main properties that you should know.\nBelow are few main and basic types properties of metals.\n- Physical Properties\n- Electrical Properties\n- Thermal Properties\n- Chemical Properties\n- Magnetic Properties\nYou may also like to read: Properties of fluids\nPhysical Properties Of Metals\nMechanical properties of metals or physical properties of metals can be defined as the natural behavior of metals under different loading conditions. It is the property of metals that offers resistance to failure when it is exposed to real-life applications.\nWhen metals are exposed to load, it gets stressed. If you increase the load, metals get more stressed and the state of metals also gets changed. In different states metals have different properties.\nHere are couple of mechanical properties of metals.\nThe ductility of metals can be defined as the property of metals to form into different shapes like wire. The metal gets elongated before it fails.\nDuctility is an important property of metals. If the metal is not ductile you can not give it a different shape which means that it will have limited real-life applications. The ductility of metals can be improved by different heat treatment techniques.\nToughness is the property of metals that absorb energy and plastically deform without fracturing. Toughness required metals to be ductile as well as strong.\nThe toughness of metals can be defined as the energy per unit volume that it can absorb before failure. A typical application of tougher material is turret press, hammer, power press, etc.\nHardness is the property of metal to resist local plastic deformation due to mechanical indentation or abrasion .\nThe hardness of metal depends on its ductility, plasticity, elasticity, and toughness. There are usually three ways, hardness can be measured for a metal.\n- Scratch hardness\n- Indentation hardness\n- Rebound hardness\nBrittleness is the property of a metal to resist fracture. Usually, if a metal is less ductile, it is more brittle. Brittle metals it has a little elastic or plastic deformation. When more load is applied it easily gets fractured.\nElasticity is the property of metals that helps metals to regain its shape when the load is removed. We all know that metals deform when an external load is applied. But when that load is removed metals should go back to their original shape and that is called elasticity.\nMost of the cutting tools have a certain level of elastic properties. Those tools have a limit of load that you can apply. Beyond that, the tool will go into permanent deformation and won’t go back to the actual shape. Elasticity is a very critical property of the metal. Without elastic property, metals will easily fracture with a very minimum load.\nWhen metals go beyond its elastic limit, it goes into the plastic limit. So plasticity is the property of metals that keeps the metal in the plastic state without permanent deformation. Even if you remove the load, the metal won’t be able to go back to its original shape. But at the same time, there is no permanent deformation or fracture.\nMost of the sheet metal operations like shearing, bending, etc is possible due to the good plasticity of sheet metal. Most of the rolling and forging operations are also done when the metal is in a plastic state.\nStiffness is the rigidity of metals. What that means is that even with extreme load those metals won’t deform. So stiffer metals won’t be having any elasticity of plasticity. Sometimes you need metals to be stiffer. For example, machine beds. Machine beds need to be stiffer as you don’t expect them to deform. If it does deform then it will affect the machine’s accuracy and alignment.\nDid you notice how old the mechanical clock used to store energy? Old mechanical clocks use a spring that stores energy. So the property due to which the spring metals could store energy is called resilience. More the resilience, the more it can store energy and absorb impact strength.\nResilience is measured as the amount of energy it can store in a unit volume of metals. Usually, springs use high resilience metals.\nCreep can also be associated with durability. Creep decides how long metal can last with a continuous force acting on it. Metals having good creep value will be able to withstand constant load for a longer period of time before it fails.\nLet’s take an example of engine metal parts. Those should be made of metals with good creep value. So that those do not fail and engines also last longer.\nMalleability is the property of metals by virtue of which it can undergo severe compressive stress without getting fractured.\nYou may also like to read: Heat treatment process\nElectrical Properties Of Metals\nThe electrical properties of metals decide if the metal can conduct or resist electricity or it offers insulation to electricity. Below are the types of electrical properties of metals that we should know.\n- Dielectric strength\nConductivity is a property of metals by virtue of which you can say how good the metal is for electricity transmission. If the metal has good conductivity it is better suited for electricity. If the metal does not have electric conductivity, then it is called insulators.\nCopper and aluminum are two widely used metals known for good electric conductivity. Since both are ductile, so they are used in manufacturing electric wires and equipment.\nResistivity is the opposite of conductivity. So resistivity defines how good the metal is to resist electric conductivity. That does not mean that those metals can not transmit electricity, they can, but they always offer some resistivity and are not good for electric conductivity.\nWe all know that metals that do not allow electric conductivity are called insulators. But please make a note those are insulator to electricity only at room temperature. If you keep on increasing the voltage, there will be a limit beyond which the metals lose their insulation properties and start conducting electricity.\nSo dielectric strength of metals is the minimum voltage at which those metals become conductive from being an insulator. This property is very crucial when we design any electric components. Otherwise even a good insulator may fail and we will run into safety issues.\nThermal Properties Of Metals\nThe thermal properties of metals define how good is the metal under heat. For example, some metals expand, and some other contract under heat. That affects the overall stability of a part and a product. Knowing the thermal properties of metals is essential while designing a product failing in which the product may also fail. Below are a couple of key thermal properties of metals.\n- Thermal Conductivity\n- Thermal Expansion\n- Specific Heat\n- Melting Point\n- Latent heat of fusion\nThermal conductivity decides how well a metal can transfer heat energy. The more the thermal conductivity, the better the metal is for transferring heat energy. For example, aluminum can quickly heat up and dissipates heat compare to steel. That is why you may notice aluminum insulation or wrapper in industrial applications.\nAlmost every metal expands under heat. Now how much it expands is the key thing. Consider you have designed a part without considering how much the part will expand under heat. When that part is exposed to heat, dimensions change and that part no longer will be able to fit into the product. The expansion or the contraction of metal is directly proportional to the amount of heat that is applied.\nSpecific heat of metal can be defined as the heat required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of a metal substance by one-degree celcius.\nMelting point is the temperature at which metals start melting. It gives an overview of when the part may start melting.\nLatent Heat Of Fusion\nLatent heat of fusion is the heat required to a solid body at its melting point to convert it from solid to liquid.\nChemical Properties Of Metals\nWhen we talk about the chemical properties of metals, we may pre-assume that it’s all about corrosion. But it is not. Do you know that in many countries, you can not use certain metal and plastic which may come into contact with human or food items? Passing toxicity tests is one of the big hurdles of many engineers when they design a product. So here are a couple of key chemical properties of metals that we should be aware of.\n- Chemical Composition\nToxicity of metals or the toxic effect of metal can be defined as those properties which can cause harm to human or animal lives. This is purely due to the toxic composition of metals that poses the threat. Do you know that, in the United States, you need to mention how much Lead you have used in your house construction as lead is considered to be a toxic metal?\nCorrosion is the natural process of refined metals to go back to a more fragile and pure state. Metal surfaces get damaged due to chemical process when it comes in contact with air and water. How much metal will degrade due to corrosion depends on the composition of metals?\nChemical composition decides if the metal is toxic or prone to corrosion. Many properties of metals depend on the composition of metals. Often it is found that metals in the raw form have poor chemical composition. Various metal treatment process like heat treatment is used to alter the chemical composition.\nMagnetic Properties Of Metals\nMagnetic properties of metals indicate how easily a metal can be magnetite and how it can retain the magnetic properties. The following are the key magnetic properties of metals.\n- Coercive force\nPermeability is the properties of metals by virtue of which you can magnetite a metal. High permeability means you can easily magnetite that metal. Usually, hard metals have low permeability and tough to magnetite. Soft metals have high permeability and easy to magnetite.\nThe coercive force also called magnetic coercivity is the measure of the ability of a metal to withstand a magnetic force without getting demagnetize.\nWhen a metal is subjected to gradually increasing magnetic forces, the intensity of magnetization also get increases proportionally but with a lag. What that means is that, if you reduce the magnetic force to zero, the intensity of magnetization does not come down to zero. To make zero intensity of magnetization, you need to apply some reverse magnetic forces. This phenomenon is called hysteresis.\nProperties of metals have a great impact on how it may perform in a real-life scenario.

{"question":"What is the relationship between margin requirements and equity in forex trading, and how do risk management practices help protect traders' assets?","answer":"Margin requirements and equity are closely interrelated in forex trading. Equity represents the total value of a trader's account, consisting of the margin used for trades plus unused account balance. For open positions, equity includes unrealized profits/losses. Risk management is crucial as traders must maintain adequate equity levels above margin requirements to avoid margin calls. When free margin falls to zero, brokers automatically close positions to protect the margin collateral. Additionally, proper risk management includes calculating potential losses before opening trades - if free margin is $500 but potential loss is $700, traders should either close positions or decrease position sizes. These practices help protect traders' assets alongside regulatory protections from bodies like the SEC, SIPC, and CFTC which govern how brokers must safeguard customer funds.","context":["In particular I would like to make the system a lot faster, since it will allow parameter searches to be carried out in a reasonable time.

In other words, if your free margin is currently $500, but your potential losses of a trade are $700 (if the trade hits stop loss), you could be in trouble. In these situations, either close some of your open positions, or decrease your position sizes in order to free up additional free margin.\ntweet at 3:44pm: [RTRS] - U.S. CDC DIRECTOR REDFIELD SAYS RISK TO U.S. PUBLIC FROM CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK IS LOW tweet at 3:46pm: REDFIELD SAYS THERE ARE 191 INDIVIDUALS UNDER INVESTIGATION IN U.S. AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK tweet at 3:45pm: US CDC Director Redfield: This is a significant global situation. https://t.co/Ao1Ci2OEfi tweet at 3:52pm: US declares the coronavirus a public health emergency, implementing special temporary measures $SPX\nA Portfolio Margin account can provide lower margin requirements than a Margin account.

This high-reward, high-risk market has plenty of opportunities for the patient, insightful investor. You do not need to spend all day researching and watching the market; currency trading only requires you to dedicate a small portion of each day to it, leaving you with more time to spend following your dreams!\nMargin calls are mechanisms put in place by your Forex broker in order to keep your used margin secure. Remember, your used margin is allocated by your broker as the collateral for funds borrowed from your broker. A margin call happens when your free margin falls to zero, and all you have left in your trading account is your used, or required margin. When this happens, your broker will automatically close all open positions at current market rates.\nFor securities, the definition of margin includes three important concepts: the Margin Loan, the Margin Deposit and the Margin Requirement. The Margin Loan is the amount of money that an investor borrows from his broker to buy securities. The Margin Deposit is the amount of equity contributed by the investor toward the purchase of securities in a margin account. The Margin Requirement is the minimum amount that a customer must deposit and it is commonly expressed as a percent of the current market value. The Margin Deposit can be greater than or equal to the Margin Requirement. We can express this as an equation:\nMargins are a hotly debated topic. Some traders argue that too much margin is very dangerous, however it all depends on trading style and the amount of trading experience one has. If you are going to trade on a margin account, it is important that you know what your broker's policies are on margin accounts, and that you fully understand and are comfortable with the risks involved. Be careful to avoid a Forex margin call.\nThe market values/prices used to compute the equity or margin requirement in an Interactive account may differ from the price disseminated by exchanges or other market data sources, and may represent Interactive's valuation of the product. Among other things, Interactive may calculate its own index values, Exchange Traded Fund values or derivatives values, and Interactive may value securities or futures or other investment products based on bid price, offer price, last sale price, midpoint or using some other method. Interactive may use a valuation methodology that is more conservative than the marketplace as a whole.","What Is Equity in Forex Trading?\nReading time: 9 minutes\nThere are many concepts in Forex trading that are important to understand, and one of these concepts is equity in Forex trading. First of all, it has to be looked at in terms of when trades are open, and also in terms of when there are no active positions in the market.\nEquity in Forex trading is simply the total value of a Forex trader's account. When a Forex trader has those active positions in the market (during open trades), the equity on the FX account is the sum of the margin put up for the trade from the FX account, in addition to any unused account balance. When there are no active trade positions, the equity is known as 'free margin', and is the same as the account balance.\nWhat Does Equity in Forex Refer To?\nWhat is equity in Forex? FX equity refers to the absolute value of a Forex trader's account. When a trader has open positions, their trading platform will factor a number of parameters into the equity equation. For example, in MetaTrader 4 (MT4), the charts will list a number of figures in the terminal window:\nThe first parameter to understand equity in Forex is margin. It is the degree of collateral that the Forex trader must put up for the trade, in an attempt to utilise the leverage provided by the broker. You should keep in mind that the foreign exchange market is a highly leveraged market, enabling traders to put up a specific sum of money (the margin in our case) to control larger trades.\nThe next one in the list is balance. This refers to the total starting balance in the trader's account on the whole. We should outline that it is not influenced by any open positions until all of your active trade positions are closed. The third parameter is unrealised profit or loss. What this refers to is either profit or loss in financial terms, that a trader's account steadily accrues from in all open positions. As a matter of fact, they are referred to as unrealised, not true profits or losses.\nMoreover, their presence solely indicates the actual state of the positions in the market, and as they are not yet added to the account, they remain unrealised, and are subject to change. They only become realised profits or losses when the positions are closed, and this is the only time that they can be either added or removed from the trader's account.\nAt this stage, no change can lead to a trader's profit or loss. The last one in our list is trading equity in Forex. In turn, this refers to the true amount of money that one will be left with when all of the active positions are closed. In addition, the trader's account balance is made up of the equity, and the unrealised profit or loss within an active position.\nGenerally, we may define the trader's equity as the following: it is to a degree the profit or loss that the account sustains from either open or closed positions. Additionally, the equity changes as the unrealised profits or losses in active positions change accordingly. Furthermore, when the positions are closed, and the profits are added or losses are removed from the actual account balance, the FX trader's equity is now known.\nThe concepts of account balance, leverage, Forex equity, and margin are actually intertwined. A Forex trader has to know how they all connect, so that they can maintain capital when trading. It is essential to note that traders who suffer the dreaded margin call are those traders who do not comprehend the interrelationship between leverage, equity, margin, and the account balance. In fact, they open positions in a way that does not create balance between the trading equity, margin requirements, leverage and the account capital.\nEquity is also known as the crucial leverage factor. Mostly, equity on a Forex account should be higher than the margin utilised for trades. The leverage factor, or the equity applied for the trade, can go a long way in terms of defining the profits made, or the losses sustained on the account. This pushes us to the point of understanding why it is important for traders to understand how to use equity to generate a balance between the risk, and the reward of a trade, and the role leverage plays here. Knowing what is Forex equity is important as well.\nHow Can Equity Can Be Applied?\nIt is important to make the relevance of equity even more explicit, so we will use some examples. Firstly try to take a look at the terminal window on the MetaTrader 4 platform when there are active positions in the market. The balance in the account will change solely when the trader closes his active position. What's more, the profit/loss from such trades will be either added to or deducted from the initial account balance. Hence, the new balance will be displayed on the terminal window.\nLet's look at an example to further understand what equity is in Forex trading:\nThe margin can be calculated with this formula:\n- Margin = (trade volume x price of the asset) / leverage.\nFor example, let's assume we have 5,000 Euro in our account. We want to trade the EUR/USD currency pair, which is currently trading at 1,1400, and the leverage offered is 30 : 1. For the volume of the trade, we want to trade 1 Mini-Lot (10,000 units).\n- Margin = (10,000 * 1.1400)/30 = 11,400/30 = 380.00\nEvery one pip move is valued at 1 USD, so if the trade then moves 100 pips in our direction, that equates to a floating profit of 87.72 Euro (USD1/1.1400 * 100 Pips). This will bring our total equity to 5,087.72 Euro (5,000 Euro + 87.72 Euro = 5,087.72 Euro).\nFree margin then equals equity minus margin. In this case, our free margin is 4,707.72 Euro (5,087.72 Euro equity – 380.00 Euro margin).\nThe margin level is then calculated by dividing total equity by the margin and multiplying it by 100.\n- Margin level = (5,087.72 Euro / 380.00 Euro) x 100 = 1,338.87%.\nYou may take a look at where the equity is listed. It can be seen clearly that the equity is actually the money traders have in their accounts, entailing plus or minus the money that traders have when all open positions are wound up. Differently put, it is the account balance plus the floating or unrealised profit or loss on any open positions.\nExtra Tips Concerning Equity\nIf the market goes through a turn around and there is a decrease in the amount of losses, then more margin is actually freed up, and the equity will soon again surpass the margin. Moreover, the size of the new trade will then be defined by the extent to which the Forex equity exceeds the margin. There is also another potential situation: If the market continues to move against you, the equity will drop to a level where it will be less than the margin, making it nearly impossible to support the open trades.\nNeedless to say, the losing positions must be closed to balance out the equation, and protect the broker's leverage capital.\nMoreover, your broker can establish the percentage limit that forms the threshold value for this event to happen. If a broker sets the margin level to 10%, it implies that when the margin level approaches 10% rate (that is when the equity is 10% of the margin), the broker will automatically close out losing positions, beginning from the one with the largest floating loss.\nIf you are considering trading with Admiral Markets, keep in mind that we offer different account types for traders, depending on their client status. There are two types of traders: Retail traders, and professional traders. You find all the details relating to their differences on our account types webpage.\nIf after the closing of a particular position with the largest floating loss, the market keeps on moving against the trader, so that the broker's capital is once again threatened, the broker will take the same course of action to close out any position with the largest unrealised losses. It goes without saying that if the trader deposits more capital to enlarge the balance with an immediate deposit means of transaction (like a credit card), money can actually be taken from the new account balance to add to the margin, therefore keeping the positions open.\nHaving a good comprehension of the role of equity in Forex can undoubtedly help you as a trader in terms of maintaining structure within your trading activity, as well as avoiding taking on too much risk, that can potentially be doubled with the trader's nightmare - the margin call.\nEquity is one of the most important aspects of Forex trading. It is imperative to know that equity must be kept at levels that are high enough so that at no point in time will the account suffer when some losing trades are incurred. This can be by either increasing account equity, or by using proper leverage/margin requirements relevant to the account size. Try to test your newly-gained knowledge on a risk-free demo account. It is a safe way to see how well you've learned all of the information, and how good you are at applying it in practical situations.\nThis material does not contain and should not be construed as containing investment advice, investment recommendations, an offer of or solicitation for any transactions in financial instruments.

{"question":"How do spheroid DropShips and the Farragut-class WarShip compare in terms of their landing and operational capabilities?","answer":"Spheroid DropShips use vertical thrust for planetary landings and takeoffs, allowing them to operate without runways but requiring constant engine power and computer control, with any failure resulting in a catastrophic crash. In contrast, the Farragut-class WarShip is designed as a pure battleship and operates in space, serving roles such as line ships and flagships.

The Farragut was the brainchild of Lord Richard Cameron (25th c.) of the Terran Hegemony. Design of the Farragut began in 2430, but Richard died before the first Farragut slipped its mooring in 2448. The name pays homage to Admiral Isaac Farragut, hero of the Battle of Lyons, making the Farragut both an impregnable naval vessel and a symbol of Hegemony martial pride. \nThe Farragut-class battleship performed several roles in the Hegemony fleets, including line ships and flagships, but the Farragut was also capable of operating independently. The largest class of naval vessel at the time of its introduction, the Farragut served admirably, but production faltered due to a combination of price and newer, more advanced features on recently designed classes. Production of the Farragut ended in 2500, however Farraguts would serve in the HAF for centuries to come. The last Farragut-class vessel was decommissioned (and slated for dismantling) on 12 December, 2766.\nThe Farragut was designed as a fighters and a showcase vessel for the newly designed Naval Gauss Cannons, of which the Farragut possesses 18. Beyond the Naval Gausses, the Farragut also mounts massive naval autocannons, Killer Whale missile systems, and Heavy NPPCs. For point defense, the Farragut can deploy an entire wing of Aerospace Fighters, and shoot down incoming bogies with a massive array of Large Lasers.\nThe Farragut is also relatively maneuverable, especially for a combat Jumpship, and is well armored.\nThe Farragut can transport a massive payload. The Farragut could deploy with a full wing of Aerospace Fighters (36 fighters), housed in three of the Farragut's five bays. Another bay was designed to carry small craft, allowing the Farragut to transport up to 10. The final bay is a dedicated cargo bay, capable of containing 183,414.5 tons cargo.\n- Word of Blake\n- WoBS Righteous Justice - Commanded by Gregory Zwick, the Righteous Justice was the Word of Blake flagship during Operation SCOUR's assault on Terra, successfully destroying in 3078, the Com Guard flagship the Cameron-class CSS Invisible Truth, commanded by Zwick's former friend Alain Beresick.

They essentially conduct all other aspects of space travel, including transit between planets and Jump Points and planetary landings (hence their name). For FTL interstellar movement, they dock with JumpShips by means of a Docking collar.\nThe mass range is given in the construction rules and reflects the fact that it is more or less impossible to build DropShips which are smaller than 200 tons or larger than 100,000 tons. Since DropShips are meant to be carried by JumpShips, a Docking collar is an implied necessity and is automatically included in the structure of any DropShip.\nDropShips are the workhorse of interplanetary space travel. It is the DropShips (and occasionally their smaller cousins, the Small Craft) that move cargo and passengers between planetary surfaces, orbits, space stations and jump points. While transport is their primary role, some have been built for special purposes and act as tugs, rescue ships, fighter carriers or even designated combat DropShips. Accordingly, a wide and diverse variety of DropShip types exist.\nEven though many DropShips serve as military spaceships, naval terms such as \"Corvette\", \"Destroyer\", \"Cruiser\" etc. are never applied to them; these are exclusively used for true WarShips, i.e. the huge Combat JumpShips that outclass DropShips by an order of magnitude (typically massing several hundred thousands or even millions of tons).\nConstruction and Subtypes\nWhile DropShips often are very large for their tonnage compared to ground- and water-based combat vehicles, they reserve most of their enormous volumes for cargo. As a result, crew facilities in DropShips are usually cramped inside, featuring relatively little in the way of creature-comforts or extra space. Every possible hole or space in a DropShip has some sort of system or mechanism important to the operation and maintenance of the vessel. Most crews live in small, spartan quarters bunking four crewman or more a piece, though Star League-era DropShips, as well as some newer ones as of the late 3060s, feature comparatively spacious twin cabins. Except for passenger liners, which afford their attendants a bit more privacy, DropShips are very public places. Most military DropShips described talk of stale air and overly-cramped living conditions.\nThey are based around two basic hullforms, aerodyne, and spheroid (egg-shaped). Depending on their intended role, DropShips can be constructed following either of these two alternative approaches.\nSpheroid (egg-shaped) DropShips use sheer thrust to vertically descend onto a planetary surface and take off in the same way. This allows them to operate independent from runways or even spaceports, making them ideal for exploring unknown planets and giving them a tactical advantage in military operations. However, their simple and versatile landing and taking off pattern comes at a great risk as there is no failsafe whatsoever. They are utterly dependent on the functionality of their powerful engines to generate lift, and a control computer to manage their unstable flight. These systems require more maintenance than on aerodyne ships, and their failure means a swift and deadly crash landing that leaves few if any survivors or salvageable parts.\nAny DropShip that is not a spheroid design is considered \"aerodyne\" even if it is in fact incapable of atmospheric operations.\nTruly aerodyne DropShips are shaped roughly similar to conventional aircraft. They are generally smaller than spheroid DropShips and cannot be bigger than 35,000 tons (the biggest known aerodyne class being the 17,400-ton Conquistador). Through their speed, they generate lift within an atmosphere which makes them easier to control. Even if the ship suffers damage or loses thrust it is often still possible to facilitate an emergency landing so that crew and cargo might survive. Aerodyne DropShips usually require runways to land and take off, making them impractical wherever runways are not readily available. Some, however, such as the Leopard, can operate from very short and/or makeshift runways, making them almost as versatile as their spheroid cousins.\nDeep space DropShips\nAlthough all DropShips are either of the spheroid or the aerodyne subtype, there is arguably a third subtype: Ships which are limited to operating in deep space for one reason or another and would be destroyed when attempting to enter an atmosphere or land on a planet, rendering the differences between aerodyne and spheroid designs irrelevant to them. Examples include the super-large Behemoth class cargo hauler, which is a spheroid design but has insufficient acceleration for planetary operations and was also described as too large and fragile to operate in gravity, and the nominally \"aerodyne\" (i.e. non-spheroid) Achilles and Vengeance class military DropShips which were never designed for atmospheric operations.\nClassification of DropShips\nIn addition to their type, DropShips have mission profiles that they were originally designed for. They include the following.\n- Assault - This primary military DropShip is designed for maximum firepower. Typically used for anti-aerospace fighter and anti-DropShip operations, they can be used ground assault purposes but this is rare. Some models of assault ships which carry anti-WarShip weaponry are referred to as Pocket WarShips. This type of DropShip is also known to carry limited quantities of BattleMechs, Battle Armor, Marines, and aerospace fighters; Usually just enough to provide \"point-blank\" defense.\n- Fighter Carrier or Aerospace Carrier - Design for carrying/supporting aerospace fighter craft operations. Though other DropShips are referred to as 'Mech Carrier, Troop Carriers, etc., a ship described as a \"carrier\" is understood to be a fighter carrier. These ships typically have CV (for Carrier Vessel) appended to their name, as in Leopard CV.\n- Cargo Ship - Typically civilian model of ship, used for hauling bulk cargo. Some ships are fitted to transport liquids and are usually referred to as Liquid Carriers.\n- 'Mech Carriers - Military type of DropShip, principally designed to carry BattleMechs into combat. They are generally modestly armed.\n- Pocket WarShip - A military DropShip type based on the Assault DropShips. These ships are designed to carry Capital Missiles and sometimes Sub-Capital Weaponry. Most are typically heavily armed with standard BattleMech scale weaponry. Early versions of this ship type were known as Q-Ships. Following the Jihad, with so many nations' shipyards damaged or destroyed, many factions turned to these as the backbone of their navies.\n- Q-Ship - Military conversion of a civilian vessel, typically cargo ships. First introduced by the Star League Defense Forces prior to the Star League Civil War.\n- Troop Transport - Typical infantry carrying DropShip, which may have capacities of moving various size vehicles. They are normally modestly armed craft.\n- Liner - Civilian Dropship design for passenger service. Normally, these ships are lightly or never armed. Rarely these ships are used as Troop Transport for infantry.\nMaintenance of a DropShip usually costs more in resources in a year than the average citizen in the BattleTech universe would ever earn in several lifetimes. The chassis itself costs a large fortune to make, let alone the weapons, armor, avionics, and the powerful engines required to even lift it off the ground.\nThe smallest known spaceship to meet the DropShip criteria is arguably the 200-ton K-1 DropShuttle, although it is generally classified as a Small Craft instead. The largest DropShip ever constructed is the 100,000-ton Behemoth, which due to its sheer size is incapable of leaving gravity wells stronger than .6 g. The biggest DropShip that can actually leave atmosphere in standard gravity is the 52,000-ton Mammoth.\nThe most common military BattleMech transport classes are the Leopard (one Lance: 4 'Mechs, 2 Fighters), the Union (one Company: 12 'Mechs, 2 Fighters) and the much rarer Overlord (one Battalion: 36 'Mechs, 6 Fighters); the most common Aerospace Fighter carrier is the Leopard CV class (one Squadron: 6 Fighters).\nKnown DropShip classes include (sorted alphabetically):\n|Achilles||4,500||2582||military||aerodyne||Designated assault ship geared for space combat; incapable of atmospheric operations.|\n|Arondight||12,000||3075||military||spheroid||Designed by the Federated Suns as low-cost mass production vessel.|\n|Arcadia||3,000||3066||military||aerodyne||First exclusive ProtoMech carrier (15 ProtoMechs), small and agile.|\n|Assault Triumph||8,000||3062||military||aerodyne||Assault transport (6 'Mechs, 6 Fighters, 24 heavy vehicles, 6 Battle Armor squads) developed from the older Triumph class.|\n|Aurora||1,600||3069||military||aerodyne||Typically a 'Mech carrier (4 'Mechs), but highly adaptable for a variety of roles.|\n|Avenger||1,400||2816||military||aerodyne||Designated assault craft and heavy aerospace support.|\n|Behemoth||100,000||2782||civilian||spheroid||Cargo carrier.

{"question":"What role does a horse's coat play in winter insulation, and how does checking their gum color help assess their health during cold weather?","answer":"A horse's coat provides winter insulation through oils that act as waterproofing and hairs that stand up to trap warm air pockets. This insulation is so effective that snow can accumulate on their backs without melting. Regarding gum color assessment, checking the mucous membrane color above the teeth provides a quick indicator of blood circulation effectiveness. Normal gums should be pale pink, while white or very pale gums can indicate shock, and dark or purple gums may suggest severe shock or toxemia where blood isn't being pumped effectively.","context":["You’ve probably seen pictures of horses grazing in a pasture full of snow and wearing a blanket of snow on their uncovered backs. In turn, your instinctive reaction is most likely to be one of “Brrrr! They have to be freezing!”\nBut do horses get cold like people do?\nAs a general rule, no. Horses are designed to handle cold weather and related conditions, but the ultimate answer is that it depends on the individual horse.\nThe physiology of a horse helps them handle the cold in such a way that it doesn’t bother them. There’s always a barn prince or princess who won’t go outside without a sheet when the temperatures dip, but they’re the exception to the rule. A horse that’s in good physical condition and has an adequate fat layer can readily handle cold weather, provided they’re of a mind to do so.\nIt’s a good idea to engage in hair coat management if you use your horse for performance or training on a year-round basis. The very effectiveness of a horse’s coat and physiology causes it to sweat harder in the winter after exertion. Clipping and blanketing helps your horse shed heat and sweat less during the winter.\nRead on to learn more about why horses don’t get cold in the winter and what you can do to help them stay comfortable.\nHow the Winter Coat Grows\nHorses have an internal sensor that tells them it’s time to grow a winter coat when the days start getting shorter.\nYou might not notice it right away, but the coat changes slowly. Their short, summer coat stays in place year-round, but longer hair starts growing in on top of the short ones. These hairs, sometimes known as guard hairs, stand up on top of the summer coat and give the horse a fuzzy appearance. This creates a dual-layer coat, one for insulation, and the other for protecting against wind, snow, and wet.\nHow a Horse’s Head Handles Cold Air\nNext time someone asks your horse “why the long face”, you can explain that their face conceals long sinus cavities that heat up air as it passes through to the neck and lungs.\nThis function is the same in all mammals, but horses evolved to have long, square heads with sinuses that run the length of their head to their neck. Cold air is warmed up by the time it reaches the neck and passes to the trachea. This eliminates the delivery of a cold shock to the lungs (although cold air can still sting when going from a warm environment to a cold one). That’s why horses sometimes “nope” at cold weather and go back in, or go running like their tails are on fire after being turned out.\nYou can get an idea of how this process works by paying attention to how air feels in your nose when it’s cold out. Take a deep breath through your nose and pay attention to the sensation as it transitions from your nose to your throat, and as it hits your lungs. This is similar to how a horse experiences breathing in cold air. Humans have shorter noses, but then again, we can cover it up to warm the air. Horses can’t, and as a result, their bodies have evolved to handle cold air.\nWhy Horses Have Long Necks\nThe length of a horse’s neck is another evolutionary trait as it enables the horse to adjust its vision, graze, and further warm cold air before it reaches the lungs. The air that’s transferred from the nose to the neck is already warmed up, but the distance from the neck to the lungs brings the air to a higher temperature and makes it easy to breathe in without shock.\nThe mane also plays a role in insulating the neck, making it a good idea to let it grow out during the winter.\nHow the Digestive System Helps\nHorses ferment their meals in their hindgut, which helps it stay warm. The heat is circulated through the body and helps maintain a constant body temperature. Horses that spend time outside should have plenty of access to forage to help them generate heat and let this natural heat source do its best work.\nHooves and Legs Don’t Transmit Cold\nThe horse’s leg is made up of tendon and bone, but has robust circulation to the hoof and coffin bone. You’d think the cold from the ground would transmit to the blood flow and bring it back to the horse’s body, except for the fact the horse intermittently shunts the blood flow away from its hooves.\nThis is thought to minimize the transmission of cold to the body as the horse’s body stops the blood flow to the leg at intervals.\nThis mechanism also increases the risk of laminitis, although a healthy horse with no underlying conditions won’t experience a bout of cold-induced laminitis. However, a horse that’s already compromised is at higher risk of an episode because it can’t tell its body to keep the blood flow going regardless.\nYou’ll want to be proactive in managing the turnout in the cold for a horse with a chronic health condition.\nFat As An Insulator\nA horse that lives in the wild or lives the life of a pasture puff spends the months prior to winter looking for extra forage. Their body signals it to eat more to increase the amount of body fat they carry. The extra fat covers the rib cage and lungs to help hold in body heat.\nYou can increase your horse’s forage amounts as the weather cools down to help it gain some weight, but you don’t want them to become obese, either. An extra flake of hay at feeding times supplies sufficient calories, or you can pour a cup of corn oil into the hard feed.\nA horse that has an adequate amount of body fat and a thick hair coat is one that can handle snowy conditions. In fact, these insulating layers are so effective that they can carry around a blanket of snow on their backs and not have it melt. The snow also acts as an additional layer of insulation, strange as that sounds, and helps the horse stay comfortable.\nHow Their Coat Helps With Insulation\nA horse’s coat is their best protection against cold. The coat contains oils that act as waterproofing, and the hairs stand up which traps pockets of air. The waterproofing of the oils prevents melting snow from getting to the skin, and the pockets of air hold warmth. This is another aspect that causes snow to blanket a horse’s back without melting.\nShould Horses Be Blanketed?\nMost horses manage to grow a coat that protects them from the cold, but there are always exceptions to the rule.\nTo begin with, horses have a light receptor that tells it when it’s time to grow and time to shed their coats. This receptor is stimulated by the winter and summer equinoxes. When the receptor senses the days are growing shorter, it sends out a signal to the body to start growing the winter coat.\nThe same is true when the days get longer. Allowing a horse to follow its natural coat growing rhythms usually results in a coat that’s adequate for the winter.\nHowever, all horses are individuals and some grow heavier coats than others. The density of a horse’s hair coat is attributable to age, chronic illness, genetics, and breed. Then there are some horses that grow a lousy winter coat no matter what you try. Horses with a poor winter hair coat will benefit from being blanketed, and it won’t affect the density of their coat as they won’t grow the adequate hair layers to keep them warm.\nShow horses that are kept in training during the winter months should also be blanketed. They’re prone to sweating from exertion, and take longer to cool off when the workout is finished. This puts them in an uncomfortable state afterwards, and it’s a rare barn that’s equipped for hot water baths in the winter.\nWalking a horse to cool it off is another option, but again, this takes time and may not be convenient. Blanketing a show horse when the nights are cool helps to slow down hair growth and enables a horse to cool down more quickly after a workout. It should be noted that a horse whose coat is managed in this fashion also needs to wear a blanket when stabled or pastured.\nPreparing Your Horse for Winter\nMost of the time, a horse prepares itself for winter without much help from you. But if you intend to keep a training schedule, ride, or drive your horse during the winter, you’ll want to take steps to manage your horse’s hair growth.\nPutting a sheet on your horse when the nights are cool will help minimize winter hair growth, although it won’t stop it from growing entirely. The winter hair coat grows shorter, making it more manageable for exercise and cooling down. You’ll need to blanket your horse for turnout if you decide to go this route for coat management. (This article will help you pick out a blanket.)\nSome individuals are prone to growing a thick coat no matter what you do. This is when you prepare to give your horse a blanket clip to help it shed heat and not sweat so heavily.\nA blanket clip is a front to rear clip of your horse’s coat from the top of the legs to about mid chest. You clip parallel to the ground and take the hair down to a short length. If your horse will tolerate getting their belly clipped, go ahead and remove some of the hair, and be sure to leave a patch intact in the girth area.\nSigns That Your Horse is Cold\nA horse that has adequate insulation from its hair and fat layers doesn’t react to the cold. They may look like they’re cold to the eye, but if a horse is acting normally and not showing signs of stress, they’re fine.\nHorses are more self-sufficient than people give them credit for, and they will seek shelter if they are cold. However, it’s possible for a horse to get cold if it’s compromised in some way.\nSigns of a cold horse include:\n- Stomping feet\n- Tucked tail\n- Huddling with other horses\n- Cold ears\n- Low body temperature under 100\n- Consuming more feed without weight gain\nWhat to Do If Your Horse is Cold\nThe first thing you should do is take your horse into the barn and put it in a stall, then put on a blanket to help the horse warm up. Make sure it has adequate forage to consume and help it raise its internal body temperature.\nTake its temperature to determine how cold it is, and call the vet for further guidance.\nYour horse may have a low-grade virus or a chronic condition that’s affecting their ability to self-regulate their body temperature. A veterinarian can assess your horse and perform tests that help determine the reason or cause of your horse’s loss of body temperature.\nThe phrase of “if you’re cold, they’re cold” doesn’t apply to horses. You may see your horse shiver a little bit in cold weather, but if the action lasts for a few seconds and doesn’t happen repeatedly, your horse is fine.\nMake sure to provide your horse with plenty of forage, a place where it can shelter from the wind when it’s outside, and fresh water to help it stay comfortable during turnout. It helps it stay healthy, comfortable, and in touch with their natural body rhythms.","Whenever your horse is sick or injured, check his vital signs at rest to assess his overall health status. This how-to summary is adapted from The Comprehensive Guide to Equine Veterinary Medicine, by H&R’s consulting veterinarian, Barb Crabbe.\nWhy check: A rapid heart rate can indicate pain (as from colic), anxiety/stress, exertion, or a fever. A slower-than-normal rate can indicate shock, hypothermia, poisoning, or simply good athletic condition.\nHow to check: Place a stethoscope against your horse’s chest up under his left elbow. Count the number of “lub-dubs” in 15 seconds, then multiply by four to determine beats per minute.\nNormal range: 28 to 44 beats per minute.\nWhy check: An elevated temperature can indicate pain, infection, heat exhaustion, or exertion. A below-normal temp can indicate shock or hypothermia due to exposure to cold weather.\nHow to check: Activate a digital thermometer; dab its tip with a lubricant. Gently insert the tip in your horse’s rectum to a depth of 2 inches; hold in place until it beeps to indicate the reading is complete.\nNormal range: 99.5 to 101.5 degrees F.\nWhy check: A raised respiratory rate can point to fever, pain (as from colic), shock, heat exhaustion, or difficulty breathing because of an abnormality in the lungs or airways. Nervousness and exercise will also speed breathing. A below-normal rate could indicate shock, hypothermia, the effect of a drug, or simply good athletic condition.\nHow to check: Count the number of breaths taken in a 30-second period by observing the rise and fall of your horse’s chest or the flaring of his nostrils. Multiply by two to determine the breaths per minute.\nNormal range: 10 to 18 breaths per minute.\nWhy check: Gum (mucous membrane) color is a quick indicator of whether blood is being effectively pumped through your horse’s body. White or very pale gums can indicate shock or anemia. Dark or purple gums may indicate severe shock or toxemia (the heart isn’t pumping effectively, and blood is pooling in these distant vessels in the gums).\nHow to check: Raise your horse’s upper lip in order to observe the gum tissue just above his teeth.\nNormal range: Gums should be pale pink.\nCAPILLARY REFILL TIME\nWhy check: A very slow capillary refill time can indicate shock (your horse’s circulation isn’t functioning as it should). If the refill time seems very fast, it’s most likely normal.\nHow to check: Raise your horse’s upper lip and press firmly with your thumb against the gums above his teeth. Then take your thumb away and count the number of seconds it takes for the blanched area you created to return to its normal pink color.\nNormal range: Blood should return within 1 to 3 seconds.\nWhy check: Louder and more frequent sounds than normal can mean your horse is experiencing a mild colic due to intestinal spasms or gas accumulation. No sounds means there’s no gut movement, which may indicate shock or a severe colic episode with a shutdown of the digestive tract.\nHow to check: Listen with a stethoscope for at least one minute at each of four different locations on your horse’s flank: one high and one low on each side.\nNormal range: On average, you should hear two to four small gurgles per minute, and one larger rumbling every two to three minutes. (These guidelines will vary from horse to horse, and may be loudest just before feeding time.)\nWhy check: A strong or “throbby” pulse indicates inflammation in your horse’s foot or a disruption of the blood flow.\nHow to check: Squat and place three fingers of your hand on the inside of your horse’s fetlock joint, resting your thumb on the outside of the joint. Apply gentle pressure with your fingers, sliding them around a bit until you feel a small cord-like structure slip beneath your fingers—the digital artery. Note the strength of the pulse there.\nNormal range: If the pulse is weak and hard to find, it’s probably normal."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4b88900a-83aa-4201-97ac-b1d2f31f7814>","<urn:uuid:29990807-012b-4a63-844f-a0169391a23e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between hospice and palliative care in terms of their care locations and accessibility?","answer":"While both hospice and palliative care can be provided in various settings, there are differences in their delivery and accessibility. Palliative care can be provided in hospitals, medical centers, specialized facilities, and through home-based care organizations. Hospice care, while often associated with a facility, is primarily delivered at home with about 80% of care taking place there, though it can also be provided in nursing homes, hospitals, or independent facilities devoted to end-of-life care. In terms of accessibility, palliative care is relatively easy to access in places like South Africa, while globally only 14% of people who need it have access. Hospice care is primarily accessible to those over 65 through Medicare benefits in some healthcare systems.","context":["The purpose of palliative care\nEverything you need to know about palliative and hospice care.\nThere is more to palliative care than most people understand.\nWhat is palliative care?\nPalliative care is holistic and multidisciplinary. It is a specialised approach to medical care. Although it is mostly relied upon near the end of a patient’s life, there are other situations during which it can prove helpful. In some cases, palliative care facilities are built and offered as a relief option for full time caregivers.\nPalliative care works well with other treatment plans and aims to cater for a wide range of needs and preferences. This includes the provision of support for families enduring one member’s terminal or life-limiting illness.\nWho needs it?\n- Patients nearing the end of their lives, as a result of a terminal illness or condition.\n- Severely impaired individuals, unable to care for themselves without assistance.\n- A patient who is undergoing treatment for a severe disease, including Cancer.\n- Someone battling a short-term illness, in need of additional care while undergoing treatment.\n- Elderly patients who need additional care.\nWhat is the purpose of palliative care?\nPalliative care is purely devoted to improving your quality of life, through an illness or severe ailment. Its holistic approach covers:\n- Pain management and relief.\n- Symptom management (relief from associated symptoms).\n- Protecting comfort and human dignity, especially related to degenerative conditions.\n- Spiritual and therapeutic respect.\n- Inclusion of family in important decision-making processes, and access to you as a patient.\n- Maintaining your control over decisions affecting your health and treatment.\n- Working in harmony with other medical and treatment providers to provide the best outcomes for patients.\n- Nursing and other practical support to avoid dependence on expensive emergency services.\nWhy do I need a palliative care plan?\nYou may not neeed one today, but in ten years from now, you might be grateful you planned ahead. Accommodate for a variety of scenarios, considering that palliative care applies to many life-defining conditions. Post-retirement and senior care plans are also worth considering. Take time to put these in place to enable your loved ones to follow and respect your decisions, no matter what happens. If something affects your ability to communicate, this type of planning basically still considers your wishes.\nWhat must I include in my palliative care plan?\n- Clearly define what kinds of pain management you would like in specific scenarios.\n- Spiritual, religious and personal requirements.\n- Draft a Living Will. If you advance to a stage of illness and can no longer communicate, this document can be referred to on your behalf. Your care team will use your Living Will to follow your wishes and respect what you want as much as possible.\n- Emergency response details. e.g. Should CPR/resuscitation be performed, or life support switched off?\n- All details of any existing or historic physical conditions, and details of doctors who have treated you previously.\n- You can include your estate, but your Last Will and Testament should cover this in full.\nWhere does it all happen?\nPalliative care can be home- or hospital-based, or provided through specialised facilities. Your doctor, nurse or clinic sister can refer you to nearby providers. Remember that your body is also completely unique, and your symptoms are not the same as someone next to you. Your care plan can be defined by a number of factors:\n- What conditions you have,\n- How long you need palliative care for.\n- Emotional, and spiritual or religious preferences.\nWhat is respite care?\nRespite care offers your family members a short break if you’re completely dependent on them for daily survival. It can be run over just a few hours to a couple of days, and helps bring balance into your home. Giving your primary caregivers and family a break, respite care is a good idea to plan for. It’s always worthwhile planning for such situations, both from a care provider and a patient perspective.\nWhat’s the difference between palliative care and hospice care?\nHospice care is fully focused on end-of-life processes, and making these as painless as possible for patients. It won’t consider management of illnesses, or treating any condition for the goal of a patient’s recovery. Often, patients rely on a hospice when there is little to no chance of surviving beyond another six months.\nPalliative care, being all-encompassing, can be relied upon at any point in a patient’s life. Some hospices do cover this type of care plan, but it’s critical to speak to the senior caregivers to know which option you are being placed on from day one.\nUnderstand more about HIV and how to live a happy, healthy life when you are HIV-positive.\nLeave your details below to get more lifestyle tips, updates on medical research, and other resources to help you and your family live a healthy happy life in the presence of HIV.\nWhere in South Africa can I find palliative care providers?\n- Hospitals and medical centres.\n- Specialised facilities and selected hospices.\n- Nursing organisations and associations.\n- Home-based care organisations and associations.\n- Community care associations and facilities.\nThe costs associated with using palliative care service providers are usually defined by:\n- Your income and range of affordability.\n- Your medical cover, including insurance and medical aid.\nImproving global access to palliative care\nAccess in South Africa is relatively easy, but this is not the case in other countries. The World Health Organisation found that only 14% of people who need palliative care have access, globally. Budget cuts from governments have placed immense pressure on the medical supply chain and employment capacity for caregivers. Effective budget management and prioritisation would drastically help to improve global access to palliative care.\nAustralian Medical Association. 2015.

HISTORY OF HOSPICE CARE : HISTORY OF HOSPICE CARE HISTORY OF HOSPICE CARE : HISTORY OF HOSPICE CARE 11th century, around 1065= the 1st hospice care are believed to have originated when the first incurably ill were permitted into places dedicated to treatment by Crusaders.\n14th century- Order of Knights Hospitaller of St.John of Jerusalem opened the 1st hospice in Rhodes\n17th century- Hospices were revived in France by the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul.\n19th Century- established also in UK where attention was drawn to the needs of the terminally ill.\n1902-1905- hospice care spread to other nations.( Australia, North America, Japan, China, Russia)\nCecily Saunders introduced the idea of specialized care for the dying to the United States during a 1963 visit with Yale University. Her lecture, given to medical students, nurses, social workers, and chaplains about the concept of holistic hospice care, included photos of terminally ill cancer patients and their families, showing the dramatic differences before and after the symptom control care.\n1965: Florence Wald, then Dean of the Yale School of Nursing, invites Saunders to become a visiting faculty member of the school for the spring term. The Modern Hospice Movement : The Modern Hospice Movement In the 1950s, as medical technology developed, most people died in hospitals. The medical profession increasingly saw death as a failure.\nPhysical pain associated with terminal illness was not a target of treatment.\nDame Cicely Saunders, MD, founded St. Christopher’s Hospice in London in the 1960s, in an effort to discover practical solutions to alleviating human suffering.\nShe introduced hospice in the U.S. in a lecture at Yale in 1963. This contact set off a chain of events which resulted in the development of hospice care as we know it today. HISTORY OF HOSPICE CARE : HISTORY OF HOSPICE CARE 1972: Kubler-Ross testifies at the first national hearings on the subject of death with dignity, which are conducted by the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging. In her testimony, Kubler-Ross states, “We live in a very particular death-denying society. We isolate both the dying and the old, and it serves a purpose. They are reminders of our own mortality. We should not institutionalize people. We can give families more help with home care and visiting nurses, giving the families and the patients the spiritual, emotional, and financial help in order to facilitate the final care at home.”\n1996: Major grant-makers pour money into funding for research, program initiatives, public forums, and conferences to transform the culture of dying and improve care at the end of life. Myths of Hospice : Myths of Hospice A place.\nOnly for people with cancer.\nOnly for old people.\nOnly for dying people.\nCan help only when family members are able to provide care.\nFor people who don’t need a high level of care.\nOnly for people who can accept death.\nNot covered by managed care.\nFor when there is no hope. Realities of Hospice : Realities of Hospice About 80% of hospice care takes place in the home.\nHospices are increasingly serving people with the end-stages of chronic diseases.\nHospices serve people of all ages.\nHospice focuses as much on the grieving family as on the dying patients.\nAlternative locations or resources\nmay be available.

Any patient with a skilled medical care need is qualified to receive home health nursing care. Hospice care, on the other hand, is limited to persons with a terminal illness, with a life expectancy of six months or less, and with a focus on palliation not cure.\n2. Patients in home health care receive visits primarily from a nurse while patients in hospice care receive the services of an entire interdisciplinary team\nwhose area of expertise is end-of-life care.

{"question":"Does almond milk have more protein than rice milk?","answer":"No, almond milk has 1g of protein per 8-ounce serving, which is the same as rice milk (1g protein per serving). Both have significantly less protein than cow's milk, which contains 8g of protein per serving.","context":["Almond milk is a drink that is prepared from ground almonds and water. Almond milk has been used for several years as a plant-based alternative to dairy milk. According to Jenny Heap, a registered dietitian with the Almond Board of California, almond milk has been around since the middle ages when noble houses used it as a substitute for dairy milk.\nThe Boston Globe released a report in 2014 indicating that almond milk had even surpassed soy milk as the most popular plant-based milk product on the market.\nIs Almond Milk Dairy?\nAlthough the plant-based drink is called milk, almond milk is not dairy. It is a tasty drink that is prepared from ground almonds and water. The drink is Dairy-free, soy-free, and lactose-free. One may choose to add salts or sweeteners to make it taste better.\nThe commercially prepared almond milk typically has added nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals. Thickening agents, such as carrageenan, which is a seaweed derivative, are added to increase the shelf-life of almond milk. Almond milk can be made at home.\nJenny Heap recommended the following recipe:\n- First, soak almonds in water for one to two days. The water should remain uncovered.\n- After the two days are over, the soaking water should be drained and discarded. The almonds should be rinsed with clean water.\n- The almonds should then be blended on high with two cups of fresh water. After blending, they should be strained well using cheesecloth, which ensures chunks of almonds do not make it into the milk.\n- Finally, one can choose to add vanilla, a sweetener, or cinnamon to taste.\nBoth homemade and commercial almond milk can go bad after some time. The commercial almond milk comes with a use-by date that is indicated on the packaging.\nAccording to Almond Breeze website, commercial almond milk should be used within seven days after opening its packaging. Experts recommend using the homemade almond milk within two days.\nAlmond Milk Vs. Almonds\nAlmond milk has the same nutritional value as super-healthy almonds. However, the almond milk's nutrient level is lower compared to almonds. According to Heap, a one-ounce serving, which needs about 23 almonds to make, provides six grams of proteins and four grams of fibers. Other nutrients include Vitamin E, magnesium, calcium, riboflavin, and potassium.\nIt is not clear the number of almonds that are used to make a quart of almond milk. The number of almonds depends on the brand or the recipe if it is homemade.\nBusiness Insider published an article indicating that the commercial almond milk recipes are similar from brand to brand. According to the Los Angeles Times, the list of ingredients on most commercial brands indicates almonds as the second or third ingredient. The top ingredients include water and sweeteners, which means there are more of those ingredients than the amount of almonds used.\nStudies have revealed that commercial almond milk has larger amounts of calcium and Vitamins A and D compared to whole almonds, as manufacturers fortify the almond milk with those nutrients. The vitamin E that is present in almond milk is also added; the vitamin E from whole almonds does not make its way into the final product.\nAlmond Milk Vs. Cow’s Milk\nThe USDA released a report that showed that almond milk has one gram of proteins per cup compared to cow milk, which has eight grams. Calcium-fortified almond milk contains high levels of calcium compared to that found in cow's milk. However, the levels of calcium found in homemade almond milk are much lower than that in cow milk. Fortified Almond milk has more Vitamins A, D, E, and B12 compared to those found in non-fortified cow’s milk.\nReports also indicate that cow’s milk has more phosphorus content than almond milk, while the plant-based milk has slightly higher sodium levels. The most notable difference between almond milk and cow milk is that almond milk is cholesterol free. It also lacks saturated fats that are present in cow milk.\nAccording to the Washington Post, the fats present in almond milk are good for human consumption. Almond milk is also said to have fewer calories than cow milk.\nAlmond Milk Vs. Soy Milk\nThe nutritional value of almond milk and soy milk tend to be very close. However, almond milk has fewer calories than soy milk. A number of carbohydrates and sugar found in almond milk is also lower than the same variety of soy milk.\nAlmond milk does not contain saturated fats, which are found in soy milk. However, soy milk has more potassium, magnesium, and folate RDA than most almond milk blends.\nAlmond Milk Vs. Coconut Milk\nThe first noticeable difference between coconut milk and almond milk is the caloric content. Unsweetened almond milk can contain a maximum of 60 calories compared to coconut milk which has 400 calories in a single serving.\nAs a result, coconut milk is not a good option for those who are interested in cutting calories consumption.\nAdvantages Of Almond Milk\nAlmond milk is the best option for those who are dairy or lactose intolerant.\nAccording to an article that was published in the Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, 75 percent of the global population are at least slightly lactose intolerant, and those people affected may benefit greatly from almond milk.\nAlmond milk is also a good option for vegetarians.\nLow Caloric Content\nAlmond milk is good for calorie-watchers because it only contains between 30 and 60 calories per cup. According to a 2003 study that was published in the International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders, combining almonds with low-calorie meals can lead to faster weight loss.\nAccording to the American Heart Association, the monosaturated fats that are found in almond milk are good for the heart. According to a 1999 review that was published in Atherosclerosis Reports, substituting almonds for saturated fats led to a reduction in heart disease by 45 percent.\nA good amount of the riboflavin present in whole almonds makes it into almond milk. Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B12, has various roles in the body. It aids in the production of new red blood cells. According to the National Institutes Health, riboflavin releases energy from carbohydrates.\nHelps In The Prevention Or Management Of Cancer\nA recent study demonstrated the ability of almond milk to prevent the growth of prostate cancer cells. The monosaturated fats that are present in almond milk may also help in the prevention of endometrial cancer. Researchers have revealed that the consumption of monosaturated fats decreases the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a rare form of cancer that affects the liver.\nResearch that was published in the International Journal of Cancer also demonstrated the ability of almond milk to prevent the development of individual breast cancer markers. The study was also published in the American Association of Cancer Research's Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers, and Prevention materials.\nAlmonds have been found to contain natural compounds that help in cancer prevention. Almond milk contains benzaldehyde, which has been shown to exert an anti-cancer effect. It also offers a high amount of fiber, which may help prevent the development of colon cancer. Other nutrients that help promote the body's health include Vitamin E, folate, phosphorus, and zinc.\nThe folate present in almond milk helps fight against cervical cancer. According to researchers based in Finland, almond milk may also assist in the prevention of lung cancers. According to a study that was conducted by scientists from the University of California, almond milk has a significant impact in the prevention of bowel cancer in rats.\nGood For The Skin\nAlmond milk has been shown to be beneficial for skin, nails, and hair. Although it has a few proteins, its zinc content can help keep the skin healthy and also free of blemishes. Lack of zinc can lead to various ailments such as hair loss.\nVitamin E is also required to protect the skin against damage caused by the ultraviolet rays of the sun and is one of the antioxidants found in almond milk. Vitamin E has an antioxidant property that helps remove harmful free radicals that may lead to the development of cancer.\nMay Help Strengthen The Bones\nDairy products are known to be rich in calcium. Almonds, on the other hand, are poor sources of calcium. To make almond milk more similar to dairy milk, manufacturers often enrich it with calcium.\nOne cup of commercial almond milk may contain approximately 50 percent of RDI. The calcium content in cow milk, on the other hand, ranges between 28-31 percent of the RDI. As a result, fortified almond milk is an excellent source of calcium.\nAlmond milk forms the best alternative source of calcium to individuals who do not consume dairy products, such as vegans. Those who are intolerant to lactose or allergic to cow milk can also benefit from almond milk. The calcium mineral is essential for the growth and maintenance of bones. As a result, an adequate intake of almond milk reduces the risks that are associated with the development of osteoporosis, which is more prevalent in women.\nWeak bones and fractures characterize the musculoskeletal condition.\nAids In Weight Loss\nThe low caloric content in almond milk makes it the best diet option for cutting weight. The number of calories found in almond milk range between 40 and 60, compared to goat milk, which has 168 calories per serving.\nAlmond milk is a standard component of diets that encourage the consumption of healthy fats, such as the ketogenic diet. Other low-carb diets often encourage people to include almond milk in their diet.\nBesides the low caloric content that is associated with almond milk, the plant-based milk minimally affects the blood sugar concentration. It is good for individuals who are watching their blood sugar levels. The nutrients that are present in almond milk are used by the body to create energy instead of being stored as fats.\nHelps In The Removal Of Free Radicals From The Body\nAlmond milk is rich in Vitamin E, which is known as a powerful antioxidant. Antioxidants help in the fight against free radicals that are caused by chemicals present in food and sun exposure.\nIt is advisable to eat antioxidants to help prevent oxidative damage that may result from the buildup of these free radicals. Almonds are one of the common sources of Vitamin E.\nBy consuming a significant amount of almond milk, the body acquires sufficient amounts of Vitamin E, which aids the body in the fight against diseases that result from the free radicals.\nPromotes A Healthy Cardiovascular System\nAccording to observational studies, a daily consumption of nuts is linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. Nuts are rich in Vitamin E and healthy fats, which help promote a healthy heart. Almonds are also rich in Vitamin E.\nThe vitamin is believed to be responsible for various health benefits of almond milk. Vitamin E protects the lipids against oxidation, and they also reduce the levels of oxidized LDL cholesterol, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.\nAlmond oil has been shown to contain one percent oil by weight. Approximately, 90 percent of the oil is unsaturated. The fatty acid profile of almond oil is 69 percent oleic acid, 17 percent linoleic acid, and 8 percent palmitic acid. The oleic acid, which is the primary fatty acid in almond milk, is associated with beneficial changes in blood lipids.\nAccording to a study that was performed on healthy adults, a daily consumption of almond milk over a period of six weeks lowered the levels of bad cholesterol in the body by six percent. The blood levels of triglycerides were also reduced by 14 percent, while the levels of good cholesterol were raised by six percent.\nSlows The Progression Of Alzheimer’s Disease\nAlthough Alzheimer's disease does not have any cure, there are natural ways that can be used to prevent or slow the progression of the disorder. Vitamin E that is found in almond milk helps slow down the degeneration that is common in Alzheimer's disease.\nAlmond milk is high in Vitamin A, which is essential for proper functioning of the eyes. Vitamin A has been shown to prevent the development of age-related macular degeneration. It also has antioxidant properties that help protect the eyes from free radical damage.\nHistory & Other Interesting Facts About Almond Milk\nAlmond milk has been in existence since the medieval times. During the Middle Ages, cow milk was not a reliable source of nutrition. One of the reasons to why cow milk was not popular was because it spoiled quickly in the absence of a refrigerator.\nMany Christians did not take cow milk during the Lenten season, which is the period of 40 days between Ash Wednesday and Easter Sunday. During this time, the recipes that included milk were less regarded.\nAlmonds give a more reliable amount of milk compared to cows. Another advantage of almond milk is the fact that it has a longer shelf life than cow milk. Its high-fat content made it possible to churn almond milk into plant-based butter during the Lenten period. Besides the beneficial fatty contents, many healthcare providers during the Middle Ages praised almond milk for its several health benefits.\nThe health care providers prescribed almond milk to their patients to improve their sexual health through increasing sperm production. According to folklore, the consumption of almonds a night before drinking helped to reduce drunkenness.\nDuring the modern times, the popularity of almonds declined due to their low nutritional value compared to cow milk. However, facts have shown that these claims were exaggerated. The popularity of almond milk started to rise again in the early 2000s after some of the drawbacks of soy milk became more widely understood.\nAlmond milk surpassed soy milk in the health sector in the year 2013. In 2014, the almond milk accounted for 60 percent of total sales of plant-based milk. Currently, almond milk accounts for approximately 4.1 percent of overall milk sales in the United States.\nWho Should Not Use Almond Milk?\nIndividuals Who Are Allergic To Tree Nuts\nAlthough almond milk may not contain a lot of almonds, the amount available is sufficient to set off an allergic reaction for those who are allergic to almonds. An almond allergy is categorized as a tree nut allergy, including walnuts, cashew nuts, and Brazil nuts.\nAccording to the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, tree nut allergies may lead to anaphylaxis, which is a severe allergic reaction.\nSymptoms that may present with an almond allergic reaction include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nasal congestion. The patient may also present with other symptoms such as nausea, shortness of breath, and itching.\nAs the popularity of almond grows, more parents are tempted to give it to their infants. Research studies have revealed that this can actually have toxic effects.\nAccording to a study that is found in the French Journal, infants who were given the plant-based milk presented with the signs of edema, hypoalbuminemia, and protein-calorie malnutrition.\nOther effects include iron-deficiency anemia, Vitamin D deficiency, and low growth rate. The article discourages the administration of the plant-based milk to infants.\nRisks Associated With Almond Milk\nSome almond milk products contain carrageenan, which is a controversial thickener that is derived from seaweed. It is commonly included in many products to provide texture, such as in ice-cream.\nAccording to a study that was published in Environmental Health Perspectives, carrageenan is a leading cause of inflammation and inflammatory bowel diseases. The natural compound is also associated with colorectal malignancy.\nIt is advisable to check the labels on the almond milk packaging to confirm that the brand chosen does not contain carrageenan.\nBecause nut allergies are common, an individual who is susceptible to almond allergies should not drink almond milk.\nThere have been reports of children developing kidney stones due to excessive consumption of almond milk. The kidney stones are as a result of oxalate compounds, which are found in almonds.\nIt is advisable to give children almond milk in moderation. Almond milk can be substituted with coconut milk or goat milk to prevent the buildup of oxalate compounds in the body.\nNutritional Benefits Of Almond Milk Conclusion\nAlmond milk is easy to make at home.

The popularity of almond milk has grown due to the desire of many individuals to find an alternative to cow milk.\nIt is advisable to try a homemade almond milk before going for the commercial ones. One can also choose start with the organic, unsweetened almond milk that is free from carrageenan.","Peruse most supermarkets today and you will find an abundance of milk that doesn’t come from a cow. There’s milk made from soy, almonds, hemp seed, rice, coconut, sunflower seeds and other ingredients.\nPeople search for alternatives to traditional milk for a variety of reasons. Some people are lactose intolerant, some are vegan or following a dairy-free diet and others simply don’t like the flavor.\nBut with so many nondairy choices available, picking the right milk alternative can be confusing.\nJulie Hood Gonsalves, a registered dietitian and an associate professor of human biology at Central Oregon Community College, helped us sort through the options. In general, she said, milk alternatives “have come a long way” in terms of taste and selection.\nWhen selecting a nondairy option, Hood Gonsalves suggests people consider what role milk plays in their diets. “It depends on the person and what they need,” she said. Are you using a glug of milk in your morning coffee or does milk account for a large proportion of your daily protein and calcium intake? Children, in particular, tend to fall into the latter category.\n“Since calcium and protein are the most important nutrients we’d be expecting to find in this food group, those are what we would be looking for in substitutes,” Hood Gonsalves said. (Whole cow’s milk has 148 calories, 7 g fat, 8 g protein, 300 mg calcium and 12 g sugar per 8-ounce serving.)\nWhile many nondairy choices are fortified with calcium and vitamin D, many do not have as much protein as milk. She also cautions individuals to watch for sugar, which is often added to improve flavor.\nHood Gonsalves also points out individuals can try to make their own nondairy milk. “You can make substitutes with about anything … add water, let it soak, blend and strain. The taste, the texture, the nutrient availability are all dependent on what you start with and whether it is fortified,” she said.\nNutrition values among milk alternatives vary depending on the particular manufacturer; many of these nondairy drinks are also fortified with additional nutrients and vitamins. The following information is a basic guide. •\nBasis for comparison: whole cow’s milk\nNutrition per 8-ounce serving: 148 calories, 7 g fat, 8 g protein, 300 mg calcium, 12 g sugar\nPros: The protein found in milk is a complete protein, which means it has all of the essential amino acids needed to build proteins for the our body.\nCons: The fat found in milk is primarily saturated fat, which has been shown to increase cholesterol levels; some people have difficulty digesting lactose, the sugar found in milk.\n1) Hemp milk\nNutrition per 8-ounce serving: 80 calories, 7 g fat, 2 g protein, 300-400 mg calcium (if fortified), 1 g sugar (14 g if sweetened), 0 g fiber\nPros: The fat in hemp milk (which is made from legal hemp seed) is primarily unsaturated and contains a large amount of omega 3, good for inflammation and heart disease. Unsweetened versions contain little sugar.\nCons: Not a good source of protein. In general, this can be an expensive choice.\nTaste: Rich and creamy.\n2) Soy milk\nNutrition per 8-ounce serving: 70 calories, 4 g fat, 8 g protein, 300-550 mg calcium (if fortified), 3 g sugar (12 g if sweetened), 2 g fiber\nPros: Soy is one of the rare nondairy choices that is high in protein. The fat in soy milk is also good, as it is primarily unsaturated and also contains some omega 3 fatty acids.\nCons: The protein is not nearly as complete as cow’s milk.\nTaste: Thick and creamy consistency, similar to whole milk. Nutty flavor. Can be substituted for milk in most savory recipes, although since it adds some soy flavor, not a best pick for desserts.\n3) Coconut milk (not canned)\nNutrition per 8-ounce serving: 45 calories, 4.5 g fat, 0 g protein, 300-400 mg calcium (if fortified), 7 g sugar\nPros: Relatively low in sugar. The fat is saturated, but new evidence suggests it is not unhealthy like other saturated fats.\nCons: No protein.\nTaste: Creamy and rich with a bit of coconut flavor. Good in coffee or tea as well as by the glass. Substitutes well in baking, but adds a sweet coconut flavor.\n4) Almond milk\nNutrition per 8-ounce serving: 40 calories, 3 g fat, 1 g protein, 300-400 mg calcium (if fortified), 1 g sugar (15 g if sweetened), 1 g fiber\nPros: The fat is primarily unsaturated. If unsweetened, almond milk is a very low-sugar choice.\nCons: Protein levels are very low and the protein is not complete.\nTaste: Sweet and nutty. Goes well in tea or coffee as well as in cereal. Also a good baking substitute, although it will add a hint of almond.\n5) Rice milk\nNutrition per 8-ounce serving: 70 calories, 2 g fat, 1 g protein, 300-400 mg calcium (if fortified), 13 g sugar, 0 g fiber\nPros: Low in fat; relatively inexpensive for a milk alternative.\nCons: Very high in sugar and very low in protein.\nTaste: Sweet and rather thin — almost watery and light — in consistency. Some people think this is the best milk for replicating a glass of milk. Works well as a milk substitute in desserts, but is too sweet for most savory preparations.\n6) Flax milk\nNutrition per 8-ounce serving: 30 calories, 2.5 g fat, 0 g protein, 300-400 mg calcium (if fortified), 0 g sugar (8 g if sweetened), 3 g fiber\nPros: Contains Omega 3s. High in fiber.\nCons: Very little protein.\nTaste: Neutral flavor with some body.\nSource: Nutrition information provided by Julie Hood Gonsalves, the USDA and manufacturers’ information"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1f15e4a7-bff9-4377-84e3-043a083a9f03>","<urn:uuid:eb96e552-4d72-457a-a7cd-5a6f6e196553>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do water needs compare between cattle and humans in hot conditions?","answer":"During hot conditions, cattle have significantly higher water requirements than humans. Cows and bulls need 15-20 gallons of water per day during summer months, and their water requirements double when temperatures increase from 50 to 95 degrees F. In contrast, humans are typically recommended to drink about 2 liters (approximately half a gallon) per day according to the 8x8 rule, though individual needs may vary based on factors like activity level and climate.","context":["Water is the most important nutrient for cattle. It accounts for 50 to 80 percent of an animal's weight and is\ninvolved in every physiological process. Cattle must have free access to all the quality water they will consume.\nWithout water, feed intake greatly decreases, the animal becomes dehydrated and body functions fail. Water\navailability and quality can become a major issue during a drought. It is important to check water sources frequently\nduring a drought for water availability and quality.\nThe amount of water an animal needs each day depends upon size, stage of production, condition and average\ndaily temperature. Table 1 shows the water requirements at a daily high temperature of 90 degrees F for various\nclasses of beef cattle. Water requirements double when temperatures increase from 50 to 95 degrees F. Cows\nand bulls will need 15 to 20 gallons of water per day during the summer months. Diet also affects the amount of\nwater an animal will need every day. Cattle grazing lush growth that contains 75 percent water need much less\nadditional water than cattle fed dry feeds or hay containing only 10 percent water.\n|Table 1. Daily water requirements for cattle when the daily high temperature is 90 degrees F.|\n|Type of Cattle||Daily gallons required\nper 100 lbs of body weight\nDuring a drought, water quality declines as the concentration of pollutants increases when water evaporates and\nbecomes stagnant. Many compounds in water can negatively affect cattle performance and health.\nWater containing high levels of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) are commonly found in wells in coastal regions, and can lower feed intake and daily gains of beef cattle. Lower gains and feed intake is not affected if the TDS level is below 3,000 ppm (parts per million); however, do not use water containing a TDS level greater than 5,000 ppm for cattle. Several studies have shown that TDS in the 4,000 to 5,000 ppm range have lowered stocker cattle gains and decreased milk production in lactating cows, causing a reduction in weaning weights.\nNitrates from manure and fertilizer are an increasing problem affecting water quality. During periods of drought, pond water and streams become stagnant and evaporate, resulting in higher concentrations of pollutants such as nitrates. Monitor levels of nitrates in the water. More than 300 ppm is considered unsafe, less than 100 ppm safe and 100-300 ppm is questionable for cattle. When pasture or feed that is high in nitrates is fed, water contamination can become a serious problem. Death can occur when cattle consume water high in nitrates, but chronic toxicity is more common. Chronic toxicity causes the animal to eat less and thus have lower performance. Younger cattle are much more susceptible to nitrate poisoning. Avoid digging ponds near areas where runoff from cropland or livestock facilities may occur.\nOther substances that cause water quality problems include sulfur, iron and manganese. These minerals decrease water intake because of foul flavors and/or odor. Another common problem is excessive levels of minerals that interfere with normal mineral absorption and lead to deficiencies. This is most common with high iron and sulfate levels that bind and prevent the absorption of copper and zinc.\nWater temperature can also affect cattle performance. Cool water helps cattle maintain proper body temperature and leads to increased water intake. Shallow ponds or small water troughs can heat up in the summer and lead to decreased water intake. Deep ponds and groundwater pumped into large water tanks do not generally heat up enough to affect water intake.\nBlue-green algae is a water quality problem usually seen in surface water that is rich in nutrients. Bluegreen algae are actually bacteria that, under the right conditions, can potentially produce toxins that can kill cattle. Toxicity problems usually occur when cattle consume large amounts of the algae in the summer or early fall following a rapid bloom of algae. The best methods to control algae are to eliminate the source of nutrients entering the water, aerate the water or fence the cattle away from the pond and pump water to a tank. If the intake pipe in the pond is at least 3 feet below the surface, intake of blue green algae toxins is minimal.\nPond versus trough:\nPonds are an important source of water for many cattle herds. To improve water quality in ponds, use fencing to prevent cattle gaining access, thereby reducing pond sedimentation. A pipe can be installed to run drinking water to a tank at the base of the dam. Researchers have documented a 9 percent higher weight gain in nursing calves when the drinking water for the cow-calf pairs came from a trough compared to cattle drinking directly from a pond.\nWater is the most important nutrient for cattle, but providing clean water for cattle is often overlooked. Most problems will occur in the summer when pond water is contaminated with manure, dissolved solids, nitrates, algae or sulfates. Poor water quality can lead to poor performance and poor reproduction that often goes unnoticed, but that can be deadly as well. Special attention should be given to water quality during the hot summer months when most problems occur. Using the best quality of water available will contribute to the optimal production of cattle. Drinking water quality should be part of an evaluation when there is a problem with poor cattle performance. The only way to know if a problem exists is to test the water for anti-quality factors.

To prevent dehydration, you need to drink adequate amounts of water.\nThere are many different opinions on how much water you should be drinking every day.\nHealth authorities commonly recommend eight 8-ounce glasses, which equals about 2 liters, or half a gallon. This is called the 8×8 rule and is very easy to remember.\nHowever, some health gurus believe that you need to sip on water constantly throughout the day, even when you’re not thirsty.\nAs with most things, this depends on the individual. Many factors (both internal and external) ultimately affect your need for water.\nThis article takes a look at some water intake studies to separate fact from fiction and explains how to easily match water intake to your individual needs.\nDoes Water Intake Affect Energy Levels and Brain Function?\nMany people claim that if you don’t stay hydrated throughout the day, your energy levels and brain function start to suffer.\nAnd there are plenty of studies to support this.\nOne study in women showed that a fluid loss of 1.36% after exercise impaired mood and concentration and increased the frequency of headaches (1).\nKeep in mind that just 1% of body weight is a fairly significant amount. This happens primarily when you’re sweating a lot.\nDoes Drinking a Lot of Water Help You Lose Weight?\nThere are many claims that increased water intake may reduce body weight by increasing your metabolism and reducing your appetite.\nAccording to two studies, drinking 17 ounces (500 ml) of water can temporarily boost metabolism by 24–30% (8).\nThe image below shows this effect. The top line shows how 17 ounces (500 ml) of water increased metabolism. Notice how this effect decreases before the 90-minute mark (9):\nThe researchers estimated that drinking 68 ounces (2 liters) in one day increased energy expenditure by about 96 calories per day.\nAdditionally, it may be beneficial to drink cold water because your body will need to expend more calories to heat the water to body temperature.\nOne study showed that dieters who drank 17 ounces (500 ml) of water before each meal lost 44% more weight over 12 weeks, compared to those who didn’t (12).\nOverall, it seems that drinking adequate amounts of water, particularly before meals, may have a significant weight loss benefit, especially when combined with a healthy diet.\nWhat’s more, adequate water intake has a number of other health benefits.\nDoes More Water Help Prevent Health Problems?\nSeveral health problems supposedly respond well to increased water intake:\n- Constipation: Increasing water intake can help with constipation, a very common problem (13, 14, 15).\n- Cancer: Some studies show that those who drink more water have a lower risk of bladder and colorectal cancer, although other studies find no effect (16, 17, 18, 19).\n- Kidney stones: Increased water intake may decrease the risk of kidney stones (20, 21).\n- Acne and skin hydration: There are a lot of anecdotal reports about how water can help hydrate the skin and reduce acne. So far, no studies have confirmed or refuted this.\nDo Other Fluids Count Toward Your Total?\nPlain water is not the only drink that contributes to your fluid balance. Other drinks and foods can have a significant effect.\nOne myth is that caffeinated drinks, such as coffee or tea, don’t help you hydrate because caffeine is a diuretic.\nIn fact, studies show that the diuretic effect of these beverages is very weak (22).\nMost foods are also loaded with water. Meat, fish, eggs and especially fruits and vegetables all contain significant amounts of water.\nFor more ideas, check out this article on 19 water-rich foods.\nTogether, coffee or tea and water-rich foods can help maintain your fluid balance.\nTrust Your Thirst — It’s There for a Reason\nMaintaining water balance is essential for your survival.\nFor this reason, your body has a sophisticated system for regulating when and how much you drink.\nWhen your total water content goes below a certain level, thirst kicks in.\nThis is controlled by mechanisms similar to breathing — you don’t need to consciously think about it.\nFor the majority of people, there probably isn’t any need to worry about water intake. The thirst instinct is very reliable (23).\nThere really is no science behind the 8×8 rule. It is completely arbitrary (24).\nThat said, certain circumstances may call for increased water intake.\nThe most important one may be during times of increased sweating. This includes exercise and hot weather, especially in a dry climate.\nIf you’re sweating a lot, make sure to replenish the lost fluid with water. Athletes doing very long, intense exercises may also need to replenish electrolytes along with water.\nYour water need also increases during breastfeeding, as well as several disease states like vomiting and diarrhea.\nFurthermore, older people may need to consciously watch their water intake because the thirst mechanisms can start to malfunction in old age (25).\nHow Much Water Is Best?\nAt the end of the day, no one can tell you exactly how much water you need. This depends on the individual.\nTry experimenting to see what works best for you. Some people may function better with more water than usual, while for others it only results in more frequent trips to the bathroom.\nIf you want to keep things simple, these guidelines should apply to the majority of people:\n- When you’re thirsty, drink.\n- When you’re not thirsty anymore, stop.\n- During high heat and exercise, make sure to drink enough to compensate for the lost fluids.\n- That’s it!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:56ac4dac-d3d2-40b8-9953-4681a3fad835>","<urn:uuid:0cedce08-b5e9-4f21-98cf-949f3301c366>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the traditional preparation techniques differ between a classic Jewish deli 'schmear' and the olive salad preparation in a Muffuletta, and what role do these components play in their respective sandwiches?","answer":"The 'schmear' is a thin spread technique traditionally used with butter or cream cheese on bagels and other baked goods, serving as a foundational element in deli sandwiches. In contrast, the Muffuletta's olive salad preparation is more complex, requiring multiple steps including infusing olive oil with garlic for 15-20 minutes, processing olives with pickled vegetables and seasonings, and allowing the mixture to marinate for several hours or overnight. While a schmear is applied directly as a condiment, the olive salad in a Muffuletta is an integral component that needs time to develop its flavors and is crucial to the sandwich's characteristic taste.","context":["Fueled by the national movement to revive all kinds of traditional products—pickles, cured meats, artisanal breads—traditional Jewish-American deli delights are being reinterpreted with sustainable, high-quality ingredients and a modern, signature edge.\n1.

While the recipe may seem daunting, it’s easy to make if you follow these crucial steps and don’t skip any of them. The bread needs time to soak up some liquid in order to allow it to soften; use enough oil so that there are no dry patches on the bottom when cooked; cover with plastic wrap while cooking so that the dough doesn’t form condensation during frying which can water down flavor.\nThe “easy muffuletta recipe” is an easy-to-follow recipe that will help you make a delicious and authentic New Orleans classic. The recipe includes layers of ham, cheese, olive salad and a sweet tomato sauce.\nLook no farther than the muffuletta if you’re looking for a delicious, tasty sandwich to serve a crowd. Layers of tangy marinated olive salad, loads of cheese, and charcuterie make up the muffuletta, a typical New Orleans sandwich.\nSalami, mortadella, olives, and giardiniera are used to make this delectable sandwich (Italian-style pickled veggies). Despite the fact that the sandwich did not originate in Italy, the word muffuletta alludes to a sort of circular Sicilian sesame bread.\nMuffuletta sandwiches are quick and simple to cook, and they’re ideal for any gathering with a big company. Make this wonderful muffuletta sandwich for picnics, potlucks, or parties, and everyone will rave about it.\nWhat is Muffuletta, exactly?\nSandwiches called muffuletta or muffaletta (pronounced muff-uh-lah-tuh) are a traditional New Orleans dish. It’s a crowd-pleaser when feeding a large company, and it’s always a hit with visitors.\nDelicious layers of charcuterie, olive salad, and cheese are served in a huge, fluffy muffuletta bread loaf. The sandwich’s name comes from a sort of huge, round Sicilian bread topped with sesame seeds.\nHowever, do not mistake muffuletta filling with giardiniera. Muffuletta is mostly composed of olives, while giardiniera is primarily composed of vegetables.\nOrigins of the Muffuletta Sandwich\nWith all of the Italian components in the muffuletta, you’d assume it was invented in Italy, but it was really invented in New Orleans by Italian immigrants.\nSalvatore Lupo, according to legend, invented the muffuletta in the early twentieth century and offered it to his clients at his grocery shop. He created it as a convenient method for his clients to consume their antipasti, which consisted of bread, meat, and olives. The sandwich was a huge success, and muffulettas can now be found all around New Orleans.\nIngredients in a Muffuletta Sandwich\nMuffuletta is an antipasti sandwich consisting of meats, bread, olives, and cheese.\nTo prepare the olive salad dressing, combine olive oil and garlic, then add lots of green and black olives (the finest are kalamata), a shallot, giardiniera (Pickled vegetables in the Italian style), and oregano.\nYou’ll need muffuletta bread or any big, circular bread that can accommodate all of the fixings to make a sandwich.\nUse mortadella, prosciutto, ham, salami (particularly Genoa salami), and either spicy or sweet soppressata for charcuterie.\nFinally, some cheese is required. The provolone and mozzarella cheeses are used in the muffuletta.\nMuffuletta: A Step-by-Step Guide\nIt’s simple to prepare and make a muffuletta, but you’ll want to allow yourself a few hours before serving it — read on to find out why.\nOlive Salad Preparation\nTo make a muffuletta sandwich, start by Olive Salad Preparation. Combine the olive oil and garlic in a bowl, then leave it for 15 to 20 minutes so the garlic can impart its flavor to the oil. Put the olives, pickled vegetables, shallot, and oregano into a food processor and coarsely chop the mixture.\nFill a bowl halfway with the chopped olive mixture. Toss it with half of the garlic oil and sherry vinegar. Allow the flavors to mingle for a few hours or overnight before serving. The greater the taste, the longer you leave it.\nPutting Together the Muffuletta Sandwich\nBegin by slicing the bread in half horizontally to construct the sandwich. Brush each half well with the remaining garlic oil using a pastry brush. In a large skillet, toast each half of bread until golden brown.\nSpread the olive salad on the toasted bread’s bottom half. On top of the olives, layer the salami, then the ham. Provolone, mozzarella, mortadella, prosciutto, and soppressata are added last.\nServe the remaining olive salad on top of the meat. With the second half of the bread, seal the sandwich.\nPutting the Sandwich Together\nYou’ll need to compress your muffuletta sandwich to make it lovely and compact. Wrap the sandwich in a couple of layers of cling film to begin. Place a heavy pot or book on top and set aside for an hour. Flip the sandwich over and continue to crush it for another hour. Remove the cling film before slicing and serving.\nMuffuletta: How to Serve It\nMuffulettas are usually served at room temperature, but if you like, you may cook the sandwich. Serve a green salad, chips, or fries as a side dish; muffulettas are pretty meaty, so keep any side dish you select light.\nMuffuletta Sandwiches: How to Make the Best\nReplace the meat with veggies to create a vegetarian muffuletta. Great possibilities are roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, cauliflower, roasted eggplant, or pepperoncini.\nDepending on whether you like a spicier sandwich, use either hot or sweet soppressata.\nAllow the olive salad to marinate overnight or for up to a week in the fridge for the finest taste.\nIf you don’t have any sherry vinegar on hand, apple cider vinegar or red wine vinegar will suffice.\nStore your muffuletta in the fridge if you aren’t going to serve it straight away. This sandwich should be kept refrigerated for no more than 2 hours.\nFor a simple delicious version, replace the oregano with basil.\nHow to Keep a Muffuletta Fresh\nRefrigerate the sandwiches for up to 3 days after wrapping them in cling film.\nIs it Possible to Freeze a Muffuletta Sandwich?\nAbsolutely! While fresh muffulettas are preferable, you can certainly freeze this sandwich. Simply slice the muffuletta into individual slices, cover them tightly in cling film or foil, and freeze for up to one month. Refrigerate them overnight to thaw.\nfor the salad with olives\npitted castelvetrano olives\nPickled vegetables in the Italian style\nto taste kosher salt and freshly ground pepper\nto make a sandwich\nthinly sliced genoa salami\nIn a mixing dish, combine the olive oil and garlic.

The route is also believed to be the first crossing of the Sierras by a non-native, Jedediah Smith, in the spring of 1827 during an exploratory journey. John Ebbetts, traversed the pass in April 1851 with a large train of mules. He was looking for a possible route for the transcontinental railroad but determine it was not suitable. The pass was named after him in 1893.

{"question":"What remedies are available in Rhode Island discrimination cases versus California workplace retaliation cases?","answer":"In Rhode Island discrimination cases, state law does not permit compensatory damages (for emotional pain and suffering) or punitive damages (to punish the employer), which is why many attorneys file in federal court instead. In California workplace retaliation cases, available remedies include damages for emotional distress (including physical pain, loss of enjoyment of life, and anxiety), damages for harm to professional reputation, lost wages from retaliatory actions like demotion or denial of promotion, and in False Claims Act cases, additional remedies like reinstatement with same seniority status, double back pay, interest on back pay, and punitive damages where appropriate.","context":["Filing a Discrimination Claim - Rhode Island\nEmployment discrimination is the practice of unfairly treating a person or group of people differently from other people or groups of other people at work, because of their membership in a legally protected category such as race, sex, age, or religion. Each state has passed laws and rules to protect your workplace rights: this page covers Rhode Island employment discrimination. The purpose of Rhode Island antidiscrimination law is to protect workers in Rhode Island from unlawful discrimination in employment. Read below to learn more about Rhode Island employment law and how the law protects you.\n1. What kinds of discrimination are against state law in Rhode Island?\nRhode Island law makes it illegal for an employer to discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex , disability, ancestral origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression and age (at least 40 years of age).\n2. How do I file a discrimination claim in Rhode Island?\nIn Rhode Island, a discrimination claim can be filed either with the state administrative agency, RICHR Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights (RICHR), or the federal administrative agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The two agencies have what is called a “work-sharing agreement,” which means that the agencies cooperate with each other to process claims. The two agencies have what is called a “work-sharing agreement,” which means that the agencies cooperate with each other to process claims. Filing a claim with both agencies is unnecessary, as long as you indicate to one of the agencies that you want it to “cross-file” the claim with the other agency. Some attorneys recommend that you file with the RICHR first for all discrimination claims.\nTo file a claim with the RICHR, contact its office below. More information about filing a claim with RICHR can be found at the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights website.\nRhode Island Commission for Human Rights\n180 Westminster Street, 3rd Floor\nProvidence, RI 02903\nTo file a claim with the EEOC, contact your local EEOC office below. More information about filing a claim with the EEOC can be found at the EEOC Filing a Charge page.\nEEOC's Boston Area Local Office\n475 Government Center\nBoston, MA 02203\nEEOC has launched an online service that enables individuals who have filed a discrimination charge to check the status of their charge online. This service provides a portal to upload and receive documents and communicate with the EEOC, allowing for a faster transmitting period. Those who have filed a charge can access information about their charge at their convenience, and allow entities that have been charged to receive the same information on the status of the charge. All of the EEOC offices now use the Digital Charge System. If you file on or after September 2, 2016, the Online Charge Status System is available for use. The system is not available for charges filed prior to this date or for charges filed with EEOC's state and local Fair Employment Practices Agencies. The system can be accessed at the EEOC website. If you do not have internet or need language assistance, you may call the toll-free number at 1-800-669-4000. For additional help, you may also call the toll free number to retrieve the same information provided in the Online Charge Status System.\n3. What are my time deadlines?\nDo not delay in contacting the RICHR or EEOC to file a claim. There are strict time limits in which charges of employment discrimination must be filed. To preserve your claim under state law, you must file with the RICHR (or cross-file with the EEOC) within 1 year of the date you believe you were discriminated against. To preserve your claim under federal law, generally you must file with the EEOC (or cross-file with the state agency) within 180 days from the date the discrimination took place. If a state or local agency enforces a law that prohibits employment discrimination, then the deadline is extended to 300 days. For age discrimination claims, there must be state law that prohibits age discrimination and a state agency to enforce the law, for the 300 day extension to apply.However, as you might have other legal claims with shorter deadlines, do not wait to file your claim until your time limit is close to expiring. You may wish to consult with an attorney prior to filing your claim, if possible. Yet if you are unable to find an attorney who will assist you, it is not necessary to have an attorney to file your claim with the state and federal administrative agencies.\n4. What happens after I file a charge with the EEOC?\nWhen your charge is filed, the EEOC will give you a copy of your charge with your charge number. Within 10 days, the EEOC will also send a notice and a copy of the charge to the employer. At that point, the EEOC may decide to do one of the following:\n- Ask both you and the employer to take part in a mediation program\n- Ask the employer to provide a written answer to your charge and answer questions related to your claim, then your charge will be given to an investigator\n- Dismiss the claim if your charge was not filed in time or if the EEOC does not have jurisdiction\nIf the EEOC decides to investigate your charge, the EEOC may interview witnesses and gather documents. Once the investigation is complete, they will let you and the employer know the result. If they decides that discrimination did not occur then they will send you a “Notice of Right to Sue.” This notice gives you permission to file a lawsuit in a court of law. If the EEOC determines that discrimination occurred then they will try to reach a voluntary settlement with the employer. If a settlement cannot reached, your case will be referred to the EEOC’s legal staff (or the Department of Justice in certain cases), who will decide whether or not the agency should file a lawsuit. If the EEOC decides not to file a lawsuit then they will give you a “Notice of Right to Sue.” `\nHow long the investigation takes depends on a lot of different things, including the amount of information that needs to be gathered and analyzed. On average, it takes the EEOC nearly 6 months to investigate a charge. A charge is often able to settle faster through mediation (usually in less than 3 months).\n5. How can I or my attorney pursue a claim in court in Rhode Island?\nIf your case is successfully resolved by an administrative agency, it may not be necessary to hire an attorney or file a lawsuit (to resolve your case, you probably will be required as to sign a release of your legal claims). If your case is not resolved by the RICHR or EEOC, and you may want to continue to pursue the matter, you will need to pursue your claim in court. A federal employment discrimination case cannot be filed in court without first going to the EEOC, as discussed above, and the EEOC dismisses the charge. This process is called “exhaustion” of your administrative remedy. Similarly, before you can proceed with a lawsuit based on your state discrimination claim, you must file with the RICHR.\nBecause Rhode Island law does not permit the compensatory (emotional pain and suffering) and punitive (damages which punish the employer) damages and attorneys' fees allowed under federal law, many Rhode Island attorneys choose to file employment discrimination cases in federal court. A case filed in state court using federal law may be subject to removal, which means that a defendant employer requests to move the case to federal court because it involves a federal statute, such as Title VII or the ADEA.\nOnly once the EEOC issues the document known as “Dismissal and Notice of Rights” or “Notice of Right to Sue” (Form 161) can you file a case based upon your federal claim. A lawsuit based on your federal discrimination claim must be filed in federal or state court within 90 days of the date you receive the notice. (Be sure to mark down that date when you receive the notice.) A lawsuit based on your state claim must be filed within 120 days of receiving the RICHR's similar “right-to-sue” or dismissal letter, or within 1 year of the date you believe you were discriminated against, whichever is earlier. These deadlines are called the “statute of limitations.” If you have received one of these agency dismissal letters, do not delay consulting with an attorney. If your lawsuit is not filed by the deadline, then you may lose your ability to pursue a discrimination case.\n© 2021 Workplace Fairness","Under California employment law, employers may not engage in workplace retaliation against employees who\n- report violations of law,1\n- oppose, complain about or participate in an investigation of workplace harassment or employment discrimination,2\n- request reasonable accommodations for a disability or their religious beliefs,3 or\n- file or assist in a \"qui tam\" lawsuit under the California False Claims Act.4\nThese workplace retaliation laws fill an important gap in California employment law. While employees are protected against wrongful termination in a variety of circumstances, employees who do not lose their jobs--but instead experience adverse employment actions, abuse or other forms of retaliation at work--have a harder time finding legal remedies.\nBut the workplace retaliation provisions of California's whistleblower laws and Fair Employment and Housing Act (\"FEHA\") retaliation laws provide a legal remedy for employees whose employers retaliate against them--but do not fire them--for exercising their rights under these laws.\nBelow, our California labor law attorneys discuss the following topics:\n- 1. How to Tell If Your Employer is Engaging in Workplace Retaliation\n- 2. Employer Retaliation for Whistleblowing / Reporting a Violation of Law\n- 3. FEHA Workplace Retaliation\n- 4. False Claims Act (Qui Tam) Workplace Retaliation\n- 5. Lawsuits and Damages for California Workplace Retaliation\nIf you have further questions after reading this article, we invite you to contact us at Shouse Law Group.\nThe basic legal definition of workplace retaliation in California is:\n- Your employer takes an adverse employment action against you or treats you in a discriminatory manner,\n- Because you engaged in a protected activity.\nWhen the adverse employment action is a termination (job loss), then it is easy to identify this as a case of potential wrongful termination.\nSimilarly, if your employer responds to the exercise of your legal rights by making your working conditions so intolerable that you have no choice but to resign, then you have a case against the employer for wrongful constructive termination.\nBut other forms of employer retaliation can be more subtle--and harder to spot. Some telltale signs that your employer might be retaliating against you include:\n- You begin receiving negative performance reviews even though your previous reviews were positive;\n- Your workload is increased;\n- You are assigned to less desirable shifts;\n- Your supervisors exclude you from meetings or correspondence or otherwise make it difficult for you to perform well on your projects;\n- You are denied a promotion or raise that you think you deserved;\n- You are subject to disciplinary action on trumped-up charges or inadequate grounds; and\n- You are denied access to resources or training that would help you maintain your work quality or advance your career.\nUnder California Labor Code 1102.5 LC, employers may not engage in retaliation against employees who\n- report suspected criminal activity by their employer to a government or law enforcement agency,\n- report a suspected violation of a law or regulation to a supervisor or other person at the employer who has the authority to investigate the violation, or\n- provide information to or testify before any government body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into a potential violation of law by their employer.5\nLC 1102.5 is a so-called \"whistleblower protection\" law. A whistleblower protection law generally protects employees from both firing/termination AND less severe forms of employer retaliation for reporting suspected legal violations by their employer.\nYou are protected by this whistleblower retaliation law even if it turns out that your employer did not actually break the law. All that matters is that you reasonably believed that your employer may have done something illegal.6\nExample: Nikolai works for a software company. Based on some conversations he has overheard, he believes that his company may be engaging in violations of antitrust laws with another similar company. Nikolai reports his suspicions to an in-house lawyer at the company.\nThe lawyer investigates the report and determines that nothing illegal is going on. But she also lets the CEO of the company know that Nikolai was the one who reported his suspicions to her.\nAfter that, Nikolai is not given assignments on important projects at work. His performance reviews also suddenly turn negative. He is passed over for a promotion that he had previously been told he could get.\nNikolai may be the victim of workplace retaliation for his whistleblowing activities.\nThe California Fair Employment and Housing Act (the \"FEHA\") protects employees from retaliation if they do any of the following:\n- Oppose acts of harassment or employment discrimination or an employer's failure to grant required pregnancy/family leave;\n- File a complaint about harassment or discrimination;\n- Testify or assist in any proceeding under the FEHA; or\n- Request workplace accommodations for their religious beliefs or observance or for a disability.7\nFEHA retaliation under California employment law occurs when any of the above activities by an employee is a substantial motivating factor for adverse employment actions against, or discriminatory treatment of, that employee.8\nExample: Robia is a Muslim. She gets a job at a call center working long shifts.\nRobia's religious beliefs require her to take regular breaks to pray over the course of the day. She asks her boss if she can take these breaks and use a supply closet for her prayers.\nRobia's boss agrees because he does not want to be accused of religious discrimination. But he is not happy about the inconvenience this causes. So he begins assigning Robia to less desirable night and weekend shifts, and he does not allow her to attend several trainings that could have helped her rise in the company.\nRobia's boss is guilty of workplace retaliation under the FEHA.\nThe California False Claims Act also prohibits employer retaliation against employees who take advantage of their rights under that law.\nThe California False Claims Act gives employees the right to file a so-called \"qui tam\" lawsuit against an employer who is committing fraud, theft or embezzlement with respect to government funds. (A \"qui tam\" lawsuit is a suit filed by a private citizen on behalf of a government entity.)9\nThe workplace retaliation provisions of the California False Claims Act prohibit your employer from retaliating against you if you\n- file, or assist in any way with, a qui tam suit, or\n- make an effort to stop a violation of the California False Claims Act.10\nExample: Ted is a manager for a construction company that does a lot of work under state government contracts. He suspects that his company has been overbilling the government. So he files a qui tam suit in state court. The California Attorney General's office then takes over the lawsuit.\nTed's boss understands that it would be illegal to fire him over the qui tam suit and that it would probably make the company look bad in the lawsuit. But the boss demotes Ted instead.\nTed probably has a case against his employer for California False Claims Act workplace retaliation.\nDifferent California workplace retaliation laws offer different options for employees who are retaliated against by their employer.\nLabor Code 1102.5 LC\nIf you think you have been a victim of whistleblower retaliation under Labor Code 1102.5 LC, you must first notify the California Labor and Workplace Development Agency through an online form and your employer via certified mail.11\nAfter you file this notice, the Labor and Workplace Development Agency may decide to investigate your complaint itself. If it chooses not to do so, you may file your own lawsuit in California Superior Court.12\nFEHA workplace retaliation\nIf your employer retaliates against you for exercising your rights under the Fair Employment and Housing Act, then your first move is to file a complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH).\nYou may then sue your employer for workplace retaliation once the DFEH issues a \"right to sue\" notice.13\nCalifornia False Claims Act workplace retaliation\nYou may file a lawsuit against your employer immediately if you are a victim of workplace retaliation under the California False Claims Act.14\nDamages for workplace retaliation\nDamages in a workplace retaliation case will be somewhat different than damages in a California wrongful termination case. This is because wrongful termination damages typically include the value of lost pay and benefits attributable to the loss of the plaintiff's job.\nIn a workplace retaliation case, though, damages are more likely to include:\n- Damages for emotional distress arising from your mistreatment at work--including physical pain, loss of enjoyment of life and/or anxiety;\n- Damages for harm done to your professional reputation as a result of retaliatory adverse employment actions (such as demotion, being denied a promotion or being denied professional development or work opportunities); and/or\n- Lost wages from a retaliatory demotion or denial of a promotion or raise.15\nCall us for help...\nFor questions about California law on workplace retaliation or to discuss your case confidentially with one of our skilled California labor and employment attorneys, do not hesitate to contact us at Shouse Law Group.\nWe have local employment law offices in and around Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange County, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, San Jose, Oakland, the San Francisco Bay area, and several nearby cities.\n- Labor Code 1102.5 LC -- Employer or person acting on behalf of employer; prohibition of disclosure of information by employee to government or law enforcement agency; suspected violation or noncompliance to federal or state law; retaliation; civil penalties [whistleblower workplace retaliation].

{"question":"Who faced more serious revolts - Nero during his rule or Augustus in 6 AD?","answer":"Augustus faced more serious revolts in 6 AD, with mass protests, seditious pamphlets, and severe grain shortages leading to unrest in Rome, plus a major revolt in Illyricum requiring emergency decrees and troop levies. In contrast, while Nero dealt with revolts in Britain led by Queen Boadicea in 61 AD and unrest in Judea in 66 AD, these were more localized provincial conflicts rather than systematic challenges to Roman authority.","context":["Octavian was too shrewd to alienate the people of Rome by formally breaking with the past and proclaiming an empire. He sought to preserve republican forms, but also to remake the government along the lines suggested by Caesar. After sixty years of internal strife, the population welcomed a ruler who promised order.\nMoving gradually, and using his huge personal fortune—now enlarged by the enormous revenues of Egypt—Octavian paid for the pensions of his own troops and settled over one hundred thousand of them on their own lands in Italy and abroad. He was consul, inzperator (a military-style emperor), and soon governor in his own right of Spain, Gaul, and Syria. He was princeps (first) among the senators. In 27 B.C. the Senate gave him the new title of Augustus (revered one), by which he was thereafter known to history, although he always said his favorite title was the traditional one of princeps, and his regime is called the Principate.\nAugustus had far more power than anybody else, but in 23 B.C. the Senate gave him the power of a tribune—the power to veto and the right to introduce the first measure at any meeting of the Senate. As censor he reduced the membership of the Senate in 29 B.C. from one thousand to eight hundred members, and in 18 B.C. from eight hundred to six hundred. As senators, he appointed men he thought able, regardless of their birth. He created a civil service where careers were open to talent. Having endowed a veterans’ pension department out of his own pocket, he created two new taxes—a sales tax of one-hundredth and an estate tax of one-twentieth to support it. He initiated the most careful censuses known to that time. His social laws made adultery a crime and encouraged larger families.\nAugustus wished, as he said, to turn Rome from a city of brick to a city of marble. He built or restored eighty-two temples in a single year, and the populace was benefited by unprecedented growth in amphitheaters, baths, basilicas, temples and forums. Architects and engineers produced magnificent, innovative structures, improved roads throughout Italy, and developed the first extensive use of concrete. The popularity of marble led to the need for Greek craftsmen, however. Roman taste (and money), wedded to Greek skills and ideas, led to some of the most noted buildings of antiquity. Augustus also gave Rome its first police and fire departments.\nAided by the growing network of new roads, the army—which at one point numbered about 400,000 men—occupied permanent garrison camps on the frontiers. In peacetime the troops worked on public projects such as aqueducts or canals. The legions were made up of Roman citizens who volunteered to serve and who retired after twenty-six years’ service with a bonus equal to about fourteen years’ salary. Non-citizens in somewhat lesser numbers served as auxiliaries, becoming citizens after thirty years of service. Augustus also created the Praetorian Guard: nine thousand specially privileged and highly paid troops, of whom about one third were regularly stationed in Rome.\nIn the East, Augustus reached a settlement with the Parthians and thus probably averted an expensive and dangerous war. In 4 B.C. Herod, the client king of Judea, died, and the Romans henceforth ruled the country through a Roman procurator, who resided outside Jerusalem as a concession to the Jews. Jews retained their freedom of worship, did not have to serve in the Roman armies, and did not have to use coins bearing “graven images”—the portrait of Augustus. Under Augustus most of Spain was pacified, and the Romans successfully administered Gaul. Roman power was extended in what is now Switzerland and Austria and eastward along the Danube into present- day Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Bulgaria, to the Black Sea.\nBut in A.D. 9* the Roman armies suffered a disaster in Germany. A German chief named Hermann—who had served in the Roman army, became a Roman citizen and had his name translated as Arminius—turned against Rome and ambushed the Roman armies, wiping out three full legions at the battle of the Teutoburger Forest. Now an old man and increasingly distrustful of foreign adventures, Augustus made little effort to avenge the defeat. The Rhine River frontier proved to be the final limit of Roman penetration into north-central Europe.\nThe Roman provinces were now probably better governed than under the Republic. Certainly, and despite occasional slave uprisings and violence in the countryside, the early Roman Empire was orderly and relatively stable economically. Regular census taking permitted a fair assessment of taxes. In Gaul the tribes served as the underlying basis for government; in the urbanized East the local cities performed that function. Except for occasional episodes, Augustus had done his work so well that the celebrated Pax Romana (the Roman Peace) lasted from 27 B.C. until A.D. 180—more than two hundred years.\nWhen Augustus died in A.D. 14, the only possible surviving heir was his stepson, Tiberius, son of his wife Livia by her first husband. Gloomy and bitter, Tiberius reigned until A.D. 37, emulating Augustus during the first nine years but thereafter becoming preoccupied with the efforts of Sejanus, commander of the Praetorian Guard, to secure the succession to the throne. Absent from Rome for long periods and in seclusion on the isle of Capri, Tiberius became extremely unpopular, even though he reduced taxes and made interest-free loans available to debtors.\nUltimately, he recognized the threat to his authority posed by Sejanus, whom he executed in 31. About two years later his procurator in Judea, Pontius Pilate, allowed the execution by crucifixion of Jesus, who called himself “the Anointed” (in Greek, Christos), because this Messianic claim was considered seditious. Tiberius’s grandnephew and successor, Caligula (r. 37-41), was perhaps insane and certainly brutish. The number of irrational executions mounted, and the emperor enriched himself with the property of his victims. Caligula was assassinated in A.D. 41.\nCaligula’s uncle Claudius (r. 41-54) was a learned student of history and languages who strove to imitate Augustus by restoring cooperation with the Senate. He added to the size and importance of the bureaucracy by dividing his own personal staff into regular departments or bureaus. As a result, the imperial civil service made great strides in his reign. Claudius was also generous in granting Roman citizenship to provincials. Abroad, he added to Roman territory in North Africa, the Balkans, and Asia Minor. And in A.D. 43 he invaded Britain, ninety-eight years after Julius Caesar’s first invasion. Southeast England became the province of Britain, whose frontiers were pushed outward toward Wales. But the conspiracies of his fourth wife, Agrippina, to obtain the succession for Nero, her son by an earlier marriage, culminated in her poisoning Claudius in 54. Agrippina herself was murdered by Nero in 59.\nAlthough dissolute, Nero (r. 54-68) did not start the great fire that burned down much of Rome in 64. Indeed, he personally took part in the efforts to put the fire out and did what he could for those who had been left homeless. But the dispossessed did blame him for incompetence, and to find a scapegoat he accused the new sect of Christians. Their secret meetings had led to charges of immorality, and Nero persecuted them to distract attention from himself.\nThere were serious revolts in Britain in 61, led by Queen Boadicea. She was “huge of frame, terrifying of aspect, with a harsh voice. A great mass of bright red hair fell to her knees; she wore a great twisted golden torc [neck ring], and a tunic of many colors, over which was a thick mantle fastened by a brooch. “She grasped a spear, and terrified all who saw her,” a Roman historian reported.\nBut the chief threat in the provinces arose in Judea. Only a small upper class supported Roman rule, and the Romans had too few troops to keep order. In 66, after the Jewish high priest refused to sacrifice to Jehovah for the benefit of Nero and a group of Jewish zealots massacred a Roman garrison, there was open warfare. Faced with rebellion in Spain and in Gaul, and unable to control his armies, Nero was displaced by the Senate, and in 68 he committed suicide.","(p.235) Appendix 3 Timeline\n(p.235) Appendix 3 Timeline\n6 BC–AD 13\n6 BC Tiberius receives tribunicia potestas; Gaius Caesar designated consul by Comitia Centuriata; Tiberius retires to Rhodes; Gaius made a pontifex.\n5 BC Gaius Caesar takes toga virilis and is made princeps iuventutis, a sevir turmae, and is allowed to give his opinion in the senate.\n2 BC Lucius Caesar takes the toga virilis and is made a princeps iuventutis, a sevir turmae, and is allowed to give his opinion in the senate, having been designated consul; the elder Julia is banished; Tiberius and the elder Julia divorce.\n1 BC Gaius Caesar begins tour of the eastern empire.\nAD 1 Gaius Caesar and L.

{"question":"How do these two types of dead zones affect marine life differently - the Gulf of Mexico ones vs the Atlantic eddies?","answer":"In the Gulf of Mexico, dead zones affect marine life by altering fish diets, growth rates, reproduction, and habitat use, particularly impacting commercially harvested species like shrimp, forcing them to move to other areas. In the Atlantic eddy dead zones, the impact is more severe and shows different behavioral patterns - specifically with zooplankton. While these organisms normally migrate to deeper waters during the day to hide from predators, within the Atlantic eddies they remain at the surface even during daylight hours, refusing to enter the extremely low-oxygen environment below. The Atlantic dead zones are also particularly threatening to coastal ecosystems when they drift near islands, potentially causing mass fish kills and die-offs of other marine life.","context":["NOAA: River discharge is a key factor\nAccording to NOAA-supported scientists, this year’s Gulf of Mexico “dead zone” – an area of low to no oxygen that can kill fish and marine life – is approximately 3,275 square miles. That’s more than 2 million acres of habitat potentially unavailable to fish and bottom species – larger than the land area of Rhode Island and Delaware combined.\nIn June, NOAA forecasted an average-sized hypoxic zone of 5,364 square miles, based primarily on Mississippi River discharge and nutrient runoff data from the U.S. Geological Survey. NOAA said that the measured size fell within the uncertainty range for the models, which factors in some of the inherent environmental variability of the system, such as the below-average river discharge over the summer.\n“This summer was an unusual year for Gulf hypoxia,” said Nancy Rabalais, principal investigator and professor at Louisiana State University and Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON). “The Mississippi River discharge was below the summer average. The lower flow is unable to support the normal layering of the water column, allowing dissolved oxygen from the surface waters to diffuse more easily to the seabed. The ecosystem subject to hypoxia was characterized by lower turbidity, lower algal biomass, lower nutrients and higher salinity in the surface waters.”\nThe measurement was made during an annual survey cruise, led by a team of scientists from Louisiana State University and the LUMCON aboard the R/V Pelican during the last week of July. The information gathered is a key metric used by the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Hypoxia Task Force to measure progress toward achieving their five-year average target of 1,900 square miles or smaller by 2035. The cruise provides a one-time snapshot of the dead zone; the five-year average captures the dynamic and changing nature of the zone over time.\n“Yearly measurements enable us to help decision-makers fine-tune strategies to reduce the size of the hypoxic zone in these waters and mitigate harmful impacts to our coastal resources and economy,” said Nicole LeBoeuf, director of NOAA’s National Ocean Service. “While some hypoxia is natural, the size and scale of what we’ve seen here in the last several decades is unusually large and detrimental. Our measurements and analyses can empower communities to take action to protect their coasts and contribute to the region’s economic sustainability.”\nThe five-year average dead zone size (also known as the hypoxic zone) is now 4,280 square miles, which is more than two times larger than management targets. Since records began in 1985, the largest hypoxic zone measured was 8,776 square miles in 2017.\nEach year, excess nutrients from cities, farms and other sources in upland watersheds drain into the Gulf and stimulate algal growth during the spring and summer. The algae eventually die, sink and decompose. Throughout this process, oxygen-consuming bacteria decay the algae and consume the oxygen. The resulting low oxygen levels near the bottom are insufficient to support most marine life, rendering the habitat unusable and forcing species to move to other areas to survive.\nExposure to hypoxic waters has been found to alter fish diets, growth rates, reproduction, habitat use and availability of commercially harvested species like shrimp. For the first time, scientists from NOAA Fisheries and North Carolina State University started using an experimental model this year to better understand where shrimp could be found relative to the hypoxic zone.\n“The dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico is a stark reminder that water quality and land stewardship go hand in hand,” said Radhika Fox, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Assistant Administrator for Water. “At EPA, we recognize this and are investing $60 million through President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in work that states are doing to reduce excess nutrients that feed the dead zone.”\nFollow the Advocate on Twitter @GSA_Advocate.\nNow that you've reached the end of the article ...\n… please consider supporting GSA’s mission to advance responsible seafood practices through education, advocacy and third-party assurances.

Wikipedia defines ocean dead zones as:\n“Hypoxic (low-oxygen) areas in the world’s oceans and large lakes, caused by “excessive nutrient pollution from human activities coupled with other factors that deplete the oxygen required to support most marine life in bottom and near-bottom water. (NOAA).” In the 1970s oceanographers began noting increased instances of dead zones. These occur near inhabited coastlines, where aquatic life is most concentrated.”\nSome of the worst dead zones in the world occur in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean – until now. A new discovery has unveiled a dead zone in the Atlantic Ocean.\nAccording to the European Geosciences Union:\nA team of German and Canadian researchers have discovered areas with extremely low levels of oxygen in the tropical North Atlantic, several hundred kilometres off the coast of West Africa. The levels measured in these ‘dead zones’, inhabitable for most marine animals, are the lowest ever recorded in Atlantic open waters. The dead zones are created in eddies, large swirling masses of water that slowly move westward. Encountering an island, they could potentially lead to mass fish kills. The research is published today in Biogeosciences, an open access journal of the European Geosciences Union (EGU).\nDead zones are areas of the ocean depleted of oxygen. Most marine animals, like fish and crabs, cannot live within these regions, where only certain microorganisms can survive. In addition to the environmental impact, dead zones are an economic concern for commercial fishing, with very low oxygen concentrations having been linked to reduced fish yields in the Baltic Sea and other parts of the world.\n“Before our study, it was thought that the open waters of the North Atlantic had minimum oxygen concentrations of about 40 micromol per litre of seawater, or about one millilitre of dissolved oxygen per litre of seawater,” says lead-author Johannes Karstensen, a researcher at GEOMAR, the Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, in Kiel, Germany. This concentration of oxygen is low, but still allows most fish to survive. In contrast, the minimum levels of oxygen now measured are some 20 times lower than the previous minimum, making the dead zones nearly void of all oxygen and unsuitable for most marine animals.\nDead zones are most common near inhabited coastlines where rivers often carry fertilisers and other chemical nutrients into the ocean, triggering algae blooms. As the algae die, they sink to the seafloor and are decomposed by bacteria, which use up oxygen in this process. Currents in the ocean can carry these low-oxygen waters away from the coast, but a dead zone forming in the open ocean had not yet been discovered.\nThe newly discovered dead zones are unique in that they form within eddies, large masses of water spinning in a whirlpool pattern. “The few eddies we observed in greater detail may be thought of as rotating cylinders of 100 to 150 km in diameter and a height of several hundred metres, with the dead zone taking up the upper 100 metres or so,” explains Karstensen. The area around the dead-zone eddies remains rich in oxygen.\n“The fast rotation of the eddies makes it very difficult to exchange oxygen across the boundary between the rotating current and the surrounding ocean. Moreover, the circulation creates a very shallow layer – of a few tens of meters – on top of the swirling water that supports intense plant growth,” explains Karstensen. This plant growth is similar to the algae blooms occurring in coastal areas, with bacteria in the deeper waters consuming the available oxygen as they decompose the sinking plant matter. “From our measurements, we estimated that the oxygen consumption within the eddies is some five times larger than in normal ocean conditions.”\nThe eddies studied in the Biogeosciences article form where a current that flows along the West African coast becomes unstable. They then move slowly to the west, for many months, due to the Earth’s rotation. “Depending on factors such as the [eddies’] speed of rotation and the plant growth, the initially fairly oxygenated waters get more and more depleted and the dead zones evolve within the eddies,” explains Karstensen. The team reports concentrations ranging from close to no oxygen to no more than 0.3 millilitres of oxygen per litre of seawater. These values are all the more dramatic when compared to the levels of oxygen at shallow depths just outside the eddies, which can be up to 100 times higher than those within.\nThe researchers have been conducting observations in the region off the West African coast and around the Cape Verde Islands for the past seven years, measuring not only oxygen concentrations in the ocean but also water movements, temperature and salinity. To study the dead zones, they used several tools, including drifting floats that often got trapped within the eddies. To measure plant growth, they used satellite observations of ocean surface colour.\nTheir observations allowed them to measure the properties of the dead zones, as well as study their impact in the ecosystem. Zooplankton – small animals that play an important role in marine food webs – usually come up to the surface at night to feed on plants and hide in the deeper, dark waters during the day to escape predators. However, within the eddies, the researchers noticed that zooplankton remained at the surface, even during the day, not entering the low-oxygen environment underneath.\n“Another aspect related to the ecosystem impact has a socioeconomic dimension,” says Karstensen. “Given that the few dead zones we observed propagated less than 100 km north of the Cape Verde archipelago, it is not unlikely that an open-ocean dead zone will hit the islands at some point. This could cause the coast to be flooded with low-oxygen water, which may put severe stress on the coastal ecosystems and may even provoke fish kills and the die-off of other marine life.”\nLatest posts by Royce Christyn (see all)\n- Government Op Who Predicted Super Bowl Score Warns Of Nuclear War - February 18, 2017\n- Video: Why Voting Doesn’t Change Anything & Democracy Is A Lie - May 7, 2016\n- Did Bible Verse Predict String of Recent Quakes, Volcano, & Foam? - April 17, 2016"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:12145f0f-984f-4fb0-972d-389090ba5665>","<urn:uuid:dcfde0c3-2857-4250-a45c-25fa0eb187ed>"],"error":null}

{"question":"which milk alternatives have most protein + environmental impact?","answer":"Among plant-based milk alternatives, soy milk has the highest protein content with 7 grams per cup, while most other alternatives like almond, coconut, and rice milk only contain 1-2 grams per protein. From an environmental perspective, plant-based milk alternatives generally require significantly less water than dairy milk - soy milk uses about one-third and almond milk about half the water needed for dairy milk production. Conventional dairy farming also contributes more to greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution compared to plant-based milk production.","context":["When embarking on a new eating lifestyle, many people are concerned with finding plant-based substitutions for their old favorite recipes. Whether it’s dairy, eggs, meat, or seafood, don’t fret – you have many fantastic options!\nBelow I’ve outlined all those and more. Consider this your comprehensive guide to plant-based alternatives to animal-based products, although if you find something missing, please let me know.\nAlso, remember that eating a plant-based diet means whole foods, for the most part. Therefore, you should only eat meat substitutions, usually higher in fat and salt, sparingly or only while you're making the transition.\nDairy-Free Milk Choices\nWith so many choices on the market today, milk is probably one of the easiest non-plant-based items to find suitable plant-based substitutes. Whichever type you choose as your plant-based milk substitute, you’ll want to stay clear of the sweetened versions to avoid unnecessary sugar intake.\nIf you want to try making your own plant milk, you can use a high-speed blender for nut milk and others. Here's my article on making nut milk. Or, try this smaller version from Nutr. I've written a review of it and am offering a discount code if you're interested.\nWhile it mostly comes down to personal taste preference, from almond to soy, and everything in-between, here’s the lowdown on unsweetened, dairy-free milk:\n- Oat Milk is the new darling of the plant milk movement. Like most of the rest, it often has additives that aren't considered a whole food, so become a label reader and choose wisely. For flavor, the Oatly brand is quite pleasant, and you can purchase it without added sugar.\n- Almond milk is probably the most well-known non-dairy milk available. It’s a low-calorie option and is usually fortified with B12, which is a nice plus for plant-based eaters. However, if you’re looking for a milk alternative that provides some of your daily protein needs, you’ll want to keep looking as it only has 1 gram per 8-ounce serving. If you're ambitious, you can make your own almond milk which will not have any additives.\n- Coconut milk is another popular option, though it is even lower in protein than almond milk. It also is high in B12, with one 8-ounce serving giving you 50% of the USRDA. It contains several other vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin D, magnesium, calcium, iron, and zinc.\n- Cashew milk is becoming more popular as it’s become more commercially available. Many people are fans of this milk alternative because of its flavor and thicker consistency, closer to that of dairy milk. Unless you’re making it yourself, it is similarly low in protein to almond milk. It also contains generous amounts of B12, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin E, and iron.\n- Soy milk is a long-standing favorite for many; this alternative is calorically similar to dairy milk, with about 80-130 calories per 8-ounce serving. Soy milk has the most protein of the non-dairy milk (7 grams per cup) and contains good amounts of B12, calcium, and vitamin D. magnesium, phosphorous, folate, and riboflavin.\n- Hemp milk is another nutrient-dense option. While it only has 2 grams of protein in an 8-ounce serving, it contains substantial amounts of calcium, vitamin D, riboflavin, B12, phosphorous, magnesium, iron, and zinc. It can be harder to find, and not everyone enjoys its earthier flavor.\n- Rice milk is a good option for those with nut and soy sensitivities. It, too, is low in protein (1 gram per cup) and is higher in calories than all of the other options mentioned here. Also, rice has arsenic, so you may want to stay away for that reason. If you are going to go with rice milk, make sure to get one fortified with calcium and other vitamins and minerals (though the levels will be lower than the others mentioned here). Learn more about arsenic in rice and how to mitigate it when working with rice. Organic has arsenic, too, by the way.\n- Pea Protein Milk from Ripple. These come in different varieties, from unsweetened to regular and vanilla flavored. This brand is fortified with calcium and has added fat. It's a good substitute for those wanting to stay away from nuts or soy.\n- Flax Milk also comes in unsweetened, regular, and vanilla. It's fortified with Vitamin D2 and B12 and naturally has calcium.\nTo replace buttermilk, add one tablespoon lemon juice or apple cider vinegar to 1 cup of non-dairy milk. Let stand for 10 minutes. The milk may curdle somewhat.\nThere are also a remarkable number of non-dairy cheeses available commercially. Some are delicious; some could easily be confused with plastic. Here are of few of the best plant-based cheese substitute options and why I think they’re worth giving a try.\n- Treeline is a brand of artisanal cheeses that are sure to please any cheese-lover seeking a plant-based cheese alternative. Made from cultured cashews, they’ve got both soft kinds of cheese and aged hard cheeses. If you can find this brand in your area and love cheese, this might be a good choice, although they are rather pricey, as are most vegan substitutions.\n- Follow Your Heart brand is a great go-to for a huge variety of plant-based vegan options, including cheeses. From blocks to slices to shreds, they’ve got you covered. Their shreds even MELT, which is pretty awesome if you’re familiar with cheese alternatives. Some of their products contain soy, and some don’t. If you’re looking for meltiness, make sure you get one that contains soy.\n- Kite Hill makes truly delicious spreadable cheeses. These go great on bread and crackers, making them great for any party where you need quick hors d'oeuvres. They also offer a lovely soft-ripened ricotta cheese, as well as pre-made ravioli stuffed with their cheeses! You can find the Kite Hill brand in Whole Foods stores nationwide.\n- Go Veggie is another brand worth mentioning. Some of their products do have dairy so check carefully when you're looking. These are a wonderful choice if you’re a plant-based grilled cheese fan!\n- If you're adventurous and want to make your own, try the recipes from this new book by Julie Piatt, \"The Cheese is Nuts!\" From what I've seen, the recipes look delicious.\nButter & Oils\nBelieve it or not, there are quite a few good choices to use to replace oil and butter. From broth to various foods, here are my top choices for a plant-based butter substitute. If you want to cook with less oil, you might like this article, \"Cooking without Oil.\"\n- Vegetable broth: I use this to sauté vegetables. You can add a couple of tablespoons at a time, being careful not to drown your veggies. You want the veggies simmering nicely in just enough broth to keep wet but not fill up the entire pan you’re using. You can also use broth in baked-veggie recipes as a fat replacement – make sure to keep checking as they’re cooking in case you need to add more broth. In a pinch, water can be used in the same way.\n- Bananas: Bananas are a great replacement for cookies, quick bread, or things like pancakes, but be aware that your recipe will have a banana flavor! Start with half of the number of mashed bananas, as there is oil in the recipe, and if your batter is too dry, add more in, little by little. It might take some experimenting to get it right with this one.\n- Applesauce: If you don’t want all your baked goods to taste like bananas, applesauce is a good replacement option. It will work well for dense things, like cakes and muffins. You can do a 1-to-1 swap of applesauce for a plant-based butter alternative.\n- Prune puree: To make prune puree, put your pitted prunes in a food processor with a little bit of water until it’s smooth. Use 1 tbsp of water with every ounce of prunes that you use. Prunes work best in chocolate-flavored recipes like brownies because, in lighter-flavored things, you will taste the prunes. Use an amount of puree equal to the amount of fat that is called for in the recipe.\n- Nut butter: When baking, you can use a nut butter fat replacer. This works especially well in cookie, muffin, and bread recipes. While you’re still adding calories to the recipe, you’re also adding more protein, minerals, and fiber than you would be if you were using oil. Swap it out of the recipe cup-for-cup. You’ll want to use a creamy variety of whatever nut butter you choose. Expect a dense end-product.\nThere are a lot of simple ways you can replace eggs when baking, a lot of which you probably already have the ingredients necessary. The following are ways to replace one egg:\n- Mix 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed with 2 ½ tablespoons of water and let it sit 10 minutes before using.\n- Mix 1 tablespoon chia seed with 3 tablespoons water and let sit for 15 minutes before using\n- Use ¼ cup applesauce\n- Use ½ of a mashed banana\n- Use ¼ cup of silken tofu\n- Mix 3 tablespoons of chickpea flour with 3 tablespoons of water\n- Mix 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with 3 tablespoons of water\n- Mix 1 tablespoon soy protein powder with 3 tablespoons of water\n- Mix 2 tablespoons arrowroot powder with 3 tablespoons of water\n- 3 Tablespoons unwhipped aquafaba (juice from a can of chickpeas)\n- Two tablespoons for egg yolks\n- One tablespoon for egg whites.\nThere's also this egg replacement from the Follow Your Heart brand. Not only can you use it in baking, but you can also make plant-based omelets and scrambled eggs with this plant-based substitute for eggs!\nTry this homemade version and keep it on hand for making delicious tempeh salad or crunchy Waldorf salad. It's made with tofu and is your healthiest option. Otherwise, there are vegan versions in your market, like Vegenaise\nDid you know that honey is not actually vegan? It's up to you whether you want to eat it or not. While there are other ways to substitute for honey, a whole food version is maple syrup. You can also find vegan honey but it may take a litter hunting. Try a Google search for \"vegan honey.\"\nGelatin presents a challenge for anyone looking to stick to a plant-based diet since it’s an animal product. Here are a couple of options for you:\n- Agar powder: Though this will give you a texture that is less “jiggly” than gelatin, it’s a nice replacement for things like firm plant-based jellies. You can replace this 1-to-1 for gelatin powder. It's sometimes called Agar Agar.\n- Pectin is in the cell walls of many fruits. It forms a thick gel-like substance when it's heated and mixed with sugars and acids. It’s a popular, common ingredient in store-bought jellies and jams.\nThere are new vegan fish substitutions and others coming to market, but as with all of these substitutions, they often contain high amounts of fat and salt. Try these 5 Delish Ways to Enjoy Seafood Flavor without Eating Any Fish from One Green Planet! Also, try my plant-based fish substitute recipe, Sheet Pan Fish & Chips.\nSome whole foods meat substitutes or replacements are less processed and more whole food than others, so choose wisely. If you're starting to eat less meat, some of the more processed meat replacements might help you through but aim for healthier versions, ultimately.\n- Tofu: There are so many ways to use tofu! So many, in fact, that I have an entire article dedicated to it. For all the ways you can use tofu as a meat replacement, check out my article here.\n- Tempeh: Made from fermented soybeans, tempeh is another excellent meat substitute. I’ve got another full-length article on the topic that will help explain how you can use it in your plant-based recipes.\n- Seitan: Another meatless alternative I’ve talked about before is seitan. You can make it yourself or use store-bought. For more on how to use seitan in your recipes, read my article here.\n- Beans: Any variety of beans, either ground or mashed, can be a great filling for things like burritos and sandwiches. You won’t get the same texture as meat, but you will get a filling, nutritious meal. And as most plant-based eaters know, a black-bean burger is a truly wonderful thing!\nAside from quick swaps you can make as plant-based substitutions, there are many products on the market that are made specifically for plant-based eaters who miss eating meat. Here are a few of the best brands out there today. But, again, be careful with these as they often have more fat and additives. I've listed a couple here, but you can find the complete list at Peta.org.\n- Beyond Meat is a relatively new company that touts itself as the “future of protein. Their plant-based burger patties look and cook like fresh-ground beef, and have passed the taste tests of vegetarians and meat-eaters alike!\n- Yves Veggie Cuisine has been around for quite a while, offering anything from falafel balls to Bologna to ground-meat replacement. If you’re looking for easy-to-prepare options, check out what Yves offers.\n- Gardein not only has beef and poultry alternatives but fish replacements as well. They’ve got some mini “crab cakes” that look amazing! And they even have gluten-free options as well!\n- New \"synthetic\" meats are on the horizon and may help people transition to a plant-based diet.\n- No Evil Foods is the only one I've found (so far) that is made without added oils.\nThere are dozens of options for meatless meats on the market today. I found a site that is a great place to search to see all of the products out there. It’s called Fake Meats. Check it out if you’ve got a meat craving!\nWhen you begin a plant-based diet, you may feel like your choices are limited. But as you can see here, with these plant-based substitutions, there are many ways to keep your meals delicious and interesting while fulfilling the cravings you may get for non-plant-based foods.\n*As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.

This is wonderful, useful, necessary information and it is all in one place! I am so grateful!\nYou’re so welcome and glad it’s useful for you. Let me know if you find anything missing and I’ll add it to the list.\nThanks for giving more options and tips.\nThank you Diane for making my life easier by sharing your expertise in plant based diet. I’m going to start the diet with you in my mind. It will be hard for the first time but I’ll give it a try. God bless you.\nThanks and wishing you the best of luck! Let me know if there’s something more that would help.\nHi, Thank you for sharing useful information. I am living in India and new to plant-based diet. I am looking for a substitute for ghee (clarified butter) which is widely used in many Indian dishes. Could you please help with this?\nHi, I’m afraid I don’t have a substitute for ghee as we use very little oil for plant-based meals. I have seen people suggest substituting with a vegetable oil, maybe a good olive oil. I’m not sure if that would work for you. I hope that helps and good luck with the new diet. ????\nCan you provide a recommendation for a substitution of a plant based replacement for PAM or other non-stick spray? The issue I run into is if I try to make pancakes or waffles they will stick even to teflon or other non-stick material.\nHey Adam, Pancakes, and waffles do tend to stick even with non-stick pans. Maybe some of the newer types would work better, I’m not sure. I really don’t have a perfect solution for you. I think a little non-stick spray would be ok if used infrequently. I believe you’re not supposed to use it on non-stick pans, though. I’ve seen the plant-based brain docs, wife and husband neurologists Drs. Ayesha & Dean Sherza, use non-stick spray on their recipes. Scroll through their Instagram or YouTube channel to see some of their delicious recipes. Usinging a little spray would depend on how strict you’d like to be.","(June 2016) Not all meat and dairy products are the same; not in nutritional quality nor in how they affect our planet. Quality and environmental impact vary greatly from the variety of agricultural practices employed, and how food is processed. I have spoken often about the health and nutrition benefits of organic, grass-fed animal-based foods. This blog, however, is about sustainability and environmental stewardship.\nThe multitude of methods used for meat and dairy production include organic, free range, intensive livestock, and subsistence farming. Beyond organic are sustainable practices like no-till and biodynamic farming. Some organic operations are far superior to others, while some conventional farms are quite a bit cleaner than others, or on the path to becoming organic. So, some of these distinctions are not clear cut. Yet, it’s always good to know from where your food comes. That’s one of the clear advantages to buying local.\nWhen it comes to raising animals for food, there’s much to consider: Water consumption, methane gas emissions, the real cost of raising grain for feed, air and water quality, etc. Regardless, beef and milk production require tons of water, to the tune of 2000 gallons to produce just one pound of beef, or a gallon of milk. Much of that is used to grow grains for cow feed. That’s at least three times as much water as it takes to grow the same quantity of soy milk, and twice that needed for almond milk.\nIndeed, most of our water use goes to what we eat. Eighty percent of the water used in California is consumed by agriculture, according to the Pacific Institute. Irrigation projects in the former Soviet Union to grow cotton dramatically emptied the Aral Sea, destroyed fisheries, depopulated large areas and caused disease epidemics. Generally speaking, agriculture uses approximately 70% of the world’s freshwater supply. Looming climate change is likely to alter both water availability and agricultural water demands, so it behooves us to conserve as much as possible, and to improve on the goods and services it produces.\nThere is potentially an enormous difference between conventional and alternative farming practices in the amount of water and land consumption, fossil fuel use, and pollution. Organic farming uses 30% less energy and less water than conventional farming to produce the same corn and soybean yields, while yielding healthier, pesticide-free produce and far less groundwater pollution. Organic farming does not contaminate soil, rivers and drinking water like industrial farming does (Gonzalez, 2008). Conventional farming and livestock production are major stressors on the planet. They are major sources of greenhouse gases and loss of biodiversity, and major water polluters [Steinfeld et al., 2006].\nIndustrial agriculture relies on pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers and other toxic chemicals that increase the use of machinery, which contributes to a larger carbon footprint and global warming. Conventional systems emit nearly 40% more greenhouse gases per unit of crop than organic systems, while organic farming systems use 45% less energy (Middleton & Smith, 2011).\nOrganic farming may be especially competitive during droughts. Berkeley researchers concluded that organic farming creates biodiversity in the soil and environment not seen with synthetic chemicals. Organic plots can even outperform conventional ones, regarding yield, when the going gets tough. Organic plots are especially resilient to droughts, and extremes of frost and flooding, according to the Rodale Institute. Microbes and other organisms in organic soil create intricate relationships with plants and affect soil architecture. Organic soil absorbs and stores water better, and needs less water than conventional soil (Ferris, 2014). Organic farming is a more sustainable way of doing agriculture, hands down.\nThe Environmental Working Group has concluded that grass fed beef is better for the environment. Benefits from well managed grass fed operations are multifaceted, whereas large-scale confined feedlots have tremendous negative impacts on air and water quality. In “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” Michael Pollan points to the lighter carbon footprint in grass-fed operations, due to the fertilizer, pesticide and fossil fuel required for grain used in feed lots. More methane is produced by grass-fed cattle because it’s harder to digest grass than grain, but grasslands sequester enough carbon to more than make up the difference. A healthier soil and richer humus result from cows trampling their manure into the soil. The increased diversity maintains a healthy soil that keeps CO2 out of the atmosphere. Grazing cattle help stabilize soil, control weeds, and reduce the risk of wildfire (Profita, 2013).\nThe animals our ancestors ate roamed free and ate grass, whereas cattle and dairy cows today are force-fed grains. What we feed them has a major effect on the nutrient composition of the milk and beef. Numerous studies conclude that these nutrients vary significantly, depending on what the cows eat. For example, grass-fed, whole milk contains a third of the omega-3 fatty acids we need for brain, heart, skin and joint health, while conventional milk is virtually devoid of omega-3s. Grass-fed, full-fat dairy also contains 3-5 times as many antioxidants like beta-carotene, lutein and vitamin E (Chang, 2016). Grass-fed beef and milk also contains about twice as much conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) as grain-fed beef products. CLA is associated with reduced body fat and other benefits (Whigham et al., 2007). Plus, organic milk and meat do not contain the antibiotics, hormones and pesticides found in conventional animal-based foods. These drugs and chemicals contribute significantly to antibiotic resistance and the chronic diseases of modernity.\nSome folks opt to cut their environmental impact by not eating meat, or cutting back on their purchases. Yet meat and dairy provide nutrients that are hard to find in other foods. If done right, these foods are not only more nutritious, but also much less harmful to the earth. We should pay attention to how our ancestors thrived, and abide by nature’s wisdom.\nChang K. 2016.

{"question":"What are the similarities and differences between how modern bridge monitoring technologies in the Netherlands deal with environmental uncertainties compared to how historical Venetian builders adapted to their lagoon environment?","answer":"Modern bridge monitoring in the Netherlands uses digital twin technology and sensors to account for environmental uncertainties like wind speed, temperature, and traffic impact. This technology enables the creation of virtual replicas to predict structural performance and identify vulnerable spots before problems occur. In contrast, historical Venetian builders adapted to their lagoon environment through innovative foundation techniques, cutting oak trees from the Dalmatian coast to create poles that were driven into the underwater ground, supporting layers of wood, brick, and marble. While modern monitoring relies on data collection and predictive modeling, Venetian builders developed physical solutions to handle their environmental challenges. Both approaches demonstrate different methods of dealing with environmental uncertainties - one through technology and prediction, the other through architectural innovation.","context":["Due to poor monitoring, many structures are not maintained properly or on time. This results in safety risks and high costs for overdue maintenance. Researcher Alice Cicirello is working on better design and monitoring tools to ensure the secure construction of structures to extend their service life.\nPremature failures of bridges, pipelines, offshore wind turbines or offshore support structures in operation can have severe consequences, such as loss of lives and unforeseen disrupting downtimes which can have safety and economic repercussions. In August 2018 Italy was shaken by the sudden collapse of the Morandi Bridge in Genova. 43 people lost their lives in what was later found to be an avoidable disaster caused by years of deferred maintenance. ‘This tragedy shows the importance of constant monitoring of structures such as bridges,’ associate professor and head of the Mechanics and Physics of Structure section Alice Cicirello says. ‘Proper monitoring will reveal the condition of the bridge so any potential risks or damage can be tackled in time.’\nIn the Netherlands too bridge maintenance has been found lacking. Recent research showed that the Merwedebrug, closed to traffic in 2016, is on the point of collapsing. In 2018 the Dutch government spent around €400m on the deferred maintenance of bridges.\nFailing monitoring systems\nMonitoring of engineering structures is carried out by means of sensors which collect data which in turn are used to learn about the condition of the structure,’ Cicirello says. ‘The problem is that these sensors are often in the wrong place, or faulty because of age or damage. That means the data they provide may be incomplete or incorrect. This might cause missed detections of unsafe structural conditions. Moreover, a faulty monitoring system can undermine the reasons for implementing monitoring technologies in the first place. For instance, if a structural problem is wrongly detected with a faulty sensor, the monitoring system will give a false alarm. This would effectively lead to an unnecessary close down of a healthy bridge causing huge detours for traffic. What I want to achieve with my research are better monitoring strategies and design tools which will improve structural performance and longevity. That is a major goal, considering the enormous maintenance and replacement challenge the Netherlands is facing. Many bridges in this country are nearing the end of their life cycle.’\nWhat I want to achieve with my research are better monitoring strategies and design tools which will improve the performance and longevity of structures and infrastructures for transportation, supply of energy and communication which are of critical importance for our society.\nVibrations and other wobbles\nBefore Cicirello came to Delft in January 2020 she earned a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in Civil Engineering in Italy and a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Cambridge. She also worked in industry and lectured at the University of Oxford. Cicirello’s research is centred around vibration. ‘Everything around us vibrates. Vibration enables us to hear sound and communicate with each other. But vibration is also a cause of structural defects or noise disturbances, not just in bridges but in cars, wind turbines, drilling tools and all sorts of other engineering devices and objects. So in order to make the engineering structures last longer you have to understand their vibration. The problem is that the dynamic response of a large scale engineering structure made of many components can be very difficult to predict. ‘There will always be a number of uncertainties that influence their behaviour and lifespan. For bridges, these include weather conditions, such as wind speed and temperature, and the impact of traffic.’\nFor Cicirello such uncertainties represent not an obstacle but a challenge. ‘In science as in life, we have to face the fact that there are many things that we do not know precisely, and other things that are subject to an inherent variability. Nonetheless we have to make decisions under these uncertainties. The question is not so much how we can control these uncertainties but how we handle them. One of the ways to tackle them is for example to minimise their effect. Robust design can make structures as resilient as possible against the effects of wind speed or heavy traffic which are not fully known at the design stage. A good monitoring strategy will then help to accumulate life cycle data about unforeseen events and external factors so action can be taken.’\nIntegrated research approach\nIn 2017 Cicirello set up the Dynamics, Vibration and Uncertainty Research Group at Oxford and started a laboratory to look simultaneously at these various aspects from different angles. She brought this expertise to Delft, where she is setting up the Monitoring, Vibration and Uncertainty Lab. ‘We look at physics, build mathematical models, experiments, quantify uncertainties and use machine learning techniques. An integrated approach is important because it gives us a comprehensive picture of the behaviour of the whole of the structure. Without experimenting, for instance, you won’t know if the assumptions in the model are correct. And we need monitoring and machine learning to collect and process data that will help us learn the behaviour of the structures during operating conditions,’ Cicirello says.\nA digital copy of reality\nAn integrated approach, Cicirello explains, will help engineering structures last longer. ‘It starts with the collection of information about the structure, its shape, material and environment. Based on this information, a representative computer model of a structure is build. This acts as a virtual replica of the structure, the so-called digital twin, which enable us to explore the performance of the structure before it is built and also during its life cycle. For example, a digital twin of a bridge can be developed. We can then take into account for uncertain elements, such as strong winds or heavy traffic. That will flag up the critical and vulnerable spots in the bridge. This not only helps promote robust design but also determines where the monitoring sensors should be placed. Once the bridge is in use you can use the data provided by the sensors to update the digital twin, enabling ever more accurate life cycle predictions.’\nRobust design and better bridge monitoring come with a number of advantages, Cicirello says. ‘The main thing of course is to keep people safe. We have only to think of the lives lost in the Morandi Bridge collapse. A better understanding of the vulnerable spots also ensures that maintenance is carried out at an early stage and in the right places. It is also money saved as preventive maintenance is much cheaper than deferred maintenance. The digital twin approach also extends the life cycle of the structure which saves on materials and energy and so benefits the environment. Better monitoring also prevents avoidable delays caused by false alarms.’\nFor her research Cicirello has partnered up with a number of parties in the field, such as the ministry of water management and infrastructure Rijkswaterstaat. ‘Rijkswaterstaat is responsible for the monitoring and management of many critical structures in the Netherlands. Together we look at how their current monitoring system can be improved. Where are the best spots to put the sensors, how do we prevent the failure of the monitoring system and how do we determine when maintenance and repair work should be carried out? We hope that within five to ten years we will have a number of effective tools in place to make effective monitoring happen in practice.’","If you came to this page directly and do not see a navigation frame on top, please go to the home page.\nVenice is certainly one of the most fascinating places in Europe. It is located in the centre of the Laguna Véneta, the largest of the northern Italian lagoons. The waters on average are only 50 cm deep and are riddled with numberless islands and sandbanks. The lagoon was formed during tens of thousands of years by the rivers Sile, Brenta and Piave. Their sediments formed the extended streches of land closing the lagoon towards the Gulf of Venice. Only three openings, called 'porti', allow the exchange of water with the open sea. The historical centre of Venice developed on numerous islands in the centre of the lagoon. During the 13th century the people of Venice started to replace their wooden buildings by stone edifices. In order to build their magnificent palaces uncountable numbers of oak trees were felled at the Dalmatian coast (which since that time is largely bare of vegetation). The trees were cut into poles that were driven into the underwater ground to support the wood, brick and marble layers that served as foundations. The historic centre of Venice is composed of about 10,000 buildings, separated by 150 canals, which are spanned by 411 bridges. Venice and its lagoon were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987 (see also list of other UNESCO heritage sites).\nThe early period of of the history of Venice began with Attila's Hun invasion of the mainland in 452 AD, which caused the population of the countryside to take refuge on the islands of the lagoon and augment the local population of fishermen. The first council of 12 townships in the lagoon was formed in 466 and the mainland settlements were abandoned in 568 during Alboin's Lombard invasion. The election of the first Doge in 727 finally marks the foundation of the Republic of Venice. The settlement at Rivo Alto (Ri'Alto), the location of modern Venice, was consolidated in 810 during the invasion of king Pippin of Italy. After the turn of the first millenium, the period of expansion of the Venetian empire began. Dalmatia was conquered in 1000, follwed by the capture in 1204 of Constantinople by Venice and the 4th Crusaders, which again increased the territory of Venice in the eastern Adriatic. The period between 1255 and 1380 was marked by four wars with the rivalling republic of Genova (Genoa). During the 14th and 15th century Venice mainly expanded on the mainland: Treviso in 1339/1388, Padua, Vicenza and Verona in 1404, Aquilea and Friuli in 1418/1421, the bay of Cattaro (Kotor) with the exception of Castelnuovo (Herceg Novi) in 1420, Brescia and Bergamo in 1428, Rovigo and Polesine in 1484. Constantinople was lost to the Ottomans in 1453, but Cyprus was conquered in 1489. The discovery of America by Columbus for Spain in 1492 and the discovery of the Cape route to the East for Portugal by da Gama in 1497 marked the beginning of the period of decline of the Venetian power. The Leage of Cambrai, a confederation formed in 1508 by the Papal States, France, Spain, Hungary and others, inflicted a decisive defeat upon Venice in 1509. The Ottoman empire finally reconquered Cyprus in 1571, Crete in 1669, and Morea in 1716. The invasion of the French army under Napoleon in 1797 and the surrender of the Great Council of Venice on the 12th of May of that year ended the existence of the Republic of Venice after 1,070 years. Between 1815 and 1866 Venice, together with the rest of Venetia and Friuli, was part of the Austrian kingdom of Lombardy and Venetia, which in 1859/1866 became part of Italy (see also the map of the Austrian possessions in Italy 18151866).\nThe Basilica Cattedrale Patriarchale di San Marco [left] is certainly one of the most famous landmarks of Venice.\nThe original church on this spot was begun in 829 and was consecrated in 832 in order to enshrine the remains of St. Mark the Evangelist,\nwhich had been brought to Venice from Alexandria in Egypt. Thereupon, St. Mark replaced St. Theodore\nas the patron saint of the city and his attribute, the winged lion, became the official symbol of the republic. The first basilica was\ndestroyed during a popular revolt in 976, but was subsequently replaced by the present church, which was completed in 1071.\nThe relics of St. Mark had been lost in the fire of 976 but had miraculously \"reappeared\" when the new church was consecrated in 1094.\nThe edifice was built in Byzantine style on a ground plan of a greek cross surmounted by five domes. Throughout the following centuries\nthe church was enriched by numerous artworks. The famous four bronze horses on the west façade were brought to\nVenice from Constantinople in 1204 during the 4th Crusade. They were originally placed in the Arsenal of Venice and were set up\non the exterior of the basilica in the mid 13th century. The sculptures were removed to Paris by\nNapoleon, but were returned to the church in 1815. The interior of the church is decorated by numerous mosaics on gold ground,\nthe floor is inlaid with marble and glass. The screen separating the choir and the nave holds marble statues, which count as\nmasterpieces of Venetian Gothic sculpture. The church originally was not a cathedral but served as the Doge's chapel.\nIt did not become a cathedral until 1807 when the seat of the patriarchs was transferred from Castello to Venice.\nA note on the labelling on the glass no. 1533 [above left]: Although the glass is labelled in Italian, it is apparent that the craftsman who drew the original drawing for the print was not familiar with the Italian language because \"Chiesa S. Marco\" is falsely spelled 'Marko' instead of 'Marco'.\nThe Lion of Venice [centre] is an ancient bronze winged lion sculpture in the Piazzetta San Marco, which came to symbolise the city — and of course of one of its patron Saint, St. Mark — after its arrival there in the 12th century. The Lion of Venice surmounts one of two large granite columns in the Square, thought to have been erected about 1268, bearing ancient symbols of the two patron saints of Venice. The Lion sculpture has had a very long and obscure history, probably starting its existence as a winged lion-griffin statue on a monument to the god Sandon at Tarsus in Cilicia (Southern Turkey) about 300 BC. The figure, which stands on the eastern column, at some point came to represent the “Lion of Saint Mark”, traditional symbol of Saint Mark the evangelist.\nThe figure standing on the western column [right, barely visible] is\nSan Giorgio Maggiore [background] is a Benedictine church on the island of the same name located in the lagoon\nopposite the Piazzetta. The island was occupied by the Venetians already in the Roman period. By 829 it had a church consecrated to St. George; thus, it was\ndesignated as San Giorgio Maggiore to be distinguished from San Giorgio in Alga (an island in the Venetian lagoon).\nThe San Giorgio Monastery was established in 982. The present church was built by Andrea Palladio between 1566 and 1610.\nThe campanile (belltower) was first built in 1467, but fell in 1774. It was rebuilt in neo-classical style in 1791.\nIn the early 19th century, after the Republic fell, the monastery was almost suppressed and the island became a\nfree port with a new harbour built in 1812. It became the home of Venice's artillery.\nSt. Mark's Campanile [below, no. 2778: left]\nis the bell tower of St Mark's Basilica (see above), located in the Piazza San Marco. It is one of the most recognizable symbols of the city.\nThe tower is 98.6 metres (tall, and stands alone in a corner of St Mark's Square, near the front of the basilica. It has a simple form, the bulk of which is a\nfluted brick square shaft, 12 metres wide on each side and 50 metres (tall, above which is a loggia surrounding the belfry, housing five bells. The belfry is\ntopped by a cube, alternate faces of which show the Lion of St. Mark and the female representation of Venice (\"la Giustizia\", Justice). The tower is capped by a\npyramidal spire, at the top of which sits a golden weathervane in the form of the archangel Gabriel.\nThe initial 9th-century construction, built on Roman foundations, was used as a watch tower or lighthouse for the dock, which then occupied a substantial part of\nthe area which is now the Piazzetta. Construction was finished in the 12th century. Seriously damaged by a fire in 1489 that destroyed the wooden spire, the campanile\nassumed its definitive shape in the 16th century thanks to the restorations made to repair further damage caused by the earthquake of March 1511.\nThe work was completed on 6 July 1513, with the placement of the gilded wooden statue of the Archangel Gabriel.\nThe original Campanile inspired the designs of other towers worldwide, especially in the areas belonging to the former Republic of Venice. Almost identical, albeit smaller,\nreplicas of the campanile exist in the Slovenian town of Piran and in the Croatian town of Rovinj; both were built in the early 17th century\nIn July 1902, the north wall of the tower began to show signs of a dangerous crack that in the following days continued to grow. Finally, on Monday, 14 July, around 9:45 am,\nthe campanile collapsed completely. Remarkably, no one was killed. Because of the campanile's position, the resulting damage was relatively limited.\nThe same evening, the communal council approved over 500,000 Lire for the reconstruction of the campanile. It was decided to rebuild the tower exactly as it was, with some\ninternal reinforcement to prevent future collapse. The new campanile was inaugurated on 25 April 1912, on the occasion of Saint Mark's feast day, exactly 1000 years\nafter the foundations of the original building had allegedly been laid.\nThe Doge's Palace [left, no. 2778: centre], built in Venetian Gothic style, also is one of the main landmarks of the city of Venice.\nThe palace was the residence of the Doge of Venice, the supreme authority of the Republic of Venice. In 810 the seat of government was moved from the island of Malamocco to the area of the present-day Rialto;\nHowever, no traces remain of that 9th century building as the palace was partially destroyed in the 10th century. A new palace was thenbuilt in the late 12th century out of fortresses,\none façade to the Piazzeta, the other overlooking the St. Mark's Basin. Although only few traces remain of that palace, some Byzantine-Venetian architecture characteristics can still\nbe seen at the ground floor. The new Gothic palace's constructions started around 1340, focusing mostly on the side of the building facing the lagoon. Only in 1424, did Doge Francesco Foscari\ndecide to extend the rebuilding works to the wing overlooking the Piazzetta, and with a ground floor arcade on the outside, open first floor loggias running along the façade, and the\ninternal courtyard side of the wing, completed with the construction of the Porta della Carta (1442). In 1483, a violent fire broke out in the side of the palace overlooking the canal, where the\nDoge's Apartments were. An entire new structure was raised alongside the canal, stretching from the ponte della Canonica to the Ponte della Paglia. Another huge fire in 1547 destroyed\nsome of the rooms on the second floor, but fortunately without undermining the structure as a whole. Refurbishment works were being held at the palace when on 1577 a third fire destroyed\nthe Scrutinio Room and the Great Council Chamber. In the subsequent rebuilding work it was decided to respect the original Gothic style. As well as being the ducal residence, the palace\nhoused political institutions of the Republic of Venice until the Napoleonic occupation of the city in 1797, when its role inevitably changed. Venice was subjected first to French rule,\nthen to Austrian, and finally in 1866 it became part of Italy. Over this period, the palace was occupied by various administrative offices as well as housing the Biblioteca Marciana and\nother important cultural institutions within the city. By the end of the 19th century, the structure was showing clear signs of decay, and the Italian government set aside significant funds\nfor its restoration and all public offices were moved elsewhere, with the exception of the State Office for the protection of historical Monuments, which is still housed at the palace's\nloggia floor. In 1923, the Italian State, owner of the building, entrusted the management to the Venetian municipality to be run as a museum. Since 1996, the Doge's Palace has been part of\nthe Venetian museums network, which has been under the management of the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia since 2008.\nThe Grand Canal (Canal Grande) is the major water-traffic corridor of the city. It is the final section of the river Brenta.\nThe banks of the Grand Canal are lined with more than 170 buildings, most of which date to 13th to the 18th century and demonstrate the welfare and art\ncreated by the Republic of Venice. The noble venetian families faced huge expenses to show off their richness in suitable palazzos.\nBecause most of the city's traffic goes along the Canal rather than across it, only one bridge crossed the canal until the 19th century, the Rialto Bridge (see below).\nThere are currently two more bridges, the Ponte degli Scalzi and the Ponte dell'Accademia. A fourth, controversial bridge (Ponte della Costituzione) designed by\nSantiago Calatrava was opened in 2011, connecting the train station to the vehicle-open area of Piazzale Roma. As was usual in the past, people can still take\na ferry ride across the canal at several points by standing up on the deck of a simple gondola called traghetto.\nMost of the palaces emerge from water without pavement. Consequently, one can only tour past the fronts of the buildings on the grand canal by boat.\nThe Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute (Our Lady of Health) [background right], commonly simply known as the Salute,\nstands on a narrow finger of land between the Grand Canal and the Bacino di San Marco.\nIn 1630 Venice experienced an unusually devastating outbreak of the plague. As a votive offering for the city's deliverance from the pestilence, the Republic of Venice\nvowed to build and dedicate a church to Our Lady of Health (or of Deliverance, Italian: Salute). The church was designed in the then fashionable Baroque style by\nBaldassare Longhena, a pupil of the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio, and construction began in 1631. Most of the objects of art housed in the church bear references\nto the Black Death. The dome of the Salute was an important addition to the Venice skyline and soon became emblematic of the city, inspiring artists like Canaletto,\nThe Rialto Bridge (Ponte di Rialto) is one of the best-known sights of Venice. It was built in 15881591 by Antonio da Ponte who had won the contract against such eminent architects as Michelangelo and Palladio. The marble bridge (48 m long, 22 m wide, span height 7.5 m) which spans the Canal Grande at its narrowest spot remained the only bridge across the canal for more than 250 years until the Accademia Bridge was built in 1854. Each of the two bridge heads was built on a foundation of 6,000 piles. The bridge has three walkways: two along the outside ballustrades and a wider, central one between two rows of small shops.\nThe tower depicted in the right background of the picture on glass no. 2987 [near left] belongs to the\nGlasses no. 2986, 2987 and 2988 (see already above) are labeled as souvenirs for\nAs the three glasses are typical souvenir items it is not likely that"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:646cc27e-911e-434d-b2b1-55d95c79f7a7>","<urn:uuid:dd44c1f1-7085-41c7-92c8-4b71547ff894>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the narrative of Rome's foundation differ between ancient sources and Mill's childhood account, particularly regarding Aeneas and the early kings?","answer":"The traditional narrative describes Aeneas as a Trojan refugee who came to Italy, married Lavinia (daughter of King Latinus), and fought wars with Turnus over this marriage. His descendant line eventually led to Romulus, Rome's founder. Mill's childhood account aligns with this but provides a more simplified version, stating that Aeneas, son of Venus and Anchises, established Albania, succeeded Latinus, and fought against the Rutuli, whose king Turnus he defeated. Both accounts then proceed to describe the succession of Roman kings, including Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, and others, though Mill's account focuses more on their military conquests and territorial expansions.","context":["Front Page Titles (by Subject) Appendix A: Juvenilia - The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, Volume I - Autobiography and Literary Essays\nReturn to Title Page for The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, Volume I - Autobiography and Literary Essays\nThe Online Library of Liberty\nA project of Liberty Fund, Inc.\nSearch this Title:\nAppendix A: Juvenilia - John Stuart Mill, The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, Volume I - Autobiography and Literary Essays \nThe Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, Volume I - Autobiography and Literary Essays, ed.

Both are in BL Add. MS 33230, c.1 and c.2, presented by Mill’s sister Harriet on 29 April, 1887.\nThe “History” is written on sheets cut, folded, and sewn to make a little booklet of ten leaves: the title and name (with the information that the author was 6½ years old when he wrote—or began?—it) are on 1r; the text is recto, with the facing versos used for notes and the lists of consuls in office during the events described in the latter part of the text (a common device in Roman histories of the period). In the text below, the notes are given as footnotes and the lists as marginal notes. As the text breaks off in mid-sentence, and the list of consuls on 10v implies a facing text, it may be inferred that the “History” continued into another booklet, and probably into more than one. The paper is watermarked “G Pike” but there is no date on any of these sheets. The hand is not that of the young Mill, Alexander Bain, who saw this version of the “History” before it was given to the British Museum, says “a lady friend of the family copied and preserved it” (John Stuart Mill [London: Longmans, Green, 1882], p. 3).\nIn editing this fragment, the great temptation (one that some will think we should have succumbed to) was to print a diplomatic text, preserving all the idiosyncrasies of the original. But several problems militate against this single happy solution: first, since the manuscript is not in Mill’s hand, we would be preserving someone else’s version, as we are not able to determine which of the many errors of various kinds are Mill’s responsibility; second, we do not know exactly on which source he was drawing for particular bits of information, so we cannot tell when an “error” is in his source or is the result of carelessness or failure of comprehension on his part; third, there are different renderings (both Greek and Latin) of various proper names, so there is no one contemporary correct form; fourth, while with juvenilia of this kind it is important to preserve the flavour of the original, one should not leave the reader puzzled and unable to solve small mysteries.\nOur attempt to balance these considerations has resulted in the following decisions.\n1. The text follows the manuscript in substantives and accidentals except (a) when the reading of a proper name is uncertain, in which case an accepted version is used, (b) when different erroneous versions of a proper name occur, in which case the version that dominates in the “History” is used, even though it is mistaken, (c) in the few places where aberrant accidentals might impede the reader’s understanding, in which case normal forms are used, and (d) where there is a manifest though minor error in syntax, likely to be the copyist’s responsibility, in which case a correction is made. A list of these corrections is given at the end. Also listed are places where, though no correction has been made, the reader may be given pause (for example, “Aborian” [542.3 (of the text)], which must be wrong, is not altered, but in this list “Aborigian [Aboriginal]” is suggested as the intended word).\n2. The marginal list of Consuls, like the text relating specifically to the Consuls and their succession, is left unamended, except that—as in (a) and (b) above—names are adjusted to the dominant (even if erroneous) form. There are misidentifications, misorderings, and gaps, but to have altered and corrected these would have involved a major distortion of the manuscript’s text; the reader interested in comparing this version with the modern one should consult T. Robert S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol. I (New York: American Philological Association, 1951).\n3. The references in the manuscript’s notes are rudimentary, and so have been expanded and the accidentals altered to make comprehension easier. The individual changes are not listed, but are summarized. Some notes have been expanded and some added by the editors; square brackets signal these changes.\n4. As elsewhere in this volume, we have changed “&” to “and” and have lowered superscripts to the line. In the manuscript there are inked lines drawn across the page to separate the “chapters”; these have been omitted here. Normal footnote indicators, in sequence, have replaced the superscript “(a)” that appears in each case in the manuscript.\nThe History of Rome by John Stuart Mill aged 6½ yrs\nFirst Alban Government Roman Conquest in Italy\nWe know not well any part, says Dionysius of Halicarnassus, of the History of Rome till the Sicilian invasion.[*] Before that time, the country had not been visited by any foreign invader. After the expulsion of the Sicilians, Aborian Kings reigned for several years: but in the time of Latinus, Aneas, son of Venus and Anchises came to Italy, and established a kingdom there called Albania. He then succeeded Latinus in the government, and engaged in the wars of Italy. The Rutuli, a people living near the sea, and extending along the Numicus up to Lavinium opposed him. However Turnus their King was defeated and killed by Aneas. Aneas was killed soon after this. The war continued to be carried on chiefly against the Rutuli, to the time of Romulus, the first king of Rome. By him it was, that Rome was built.\nLatin Government Regal State\nRomulus, then conquered the Lavinienses, and defeated the Veians. He established a Senate. The Romans seized the Sabine women and on account of this the Sabines made war with them. * Romulus took Canina, Crustiminium, and Antemna.\nHe also took Cures and died.\nNuma Pompilius chosen King\nNuma Pompilius a Sabine was chosen king in the room of Romulus. He thoroughly restored his People to the exercise of peace. He died however soon.\nTaking of Alba, Death of Hostilius\nTullus Hostilius, a very warlike prince, succeeded him. He took the cities of Alba, Fidæna and died. Ancus Marcius succeeded him. He took Politorium. Tellena and Ficcana, Latin cities† and also Fidæna and Velitræ and died.\nTarquinius Evergetes chosen King\nTarquinius Priscus, his successor, took Apiolæ, Crustiminium and Collatia. He gave to his brother Arynx the government of Collatia, with the name of Collatinus. Collatinus defeated the Tuscans at Veii and Cera. Tarquin himself defeated them near Eratum, a city of Sabinia. He died and was succeeded by Servius Tullius.\nThis Prince defeated the Sabines and Tuscans and died.\nTarquinius Superbus, his Successor took Suessa, a city of the Volsci. He finally reduced the Sabines.\nGovernment of Rome after the deposition of Kings\nBehaviour of Collatinus and Poplicola\nA conspiracy, formed in favor of Tarquin, was quelled. It had been carried on by near relations of the Consuls. Collatinus retired from Rome to Lavinium, where he lived and died in peace. * Poplicola was appointed Consul in his stead. Brutus (though the Romans gained the victory) was slain in a battle against Tarquin. Sp. Lucretius was appointed Colleague of Poplicola.\nSabine war.

Therefore that is the reason of its being Poplicola in Dionysius not Publicola, as in Plutarch. Livy also calls him Poplicola. I know not the reason of its being Poplicola in Hooke and Livy. It is also spelt Ποπλιος (Poplius) in Greek, not Πυβλιος (Publius). It must doubtless be a mistake in Langhorne’s Plutarch. [This learned footnote is not without its difficulties. In Plutarch’s Lives, trans. John and William Langhorne, 6 vols.

The Livy reference is probably to Bk. II, Chap. viii, §2, however (and we do not know what edition is in the mind of the young Mill, who is not thought to have yet begun to learn Latin), various versions of the name appear in different editions, including “Publicola” and “Poblicola.” Of course no “mistake” is involved, but merely different versions of the actual and honorific names.]","Founding of Rome\nThe founding of Rome can be investigated through archaeology, but traditional stories handed down by the ancient Romans themselves explain the earliest history of their city in terms of legend and myth.\nThe most familiar of these myths, and perhaps the most famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, the twins who were suckled by a she-wolf. This story had to be reconciled with a dual tradition, set earlier in time, the one that had the Trojan refugee Aeneas escape to Italy and found the line of Romans through his son Iulus, the namesake of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.\nThe national epic of mythical Rome, the Aeneid of Virgil, tells the story of how Trojan prince Aeneas came to Italy. The Aeneid was written under Augustus, who claimed ancestry through Julius Caesar from the hero and his mother Venus. According to the Aeneid, the survivors from the fallen city of Troy banded together under Aeneas and underwent a series of adventures around the Mediterranean Sea, including a stop at newly founded Carthage under the rule of Queen Dido, eventually reaching the Italian coast. The Trojans were thought to have landed in an area between modern Anzio and Fiumicino, southwest of Rome, probably at Laurentum or, in other versions, at Lavinium, a place named for Lavinia, the daughter of King Latinus whom Aeneas married. This started a series of armed conflicts with Turnus over the marriage of Lavinia. Before the arrival of Aeneas, Turnus was engaged to Lavinia, who then married Aeneas, starting the war. Aeneas won the war and killed Turnus. The Trojans won the right to stay and to assimilate with the local peoples. The young son of Aeneas Ascanius, also known as Iulus, went on to found Alba Longa and the line of Alban kings who filled the chronological gap between the Trojan saga and the traditional founding of Rome in the 8th century BC.\nToward the end of this line, King Procas was the father of Numitor and Amulius. At Procas' death, Numitor became king of Alba Longa, but Amulius captured him and sent him to prison; he also forced Numitor's daughter Rhea Silvia to become a virgin priestess among the Vestals. For many years, Amulius was the king. The tortuous nature of the chronology is indicated by Rhea Silvia's ordination among the Vestals, whose order was traditionally said to have been founded by Romulus's successor Numa Pompilius.\nRomulus and Remus\nThe myth of Aeneas was of Greek origin and had to be reconciled with the Italian myth of Romulus and Remus, who would have been born around 771 BC if taken as historical figures. They were purported to be sons of Rhea Silvia and either Mars, the god of war, or the demi-god hero Hercules. They were abandoned at birth, in the manner of many mythological heroes, because of a prophecy that they would overthrow their great-uncle Amulius, who had overthrown Silvia's father Numitor. They were abandoned on the Tiber River by servants who took pity on the infants, despite their orders. The twins were nurtured by a she-wolf until a shepherd named Faustulus found the boys and took them as his sons. Faustulus and his wife Acca Larentia raised the children. When Remus and Romulus became adults, they killed Amulius and restored Numitor. They decided to establish a city; however, they quarreled, and Romulus killed his brother. Thus, Rome began with a fratricide, a story that was later taken to represent the city's history of internecine political strife and bloodshed.\nThe ancient Romans were certain of the day Rome was founded, April 21, the day of the festival sacred to Pales, goddess of shepherds, on which date they celebrated the Par ilia (or Palilia). However, they did not know the exact year the city had been founded; this is one reason they preferred to date their years to the presiding consuls over using the formula A.U.C. or Ab Urbe Condita. Several had been proposed by ancient authorities, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus records these: the Greek historian Timaeus, the first to write a history of the Romans, stated that Rome was founded in the 38th year prior to the first Olympiad, or 814 BC; Quintus Fabius Pictor, the first Roman to write the history of his people, stated Rome was founded in the first year of the eighth Olympiad, or 748/7 BC; Cincius Alimentus claimed Rome was founded in the fourth year of the twelfth Olympiad, or 719/8 BC; and Cato the Elder calculated that Rome was founded 432 years after the Trojan War, which Dionysius stated was the first year of the seventh Olympiad, or 752/3 BC. Dionysius himself provided calculations showing that Rome was founded in 751 BC, starting with the Battle of the Allia, which he dated to the first year of the ninth Olympiad, or 390 BC, then added 119 years to reach the date of the first consuls, Junius Brutus and Tarquinius Collatinus, then added the combined total of the reigns of the Kings of Rome (244 years) to arrive at his own date, 751 BC. Even the official Fasti Capitolini offers its own date, 752 BC.\nThe most familiar date given for the foundation of Rome, 753 BC, was derived by the Roman antiquarian Titus Pomponius Atticus, and adopted by Varro, having become part of what has come to be known as the Varronian chronology. An anecdote in Plutarch where the astrologer Lucius Tarrutius of Firmum provides an argument based on a non-existent eclipse and other erroneous astronomical details that Rome was founded in 753 BC suggests that this had become the most commonly accepted date. Through its use by the third-century writer Censorinus, whose De Die Natali was the ultimate influence of Joseph Justus Scaliger's work to establish a scientific basis of ancient chronology, it became familiar.\nRecent discoveries by Andrea Carandini on Rome's Palatine Hill have also yielded evidence of a series of fortification walls on the north slope that can be dated to the middle of the 8th century BC. According to the legend, Romulus plowed a furrow (sulcus) around the hill in order to mark the boundary of his new city.\nThe name of Rome\nThere is no consensus on the etymology of the city's name. Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) suggested Greek \"ῥώμη\" (rhōmē), meaning \"strength, vigor\". A modern theory of etymology holds that the name of the city is of Etruscan origin (and perhaps the city itself, though this cannot be proven), derived from rumon, \"river\".\n|This section needs additional citations for verification. (December 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)|\nThe historical Latins were originally an Italic tribe who inhabited the Alban Hills.[when?] They later moved down into the valleys, which provided better land for agriculture. The area around the Tiber river was particularly advantageous and offered notable strategic resources; the river was a natural border on one side, and the hills could provide a safe defensive position on the other side. This position would also have enabled the Latins to control the river and the commercial and military traffic on it from the natural observation point at Isola Tiberina. Moreover, road traffic could be controlled, since Rome was at the intersection of the principal roads to the sea coming from Sabinum (in the northeast) and Etruria (to the northwest).\nThe development of the town is presumed to have started from the development of separate small villages located at the tops of hills that eventually accreted to form Rome. In any case, the location that became the city of Rome was inhabited by Latin settlers from various regions, farmers and pastoralists, as evidenced by differences in pottery and burial techniques.\nRecent studies suggest that the Quirinal hill was very important in ancient times, although the first hill to be inhabited seems to have been the Palatine (therefore confirming the legend), which is also at the center of ancient Rome. Its three peaks, the minor hills (Cermalus or Germalus, Palatium, and Velia), were united with the three peaks of the Esquiline (Cispius, Fagutal, and Oppius), and then villages on the Caelian Hill and Suburra.\nThese hills had expressive names. The Caelian Hill was also called Querquetulanus (from \"quercus\", oak) and \"Fagutal\" (pointing to beech-woods, from \"fagus\" meaning \"beech\"). Recent discoveries revealed that the Germalus on the northern part of the Palatine was the site of a village (dated to the 9th century BC) with circular or elliptical dwellings. It was protected by a clay wall (perhaps reinforced with wood), and it is likely that this is where Rome was really founded.\nThe territory of this federation was surrounded by a sacred border called the pomerium, which enclosed the so-called e Servian expansion of Rome.\nFestivals for the Septimontium (literally \"of the seven hills\") on December 11 were previously considered to be related to the foundation of Rome. However, April 21 is the only date for Rome's foundation upon which all the legends agree, and it has recently been argued that Septimontium celebrated the first federations among Roman hills. A similar federation was, in fact, celebrated by the Latins at Cave, Italy or at Monte Cavo (in Castelli).\nDuring the Italian Renaissance, a group of humanists affiliated with the Roman Academy formed a sodality to pursue antiquarian interests, celebrating the \"birthday of Rome\" annually on April 20. In 1468, the Academy was suppressed by Pope Paul II for fomenting \"republicanism, paganism, and conspiracy\", but the sodality was reinstated about ten years later under Sixtus IV as the Societas Literatorum S. Victoris in Esquiliis (\"Literary Society of Saint Victor on the Esquiline\"). The reformed group placed itself under the new patronage of saints Victor, Fortunatus, and Genesius, \"whose feast day was conveniently proven to coincide with the Palilia\". Their \"Palilia\" was organized by Pomponio Leto and featured speeches, a communal meal, and a poetry competition.\n- Livy (1797). The history of Rome. George Baker (trans.). Printed for A.

When left undetected, malicious code can gain access to confidential information, corrupt data, and allow attackers to gain control of systems. To avoid these damaging circumstances, it is important to detect unknown malicious behaviour efficiently. This article outlines the challenges of new threats’ detection and provides a guide to detecting and responding to new threats, with a focus on indicators of malicious behaviour.\nChallenges of new threats detection\nNew threats can take on a variety of forms and present distinct challenges for their detection, such as:\n- Polymorphism: Malware developers modify the malicious code to generate unique variants of the same malware.\n- Not identified: Some threats are still not identified and don’t have any rulesets for detection.\n- FUD: Some threats can be Fully UnDetectable (FUD) for some time and challenge perimeter security.\n- Encryption: The code is often encrypted, making it difficult to detect by signature-based security solutions.\n- Low and slow: Malware authors may use a “low and slow” approach, which involves sending a small amount of malicious code across a network over a long time, making it harder to detect and block.\nDetection of new threats\nTo detect new threats, researchers must use reverse engineering, static analysis, dynamic analysis, sandboxing, and heuristics to determine the malicious nature of code. Tools such as Process Monitor and Wireshark, as well as ANY.RUN, can help with these steps. The most important focus should be on indicators of malicious behaviour.\nMonitor suspicious activities for effective detection\nIn computer security terminology, a signature is a typical footprint or pattern associated with a malicious attack on a computer network or system. Behavioural signatures are especially important when detecting threats, as all activities in the OS leave behind a trace. By running a suspicious program in a sandbox to observe its behaviour, malicious activities such as abnormal file system activity, suspicious process creation and termination, abnormal networking activity, and more can be identified.\nFor example, Microsoft Office launching PowerShell is suspicious, as is an application that adds itself to the scheduled tasks, or a svchost process running from the temp registry. Other suspicious activities may include attempting to delete shadow copies, creating a TXT/HTML file with readme text in each directory, or sending credentials, OS characteristics, or other sensitive data collected locally from an infected system.\nUse case #1\nHere is a sample of the stealer. It steals user data, cookies, wallets, etc. The malicious intentions of the threat can be revealed when the application opens the Chrome browser’s Login Data file.\nUse case #2\nMalicious applications may attempt to stop Windows Defender or create an exclusion for themselves, activities which are not typical of legitimate programs. If user data is encrypted in the process, it can be assumed to be ransomware.\nBehaviour analysis enhances organisations’ ability to respond to new and unknown threats and strengthens their protection without additional costs. Cybercriminals can use unknown threats to extort businesses for money and launch large-scale cyberattacks, but these can be identified and prevented by focusing on indicators of malicious behaviour. Try ANY.RUN online interactive service to monitor suspicious activities and get the first results immediately.\n- Unknown malware presents a significant cybersecurity threat and can cause serious damage to organizations and individuals alike.\n- Known malware families are more predictable and can be detected more easily, while unknown threats can take on a variety of forms, causing a bunch of challenges for their detection.\n- Reverse engineering, static analysis, dynamic analysis, sandboxing, and heuristics can be used to detect new threats.\n- Behavioural signatures are especially important when detecting threats, as all activities in the OS leave behind a trace.\n- Focus on indicators of malicious behaviour to detect any threat, even without signatures.\n– Behavior analysis enhances organizations’ ability to respond to new and unknown threats and strengthens their protection without additional costs."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:96c69411-f503-4e10-a6a1-e6047d551a3c>","<urn:uuid:e9ba8987-1df1-4a1b-a438-de9f1017b538>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hey! Could you compare how light and vibration techniques are used differently in MSEs vs Parkinson's therapy? 😊","answer":"In MSEs, light techniques are extensively used through multiple components like bubble tubes with changing light colors, fiber optic strands that produce soft glows, and projector devices that display colorful moving images - all designed to promote visual focus, tracking, and relaxation. Vibration is incorporated through specialized furniture with built-in speakers for feeling music vibrations. In contrast, Parkinson's therapy focuses primarily on vibration techniques through specialized braces and wraps that provide soft massage-like vibrations, specifically targeted to reduce tremors, alleviate pain, and improve dexterity. The vibration therapy for Parkinson's is more medically focused, while in MSEs it's part of a broader sensory experience combining multiple stimuli for well-being and learning.","context":["According to Research Autism: “Multi-sensory Environments or MSE’s are designed to create a feeling of safety and to provide novel and intriguing sensations, which can promotes pleasure and/or feelings of well-being. They can also be utilized as part of the learning or treatment experience or for leisure and relaxation.”\nTypically, a MSE is a dedicated space or room that is designed to stimulate the senses through a controlled environment enhanced with individualized sensory equipment. Some of the goals and benefits of MSE’s include promoting relaxation and a feeling of well-being, focus and attention, understanding of cause/effect and social interaction skills and are often a perfect milieu for those on the autism spectrum. With their adjustable sensory components combining touch, vibration and movement with sight and sound, they offer something for all levels and sensory preferences.\nComponents in a sensory room can vary widely and usually involve selection based on the assessment of the special needs or general population that will be utilizing the space. A collaboration between educators, parents, equipment vendors and other related specialists are helpful when planning an MSE. Here are just a few of the options available that may work well for individuals with autism:\nThe clear plastic water column produces a steady stream of small bubbles which coordinate with changing light colors within the tube. With an interactive Bubble Tube, the user presses a switch or panel which allow the tube to change color and/or speed of vibration of the bubbles so can help promote cause/effect, turn taking and simple visual perception skills. In addition to the light, the hum and vibration of the tube are also often a source of attention and appeal.\nFor an update on a traditional bubble tube, consider the Calming Bubble Wall as a space saver and/or if there are behavior issues that would preclude using a standard tube.\nThese are light sources made of fiber optic strands in a variety of options including hanging curtains, wall or floor carpets, vertical sprays or draped strands over a sitting piece such as a bean bag cushion. In a semi-darkened room, Fiber Optics produce a soft glow that can promote visual focus and tracking. When used in strands (usually grouped in sets of 100 or more) and draped across the body in a seat or in a swing, the weight of the combined strands provides deep touch pressure input on the body which may help promote the relaxation/calming response.\nThese devices are a fun method to project colorful images onto walls, ceilings, floors or a soft space such as a draped parachute. Themed concepts such as shapes, planets, a deep sea environment or even customized pictures are displayed on a projector disc or wheel which gently rotates producing a clear slow moving image across the desired surface. In a semi- darkened room, these oversized rotating images are great for calming, attending and visual focus and tracking.\nThese lounging pieces such as a beanbag, recliner, wedge, pillow or mats have built in speakers which allow the user to “feel” the music through vibration. Classical, drumming and/or even some contemporary new age composers are often good music choices to use with this equipment.\nWhen considering a MSE keep in mind your space. Obstructions such as excess light from windows, wall barriers such as closet doors, cabinets/shelving and/or ventilation (side hvac units etc.) should be covered, moved or minimized as feasible. Additional electrical outlets may need to be installed and lighting should be changed to a rheostat control to allow gradual dimming. Floor and/or wall padding may be needed for comfort and acoustics. If space or budget is limited a Sensory Calming Cocoon or a Portable Sensory Corner may be good options. Visit our website for more sense-ational ideas for sensory rooms!","How vibration therapy can alleviate tremors caused by Parkinson’s disease\nHere's how vibration therapy can be used to limit pain and tremors caused by Parkinson's disease.\nParkinson’s disease is a disorder that over time creates mobility problems by affecting the nervous system. Tremors are one of the most common symptoms, and this can be very minor or more serious involuntary bouts of shaking. As many as one million Americans are living with the condition, according to the Parkinson’s Disease Foundation. Medication costs average $2,500 per person each year, and surgeries can be $100,00 or more.\nVibration therapy represents a powerful and cost-effective resource for individuals living with Parkinson’s disease. There is evidence that this can sooth pain and stiffness, and growing research suggests it can alleviate tremors as well. For many people around the world, vibration therapy could be an important tool. Here’s what you need to know:\nWhat is Parkinson’s disease?\nThe disorder is characterized by the slow break down and death of neurons that limit chemical messaging throughout the body. As a result, individuals living with Parkinson’s may suffer from tremors caused by imbalances in the brain. This can also lead to stiffness and limited mobility in the limbs, hands and feet. Some patients may also have trouble with posture, and eventually struggle with writing, speech and even breathing.\nThe Mayo Clinic reported that scientists are unsure of the root causes of the disorder. There are genetic traits that can leave individuals more susceptible to Parkinson’s disease, but environmental factors and behaviors can play a role as well. And although older adults and men in particular show higher rates of the condition, it can affect anyone.\nHow can vibration therapy help?\nThere is no cure for Parkinson’s disease, and although on-going treatments are available that extremely important for those living with the disorder, these can be expensive or difficult. Fortunately, researchers have uncovered that vibration therapy can be helpful in limiting pain or reducing tremors.\n“There are many options when it comes to vibration therapy.”\nScientists from the Florida State University College of Medicine found that regular vibration therapy was helpful in improving the quality of life in study participants diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. Similar results were also reported by researchers at the Biomedical and Mechanical Engineering Departments at the Lebanese International University.\nOverall, the use of small braces and wraps that softly massage the body through vibration not only supported individuals and lessened the affects of tremors, but were also able to reduce pain and improve dexterity in the short-term. Because there are many options when it comes to vibration therapy, those living with Parkinson’s have new options beyond traditional medical treatment.\nWhat other steps are helpful?\nImportantly, the authors of both studies stated that regular exercise was needed to make vibration therapy successful. This strengthens muscles and helps combat the degenerative effects of Parkinson’s disease. Even activities such as yoga or Tai Chi can be beneficial in keeping the body strong. When done in conjuncture, an individual can slow the process of the illness and use vibration therapy to minimize complications and discomfort.\nThe Mayo Clinic reported that other alternatives offer similar but less targeted relief. Massages reduce tension and promote relaxation. Home vibration therapy makes it possible to achieve the same results alone and with more specific results.\nIndividuals living with Parkinson’s disease may also benefit from a change in diet. Whole grains, fruits and vegetables promote wellness and help bolster an exercise regimen. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish has also been tied to better daily health for patients as well. Fiber and plenty of fluids are necessary too, as the disorder can cause complications going to the bathroom.\nOverall, vibration therapy is part of a mosaic of treatments that reduce pain and tremors. Gloves, wraps and masks that offer this relief represent an important resource in addressing Parkinson’s disease."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b1b99488-7293-4f33-8012-211cd59ef205>","<urn:uuid:c550bc8f-3c9e-4603-9769-ebdd26ca0028>"],"error":null}

Could you explain what changes were implemented in 2017?","answer":"In September 2017, the Federal Open Market Committee announced the implementation of a balance sheet normalization program, which began in October 2017. This program was outlined in the June 2017 addendum to the FOMC's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans. This initiative came after the Federal Reserve had significantly increased its balance sheet from about $900 billion at the end of 2007 to approximately $4.5 trillion following the global financial crisis.","context":["The Federal Reserve Bank of New York works to promote sound and well-functioning financial systems and markets through its provision of industry and payment services, advancement of infrastructure reform in key markets and training and educational support to international institutions.\nThe New York Fed engages with individuals, households and businesses in the Second District and maintains an active dialogue in the region.

We noted that while interest rates have generally come down over the past two decades, this decline has been more pronounced for Treasury securities. The conclusion that we draw from this evidence is that the convenience associated with the safety and liquidity embedded in Treasuries is an important driver of the secular (long-term) decline in Treasury yields. In this post and the next, we provide an overview of the two complementary empirical strategies we adopt to extract the trends in real interest rates and quantify their driving factors.

{"question":"Could you explain the difference between how bullying incidents are reported in Handel House School versus Alief ISD's reporting system?","answer":"In Handel House School, bullying incidents can be reported through informal access to the Head and other staff, with disclosures taken seriously whether they come from a pupil, parent, staff member, or volunteer. At Alief ISD, students or parents can report bullying either orally or in writing to teachers, counselors, principals, or other district employees, or by using a specific online Report Bullying Form. Alief ISD also offers an anonymous reporting option through their online form, though they note they cannot follow up on anonymous reports. Both systems emphasize prompt handling of reports and thorough investigation of incidents.","context":["At Handel House School we seek to create a culture in which bullying of any kind, either against pupils or adults is not accepted by any member of the school community. As an organisation that is serious about child protection, we will also be serious about preventing and tackling bullying whether it is on the grounds of race, religion, educational need, disability or sexual orientation. Bullying of any kind can threaten both the mental health and educational progress of our pupils. Handel House School enables all members of the school community to understand what constitutes bullying, making it clear to pupils, staff, parents and guardians that bullying is completely unacceptable.\nWe strongly believe that our pupils have the right to study in a safe, supportive and secure environment, free from physical threats, verbal taunts and any form of harassment. Incidents of bullying threaten this and cause enormous stress to victims. We are therefore strongly committed to the avoidance of bullying in all its forms. We provide a clear framework for dealing with incidents of bullying, ensuring that bullies are dealt with swiftly and firmly. Our aim is to promote positive relationships amongst all members of the school community and to develop a culture in which individuals are listened to and their concerns taken seriously. Our straightforward procedures make it easy to report bullying, including cyber bullying and bullying and bullying outside of school.\nTherefore if bullying does occur, all pupils should be able to tell, and know that incidents will be dealt with promptly and effectively. All adult members of our school community should be vigilant in recognising that bullying is taking place, and deal with it thoroughly and with sensitivity. Our aim is to promote positive relationships amongst all members of the school community and to develop a culture in which individuals are listened to and their concerns taken seriously. Records are kept to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach or to enable patterns to be identified. As part of this Policy we believe that all children and adults have the right to work in a supportive, caring environment in which pupils feel safe and free from bullying and harassment that may include cyber-bullying and prejudice-based bullying related to special educational need, sexual orientation, sex, race, religion and belief, gender reassignment or disability (as defined in the Equality Act 2010), and the use of discriminatory language.\nWe believe that the principle means of prevention is through the maintenance of conditions where bullying is less likely to flourish and is more easily detected. As we are a relatively small school, all pupils are known to us personally and it is therefore easier for us to detect signs of possible distress. Moreover, we feel that it is important that pupils have free and informal access to the Head and other staff. This can be seen in the procedures we adopt. However, a formal anti-bullying policy is of utmost importance.\nThis policy applies to all Handel House School activities both on and away from the school campus. We aim to promote a transparency in human relationships so that children, by default, are held to account for the feelings they may evoke in others. In the event of bullying taking place among the staff, the Headmistress should be informed and appropriate decisions made with possible reference to the relevant school Employment Policies and Procedures. Accusations of bullying of a pupil (pupils) by members of staff will be investigated thoroughly. Each pupil is treated fairly and with respect. Members of staff to whom disclosures are made should initiate the following procedures themselves and/or consult with the relevant staff as appropriate. All disclosures, whether from a pupil, a parent, a member of staff or a volunteer should be taken seriously and treated with sensitivity. The victim(s) should be made aware that their safety is considered to be of paramount importance.\nA bullying incident is treated as a child protection concern when there is reasonable cause to suspect that a child is suffering, or likely to suffer, significant harm. In such cases the school reports its concerns to the local authority social care department. We treat all our pupils and their parents fairly and with consideration and we expect them to reciprocate towards each other, the staff and the school. Any kind of bullying is unacceptable.\nBullying can be defined as a deliberate and a repeated (over time) to intentionally hurt another pupil or group physically or emotionally. It is often motivated by prejudice against particular groups, for example, on grounds of race, religion, culture, sex, gender, homophobia, special educational needs and disability ( as defined in the Equality Act 2010), or because a child is adopted or is a carer. It may occur directly or through cyber-technology such as social websites, mobile phones, text messages, photographs and email.\nA feature of bullying in schools is that its existence is not always immediately known or suspected by those in authority. The school recognises the seriousness of both physical and emotional bullying in causing psychological damage and even suicide. Although bullying in itself is not a specific criminal act in the UK, some types of harassing or threatening behaviour or communications could be a criminal offence; for example, under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, the Malicious Communications Act 1988, the Communications Act 2003 and the Public Order Act 1986. If our staff feel that an offence may have been committed, we will seek assistance from the police.\nBullying can take place between pupil and pupil, staff and staff and staff and pupil. We consider the pastoral care of the pupils and staff to be of prime importance. In class, this role largely rests with the class teacher. It is school policy that any misdemeanour will be dealt with by the member of staff present when it occurs, whether in the playground, classroom, cloakroom or any part of the school. A common code of behaviour is expected from everyone at Handel House School (see Behaviour Policy). All staff and volunteers at Handel House School are expected to treat each other with a professional level of respect. The term ‘bullying’ is commonly associated with acts of violence but non-physical bullying is experienced by most pupils at some period during their school career.\nHandel House School’s Anti-bullying Policy is dovetailed with the Behaviour Management Policy (with support for the victim and the bully) and makes it clear what the sanctions are for bullying. At Handel House School we implement disciplinary sanctions that reflect the seriousness of an incident and convey a deterrent effect. If necessary, strong sanctions, such as exclusion, would be used in cases of severe and persistent bullying. It is incumbent on Handel House School to have clear policies that are communicated to parents, pupils and staff, along with creating an environment of good behaviour and respect, with helpful examples set by staff and older pupils. Integral to our policy is involving parents and making sure pupils are clear about the part they can play to prevent bullying, including when they find themselves as bystanders. Handling of a bullying incident is given much thought to ensure that the facts are fully known, agreed and understood by the bully/ies and the victim(s). Bullying instances are reported and recorded so that patterns can be identified. Staff will consult with the Head or other senior manager knowing that their response will be sympathetic and appropriate.\nDownload our Anti-Bullying Policy in full by clicking the button below. This policy is made available to parents or guardians of pupils on request to the school office, during the school day, or by e-mail.","WHAT IS BULLYING?\nDefined in the Education Code as a single significant act or pattern of acts by one or more students directed at another student that exploits an imbalance of power and occurs when a student or group of students engages in written or verbal expression through electronic means, or physical conduct against another student that:\n- Has the effect or will have the effect of physically harming a student, or damaging the student’s property; or\n- Places a student in reasonable fear of physical harm to the student’s person;\n- Is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive enough that the action or threat creates an intimidating, threatening, or abusive educational environment for that student;\n- Materially and substantially disrupts the educational process or the orderly operation of a classroom or school; or\n- Infringes on the rights of the targeted student at school.\nBULLYING INCLUDES CYBERBULLYING.\nThis state law on bullying prevention applies to:\n- Bullying that occurs on or is delivered to school property or to the site of a school-sponsored or school-related activity on or off school property;\n- Bullying that occurs on a publicly or privately owned school bus or vehicle being uses for transportation of students to or from school or a school-sponsored or school-related activity; and\n- Cyberbullying that occurs off school property or outside of a school-sponsored or school-related activity if the cyberbullying interferes with a student’s educational opportunities or substantially disrupts the orderly operation of a classroom, school, or school-sponsored or school-related activity.\nProcedures for Reporting Allegations of Bullying in Alief ISD\nThe district prohibits bullying on school property, at school-sponsored or school-related activities, or in any vehicle operated by the district. Bullying may be verbal or written expression or expression through electronic means, or physical conduct. Bullying is not tolerated by the district and any student or parent of a student who believes that the student or another student has experienced bullying or that a student has engaged in bullying is encouraged to immediately report the incident. Retaliation against anyone involved in the complaint process is a violation of district policy and is prohibited.\nStudents or parents may report an alleged incident of bullying, orally or in writing, to a teacher, counselor, principal or other district employee. Students or parents may contact the student’s Assistant Principal to complete an Investigation of Behavior form.

{"question":"Can you explain how Bitcoin works as a currency for transactions, and what environmental concerns does its mining process raise? 🤔","answer":"Bitcoin works as a currency through a decentralized network where users can conduct peer-to-peer transactions using digital wallets. To make a transaction, the sender enters the recipient's Bitcoin address and amount, then signs with their private key. The transaction is validated by miners and recorded on the blockchain. Many merchants now accept Bitcoin, including major companies like Microsoft and Overstock, though its price volatility can pose challenges for everyday use. However, Bitcoin mining, which is essential for validating transactions, has significant environmental impacts. The mining process requires massive computational power and energy consumption - estimated at 128.84 TWh annually, exceeding Argentina's energy usage. This high energy consumption primarily relies on non-renewable sources like coal and natural gas, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.","context":["In the ever-evolving world of digital currency, the emergence of Bitcoin has undoubtedly captured the attention of individuals and organizations worldwide. As a decentralized virtual currency, Bitcoin has generated both intrigue and skepticism, leaving many to ponder: what is Bitcoin used for? Beyond its existence as a form of digital payment, Bitcoin holds the potential to revolutionize multiple industries, from finance to healthcare, offering secure, fast, and borderless transactions. This article will explore the multifaceted uses of Bitcoin and shed light on its transformative power in the modern era. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known digital currency, has gained significant traction and popularity in recent years. Understanding Bitcoin is essential for anyone looking to get involved in this innovative and rapidly evolving field. In this comprehensive article, we will delve into the definition of Bitcoin, explore its creation, and shed light on how it works. We will also provide detailed instructions on how to buy and sell Bitcoin, discuss the benefits and risks involved in using Bitcoin, analyze its potential as a currency and investment, delve into Bitcoin mining, explore its usage on the Darknet, and examine its role in remittances. Finally, we will look into the future of Bitcoin and its potential impact on payment systems.\nDefinition of Bitcoin\nBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, often referred to as a cryptocurrency, that enables peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries such as banks or governments. It was created by an anonymous person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin operates on a technology called blockchain, a transparent and secure system that records and verifies transactions.\nThe Creation of Bitcoin\nBitcoin was created in 2008 in a white paper published by Satoshi Nakamoto titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” The white paper outlined the concept of a decentralized digital currency and proposed the use of blockchain technology to maintain a transparent and secure transaction ledger. In January 2009, the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain, often referred to as the genesis block, was mined by Nakamoto, marking the birth of Bitcoin.\nHow Bitcoin Works\nBitcoin works through a decentralized network of computers called nodes, which maintain the blockchain and validate transactions. When a user initiates a Bitcoin transaction, it is broadcasted to the network and grouped with other pending transactions into a block. Miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems, and the first to find a solution adds the block of transactions to the blockchain. This process, known as mining, not only secures the network but also incentivizes miners with newly minted Bitcoins. Once a transaction is included in a block, it is considered confirmed and cannot be reversed.\nHow To Buy and Sell Bitcoin\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Exchanges\nBitcoin exchanges are online platforms that allow users to buy, sell, and trade Bitcoin using various currencies, such as US dollars or euros. These exchanges act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, matching their orders and facilitating the transfer of funds. Some popular Bitcoin exchanges include Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. It is important to choose a reputable and secure exchange that complies with regulatory requirements to ensure the safe handling of funds.\nHow to Buy Bitcoin\nTo buy Bitcoin, you first need to open an account with a Bitcoin exchange. This typically involves providing your personal information, such as your name, email address, and proof of identity. Once your account is verified, you can deposit funds into your exchange account using a bank transfer or other supported payment methods. With funds in your account, you can place a buy order specifying the amount of Bitcoin you wish to purchase and the price you are willing to pay. If your buy order matches a sell order on the exchange, the trade will be executed, and the Bitcoin will be credited to your account.\nHow to Sell Bitcoin\nSelling Bitcoin is a similar process to buying. You need to have a Bitcoin exchange account, deposit your Bitcoin into your account, and create a sell order specifying the quantity of Bitcoin you want to sell and the desired price. When a buyer matches your sell order, the trade will be executed, and the funds will be credited to your account. From there, you can withdraw the funds to your bank account or utilize them for other investments or purchases.\nBenefits of Using Bitcoin\nOne of the key benefits of using Bitcoin is its decentralized nature. Traditional currencies are controlled by central banks and governments, which can lead to inflation, currency manipulation, and restrictions on transactions. With Bitcoin, the power is distributed among the network of nodes, making it more resistant to censorship, control, and manipulation.\nPotential for High Returns\nBitcoin has gained significant attention due to its potential for high returns on investment. Its limited supply, with a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins, coupled with increasing demand, has led to significant price appreciation over the years. Bitcoin’s decentralized and global nature also makes it accessible to individuals and investors worldwide, further contributing to its potential for high returns.\nPseudonymity and Privacy\nBitcoin offers a certain level of pseudonymity and privacy. While transactions on the blockchain are transparent and traceable, Bitcoin addresses are not directly linked to individuals’ identities. This can provide a sense of privacy when conducting transactions, especially for those seeking to maintain their financial information confidential.\nRisks Involved in Using Bitcoin\nBitcoin is known for its extreme price volatility. Its price can fluctuate significantly within short periods, leading to potential gains or losses. This volatility makes Bitcoin a risky investment and may deter individuals seeking stability in their financial assets.\nLack of Regulation\nUnlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin operates in a regulatory gray area. It is not backed by any government or regulatory authority, which can lead to challenges and uncertainties regarding its legal status, taxation, and consumer protection. The lack of regulation also opens the door to potential fraud and scams in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nPotential for Loss Due to Hacking\nWhile Bitcoin blockchain technology is secure, individual Bitcoin users may be vulnerable to hacking and theft. Hackers often target individuals’ Bitcoin wallets, exchange accounts, or other vulnerable points of entry to steal Bitcoins. It is crucial for Bitcoin users to employ robust security measures, such as strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and cold storage solutions, to minimize the risk of loss due to hacking.\nUncertain Legal Status\nBitcoin’s legal status varies from country to country. Some governments have embraced Bitcoin and implemented regulations to foster its growth, while others have imposed strict regulations or even banned it outright. This uncertain legal environment can create challenges for individuals and businesses engaging with Bitcoin, leading to potential legal or regulatory repercussions.\nBitcoin as a Currency\nHow to Use Bitcoin for Transactions\nBitcoin can be used as a currency for various transactions, both online and offline. To use Bitcoin for transactions, a person needs a Bitcoin wallet, which is a digital wallet that acts as a personal bank account for storing and managing Bitcoin. When making a transaction, the sender enters the recipient’s Bitcoin address, specifies the desired amount, and signs the transaction with their private key. The transaction is then broadcasted to the network and validated by miners, ensuring its inclusion in the blockchain.\nMerchants that Accept Bitcoin\nOver the years, an increasing number of merchants and businesses have started accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. These merchants span various industries, including online retailers, travel agencies, restaurants, and even real estate agencies. Some well-known companies that accept Bitcoin include Microsoft, Overstock, and Expedia. Payment processors like BitPay have also emerged, allowing merchants to seamlessly accept Bitcoin payments and convert them into traditional currencies if desired.\nPros and Cons of Using Bitcoin as Currency\nUsing Bitcoin as a currency offers several advantages. It allows for fast and borderless transactions, as Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world within minutes. Bitcoin transactions are also often cheaper than traditional payment methods, especially for international transfers. Furthermore, Bitcoin provides an alternative to individuals in countries with unstable currencies, political unrest, or limited access to banking services.\nHowever, there are also drawbacks to using Bitcoin as a currency. Bitcoin’s price volatility can introduce uncertainty and pose challenges for both buyers and sellers. Additionally, not all merchants accept Bitcoin, limiting its usability. The process of converting Bitcoin into traditional currencies can also involve fees and delays, especially if the Bitcoin market experiences high demand or congestion.\nBitcoin as an Investment\nBitcoin as a Commodity\nBitcoin has been regarded as a digital commodity due to its limited supply and scarcity. Similar to precious metals or other commodities, Bitcoin’s value is driven by supply and demand dynamics. Investors consider Bitcoin as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation or economic instability. Its increasing adoption and potential for high returns have led many to view Bitcoin as a speculative investment asset.\nApproaches to Investing in Bitcoin\nThere are several approaches to investing in Bitcoin. Some investors choose to buy Bitcoin directly by creating an account on a Bitcoin exchange and purchasing Bitcoin with fiat currency. Others prefer to invest indirectly through investment vehicles such as Bitcoin investment trusts or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, some investors engage in short-term trading strategies, capitalizing on Bitcoin’s price volatility.\nRisks and Rewards of Investing in Bitcoin\nInvesting in Bitcoin involves both risks and rewards. The potential rewards include the possibility of significant returns on investment, especially in times of price appreciation. Bitcoin’s limited supply and increasing mainstream adoption contribute to its potential as a long-term investment asset. However, the risks associated with investing in Bitcoin should not be overlooked. Its price volatility can lead to substantial losses, and the lack of regulation and market manipulation can expose investors to fraudulent schemes and pump and dump schemes.\nWhat is Bitcoin Mining\nBitcoin mining is the process of verifying and adding new transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain. It involves solving complex mathematical problems using computational power, and the first miner to find a solution is rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins. Mining also secures the network and ensures the integrity and immutability of the blockchain.\nHow Bitcoin Mining Works\nBitcoin mining requires specialized hardware called mining rigs, which are built with powerful processors and graphics cards. Miners compete to solve a computational puzzle by continually guessing a random number until finding the correct solution. To increase their chances of solving the puzzle, miners often join mining pools, which allow them to combine their computing power and share the rewards.\nThe Profitability of Bitcoin Mining\nBitcoin mining profitability depends on several factors, including the cost of electricity, the price of Bitcoin, the mining difficulty, and the efficiency of the mining hardware. As the number of miners and the difficulty of the puzzles increase, it becomes more challenging to mine Bitcoin profitably. Miners need to carefully consider their costs and potential returns before investing in mining equipment and operations.\nBitcoin and the Darknet\nHow Bitcoin is Used on the Darknet\nThe Darknet, often associated with illicit activities, has embraced Bitcoin as a means of conducting anonymous transactions. Bitcoin’s pseudonymity and decentralized nature allow users on the Darknet to engage in illegal activities such as drug trafficking, weapons sales, and money laundering. Bitcoin’s ability to facilitate anonymous transactions has made it the preferred currency on several Darknet marketplaces.\nThe Implications of Bitcoin’s Usage in Illegal Activities\nBitcoin’s usage in illegal activities presents several implications. First, it raises concerns about the legitimacy and public perception of Bitcoin as a reliable and transparent currency. The association with illegal activities can tarnish Bitcoin’s image and create regulatory challenges. Furthermore, the unregulated nature of the Darknet marketplaces and Bitcoin transactions can make it difficult for law enforcement agencies to trace and seize illicit funds.\nEfforts to Curb Illegal Bitcoin Use\nTo address the concerns surrounding Bitcoin’s usage in illegal activities, regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies have implemented various measures. These include increased monitoring of Bitcoin transactions, cooperation between international agencies to combat money laundering and terrorism financing, and the development of tools and technologies to trace and analyze Bitcoin transactions on the blockchain. Efforts are also being made to educate the public about the risks and consequences of engaging in illegal activities using Bitcoin.\nBitcoin and Remittances\nHow Bitcoin is Used for Remittances\nBitcoin has gained traction as a potential solution for cross-border remittances, especially in developing countries. Traditional remittance methods can be slow, expensive, and subject to third-party fees. Bitcoin offers a faster and more cost-effective alternative, allowing individuals to send and receive money internationally within minutes and with lower transaction fees.\nAdvantages of Using Bitcoin for Remittances\nUsing Bitcoin for remittances offers several advantages. Bitcoin transactions are fast and can be completed within minutes, enabling individuals to receive funds promptly. The transaction fees associated with Bitcoin remittances are often lower than those charged by traditional remittance services, making it a more affordable option, especially for smaller transfers. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing the potential for delays or bureaucracy in the remittance process.\nChallenges in Using Bitcoin for Remittances\nWhile Bitcoin presents opportunities for remittances, there are also challenges that need to be addressed. Bitcoin adoption and awareness are still relatively low in many countries, making it challenging for individuals to convert Bitcoin into local currency. The volatility of Bitcoin’s price also introduces uncertainty for recipients who may need to quickly convert Bitcoin into their local currency to cover expenses. Finally, the regulatory environment surrounding Bitcoin remittances varies from country to country, which can create legal and compliance challenges for both senders and recipients.\nFuture of Bitcoin\nDevelopments on the Horizon\nThe future of Bitcoin holds great potential for further developments and innovations. One area of focus is scaling Bitcoin to accommodate increased transaction volume and address concerns regarding network congestion and high fees. The Lightning Network, a layer built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, aims to enable faster and cheaper transactions by facilitating off-chain transactions and reducing the burden on the main blockchain.\nPotential Impact of Governmental Regulation\nGovernmental regulation can have a profound impact on the future of Bitcoin. While regulatory clarity can foster mainstream adoption and provide a framework for businesses and individuals to operate within, excessive regulation or bans can stifle innovation and limit the growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Striking a balance between consumer protection, financial stability, and fostering technological advancements will be crucial for governments as they navigate the regulation of Bitcoin.\nHow Bitcoin May Shape Future Payment Systems\nBitcoin has the potential to reshape future payment systems. Its decentralized and global nature provides a level of accessibility and financial inclusion that traditional payment systems struggle to offer. The use of blockchain technology for transactions can increase transparency, streamline processes, and reduce costs. However, challenges such as scalability, regulatory compliance, and consumer adoption need to be addressed for Bitcoin to play a more prominent role in mainstream payment systems.\nIn conclusion, Bitcoin is a revolutionary digital currency that has captured the attention of individuals, investors, and governments worldwide. Understanding its definition, creation, and operation is essential for anyone interested in participating in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Buying and selling Bitcoin, recognizing its benefits and risks, evaluating its potential as a currency and investment, exploring Bitcoin mining, examining its usage in the Darknet, and understanding its role in remittances sheds light on the multifaceted nature of Bitcoin. As we look into the future, developments, governmental regulation, and the potential impact of Bitcoin on payment systems present exciting possibilities and challenges that will shape the trajectory of this transformative technology.","As the world becomes more conscious of sustainability, the environmental impact of industries and businesses is under the microscope. Cryptocurrency is one of the newer and rapidly evolving industries that has been called out for its high energy consumption and carbon footprint. However, the cryptocurrency sector is also built on innovation, decentralization, and financial democratization. The challenge is to balance these two seemingly opposing goals – sustainability and innovation. In this article, we will explore the environmental concerns of cryptocurrency and ways to mitigate its impact while continuing to promote its benefits.\nRead more: Silvergate Collapse Dragging Down Bitcoin Volume\nCryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses encryption techniques to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds. It is decentralized and operates on a peer-to-peer network that enables secure, fast, and anonymous transactions. Cryptocurrency has gained popularity in recent years, with bitcoin being the most well-known example. However, the process of generating cryptocurrency, known as mining, requires significant computational power, which consumes a massive amount of energy.\nThe amount of energy consumed by cryptocurrency mining has sparked concerns about its environmental impact. According to a 2021 report by the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the annual energy consumption of bitcoin mining alone is estimated to be around 128.84 TWh, which is more than the energy consumption of Argentina. The high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, as the majority of the energy used comes from non-renewable sources like coal and natural gas.\nThe Environmental Impact of Cryptocurrency\nCryptocurrency mining is a highly energy-intensive process that requires specialized computer equipment and software. The process involves solving complex mathematical problems to verify transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. The first miner to solve the puzzle is rewarded with a certain amount of cryptocurrency.\nTo mine cryptocurrency, miners need to use powerful computers, which consume a considerable amount of energy. The energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is a function of the computing power used and the time it takes to solve the problem. As the difficulty of the problem increases, more computing power is required, which leads to a higher energy consumption.\nThe high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has a significant impact on the environment. Most of the energy used to power cryptocurrency mining comes from non-renewable sources like coal and natural gas. The combustion of fossil fuels leads to the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming and climate change. The increase in greenhouse gas emissions from cryptocurrency mining is a concern as it undermines global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.\nMitigating the Environmental Impact of Cryptocurrency\nThe environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining can be mitigated by adopting sustainable practices. Some of the ways to reduce the energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining are:\nUsing renewable energy sources: One of the most effective ways to reduce the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining is to use renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Some cryptocurrency mining companies are already using renewable energy to power their operations. For example, the cryptocurrency mining company, Square, has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030.\nDeveloping energy-efficient mining equipment: Cryptocurrency mining companies can reduce their energy consumption by developing energy-efficient mining equipment. For example, some companies are developing ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) that are designed to consume less energy than traditional computer processors.\nImplementing proof-of-stake consensus mechanism: Another way to reduce the energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is to implement the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Proof-of-stake is an alternative to proof-of-work, which is the current consensus mechanism used by most cryptocurrencies. Proof-of-stake does not require miners to solve complex mathematical problems to verify transactions. Instead, it relies on a random selection process to choose a validator who is responsible for verifying transactions. Validators are required to hold a certain amount of cryptocurrency, which acts as a stake. If a validator acts maliciously, their stake is forfeited. The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is less energy-intensive than proof-of-work, making it a more sustainable alternative.\nCarbon offsetting: Cryptocurrency mining companies can offset their carbon emissions by investing in renewable energy projects or purchasing carbon credits. Carbon offsetting is a way to neutralize the carbon emissions associated with cryptocurrency mining by investing in sustainable projects that reduce carbon emissions.\nBalancing Sustainability and Innovation\nCryptocurrency has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry by providing financial democratization and decentralization. However, this cannot come at the expense of the environment. The challenge is to balance sustainability with innovation. The cryptocurrency industry needs to take responsibility for its environmental impact and take steps to mitigate its carbon footprint. It is essential to recognize that sustainability and innovation are not mutually exclusive goals, but rather complementary.\nSustainability is a key factor in the long-term success of cryptocurrency. As the world becomes more conscious of the environment, consumers are looking for sustainable products and services. The cryptocurrency industry needs to recognize this trend and take steps to reduce its carbon footprint. By adopting sustainable practices, the cryptocurrency industry can attract a more environmentally conscious audience.\nCryptocurrency has the potential to transform the financial industry by providing financial democratization and decentralization. However, the high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has sparked concerns about its environmental impact. To balance sustainability and innovation, the cryptocurrency industry needs to take responsibility for its carbon footprint and adopt sustainable practices. By using renewable energy sources, developing energy-efficient mining equipment, implementing proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, and carbon offsetting, the cryptocurrency industry can mitigate its environmental impact. Sustainability is not a trade-off for innovation, but rather a complementary goal that is essential for the long-term success of the cryptocurrency industry."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c5c3f0c8-950e-4834-8909-91539519d6a7>","<urn:uuid:16d423b7-32cb-493a-822d-c068233478c4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How can control valves be protected from harsh environmental conditions to ensure long-term reliability? Please explain the protection mechanisms.","answer":"To protect control valves in harsh environments like moisture-laden atmospheres, corrosive chemicals, and regular wash-downs, one key solution focuses on protecting the spring chamber of the actuator. Since atmospheric air is drawn into the spring chamber each time the valve operates, this area is vulnerable to contamination. The solution is to use clean, instrument air to replenish the spring chamber, which prevents contamination from entering. This is achieved by diverting a small amount of clean control air into the control head, maintaining a slight positive pressure. This simple innovation prevents corrosion of the internal elements and can significantly improve reliability and longevity in challenging operating conditions.","context":["Making the right choice for process control valves\nDamien Moran, Field Segment Manager, Hygienic, Pharmaceutical at Bürkert, looks at some of the basic differentiators of process valves as well as some recent design developments.\nControl valves are used to manage the flow rate of a liquid or a gas and in-turn control the temperature, pressure or liquid level within a process. As such, control valves are defined by the way in which they operate to control flow and include globe valves, angle seat, diaphragm, quarter-turn, knife and needle valves, to name a few. In most cases the valve bodies are made from metal; either brass, forged steel or in hygienic applications 316 stainless steel.\nOne of the main areas of debate when specifying control valves is determining the size of the valve required. Quite often process engineers will know the pipe diameter that is used in an application and it is tempting to take that as the defining characteristic for the control valve. Of greater importance are the flow conditions within the system as these will dictate the size of the orifice within the control valve. The pressure either side of the valve and the expected flow rate are essential pieces of information when deciding on the valve design.\nInside the valve body, the actuator design is predominantly either a piston or a diaphragm design. The piston design typically offers a smaller, more compact valve which is also lighter and easier to handle than the diaphragm designs. Actuators are usually made from stainless steel or polyphenolsulpide (PPS), which is a chemically resistant plastic. The actuator is topped off by the control head or positioner.\nOlder, pneumatically operated positioners had a flapper/nozzle arrangement and operated on 3-15 psi, so no matter what the state of the valve, open closed or somewhere in between, the system was always expelling some compressed air to the atmosphere.\nCompressed air is an expensive commodity, requiring considerable energy to generate and when a manufacturing line is equipped with multiple process control valves all venting to the atmosphere, this can equate to a considerable waste of energy. It is important then to establish not only the most appropriate valve design, but also a cost-effective solution that takes account of annual running costs.\nModern, digital, electro-pneumatic valves that use micro solenoid valves to control the air in and out of the actuator have introduced significant improvements for operators. This design means that while the valve is fully open, fully closed or in a steady state, it is not consuming any air. This, and many other engineering improvements, have made substantial advances in both economy and precision.\nValve seats can be interchangeable within a standard valve body, which allows the valve to fit existing pipework and the valve seat to the sized to the application more accurately. In some cases, this can be achieved after the valve has been installed, which would enable a process change to be accommodated without replacing the complete valve assembly.\nSelecting the most appropriate seal materials is also an important step to ensure reliable operation; Steam processes would normally use metal-to-metal seals, whereas a process that included a sterilisation stage may require chemically resistant seals.\nHaving installed a new valve, setting it up is now comparatively easy and much less time-consuming. In-built calibration procedures, such as Bürkert’s X-tune, perform the initial setup procedures automatically, measuring the air required to open and close the valve, the resistance of the piston seals on the valve stem and the response time of the valve itself. Once complete, the valve is ready for normal operation.\nControl valves should be specified so that they operate in the 40-85% range so if the valve is commanded to a 10% setting, it can detect that something has potentially gone wrong with the control system and the best course of action is to close the valve completely. If the valve is commanded to a position of 10% or less this can cause very high fluid or gas velocities, which have damaging effects on the system and cause considerable noise and damage to the valve itself.\nModern control functionality can offer a solution that acts as a safety device to prevent damage to the process pipework and components. By building in a fail-safe mechanism, any valve position setting below a pre-set threshold will result in the valve closing completely, preventing damage to the surrounding system.\nControl inputs can also include safety circuits to ensure safe operating conditions within the process equipment. For example, if an access panel on a vessel containing steam is opened, an interlock switch will open and the valve controlling the steam supply to the vessel can be closed automatically helping to mitigate any risks.\nMany process control environments offer less than ideal conditions for long-term reliability. Moisture-laden atmospheres, corrosive chemicals and regular wash-downs all have the capacity to shorten the service life of a process control valve. One of the potential weaknesses of the actuator is the spring chamber where atmospheric air is drawn in each time the valve operates.\nOne solution is to use clean, instrument air to replenish the spring chamber, preventing any contamination from entering. This offers a defence against the ingress of airborne contaminants by diverting a small amount of clean control air into the control head, maintaining a slight positive pressure, thus achieving a simple, innovative solution. This prevents corrosion of the internal elements and can make a significant improvement to reliability and longevity in certain operating conditions.\nOther News from Burkert Fluid Control Systems\nLatest news about Valves & cylinders"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:596c7e5d-dd11-4cbd-9525-d1ec90c75d9c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the different interference patterns that can occur when sound waves interact, and under what specific conditions do they happen?","answer":"Sound waves can create two types of interference patterns: constructive and destructive interference. Constructive interference occurs when two waves combine to make a bigger wave, and this happens when the path difference (δ) equals 0, λ, 2λ, 3λ, or more generally nλ (where n = 0, 1, 2, 3...). Destructive interference, where waves combine to make a smaller wave, occurs when the path difference equals λ/2, 3λ/2, 5λ/2, or more generally (n+ ½)λ. This can be demonstrated through simple experiments, such as using two speakers placed side by side, where moving along a line joining the speakers reveals points of increased and decreased sound intensity.","context":["Air is the most common medium for sound to propagate. The vibration produced by a sound source such as the voice or a horn, is transmitted in turn in all directions to the surrounding air molecules and these to their neighbors.\nThis disturbance causes pressure variations in the air, creating pressure waves. These variations are propagated and when they reach the eardrum, it begins to vibrate and the auditory signal is produced.\nWaves carry energy at the same speed as the disturbance. In air, for example, sound travels at a rate of about 343.2 m / s under normal conditions of temperature and pressure, this speed being a characteristic of the medium, as we will see later.\nHow does the propagation of sound occur?\nThe propagation of sound basically occurs in two ways, the first is the sound that comes directly from the source that originates it. The second is through the sound waves that are reflected off obstacles such as the walls of the rooms, giving rise to a reverberating sound field.\nThese reflections from sound waves can occur many, many times and what is interpreted as sound is the acoustic pressure resulting from the direct sound field and the reverberant field.\nIn this process, the sound waves give up their energy to the medium and diminish with distance until they disappear.\nSound propagation speed\nThe speed with which sound propagates in different media depends on their properties. The most relevant are density , elasticity, humidity, salinity and temperature. When these change, so does the speed of sound.\nThe density of the medium is a measure of its inertia, which is a resistance to the passage of the pressure wave. A very dense material initially opposes the passage of sound.\nFor its part, elasticity indicates how easy it is for the medium to regain its properties once it is disturbed. In an elastic medium, sound waves travel more easily than in a rigid medium, because the molecules are more willing to vibrate over and over again.\nThere is a physical quantity called the modulus of compressibility to describe how elastic a medium is.\nEquation for the speed of sound\nIn general, sound propagates in a medium with a speed given by:\nWhere the elastic property is the modulus of compressibility B and the property y is the density ρ:\nFinally, temperature is another important factor when sound propagates through a gas such as air, which is the medium through which most of the sound waves propagate. When considering the ideal gas model, the quotient B / ρ depends only on its temperature T.\nIn this way, the speed of sound in air at 0ºC is 331 m / s, while at 20 ºC its value is 343 m / s. The difference is explained because when the temperature increases, the vibrational state of the air molecules also rises, facilitating the passage of the disturbance.\nMeans of propagation\nSound is a mechanical wave that needs a material medium to propagate. Therefore there is no way for sound to be transmitted in a vacuum, unlike electromagnetic waves that can do so without major problem.\nAir is the most common environment for sound transmission, as well as other gases. Disturbances are transmitted by collisions between gaseous molecules, in such a way that the higher the density of the gas, the faster the sound travels.\nAs we have said before, temperature influences the propagation of sound in gases, since when it is higher, collisions between molecules are more frequent.\nIn air, the dependence of the speed of sound v on the temperature T in kelvin is given by:\nMany times the temperature is not distributed evenly in a place, for example a concert hall. The warmer air is closer to the floor, while above the audience it can be up to 5ºC cooler, which affects the propagation of the sound in the room, since the sound moves faster in the areas more hot.\nLiquids and solids\nSound travels faster in liquids than in gases, and even faster in solids. For example, in fresh water and salt water, both at a temperature of 25 ºC, the speed of sound is, respectively, 1493 m / s and 1533 m / s, about four times more than in air, approximately.\nIt is easy to check by putting your head in the water, so the noise of the engines of the boats is much better than in the air.\nBut in solid materials like steel and glass, the sound can reach up to 5920 m / s, therefore they conduct sound much better.\nSimple sound propagation experiments\nSound waves interfere constructively or destructively, in other words, they overlap. You can easily experience this effect with a simple experiment:\n-1 pair of speakers like the ones you use on desktop computers.\n-Cell phone that has a wave generator application installed.\nThe experiment is carried out in a large, open room. The loudspeakers are placed side by side, 80 cm apart and in the same orientation.\nNow the speakers are connected to the phone and both are turned on with equal volume . A specific frequency is selected in the generator, such as 1000 Hz.\nThen you have to move along the line that joins the speakers, but maintaining a separation of about 3 m. It is immediately noticeable that at some points the intensity of the sound increases (constructive interference) at some points and decreases at others (destructive interference).\nIt is also observed that when standing at the equidistant point from the speakers, this is always a place of constructive interference.\nThis experience, which requires the participation of two people, serves to verify that the objects have characteristic frequencies.\n2 identical empty bottles.\nParticipants must keep their bottles upright and vertical and be separated by a distance of approximately 2 m. One of the people blows through the mouth of the bottle, making the jet of air impinge obliquely, the other person holds his bottle vertically next to the ear.\nThe listener immediately notices that the sound appears to be coming from their own bottle, although the original sound is produced by the bottle being blown by the other person. This phenomenon is called resonance .\nThe experience can be repeated if the blowing person’s bottle is filled halfway with water. In this case the sound is also recorded, but higher.","Presentation on theme: \"Waves A disturbance in a medium that transfers energy and momentum.\"— Presentation transcript:\nWaves A disturbance in a medium that transfers energy and momentum\nTo produce a Wave: A vibration (disturbance) A medium – a substance to travel through.\nExamples of Waves Sound Light Water\nThere are two types of waves\nTransverse Transverse – the individual wave particles move perpendicular to the velocity of the wave.

{"question":"Is there a similar emphasis on professional training in both child protection systems and judicial proceedings?","answer":"Yes, both systems emphasize professional training. Child protection systems specifically require a highly trained workforce as part of their well-developed frameworks. Similarly, in judicial proceedings, there is a strong focus on training professionals, with specific emphasis on training for multidisciplinary and inter-agency teams. The European Commission highlights the importance of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary cooperation and coordination, including training, as crucial elements for effective implementation of child-friendly justice.","context":["The main objective of the CBSS Expert Group Children at Risk 2020-2025 strategy is to enhance national child protection systems through regional exchange and cooperation. The value of regional cooperation to strengthen and support national child protection systems is significant. Experience has shown that engaging in cross-border dialogues to address the complex issue of building and sustaining child protection systems can significantly improve the overall effectiveness of the systems. Collaboration and exchange of promising practices strengthen trust among stakeholders and enable the development of more resilient and inclusive child protection systems.\nCreating resilient and effective child protection systems poses a multi-faceted and multi-dimensional challenge. They involve a wide range of actors such as children, families, communities, and sub-national or national-level authorities. They consist of formal and informal structures, functions, and capacities to prevent and respond to abuse, violence, and exploitation of children. The systems rely on human and financial resources, laws and policies, governance, and protection and response services.\nThe Expert Group provides a platform that fosters regional exchange and cooperation, sharing good practices, promoting cooperation and collaboration, and establishing partnerships, ultimately resulting in mutual trust among stakeholders in the region.Olivia Lind Haldorsson, Senior Adviser, Head of the Children at Risk Unit\nRecent crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the war against Ukraine, have highlighted the importance of effective and resilient systems. A recent mapping of child protection systems, led by Norway with the participation of Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, and Lithuania, and funded by the CBSS Project Support Facility, aimed at identifying key practices and success factors of effective and resilient systems, including in crises. The countries’ national legislative, policy, and strategic frameworks are founded in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The child protection systems are well developed and encompass legal frameworks, governance structures, a plethora of programs ranging from prevention to response, a highly trained workforce, and decentralised services. The mapping also highlighted promising cross-border practices. For more information about the mapping, click here.\nThe mapping will result in a regional registry of noteworthy practices.

The German Presidency’s priority on online child sexual abuse is one such challenge. Many of the member states have experienced an increase in online child sexual abuse cases. A recent survey of Barnahus in seven European countries established that Barnahus have seen an increase in cases that concern child sexual abuse that have an online element. There is a consensus that more data and research are needed. By working cross-borders, countries can tackle this emerging challenge in a coordinated and more effective way by sharing resources, information, and promising practices.\nTo facilitate cross-border cooperation, we are working with partners from the region to collect data on online violence against children. We aim to gain a deeper understanding of online child sexual abuse and to develop evidence-based preventive measures. We are also working to adapt multidisciplinary and inter-agency service models to support the protection, justice, and recovery of child victims and witnesses of online sexual violence. In this work, we aim to implement and evaluate tailored protocols and procedures to ensure that victims of online child sexual violence receive appropriate and holistic support and provide training for multidisciplinary and inter-agency teams in cases related to online child sexual abuse.","Written by Anna Dimitrova-Stull, Ulla Jurviste and Irene Penas Dendariena,\nEvery year hundreds of thousands of children across the EU are involved in judicial proceedings. They may enter into contact with justice systems in many different ways: for family issues such as divorce or adoption, in administrative justice for immigration or nationality matters or in criminal justice, as victims, witnesses or suspects/offenders. It is essential that they are met with a system that respects both their particular vulnerability and their rights. To that purpose, a set of international standards has been developed to ensure that children are heard and protected in the process.\nThe EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) reveals that child participation practices in the EU vary not just across but also within Member States, and these practices are not always child-friendly. It points out that in recent years respect of the child’s right to be heard has improved particularly in criminal proceedings but in civil ones children are not always heard. There is a need to ensure that children’s access to justice and their treatment in legal proceedings is effectively monitored to prevent any discrimination, says FRA.\nIn January 2016, the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) endorsed the agreement reached by the Parliament and the Council last December to set new rules designed to make legal protection of children who are suspected or accused of a crime more consistent within the EU, providing a set of rights that meet their specific needs.

{"question":"How does IBM's Food Trust platform enhance food production safety, and what are the key security measures companies need to implement in their supply chain systems?","answer":"IBM's Food Trust platform enhances food production safety by creating complete transparency throughout the supply chain, allowing companies like Walmart and Nestle to monitor intermediaries and ensure proper product handling in real-time. The platform enables trustworthy communication between all parties through decentralized, immutable data. Regarding security measures, companies need to implement proactive defense protocols, conduct third-party risk assessments, and use efficient vetting software for suppliers. They should also identify and categorize suppliers with access to internal networks or critical enterprise data, segregate vendors according to their functional roles, and define specific data ownership requirements for every vendor to improve security across the supply chain.","context":["The world’s biggest retail companies use IBM’s blockchain platform IBM Food Trust to make their food production safer and more efficient throughout the supply chain. The platform has now been released to the general public.\nWalmart, Nestle, Kroger, Carrefour. The list goes on… The past year and a half some of the world’s biggest retailers have cooperated with IBM testing an ambitious project, to put the supply chain of retailer’s food production on a blockchain platform.\nNow the test phase is over. And with millions of food items scanned successfully, all companies now have the opportunity to source and monitor their food production on the platform.\n“We have gotten a very positive response from the retailers. They all have the option of tracing their goods on the blockchain and understand what happens in seconds instead of hours or days calling around to the different intermediaries,” says the head of IBM Blockchain Nordic, Christian Lassen.\nThe purpose of the platform is primarily to create transparency in a supply chain and monitor the different intermediaries to make sure they handle a company’s product the right way. This is something that has always been an issue for large companies, says the head of department for Digitalization at Copenhagen Business school, professor Jan Damsgaard.\n“Today, companies with large supply chains have to trust who they do business with. But with blockchain, you don’t have to trust anyone. The technology allows you to monitor the activities of your whole supply chain at once regarding transactions of goods, services and data. As it is now, companies can only verify the actions of one intermediary at a time. It’s a whole new way of transparency, which we haven’t seen before,” he says.\nBlockchain technology is able to create this transparency firstly because it is decentralized, which means the company and all intermediaries have the exact same information available at the same time. Secondly, because data already written in the blockchain cannot be manipulated, and therefore all data can always be traced back to who made the input.\n“The technology provides a new way of interaction that is more direct and transparent – it creates completely trustworthy communication between all parties,” says Christian Lassen.\nBig companies want transparency for customers\nAfter the platform was released for purchase to all companies around the world the list of participants continues to grow according to IBM. Two companies stand out, one of these is the biggest retailer in the world with a market capitalisation of more than 293 billion dollars, Walmart Inc, who from September 2019 have required all producers of their leafy green vegetables to use the blockchain platform.\n“We’re committed to providing our customers with safe, quality foods. Our customers deserve a more transparent supply chain. We felt the one-step-up and one-step-back model of food traceability was outdated for the 21st century. This is a smart, technology-supported move that will greatly benefit our customers and transform the food system, benefitting all stakeholders,” says Frank Yiannas, Vice President of Food Safety for Walmart Inc. in a press release.\nThe second stand out company French Carrefour is the fourth biggest retailer in the world. They have chosen to use the platform to create more safety around their food production.\n“Being a founding member of the IBM Food Trust platform is a great opportunity for Carrefour to accelerate and widen the integration of blockchain technology to our products in order to provide our clients with safe and undoubted traceability,” said Laurent Vallée, General Secretary of Carrefour in a press release.\nBut it is not only in food production that blockchain has the potential to create a more efficient and transparent process, according to Christian Lassen, Head of IBM Blockchain Nordic:\n“In many cases where transactions of data or value are being made, blockchain has the potential to optimize the process and make it better, safer and more transparent, dependent on the situation and use case. I think, that the market for blockchain will continue to grow within supply chains, KYC, payments and trade finance because there is a need for more transparency,” he says.\nAs an example, Christian Lassen mentions another blockchain platform IBM has developed – TradeLens. A supply chain digitization solution for the shipping industry where shippers, shipping lines, freight forwarders, port and terminal operators and customs authorities can interact more efficiently through real-time access to shipping data and shipping documents.","Maintaining a secure supply chain can be a challenge. Within a supply chain, numerous people, companies, third-party suppliers, and nations are likely involved, which can lead to serious security issues in logistics.\nMany companies depend on their own resources as well as industry standards to fight security issues. Depending on the industry, companies can be subject to security issues in logistics such as cyberattacks, theft, fraud, terrorism, sabotage, and more. A 2018 Ponemon Institute report found that 56% of companies suffered a breach caused by one of their third-party vendors. Although breaches in a supply chain are common, many companies remain unprepared.\nWhy is supply chain security important?\nAttacks to the supply chain are twofold. The first is usually meant to disrupt or cripple actual supply chains logistics. The second is to use supply chains as a channel to attack potentially thousands of connected partners and suppliers. By finding and exploiting weak links within the supply chain, attackers can jump between linked systems, stealing data and sabotaging businesses.\nTech, defense, financial services, and energy are favorable targets for hackers, but no industry is immune. In fact, there are now what experts call “island hoppers” who aren’t just attacking one organization, but instead multiple.\nA security issue within the supply chain should be a high priority for companies considering any incident or breach could greatly damage or disrupt operations; vulnerabilities could lead to unintended costs, inefficient delivery schedules, and a loss of intellectual property.\nThreats to supply chain security are on the rise across all industries, with nearly two-thirds of companies reporting a breach—spiking 78% last year-over-year. The top threat: cyberattacks. In fact, a recent report found that 56% of respondents have experienced a cybersecurity breach from a third-party supplier. But risks can occur at all stages—design, development and production, distribution, acquisition and deployment, maintenance, and disposal.\nOnce an attack occurs and disrupts the supply chain, a company’s reputation can be damaged. From that point on, it can sow doubt into consumers’ minds about reliability, productivity, and their security, including financial and personal information.\nHow can companies protect themselves from security issues in logistics?\nCompanies must be proactive in developing defense protocols and standards for supply chains. To ensure your company supply chain is secure, the proper management and safety regulations need to be put in place. For the majority of organizations, poor risk management is often a result of resource scarcity and ineffective processes.\nAs most breaches are caused by third parties, third party risk assessments—along with an efficient vetting software for suppliers—can reduce the threat of security breaches in a supply chain. Organizations should identify and categorize suppliers who either have direct access to their internal network or access to critical enterprise data.\nSegregating third-party vendors according to their functional role can also help organizations better understand who these contributors are, the type of information they have access to, and how they are connected to the company framework.\nAdditionally, companies need to define specific data ownership requirements for every vendor. All the stakeholders across the value chain need to be clear as to who maintains the ownership of data being shared and the acceptable use of that data—doing so can greatly improve security issues in logistics."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b28a04df-0059-4e73-af5e-b738f4c40dc8>","<urn:uuid:17e41b2a-b79c-4a5e-a244-7b4e4d21da41>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How long does a typical shingles outbreak last + when should you see a doctor?","answer":"A typical shingles outbreak lasts about seven to ten days before blisters start to scab over, with complete skin clearing taking an additional two to four weeks. You should seek medical attention as soon as possible if you suspect shingles, as the condition can lead to serious health issues if left untreated. It's especially critical to see a doctor if you're over 70 years old or if you have symptoms affecting the eye or areas near the eye. Early treatment provides the best results and may include pain relievers, medicated creams, and antiviral drugs to shorten the outbreak's duration and reduce complication risks.","context":["What are shingles?\nShingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a viral infection that affects approximately one third of Americans. The virus typically causes an itchy or painful skin rash of small, fluid-filled blisters. Eventually, the blisters dry out, form a crust, and sometimes leave behind scars. Interestingly, shingles is caused by a re-activation (or “awakening”) of the varicella-zoster virus in the body, the same virus that causes the chickenpox (more on that later). The condition is very contagious and can spread through direct physical contact with open sores or blisters, not just to other parts of the affected person’s body, but to those around them who’ve never been vaccinated or have never been exposed to the virus. It’s highly recommended that anyone who suspects they may have shingles to seek medical attention as soon as possible, as the condition can result in serious health issues if left untreated. Thankfully, only one out of three people with shingles might experience complications or severe symptoms, including nerve pain.\nSo, what’s the difference between shingles and chickenpox if they’re caused by the same virus? Usually, most varicella-zoster viral particles are destroyed by a person’s immune system following a chickenpox infection. For most people in the U.S. this happens in childhood. However, some of these particles can remain dormant (or inactive) in the body for years, re-activating later on in life to cause a shingles outbreak during a time of weakened immunity. This is why shingles outbreaks are more likely to occur among individuals with chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, people taking immunosuppressive drugs, and those over the age of 50. In fact, half of all shingles cases occur in people 60 years of age or older as age is the most relevant risk factor for developing shingles. While multiple outbreaks of shingles are fairly rare, the risk of recurrence is higher in immunocompromised individuals.\nKnowing what to look out for can not only help folks seek treatment early, but it can also prevent transmission to others. Symptoms of shingles may include:\n- Red, itchy rash with fluid-filled blisters, often on one side of the abdomen or near an eye\n- Pain, tingling, burning, and itchiness at infected sites of the skin, sometimes one to five days before the appearance of a rash\n- Fever or chills\n- General achiness, fatigue, headache, and upset stomach\nA shingles outbreak typically lasts about seven to ten days then blisters start to scab over. It may take another two to four weeks for the skin to clear completely — at this point, the person is no longer actively contagious. It’s worth noting that symptoms and the degree to which they’re experienced may vary between individuals. For example, some folks with shingles might experience pain without the rash, or vice versa. Left untreated, however, shingles can lead to severe complications, including serious nerve damage and pain that can last for months to years, as well as vision loss, neurological problems, and additional skin infections. Thus, if there’s a suspicion that shingles may be the culprit for a given set of symptoms, getting it checked out is wise. With this in mind, it has been noted that getting medical attention is especially critical for those people over the age of 70 concerned that they may have shingles or those who have characteristic symptoms that appear to be affecting the eye or areas of the face near the eye. Confirmation of a shingles diagnosis is only possible by assessing a person’s symptoms and ordering laboratory testing. Treatment started as soon as possible is recommended for best results and may include pain relievers (analgesics) and medicated creams to reduce the pain or itching. A prescription for an antiviral drug that can shorten the duration and severity of the outbreak and also reduce the risk of complications.\nAlthough shingles is less contagious than chickenpox, there are steps individuals can take towards prevention. There have been reports of airborne transmission — so it’s highly recommended that those with an active outbreak also avoid direct contact with newborn babies, pregnant women, and anyone with a weakened immune system. Frequent hand-washing, covering a shingles rash, and avoiding the urge to scratch are ways to prevent spreading the virus to others during an active outbreak. At-home remedies that might help with discomfort include wet compresses, calamine lotion, and oatmeal baths, pain relievers and fever reducers (though avoiding aspirin is a critical recommendation for young children, as it can lead to Reye’s syndrome).\nFortunately, there are also effective preventative strategies for avoiding a shingles infection all together. First, there’s the chickenpox vaccine, which most children receive as part of routine pediatric immunization in the United States. For individuals age 50 and over, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also approved the use of the shingles vaccine. While neither of these vaccines guarantees immunity, they can both help to reduce the onset, duration, and severity of outbreaks if they do occur.\nTo learn more about the condition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has additional information. If you’re experiencing concerning symptoms or are interested in being vaccinated, it may be a good idea to talk with your health care provider for more advice.Alice!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:075580ed-95a6-4f13-b709-02ad2ad93ad5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you explain what makes a species endemic according to the BSG website, and how does this relate to the bird species found at the South African wetland site? 🤔","answer":"According to BSG, while endemic birds are commonly understood as species occurring in just one country, this is technically incorrect as endemic truly refers to biome. A species is considered endemic if it breeds in only one ecoregion or area, though it may be found elsewhere when not breeding. The site specifies that species with ranges smaller than 50,000km2 are considered restricted range species. In the South African wetland site, this concept is exemplified by species like the White-winged Flufftail (Sarothrura ayresi), which has been recorded at the site with an estimated population of 30-50 birds, making it a significant location for this critically endangered species. The site also hosts other notable species like the Southern Bald Ibis and is located in the Grassland Biome at 1,700m altitude.","context":["New Users Introduction\nBirding Site Guide\nThis is a new where to watch birds, free access website for birders.

Most of the site is very straight-forward, particularly if you are computer literate. However some points need a little explaining.\nFinding a Site Account\nThere are 2 main ways you can do this, the first is through the search facility, which will produce a list of possibles. The other way is through the Regions and countries button.\nUsing Biogeographical Regions is more appropriate for biological organisms, but man-made concepts such as countries are obviously easy to understand. With this button you can find your target site using region and country.\nSite Accounts Layout\nThe information given is self explanatory, the only point that may cause confusion are the 2 sets of dates given. The first is actually not a date but the best time to visit that site. The second, in brackets, is the date of the visit of the main author/s.\nBecause English names on this site directly follow Handbook of the Birds of the World (which Clements 5th edition-2005 is based on) as on Avibase (Clements), the scientific names can readily be found via the hyperlink. They are thus not reproduced on the site account pages but are for (nearly) all site lists. Species status is from Birdlife International not Avibase, the reason for this is because Birdlife International is more up to date than Avibase, since it is the determining body, and it has individual species accounts for all species.\nExplanatory Notes on Species Lists\nSince no one species list I came across seemed to adequately cover all the species I regarded as Sought After Species, namely all threatened, all endemics and all restricted range species for a given area, I decided to make my own list.\nThreatened species lists do not cover commoner restricted range species, and similarly restricted range species lists do not cover more widespread threatened species. Neither list covers all endemics, and an endemics list does not cover either of the other 2 lists completely.\nEndemic birds as most birders understand are birds that only occur in one country. This is useful for listing but in fact is not correct, endemic refers to biome. Some species of endemics that are rare none-breeders in other biomes or countries are usually still regarded as endemic for practical reasons.\nWhen regarding species as country enedemics, certain points need to be remembered. Some species only occur in certain habitats of a limited area. Nevertheless this small area may straddle two or more countries borders (as with a mountain or lake) and the species may be found equally in all those countries. The species therefore is not a true country endemic but may occupy an area smaller than many true country endemics, and therefore be just as sought after by birders. Species with ranges smaller than 50,000km2 whether true endemics or not are what is meant by a restricted range species (Birdlife International). The problem is that species ranges are not defined by artificial human boundaries such as borders but by habitat and biome.\nIn order to identify the most important areas for such restricted range species, maps of ranges are draw and where 2 or more species are wholly confined to an area, that is where 2 or more restricted range species distributions overlap, then these areas are called Endemic Bird Areas or EBAs (Birdlife International). These species ranges may be in one block or fragmented blocks, so long as they do not cover more than 50,000km2 in total. Species with disjunct ranges therefore may fall in 2 different areas or even 2 different EBAs (as with some species found both in the Amazon and the Atlantic forest).\nBiome Endemic and Near Endemic Species Lists\nThese lists include all threatened, near-threatened, restricted range and country endemics for a whole biome. They can be found on site accounts and under the country list.\nAlthough endemics should be treated according to biome, they are often treated according to countries. It is obviously convenient to use the term country endemic, even if misleading this is because most birding trips focus on one country not an ecoregion. Country endemics are therefore recognized on birding site guide and are marked with an asterix * on the SAS list. If the list applies to more than one country then the endemics will be country coded.\nWhether a species should be considered an endemic if it only occurs in one habitat or whether it breeds in only one habitat or place, is open to debate. For example Kirtland’s Warbler only breeds in one small area but winters in another country.\nSince a species cannot exist without its breeding area, on this site an endemic is a species that breeds in only one ecoregion or area (country) but may or may not be found elsewhere when not breeding.\nNear endemics will be marked if known! For example Cinnamon Tanager is easily found in Brazil, but also has been found in Argentina and Paraguay. White-winged Nightjar and Lesser Nothura may be very difficult in Brazil but are easier to find in Paraguay.\nSpecies that have been extirpated from former ranges and now only occur in one country, will be marked? For example, Brazilian Merganser.\nCoastal, maritime and marine species will occur on the relevant ocean SAS list. So for Atlantic Ocean-South America all the SAS species recorded from that coast will be listed with a compass points (N, E, S, W, c, all) column to give an indication of where they might be found.\nLink and Hyperlinks\nPerhaps the next thing about the site account you will notice is that there are no full site lists on the accounts. However if you go below the Species Notes paragraph there is a link to elsewhere on BSG containing the lists (some lists are still in preparation). BENES links are found both on the country list and on the relevant site accounts, these go to the relevant ecoregion list, these lists contain all species that are threatened, near-threatened, restricted range and endemics to that ecoregion (the country endemics are marked with an asterix*).\nThere is a general list of birding links under the Birding Links button. Under Worldwide Links: Travel Advice, Volunteering & Accommodation (and elsewhere) are links regarding travel information.\nIf you notice any errors or have any comments or suggestions with site accounts or on the web pages generally please let me know. I sincerely hope you find this web site useful. New features are already planned but will take time and money to implement. Trip reports are welcome but again extracting relevant info and putting it to each site will be time consuming so information will take longer to appear. I take this opportunity to thank everyone in advance for their help, comments and submissions and hope they continue to have many good birding times.","|Location||South Africa, Free State|\n|Central coordinates||29o 34.00' East 28o 13.00' South|\n|IBA criteria||A1, A4i|\n|Year of IBA assessment||1998|\nSummary This site consists of a wetland on the private farms Wilge Rivier, Chatsworth and Bedford c. 20 km east of Harrismith. The farms lie in the Grassland Biome at an altitude of 1 700 m a.s.l. and consist primarily of flat grassland plains. White-winged Flufftail Sarothrura ayresi has been recorded at the site.\nSite description This site consists of a wetland on the private farms Wilge Rivier, Chatsworth and Bedford c.20 km east of Harrismith. The farms consist primarily of flat grassveld plains, most of which are used for growing maize, wheat, soya beans and pasture grass, while most of the remaining natural grassland on the slopes is grazed by sheep and cattle. A very large, impressive wetland is situated on the properties. This wetland is minimally disturbed or modified, and is possibly only grazed lightly for part of the year. The vlei has three major arms, which unite in a main channel running below a steep ridge on the wetland’s northern border. On sections of the vlei adjacent to the steeper slopes, there are extensive, broad beds of Phragmites, up to 2.5 m tall, which often contain a rich mixture of other plant species such as Carex, Cyperus, Typha, Schoenoplectus and Leersia. On the side of the wetland adjacent to the shallow slopes, the vegetation comprises extensive patches of Typha and mixed sedges, with some grass. Around the edges there are numerous small depressions and inlets with combinations of sedges and grasses, which further increase the diversity of the vegetation.\nKey Biodiversity See Box for key species. Sarothrura ayresi has been recorded at the site. There is enough habitat to support between 30 and 50 birds, a higher estimated total than for any other single site in South Africa. Potential habitat for Porzana pusilla occurs regularly around the edges of the wetland, and it may also breed here. Balearica regulorum occurs at the site regularly.\nNon-bird biodiversity: None known to BirdLife International.\n|Species||Season||Period||Population estimate||Quality of estimate||IBA Criteria||IUCN Category|\n|Southern Bald Ibis Geronticus calvus||resident||-||present||-||A1||Vulnerable|\n|White-winged Flufftail Sarothrura ayresi||winter||1998||30-50 individuals||unknown||A1, A4i||Critically Endangered|\n|Medium - based upon reliable but incomplete / partially representative data|\n|Energy production and mining||oil and gas drilling||likely in short term (within 4 years)||some of area/population (10-49%)||no or imperceptible deterioration||low|\n|Energy production and mining||renewable energy||likely in short term (within 4 years)||some of area/population (10-49%)||slow but significant deterioration||medium|\n|Human intrusions and disturbance||work and other activities||happening now||some of area/population (10-49%)||slow but significant deterioration||medium|\n|Invasive & other problematic species, genes & diseases||invasive non-native/alien species/diseases - named species||happening now||small area/few individuals (<10%)||slow but significant deterioration||low|\n|Invasive & other problematic species, genes & diseases||problematic native species/diseases - named species||happening now||some of area/population (10-49%)||slow but significant deterioration||medium|\n|Natural system modifications||dams & water management/use - abstraction of ground water (commercial use)||happening now||small area/few individuals (<10%)||no or imperceptible deterioration||low|\n|Natural system modifications||fire & fire suppression - increase in fire frequency/intensity||happening now||majority/most of area/population (50-90%)||moderate to rapid deterioration||high|\n|Residential and commercial development||tourism and recreation areas||likely in long term (beyond 4 years)||some of area/population (10-49%)||no or imperceptible deterioration||low|\n|Forest||0||0||moderate (70-90%)||good (> 90%)||near favourable|\n|Grassland||Grassland - edaphic, wet||0||0||good (> 90%)||moderate (70-90%)||near favourable|\n|Wetlands (inland)||Permanent herbaceous swamps and bogs||0||0||good (> 90%)||moderate (70-90%)||near favourable|\n|Whole area of site (>90%) covered by appropriate conservation designation||A comprehensive and appropriate management plan exists that aims to maintain or improve the populations of qualifying bird species||Substantive conservation measures are being implemented but these are not comprehensive and are limited by resources and capacity||high|\n|IUCN habitat||Habitat detail||Extent (% of site)|\n|Grassland||Grassland - edaphic, wet||-|\n|Wetlands (inland)||Permanent herbaceous swamps and bogs||-|\n|Artificial - terrestrial||9%|\n|Land-use||Extent (% of site)|\n|nature conservation and research||100%|\nReferences Taylor (1997a,b).\nContribute Please click here to help BirdLife conserve the world's birds - your data for this IBA and others are vital for helping protect the environment.\nRecommended citation BirdLife International (2016) Important Bird and Biodiversity Area factsheet: Ingula Nature Reserve.

{"question":"How does vehicle equity accumulate differently between leasing and financing, and what are the long-term financial implications of each choice?","answer":"With financing, you build equity in the vehicle because a portion of your higher monthly payments goes toward ownership. Over time, this equity can be used to help pay for your next car once the loan is paid off. In contrast, leasing typically doesn't build equity since you're making lower monthly payments that only cover the vehicle's depreciation during the lease term. From a long-term financial perspective, financing one vehicle and driving it for ten or more years is less expensive than leasing several vehicles over the same period. Additionally, when financing, you can sell or trade in your vehicle at any time and use the money from the sale to pay off any loan balance. It's worth noting that according to Carfax, a car will lose 10 percent of its value immediately after purchase and up to 20 percent after the first year.","context":["Fundamental Difference Whether to Finance or Lease\nAutomobile financing allows for the purchase of a vehicle. When you buy, you pay the entire cost of a vehicle regardless of how many kilometres you drive it. You typically make a down payment, pay all applicable taxes in cash or roll them into your loan, and pay an interest rate determined by your financial institution based on your credit worthiness. Most loans are for a term between 36 and 60 months, but can go up to 84 months. You make monthly payments and may pay off your loan at any time without penalty. You can pay less each month with a longer term, or you can shorten your term with a higher monthly payment to drive a new car sooner. Once the loan is paid off, you have an outright ownership of your vehicle also known as clear title.\nAutomobile leasing allows for the use of a vehicle during the lease term which is typically between 24 and 48 months, and up to 60 months. When you lease, you pay only for a portion of a vehicle’s cost, which is the part that you “use up” during the lease period. You have the option of not making a down payment, paying taxes only on your monthly payments and paying interest similar to what you would pay on a loan. You choose an allowance based on 16,000 to 24,000 kilometres of driving.\nAt the end of the lease term, you may either return the vehicle or purchase it for its depreciated resale value which is always spelled out in the lease contract. If you have driven the vehicle more than the allowable kilometres, and you hadn’t purchased extra kilometres upfront at a reduced rate beforehand, you will pay additional charges as specified in the lease contract.\nLeasing Tip: Residual Value\nCheck the residual value of a car before signing a lease agreement. The residual value is what the car is worth at the end of your lease. The value is based on a percentage of the MSRP Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price, as set by the leasing company, not the dealer. The value has a big impact on your monthly lease payments, and may affect your choice of vehicle, plus whether you choose to buy the car at the end of your lease.\nHere is how you calculate residual value and lease end value.\nConfirm your car’s MSRP on the automaker’s website.\nRequest the residual value percentage rate from your leasing company – usually between 45% and 60% but can be lower or higher. The lower the percentage, the lower your monthly lease payments and the higher the residual value of your car at the end of the lease.\nCalculate (MSRP) x (Residual Value %) = LEV Lease End Value\nExample: $35,000 MSRP x 58% = $20,300 LEV residual value (the price you pay if you decide to buy the car at the end of your lease)\nTop Tip: Higher Residual = Lower Monthly Lease Payments\nExample: A $30,000 MSRP vehicle leased for 36 months with a residual value of $14,000, means you pay only $16,000 over three years. If the residual is $20,000, you pay only $10,000 over three years. You have lower monthly lease payments.*\n* Offers, incentives, interest rates and taxes not factored into example.\nSo, now the question is which is better, leasing or financing? Well, that depends on what is important to you. Besides financial considerations, we all have different lifestyles and priorities to consider. We hope our ultimate side-by-side checklist helps your decision.\nTo summarize, leasing does not typically build equity with its lower monthly payments, while financing does. The reason equity is built for financing is because a portion of the higher monthly payments builds equity. The cost of financing one vehicle and driving it for ten or more years is definitely less expensive than leasing several vehicles over the same period. However, when your primary consideration isn’t financial, then other variables like the ones in our checklist will play a significant role in your decision-making process.\nGood luck and happy decision-making.","ACCC provides consumers with the facts to help make the car buying process simpler\nBoston, MA – June 11, 2018\nBuying a car can be an agonizing process between researching prices and dealerships, test driving, and paperwork. How do consumers decide if owning or leasing is best? National nonprofit American Consumer Credit Counseling (ACCC) provides consumers with the facts to help make the car buying process simpler.\n“Deciding whether to own or lease a car can be a hard decision, especially because both options come with a specific set of pros and cons,” said Steve Trumble, President, and CEO of American Consumer Credit Counseling. “In the end, it is a personal decision that consumers must make based on their budget and driving needs.”\nThere are pros and cons to each. When you buy a car, you have higher monthly costs, but you end up owning it in the end. A lease has lower monthly costs, but you may never stop paying for a vehicle. According to Carfax, a car will lose 10 percent of its value as soon as you leave with it and up to 20 percent after the first year.\nACCC provides consumers with a helpful video and a list of facts about owning vs. leasing a car.\nOWNING A CAR:\n- You own the car and get to keep it as long as you want.\n- The up-front costs include the cash price or a down payment, taxes, registration, and other fees.\n- Monthly loan payments are usually higher because you’re paying off the entire price of the vehicle.\n- You can sell or trade in your vehicle at any time. Money from the sale can be used to pay off any loan balance.\n- At the end of the loan term, you may have equity to help pay for your next car.\nLEASING A CAR:\n- You must return the vehicle at the end of the lease unless you decide to buy it.\n- Up-front costs can include the first month’s payment, a security deposit, an acquisition fee, a down payment, and other fees, including potential gap insurance.\n- Monthly payments are less because you’re only paying for the vehicle’s depreciation during the lease term.\n- Most leases will include limits on the number of miles you can drive. You’ll have to pay extra fees for exceeding your limits – often a specific charge per mile. For individuals who drive a lot, that can be extremely costly.\n- Most leases will hold you responsible for exceeding normal wear and tear.\nWhile there are many facets to car buying, take it one step at a time. Researching inventory before heading to a dealership can save time. It can help you narrow down vehicle choices by price, condition, make, model, and more. It can also help you learn about potential deals and discounts around holidays or end-of-month sales. Buying close to home also has the added benefit of being able to take the car in for repairs under warranty.\nACCC is a 501(c)3 organization that provides free credit counseling, bankruptcy counseling, and housing counseling to consumers nationwide in need of financial literacy education and money management.

{"question":"What are the key structural differences between toe phalanges and finger phalanges in the human body?","answer":"Both fingers and toes have phalanges, but with some distinct differences in their structure. The toes have three phalanx bones (proximal, middle, and distal), except for the big toe which only has two phalanges (proximal and distal). Similarly, in the fingers, there are 14 phalanges total, with the thumb having 2 phalanges while other fingers have 3 phalanges each. The toe phalanges connect to metatarsals in the midfoot, while finger phalanges connect to metacarpals in the palm region. The toe phalanges are specifically designed to provide posture, balance, and support body weight during walking.","context":["The toes consist of multiple osseous and soft tissues including tendons, nerves, and ligaments, that support our body weight. Each toe has several small bones called phalanges that connect to metatarsals, the longer bones in our midfoot. Each toe is made up of three phalanx bones, which are the proximal, middle and distal, except for the big toe which only has two phalanges, the proximal and distal. The primary function of your toes is to provide posture and balance, support the body weight, and propulsion during the gait cycle. Not only do your toes help thrust your body forward when you walk, they actually help increase the length of your stride allowing you to run faster.\nToe pain is any uncomfortable sensation in the toes. You may feel irritated or debilitating when you attempt to put any pressure on your foot or toe due to this condition. Toe pain can come on suddenly and severely, or it may develop gradually over time. However, there are a lot of reasons you may have an aching toe.\nThere’s always the chance you stubbed it or banged it while playing certain sports activities. But there are also problems like hammertoe or arthritis that could be the result of the pain. If one or more of your toes are crooked or curled under, you may have a hammer, mallet, or claw toe.\nYour foot has a unique shape because the muscles, tendons, or ligaments that surround your toe aren’t balanced. This causes the toes to bend in an odd position. Your toe may generally hurt. It’s also common to develop a corn or callus because the joint rubs the inside of your shoe. Each of the toe conditions mentioned earlier has its own distinctive appearance, such as described below:\n- Hammertoe – The middle joint of your toe bends downwards. This causes your toe to rise up instead of lying flat. This condition typically occurs in your second, third, and fourth toes.\n- Mallet toe – Your toe bends down at the joint closest to the nail. Like hammertoe, it often happens in your second, third, and fourth toes.\n- Claw toe – In cases of a claw toe, your toes form a claw shape. The joint at the base of the toe bends up, while the two other joints bend down. This causes your toe to curl and dig into the soles of your shoes.\n- Turf toe – Turf toe is a sprain to the joint at the bottom of your big toe. This injury causes pain and swelling while decreasing your ability to move your big toe. Walking or other weight-bearing activities can make it ache more.\nCauses & Symptoms of Toe Pain\nToe pain can be caused by a wide variety of ways depending on which toe has been injured at the moment. Some potential causes of toe pain when walking are the result of broken, sprained, or dislocated toes, as well as corns and calluses. Arthritis can also be present when walking over time, which can make toe joints sore, swollen, and stiff. Certain toe conditions primarily affect the big toe. Some common causes of big toe joint pain include:\n- Bunions – which are bony growths on the outside of your big toe joint.\n- Hallux rigidus – which is a type of arthritis at the base of your big toe.\n- Turf toe – An injury that can occur with the overextension of the big toe joint.\nIn addition, some painful conditions occur more often in your middle toes than in your big toe or pinky toe. These conditions include:\n- Capsulitis – which refers to inflammation of the connective tissues where the toe joint meets the ball of the foot.\n- Morton’s toe – The extension of the second toe past the big toe, which can lead to painful pressure and calluses.\n- Plantar plate tear – This is the rupture of the thick, fibrous tissue that extends across the ball of the foot, frequently involving the second toe.\nRight or left toe pain does not manifest in the same way for all patients. Variations result from what the cause of the toe pain is, which toe hurts, and at what times and during which activities the pain arises. Therefore, below are common symptoms linked to toe pain:\n- Abnormal bending\n- Tingling feeling that can become painful\n- Limited range in motion of the affected toe\n- Stiffness and pain when moving the injured toe\n- Painful swelling\nWho gets Toe Pain?\nRisk factors associated with toe pain can lead to most conditions in strange ways, such as:\n- Genetics – The shape of your foot and your gait can play a role in whether you develop toe pain and other foot conditions. This may be determined by your genetics.\n- Stress – If you spend a lot of time on your feet at work or while playing sports, you might put too much strain and pressure on your toes and other areas of the foot. Without proper rest and stretching of the foot, this can result in toe pain and injury.\n- Diabetes – Diabetes can lead to blisters and sores on the toes and other areas of the foot. If left untreated for too long, these blisters and sores may turn into ulcers.\n- Shoes – High heels and tight shoes crowd the toes together and cause the muscles to tighten and shorten. In time, straightening the toes becomes impossible. Tight shoes can also cause ingrown nails and shoes that are too loose can provoke improper gait leading to a foot injury.\nHow Does Toe Pain Affect You? How Serious is it?\nDifferent toe pain will have its own causes and risk factors; toe pain due to chronic or progressive conditions is likely to worsen if left untreated. If this occurs, chronic conditions can cause permanent damage or other complications. Therefore, it is important to seek immediate medical attention when you experience any of the complications mentioned below:\nThe toe bones are as fragile as they are strong. You might not immediately notice a fracture or breakage of the toe, so it is important to seek medical treatment after a harsh impact to the toe where pain does not dissipate.\nA common cause of nerve damage is Morton’s neuroma. In these cases, your toes could feel numb, or you might experience a tingling sensation. Burning pain or a feeling as if you are standing barefoot on pebbles is associated with nerve damage.\nArthritis can lead to complications with joints all around the body. Toe joints are easily susceptible to arthritis as your toes are used for everyday weight-bearing activities. One specific complication it can cause is hallux rigidus.\nBreaking of the toe, bunions, and other similar injuries to the toe can cause an irregular shape of your affected toe. The irregular shape can lead to discomfort while wearing shoes or pain when walking.\nRecommended Treatment & Rehabilitation for Toe Pain\nIn order to accurately diagnose the underlying cause of toe pain, your doctor will begin by examining your toe and foot and ask you several questions related to your symptoms. He or she may also order an X-ray to determine if structural damage could be the source of the pain. If a broken toe is suspected, your doctor will most likely use multiple X-rays to get a clearer view of your foot taken from various angles.\nIf your toe has truly been broken, then surgery may be required. The most common type of surgery for broken toes is open reduction and internal fixation. To begin with the procedure, your surgeon will administer regional anesthesia. In some cases, sedation may also be provided.\nAfterward, a small incision is created down the length of your toe to access the fractured areas. Your surgeon will then place the bone fragments in their correct positions, then secures them into place using surgical screws, plates, or rods. Lastly, the incisions are closed with surgical staples or sutures. The area is then covered with a surgical dressing and protected with a cast or a splint. Normally, the length of surgery depends on the extent of the damage. But in most cases, toe surgery can be completed in approximately two hours.\nImmediately after a toe pain injury, the following treatment plans may help alleviate the pain and prevent further injury. A physiotherapist will be able to perform this treatment method known as the PEACE principle, such as described below:\n- Protect – Your physiotherapist will limit movement and use pain as a guide to avoid causing discomfort.\n- Elevate – He or she will put your feet up at about heart level to increase blood circulation.\n- Avoid anti-inflammatory medications – Inflammation is the first stage of the body’s natural recovery process. You do not want to disrupt your recovery if you take anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n- Compress – Putting pressure on the toe / foot (such as when using a compression sock) may help limit swelling. Too much compression can restrict needed blood flow. Your physiotherapist will choose the perfect amount of compression to help treat your toe injury.\n- Education – Your physiotherapist will educate you about the injury and instruct you on an active approach to recovery and your options for treatment. He or she will also determine when it is safe for you to return to your regular activities.\nAfter the treatments mentioned above have been achieved, your physiotherapist will work with you to design a proper treatment program specific to your goals to finish recovering from your toe pain. Some of these treatment plans may include:\nIt is important to regain the full range of motion of your big toe and foot. If your injury required the use of a brace or boot to restrict movement during healing, your toe and foot joints may be stiff. Your physiotherapist will then teach you gentle stretching and movement exercises to help restore normal movement.\nIt is common to lose strength in the muscles of your foot, ankle, and leg after a toe injury. This is due to the change in activity and any bracing or boot used to restrict movement during healing. Your physiotherapist will determine which muscles are weak and teach you specific exercises to strengthen them.\nManual therapy can be especially effective to restore movement in joints that become stiff after being immobilized. Your physiotherapist may gently move the joints involving your injury for you. This might feel like your foot is being gently wiggled.\nBelow are a few exercise examples for you to try at home:\nSit on the floor, with the heel of your affected foot on the floor. Next, gently curl your toes forward and then backward. Hold each position for about 6 seconds. Repeat 8-12 times a day.\nSit in a chair and place your affected foot on a towel on the floor. Then, scrunch the towel toward you with your toes then use your toes to push the towel back into place. Repeat 8-12 times a day.\nPut some marbles on the floor to lift up one marble from the floor at a time. Then try to put the marble in the cup. Repeat this method 8-12 times a day.\nSit with your legs extended and knees straight. Next, place a towel or belt around your foot just under your toes. Hold both ends of the towel or belt, with your hands above your knees. Pull back with the towel or belt so that your foot stretches toward you. Hold the position for at least 15-30 seconds, then repeat 2-4 times a day.\nAlternative & Homeopathic Treatment for Toe Pain\nThere are many different ways to ease your toe pain homeopathically. Some of these alternative treatments include:\n- Ice application – An ice pack can help relieve toe pain. This option could be particularly useful for patients with foot pain in the joints of their feet due to trauma, infection, inflammation, or arthritis.\n- RICE method – RICE stands for rest, ice, compression, and elevation. Many athletes tend to follow this method in order to rule out further symptoms linked to injured toe.\n- Foot shower – Patients can bathe sore, painful, or tired feet in a bowl of warm water. Some individuals find that adding Epsom salts to the water can help ease the soreness much further.\n- Fish oil – Omega-3 oils are perfect for supporting nerve health and preventing foot pain.\n- Massages – Having a foot massage by a massage therapist can help seek out tender spots in your affected toe and other areas in your feet and press on them while gently stretching.","Home > Quiz Games > Biology > Print Preview\nBiology : Skeletal System & Bones of Human Body II\nHide all answers\nView all answers\nTry the Quiz\nGiven the SKELETAL POSITION, identify the BONE NAME\n1.

{"question":"How do CCPM (Critical Chain Project Management) and Scrum differ in their resource management approach?","answer":"CCPM and Scrum have contrasting approaches to resource management. CCPM focuses primarily on resources like teams, equipment, and office space, with less emphasis on task order or scheduling, aiming to keep resources flexible and balanced. It's credited with making projects 10-50% faster or cheaper. Scrum, on the other hand, has a more structured approach with specific team roles, including a Scrum master, and is designed for small teams of no more than 10 people. It manages resources through a task board system where work items move through different stages, from initial story to completion, with daily scrum meetings to coordinate team efforts.","context":["How To Use Scrum Task Board\nScrum task board is a work organization means that is usually used by the Scrum teams. Every Scrum team has its own Scrum task board. To realize what a Scrum task board is and what it is for, we should come up with a Scrum task definition.\nWhat is a Scrum task?\nScrum tasks are actually processes that are to be made by the Scrum team during a certain sprint. They are formulated in the sprint backlog, and the sprint backlog itself is formed by the items of the product backlog. Hence, a Scrum task is the smallest unit of the Scrum project management process.\nA Scrum task board is designed to put the scrum tasks in order and to visualize the process of their performance. There are several different ways to organize your Scrum task board. Usually it is just an ordinary board on a wall that is subdivided into several columns and rows. Some companies also use special software to view their Scrum task boards on computers. The others place their Scrum task boards online. However, there is no difference between Scrum task boards that are placed on walls or on websites. All of them have the same principle of work. At first the task is placed in the left column which is usually labeled “Story”. After that it goes to the right and passes all the columns of the Scrum task board. This illustrates the process of task performance. Finally, the Scrum task is placed in the “Done” column. It means that the work on this element is finished.\nA Scrum task board usually has such columns:\nThis column contains descriptions of the user’s or the customer’s wishes. At the moment when Scrum tasks are in this column they are not exactly formulated yet. This row consists only of general descriptions and user wishes. To formulate a Scrum task the developer needs to analyze them and make a plan of their performance.\nAfter a Scrum task is formulated, it is placed in this column. On this stage of work the task already has a certain goal and the developers know its precise place in the final product. This column is full of tasks that are to be done during the sprint period.\nWork in process\nThis column is formulated by the tasks that are in the process of performing at the moment. After the task is formulated and a certain developer (or several developers) begins to work on it, it goes to this row. The task will stay here until it is finished. After that it will move to the next column.\nThis row contains the tasks that should be tested. The Scrum process involves product testing after each sprint. There are many types of tests. Some of them involve final users in the process of software development. The others are performed by the Scrum team members. However, the task remains in the column “To verify” until it is successfully tested. After that it will go to the final column.\nThis is the final column of the Scrum task board. When the Scrum tasks are finished, they are placed here. After all the tasks pass all columns of the Scrum task board and are placed in the row “Done”, the sprint may be considered finished. After that the team will contact the customer and show him the intermediate product which will be the result of the sprint.\nSometimes a Scrum task board may have additional columns. Usually they are labeled “Notes” and “Test specified”. The “Notes” column is designed for remarks of the team members on any topics that are relied to the project. The row “Test specified” is a place where the developers can write down the types of tests that they are planning to use for certain tasks.\nScrum task board is the simplest and probably the best way to visualize the progress of your work. It is irreplaceable for teams that use Scrum methodology to run their projects.","There’s method in his madness, goes the oft-quoted Shakespeare line. There’s a reason it’s used so often. It’s true. Not just in the case of “Hamlet,” of course, but in explaining any purpose or reasoning behind an action.\nThe motivation behind the process of managing a project can seem inexplicable to some, especially if they’re not aware of the many methodologies that have been developed to organize complex plans. But there is a rule that governs all successful projects. However, that process isn’t the same for every project.\nProject management methodology is just a fancy way of describing a system used to do something. Before you begin any project, you need the right project management tools, a good team, and you must know how you’re going to run the project. Some projects lend themselves to certain methodologies. Sometimes it’s at the preference of the project manager.\nTo choose the right methodology for you and your project (or even decide on a hybrid methodology), you should know what they are. There are many, so let’s get started on a summary of the most widely used.\nWhat It Is: This is the granddaddy of methodologies, if it’s a methodology at all. The Project Management Institute (PMI) is a not-for-profit membership association, project management certification and standards organization. They publish guidelines, rules and characteristics for project, program and portfolio management.\nFor off, PMBOK® is an acronym for Project Management Body of Knowledge. It’s a book, published by PMI, that collects the processes, best practices, terminologies and guidelines that are the accepted norm in the industry. It was first published in 1996 and is about to publish its sixth edition in the fall of 2017.\nThe text breaks down a project into five process groups: initiating, planning, executing, controlling and closing. So, is it a methodology or an agreed upon structure for projects? That’s the debate. What’s clear, though, is that by creating these phases of a project, one can begin to manage the unruly thing into a clear and effective pathway to success.\nWhen To Use It: Almost any project can benefit from PMBOK, as all projects big and small are going to go through the various stages outlined in the book. It’s a great way to keep everyone on the same page, so to speak, and offers a clear definition of how a project is managed.\nAnother use is that is creates a standardized method to keep working methods consistent across different companies. It is also the basis for PMP certification, which is the gold-standard among project managers, and recognized all over the world. PMBOK is a great traditional framework to run a project.\nWhat It Is: This may be the most straightforward and linear of all the approaches to managing a project. The name is apt, as the waterfall methodology is a process in which the phases of the project flow downward. The model requires that you move from one phase to another only once that phase has been successfully completed.\nThe method originates from a symposium on advanced programming held in 1956. It wasn’t until 1970, though, that the first formal description of the waterfall model was published by Winston W. Royce, though the term waterfall wasn’t used. That word to describe this method was first used in a paper by Bell and Thayer, published in 1976.\nThe model is in six parts, beginning with capturing requirements in a document, creating models to analyze them, designing, coding, testing and installing and maintenance of that system.\nWhen to Use It: Waterfall is great for manufacturing and construction projects, which are highly structured and when it’s too expensive to pivot or change anything after the fact. Waterfall often makes use of a Gantt chart for planning and scheduling; an example is below.\nCritical Path Method (CPM)\nWhat It Is: In CPM, you build a model of the project, including all the activities listed in a work breakdown structure, the duration of those tasks, what if any task dependencies there are and marking off milestones to indicated larger phases of the project or points in which your deliverables are due. With this information, you determine what is the path to finish the project with the least slack. Basically, you’re figuring out how long the tasks that make up the project will take.\nThe critical path method was developed in the late 1950s by Morgan R. Walker of DuPont and James E. Kelley, Jr., of Remington Rand. DuPont was already using a precursor of CPM as early the the 1940s, and it was applied to the Manhattan Project.\nThe technique starts with a list of all activities, or a work breakdown structure, the duration of each task, what dependencies there are and then mapping milestones and deliverables.\nWhen to Use It: CPM works better with smaller or mid-sized projects. The larger the project, the more difficult it can be to take all the data you need to diagram and make sense of it without software.\nCritical Chain Project Management (CCPM)\nWhat It Is: In CCPM, you’re focusing on resources that you’ll be using to complete the project, such as teams, equipment, office space, etc. It’s a less technical method of project management that doesn’t put as much emphasis on task order or scheduling, but rather on balancing resources and keeping them flexible.\nFirst introduced in 1997, in the book “Critical Path” by Eliyahu M. Goldratt, it has been credited with making projects anywhere from 10-50% faster and/or cheaper.\nWhen to Use It: Can be applied to both large and small companies, and for projects that include industries such as construction, software development and tech research and development.\nWhat It Is: Controversial is what it is. There’s a passionate argument as to whether agile should even be considered a methodology, but as it’s used to run projects we’ll include it here. In a nutshell, it’s an evolving and collaborative way to self-organize across teams. The work is adaptive in planning, evolutionary in development, seeking early delivery and is always open to change if that leads to improvement. It’s fast and flexible.\nThe use of an iterative and incremental software development method dates back to the 1950s, and adaptive software development came about in the early 1970s. But what we think of as agile really appeared in 2001 with the publication of the “Manifesto for Agile Software Development,” authored by 17 software developers.\nThe core values of agile can be summed up as follows: individuals over processes, working software over detailed documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation and responding to change over rigid planning. Read about the 12 principles of agile for more information.\nWhen to Use It: The practice originated in software development and works well in that culture. How do you know if agile is for you? It has been applied to non-software products that seek to drive forward with innovation and have a level of uncertainty, such as computers, motor vehicles, medical devices, food, clothing, music and more; and it’s also being used in other types of projects that need a more responsive and fast-paced production schedule, such as marketing.\nWhat It Is: Scrum is a short “sprint” approach to managing project. It’s ideal for teams of no more than 10 people, and often is wedded to two-week cycles with short daily meetings, known as daily scrum meetings. It’s led by what is called a Scrum master. It’s works within an agile framework, though there have been attempts to scale Scrum to fit larger organizations.\nThe term scrum was introduced in a “Harvard Business Review” article from 1986 by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka. It became a part of agile when Ken Schwaber and Mike Beedle wrote the book “Agile Software Development with Scrum” in 2001. Schwaber formed the Scrum Alliance in 2002, a certified scrum accreditation series. Schwaber left the Scrum Alliance in 2009 to start a parallel accreditation organization called Scrum.org.\nWhen to Use It: Like agile, scrum has been used predominantly in software development, but proponents note it is applicable across any industry or business, including retail logistics, event planning or any project that requires some flexibility. It does require strict scrum roles however.\nWhat It Is: Kanban is visual approach to project management. The name is literally billboard in Japanese. It helps manage workflow by placing tasks on a Kanban board where workflow and progress is clear to all participants. Kanban helps improve inefficiencies, and has been used to schedule lean manufacturing in Agile projects.\nKanban has been around since the late 1940s, when it was studied by Toyota to use the rate of demand to control the rate of production of its vehicles. The car company applied it to their main plant machine shop in 1953.\nWith the dawn of visual planning boards in software in our era, like Trello, there are now new uses for Kanban tools and Kanban methods. Agile teams use Kanban boards for story-boarding user stories and for backlog planning in software development.\nRelated: Kanban vs. Scrum: Which is Better?\nWhen to Use It: Another process developed initially for manufacturing and for software teams, the Kanban method has since expanded and has been used in human resources, marketing, organizational strategy, executive process and accounts receivable and payable. Almost anyone can plan with Kanban boards, adding cards to represent project phases, task deadlines, people, ideas and more. Kanban software makes this methodology especially accessible.\nExtreme Programming (XP)\nWhat It Is: It sounds like some dangerous sport the kids are into, but in fact XP is a type of agile software development with short development cycles and multiple releases to improve productivity. Customer requirements are sought and can adapt the course of the project.\nCreated by Kent Beck while working on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System payroll project, he literally wrote the book (“Extreme Programming Explained”) in 1999. But many of its practices have been around for awhile.\nWhen to Use It: When requirements change frequently, then you’ll want to use a methodology such as XP. It’s good for when your customer doesn’t have a clear idea of what they want.\nAdaptive Project Framework (APF)\nWhat It Is: Rejecting the more structured project management methodologies as not adaptable to evolving projects with uncertain requirements, APF is open to change. In fact, it thrives on change, learning by iterative delivery and driven by a deep client involvement. What APF does is take agile and try to make it more pragmatic.\nThis methodology has a long history, dating back to ancient civilizations, though as a management concept, it was brought to attention by Frederick Taylor in the early 1900s. It has been adopted over the last few decades for use in environmental practices.\nWhen to Use It: APF was developed for IT and works best in those flexible environments.\nEvent Chain Methodology (ECM)\nWhat It Is: ECM emphasizes identifying and managing events that impact the project schedule. It’s related to the critical path method and critical chain project management, and helps with more accurate estimating and scheduling plans.\nECM is based on six principles: moment of risk and state of activity, event chains, Monte Carlo simulations, critical event chains, performance tracking with event chains and event chain diagrams. The methodology simplifies risks associated with project schedules, and is closely related to Gantt charts, so can be used as a support with other techniques of project management.\nWhen to Use It: It’s ideal for projects with great uncertainty throughout the life cycle, which means that it can be applied to almost any project.\nExtreme Project Management (XPM)\nWhat It Is: XPM is another response to the rigidity of traditional project management. It’s of short duration and open to flexibility, so plans, budget and more can change throughout the project to fit changing needs.\nXPM helps manage the unknown factors in your project, installs confidence in your stakeholders and is an holistic approach to project management, based on facts and using experts to get the job done.\nWhen to Use It: Because of its emphasis on short duration, XPM is best for projects that are only weeks or even days long.\nWhat It Is: Lean is what you’d think from its name: a way to cut waste and in so doing increase value. So, lean focuses on key processes to continuously be impacting positively on value. It does this by optimizing separate technologies, assets and verticals.\nRelated: What is Lean Manufacturing?\nLean as a method of project management goes back to Henry Ford and his flow production for automating the process of building cars. Toyota picked up on the idea, as well, extending their idea beyond manufacturing to the process of the product. Today, software development teams run lean processes to focus on end user feedback and increased value, which means Lean methodology has taken on a new meaning, particularly with the publishing of Lean Startup, by Eric Ries, who advocates for rapid prototyping, end user feedback and early and rapid product delivery.\nThere are five main principles to lean: specify value by the customer, identify value stream, make product flow continuously, introduce pull through each step and manage towards removing unnecessary steps.\nWhen to Use It: Lean was first developed by Toyota and is obviously a great methodology for manufacturing, but it has been adopted by construction and education industries, among others in the manufacturing space and countless startups and software development firms looking to drive products focused on the end user.\nWhat It Is: Introduced by engineers working at Motorola in the mid-1980s, Six Sigma works to improve quality by identifying what is not working in the project. It applies quality management, including empirical statistics, and employs personnel who are experts in these disciplines. There is also a Lean Six Sigma that adds lean methodology to eliminate waste.\nAs a doctrine, it says that continues efforts to achieve results that are stable and expected are most important to success. Processes can be defined and improved. It takes the whole organization, from the top down, to sustain quality in a project.\nWhen to Use It: This methodology works best in larger organizations. Even companies with a few hundred employees are likely too small to take advantage of its benefits. It requires a certification to practice. Learn about six sigma certification here.\nWhat It Is: PRINCE2 stands for Projects IN Controlled Environments, and is a structured certified methodology. It was initially created by the UK government for IT projects. PRINCE2 is not like other traditional methods like waterfall, in that it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution, but follows seven principles, themes and procedures.\nWhen the UK government adopted standards for IT systems in 1989, they called in PRINCE. PRINCE2 came about in 1996 as a more general project management method. It is now a popular project management methodology throughout all UK governmental agencies and the United Nations.\nWhen to Use It: Adopted by many other country’s governments, PRINCE2, so, as you can imagine, it’s not always suitable for smaller projects.\nThere are more project management methodologies, but these are some of the most popular. Regardless of which you use, you need a project management tool to best manage all your processes and projects.

{"question":"How do the archaeological discoveries at West Runton and Sungir compare in terms of mammoth-related findings and their historical significance?","answer":"Both sites have significant mammoth-related findings but differ in their nature and use. West Runton is famous for discovering one of the oldest and best preserved fossil elephants (Mammuthus trogontherii) in the UK in 1990. At Sungir, dated to around 28,000 years ago, mammoth remains were used for artistic and burial purposes - notably a carved ivory pendant in the shape of a mammoth, a mammoth sculpture, and a massive 2.4-meter lance made from a straightened mammoth tusk weighing more than 20kg. The Sungir site also features thousands of ivory beads made from mammoth tusks, decorating burial clothing, while West Runton's mammoth remains are primarily paleontological specimens found in the Freshwater Bed.","context":["This is the location of the famous ‘West Runton Elephant’ find. From the West Runton Fresh Water Bed, mammal and fish remains are common, along with freshwater shells. On the foreshore, during scouring tides, the chalk yields echinoids and sponges.\n♦ West Runton is located to the west of Cromer on the northern Norfolk coast and is a small village. Driving through the village, you will pass some caravan sites and then a road sign leading to the beach. There is a small corner shop near the entrance to the road. Follow the road all the way down and, on the left, you will come to a car park.\n♦ In summer, parking fees apply at a toll gate, but, during the off peak season, tickets are issued from the cafe. Toilets and the cafe are also next to the beach. Once on the beach, you need to walk east and it isn’t very far until you get to the beds (providing they are exposed).\n♦ The best chalk section, including the Micraster Bed, is just west of the road on the shore. During scouring tides, the entire foreshore is exposed with chalk.\n♦ Ref: 52.94173°N, 1.25137°E\nFIND FREQUENCY: ♦♦♦♦♦ – West Runton is a very productive site. However, you do need the right conditions – either scouring to expose the chalk on the foreshore and Weybourne Crag or a high tide to wash out the Cromer Forest Bed. In fact, the best beds at West Runton are in the lowest part of the Cromer Forest Bed, which are exposed during scouring tides.\nCHILDREN: ♦♦♦♦♦ – West Runton is ideal for children. Indeed, local schools often take their students to this location to study the geology of the area. They can collect fossils on the foreshore and, when they get bored, they can play in the sand. Toilets and a cafe are provided at the car park near the beach.\nACCESS: ♦♦♦♦ – There is easy parking nearby at West Runton, with good access to the beach.\nTYPE: – Fossils at West Runton can be found within the cliff (in the Cromer Forest bed) or on the foreshore (in the chalk).\nThe Forest Bed is rich in fossils. There is a large number of different freshwater shells to be collected, together with fossil seeds, and fish, birds, frogs and mammal remains. The mammal remains from this bed can be anything from beavers to vole and even elephants, deer and hippopotamus. So many different mammals have been recorded from this bed that you never know what you may find. On the foreshore, the chalk yields superb corals, sponges and echinoids. Bivalves can also be found. Between the Fresh Water Forest Bed and the chalk, the Wroxham Crag also yields mammal and fish remains, and anything from deer to mammoth and whale remains have been found.\nThe best time to collect fossils at West Runton is after high tides, heavy rainfall and scouring conditions. Fossils are exposed on the Forest Bed surface, which can easily be seen and collected from. After a very high tide and during scouring conditions, mammal remains are often found. However, even if the conditions are not favourable, with a small knife or pick, you can very gently break apart the loose material at the base of the cliff section to make finds. On the foreshore, fossils from the chalk and Wroxham Crag can be found. Search carefully around the chalk exposures and in the areas of heavy-iron coloured cemented pebbles (that is, the Wroxham Crag).\nWest Runton beach is most famous for the elephant or steppe mammoth, Mammuthus trogontherii, which was discovered in 1990 and is one of the oldest and best preserved fossil elephants ever found in the UK. Deposits of bone and teeth can still be collected from this bed, but, being a SSSI, it should not be dug into and it is better to collect from the beach, unless something is obviously exposed at the surface.\nThe world-famous Upper Freshwater Bed is well exposed at the base of the cliff. These and the underlying sands, gravels and estuarine silts (Pastonian Stage) comprise the Cromer Forest-bed Formation, which can be exposed in the cliffs during scouring tides and rough weather.\nThe geology of the section between West and East Runton is complex. The beach itself is composed of flint, which sits on top of a Cretaceous Chalk wave-cut platform, with various erratics, which were deposited by Ice Age glaciers.\nDirectly on top of the Chalk is the Cromer Stone Bed, followed by the Wroxham Crag. Old literature may refer to the Wroxham Crag as Weybourne Crag. The Wroxham Crag consists of sands, gravels, silts and clays, all of which represent a period of time from the pre-Pastonian cold stage, the Pastonian warm stage and into the Beestonian cold stage.\nThe Cromer Stone Bed and Wroxham Crag are often cemented together by calcrete and iron pan and are exposed during heavy tidal scouring conditions. The shelly sands, grey silts and conglomerates have produced a rich fauna, including voles, shrews, giant beaver, deer, elephant and it is significantly older than the West Runton Freshwater Bed.\nOverlying the Wroxham Crag is the West Runton Freshwater Bed; a prominent dark ‘peaty’ bed at the base of the cliff and up to 2 m thick. It is highly fossiliferous and contains the remains of plants and trees (seeds, cones, fungi and pollen), terrestrial and aquatic molluscs, fish (scales, teeth and bones), amphibians, large and small mammals (teeth and bones) and bird bones.\nCommon sense when collecting at all locations should be used and knowledge of tide times is essential. The main issue at West Runton to consider is the tide if visiting the chalk past the headland. This is the main place where you can be cut off by the tide.\nThe West Runton Freshwater-bed is protected by SSSI rules, so digging and removing samples is not permitted, but the use of small tools, such as a knife or small pick to remove any fossils is. Collecting from the foreshore chalk is less restricted, but a knife or pick is still the best tool for removing fossils. Remember to bring specimen boxes to ensure your fragile specimens make it safely back home.\nThis site is a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). This means you can visit the site, but hammering the bedrock is not permitted.

According to the map in her book, the actual Sungir site was under hundreds or thousands of metres of snow and ice. You can see my estimate of where she put the Sungir (Sungaea) site at the Ukraine Map:\nGo to the map of The Mammoth Hunters, in Ukraine\nThis includes Ayla's journeys in Clan of the Cave Bear, Valley of Horses, Mammoth Hunters, and the first part of the journey in Plains of Passage\nWhen reading the following notes about the burials at Sungir, it should be realised also that most researchers estimate that each ivory bead took an hour to make.\nThe site of Sungir (Bader 1978; USSR Academy of Sciences 1984), discovered during clay extraction operations in 1956, was excavated by Otto Bader from 1956 to 1977. Excavations were re-opened by Bader's assistant Ludmilla Mikhailova and Bader's son Nicolai in 1986, and continue today. Sungir is an enormous early Upper Paleolithic living site located on the outskirts of the city of Vladimir, about 150 km east of Moscow in the Russian Republic.\nThe supposed small boy was covered with strands of beads--4,903 of them--that were roughly 2/3 the size of the man's beads although of exactly the same form. He also had a beaded cap with some fox teeth. Unlike the man however, he had around his waist--apparently the remains of a decorated belt--more than 250 canine teeth of the polar fox. On his chest was a carved ivory pendant (Figure 16) in the form of an animal. At his throat was an ivory pin, apparently the closure of a cloak of some sort. Under his left shoulder was a large ivory sculpture of a mammoth.\nAt his left side lay a medial segment of a highly polished, very robust human femur, the medullary cavity of which was packed full of red ocher. At his right side, and continuing partially alongside the girl was a massive ivory lance, made from a straightened woolly mammoth tusk. It is 2 meters, 40 cm in length, and weighs more than 20 kg. (Given the weight of these objects, I doubt very much if they were functional lances). Near it is a carved ivory disk (Figure 17d) with a central perforation, which sits upright in the soil. As we shall see in the case of the supposed girl's burial, this had apparently been mounted over the tip of a no longer preserved (wooden?) \"lance,\" up to a point a few centimeters from the tip.\nAbout 28,000 years ago, the residents of the Russian site of Sungir produced thousands of personal ornaments and a number of ivory carvings in geometric and animal forms. Sungir is one of the oldest known cases in which ornaments are actually found on human skeletons. While inhabiting Sungir, at least nine of the site's occupants perished. According to Russian physical anthropologists the best preserved of these consisted of a 60 year-old man, a 7 to 9 year-old girl, a 13 year-old boy, an unsexed (male?), headless adult and an adult female skull. From my reading of the evidence, the adult burial is clearly an older male. The sex of the adolescents remains ambiguous.\nIn total, the three most intact burials were lavishly decorated with more than 13,000 painstakingly prepared ivory beads arranged in dozens of strands, perhaps basted to their clothing. Although it is almost certain that the three individuals buried intact at Sungir were members of the same social group, there are remarkable differences among them in details of body decoration and grave offerings. For example, the man's forearms and biceps were each decorated with a series of polished mammoth-ivory bracelets (25 in all), some showing traces of black paint. Around his neck, he wore a small, flat schist pendant painted red, but with a small black dot on one side.\nThe technology of the dominant form of bead production at Sungir was clearly a variation on the Aurignacian assembly-line approach to ivory bead manufacture discussed earlier. However, at Sungir the blanks were scored across the width of each face before the hole was drilled. This caused the beads to fall into a visually impressive interlocking pattern when strung. In other words, the desired esthetic effect was deeply embedded in even the earliest stages of production.\nExperiments reveal that each of the ivory beads at Sungir took more than an hour to fabricate. Hence, the man's beadwork took more than 3,000 hours, while that of each child took more than 5,000. Considering additional objects placed on and alongside the corpses, it is clear that each of the childrens' burials had substantially more labor invested in it than that of the man. Based on the differences in grave offerings and labor investment revealed among these burials, we might be justified in inferring that the social system represented at Sungir was an internally differentiated one in which social position was inherited rather than achieved; suggesting that complex social systems arose prior to and independent from economic systems based on agricultural production.\nBADER (O.). - Sungir Upper Paleolithic site. Moscow, NAUKA, 1978.\n- The boys of Sungir. The Illustrated London News. March 7, 1970, p.24-26.\nThe glacial period is the time of Homo sapiens origin. Now world science is acquainted with only a few dozen of the Upper Palaeolithic Period archaeological sites. Sungir, discovered by the famous Russian archaeologist O.N. Bader in 1956, is one of the most well known Upper Palaeolithic settlements in Eastern Europe. This site, situated to the north-east of Moscow near the town of Vladimir, is one of the northernmost late glacial settlements of Eastern Europe.\nSungir is one of the earliest human settlements at high latitude; radiocarbon data determined this site age to be approximately 30,000 BP. Some patterns of ground geomorphology and the cultural layers content give us information about a cold arid climate and steppe forest- steppe landscape. Judging by mammoth, deer, and horse bone finds, Sungir humans were hunters. They also hunted reindeer and polar fox.\nThis settlement has gained world popularity due to the opening of unique individual burials. In the graves are splendidly preserved assemblages of people, hunting weapons, including a spear from a straightened tusk of a mammoth (2.4m), animal figures and thousands of beads from mammoth tusks which decorated cloth. The bead position gives some clue about the garment's cut. These ancient people may have had some knowledge of counting and the lunar calendar.\nThe Institute of Archaeology, Russian Academy of Sciences conducted more than thirty years of field studies. The settlement has been excavated to a total area of 4500 square metres. The Sungir findings have become famous in different publications as one of the earliest examples of the custom of preparing rich, time consuming burials.\nHuman skeletal remains from Sungir are of unique importance. Without these materials it is difficult to understand the world of Palaeolithic humans in Europe. Complex palaeoanthropological and archaeological investigations can highlight some patterns of lifestyle as well as the type of physical activity, occupation, diet and health.\nAt the moment five skeletons are kept in the Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology, Moscow. Some aspects of anthropological investigations have already been made but a complete description of every individual has been absent until now.\nThis site dates to 28,000 years ago and is located in Russia. In addition to occupation evidence, the site contains several burials dug into the living surface of the site. All of the bodies were laid on their backs with their hands crossed over their pelvises.\nOne pit contained the skeleton of a 60-year-old man. He was buried with 2,936 ivory beads in strands all over his body, including what appears to be a bead cap on his head. The \"cap\" also contained 6 fox teeth. A series of bone bracelets was found on his arms. The bracelets were painted both red and black. Around his neck, he wore a small stone smeared with red ocher. (Ocher is a naturally occurring pigment that is often found in burials.)\nTwo other burials were found placed head to head in one trench. Researchers estimate these children were 13 and 8 years old. The 13-year-old was buried with 4,900 ivory beads, including a bead cap with fox teeth. This individual, which is often thought to be a boy, also wore a belt with 250 fox canine teeth. On the chest was an ivory pendant carved in the shape of a mammoth, and on its left shoulder was a sculpture of a mammoth. Next to the skeleton was a full-sized lance made from a mammoth tusk.\nThe 8-year-old, which is thought by many to be a girl, was buried with over 5,200 beads and a bead cap without any fox teeth. This burial also lacked any pendant or necklace. It does, however, have several miniature lances and a pierced object made from antler and decorated with drilled holes. This grave also contained four ivory disks that have a latticework pattern carved into them and a hole drilled into their centers.\nStraightening of mammoth tusks:\nIn my experience, there is no archaeological evidence before Sungir (dating to ca. 28-25,000 BP or earlier) for the preparation of whole tusks by softening (heating, boiling), which would have allowed the ivory to have been more easily worked. Even at Sungir however, the operational chain for bead production (White 1993) seems not to have employed thoroughly softened ivory. Simple soaking of tusks in water has only superficial effects. However, once the tusk is reduced to much thinner fragments, such soaking can penetrate the entire thickness, making drilling, scraping and gouging much easier. This soaking also works well on subfossil tusk fragments. Comparison of our experimental sample with actual Aurignacian production debris indicates clearly the use of water in the final stages of bead production."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9b0e9cd6-1e3e-4c36-ad9e-24c16e28e3ba>","<urn:uuid:b96f1019-5777-4ead-aac6-09e6aacfb744>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do chicken farming and electric cars compare in terms of environmental efficiency?","answer":"Chicken farming is highly efficient environmentally, with chickens being the most efficient converters of feed into meat among land-based livestock, resulting in low greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, electric cars show significant environmental benefits, reducing emissions by around 40% compared to average petrol cars and 25% compared to fuel-efficient diesel cars when using UK mains electricity. Both represent environmentally sustainable options in their respective sectors.","context":["With all agricultural industries across Australia looking at how they can operate more sustainably and considering whether, and when, a carbon neutral future may be possible, it is timely to reflect on what the chicken industry’s environmental impact is and celebrate its unique achievements.\nIt’s a fact that most commercial chicken meat production today is farmed intensively, but did you know that this helps to contribute to its very modest environmental impacts. In fact, chicken has the lowest environmental footprint of any meat.\nLet me explain why this is the case…\n- One of the biggest determinants of how much energy is used, and greenhouse gasses created, in the production of livestock products (like chicken and other meats and dairy products) is how efficiently the animals convert feed into edible product. This is because feed represents the biggest source of these impacts. The good news is that chickens are the most efficient converters of feed into meat of all land-based livestock species.\n- The way we rear most chickens today, where they are housed in large sheds or barns that have been designed so that they provide, as closely as is possible, their ideal climatic conditions, where food and water are laid on continuously and the birds are fed a diet which very precisely matches their ideal dietary nutrient profile for each stage of growth, all means that we can optimise the flocks’ growth and minimise the amount of feed the birds require to grow. In these farming systems we can also reduce the amount of energy that the chickens themselves need to put into maintaining their body temperature and in finding food and water.\n- All this translates to more efficient use of feed, energy and water to produce each kg of chicken meat – and less greenhouse gas emissions created.\n- The above also applies for free range production systems, where the chickens are also housed in large sheds, but also have access to an outdoor range area during daylight hours once they have reached an age where they are relatively safe from predation and can better cope with variable outside temperatures.\nAm I just making this up, or is there actual hard evidence of this? In fact, there is abundant evidence to support what I have said. Most of this has come from studies using Life Cycle Assessment methodologies.\nLife cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool which is being used worldwide to estimate the environmental impacts associated with producing a particular product from ‘cradle-to-grave’, taking into account all the environmental impacts involved in producing the product, including those generated in creating the inputs into a particular product, for example, the impacts associated with producing the grains that are fed to the chickens, or in generating the energy that might be used on farm or in the processing plant.\nResearch conducted on the environmental impacts of Australian chicken meat have confirmed that chicken meat production generates low levels of greenhouse gas emissions and results in modest levels of energy and water use. Click here to listen to Stephen Wiedemann, the Agricultural Scientist who worked on this research, talking about chicken meat production and its environmental impact. The report on this research, “Using Life Cycle Assessment to Quantify the Environmental Impact of Chicken Meat Production”, is available here. The results from the Australian LCA are broadly consistent with a significant body of overseas research that confirms that poultry production is the most environmentally sustainable (land-based) way to produce quality animal protein for human consumption.\nWhat about waste?\nIn terms of waste…there is virtually no wastage from chicken meat production!\nFor a start, as I’ve described above, chickens are amazingly efficient converters of feed into meat. On average, a meat chicken on a typical Australian commercial farm will consume about 1.6 kg of feed for every kg of body weight it puts on…and this ratio (kg of feed in : kg of body weight produced) is reducing all the time, due to superior bird genetics, better bird nutrition and improved bird health, husbandry practices and management. The more efficiently the chickens convert their feed (which is mostly grains) into meat, the less nutrients that get deposited in their manure. As I’ve said above, the way we grow chickens in Australia today maximises this efficiency.\nBut what of the nutrients that do end up on the shed floor? Well, the used litter (the bird’s bedding plus manure which remains on the floor of the chicken shed after a batch of chickens has been collected to be processed) is taken out of the shed, loaded into trailers and trucked off, generally for use in composts or in organic fertiliser for a range of different applications, such as horticulture, viticulture, broadacre farming, pasture and turf farms. (click here to listen to Stephen Wiedemann).\nEven better, the use of chicken litter as fertiliser reduces the amount of artificial or inorganic fertilisers, like urea and superphosphate (which require significant amounts of energy to produce), that need to be used across Australia to produce a diverse range of other food products and it also contributes valuable organic matter to soils. Chicken litter is therefore not a waste product… it’s a valuable resource used in the production chain of other crops and foods.\nAt the chicken processing plant, there is virtually no waste either! As a rough guide, a bit over two thirds of the weight of the live chicken that leaves the farm ends up in products for human consumption. What doesn’t end up in products for human consumption mostly ends up in a range of rendered or fresh products used in animal and pet foods.\nWhat about water use?\nBecause there is a very close relationship between how much an animal eats and how much it drinks (in the case of chickens, it’s about 2 litres of water for every kg of feed consumed), this means that the more efficiently an animal converts feed into product, the more efficiently it uses drinking water also…so modern poultry production wins again!\nThe area of commercial chicken meat production where most water is used is in the processing plant, where water is a critical input for the carcase cleaning and chilling processes. However, chicken processing companies have, over the past ten years, invested a significant amount of time, money and effort into finding and implementing new ways of reducing water usage in their plants, without compromising food safety. This has resulted in massive reductions in the amount of water used to process each chicken. Indeed, industry initiatives in this area have been recognised nationally. For example, in 2010 Inghams Enterprises was recognised with the Prime Minister’s Water Wise Award for its adoption of advanced water treatment technologies which enabled the company’s Brisbane plant to treat wastewater from the poultry processing plant to drinking water quality, thereby reducing its reliance on mains water by 70 per cent.\nTo put things into perspective, the Life Cycle Assessment conducted for Australian chicken meat (referred to above) concluded that the average 1.7 kg whole chicken requires less water to produce throughout the whole supply chain (up to the point that it leaves the plant for retail sale and ultimate cooking) than an average 4-minute shower.\nAdd this to the finding that the total greenhouse gas emissions associated with producing that chicken would be equivalent to the emissions that would be generated by driving a car to collect the same chicken from the local supermarket or chicken shop, and I think the case for the environmental sustainability of modern chicken meat production clearly stacks up!","'Normality is a paved road.

{"question":"What are the main benefits of having a high customer retention rate in business? Could you explain the financial implications?","answer":"There are five key benefits of having a high customer retention rate: 1) Lower marketing costs - it costs five times less to retain existing customers than acquire new ones. 2) Increased profitability - a 5% increase in retention can lead to 75% more profit. 3) Free word-of-mouth advertising from satisfied customers. 4) Valuable feedback about business health through retention metrics. 5) Higher purchase values since existing customers tend to spend more due to trust in the brand and likelihood to use upsells.","context":["Customer retention is essential for the success of any business. Yet, many companies struggle to keep their customers happy because they don't know how to measure, evaluate or improve their customer retention rate.\nThe average annual customer retention rate for the SaaS industry is 50-68%, and, in addition to that, the average company will lose 10-25% of its customers each year. In this article, we'll go into how to measure CRR and strategies you can implement to make sure that you are beating industry averages and retaining as many customers as possible.\n- What customer retention rate is\n- How you can calculate your customer retention rate — both manually and in Excel (we've prepared a template)\n- What a good customer retention rate is\n- Why and how often you should calculate your customer retention rate\n- How to interpret your CRR\n- Strategies you can implement to improve a low customer retention rate and, finally,\n- How software like Fullview can help you increase your CRR\nWhat is customer retention rate?\nCustomer retention rate (AKA CRR or user retention rate) is the percentage of customers who stay with a company over a period of time. It is expressed as a percentage of a company's existing customer base, meaning that if you start with 100 customers and lose 10 over some period of time, your customer retention rate during that period was 90% (i.e., 90 of your existing customers remained customers and didn't churn).\nShould you count new users when measuring user retention?\nIt's important not to include new customers who signed up during that same period when you're calculating your customer retention rate. This is done in order to accurately analyze your customer retention rate and what it means about what you're doing right — and what you could improve upon. Why?\nBecause making up for churn by acquiring new customers is unsustainable and can hide serious issues with your product, customer experiences, or business model. Plus, it's 5 times more expensive to acquire new customers than it is to retain existing ones, so shoring up churn with new acquisitions quickly becomes an expensive enterprise.\nHow often should you measure CRR?\nCRR is typically measured on an annual basis, but it can also be helpful to measure customer retention on a quarterly or monthly basis in order to track progress and identify any potential issues early on. How often you measure customer retention depends very much on your business model: if most of your contracts are long-term or annual contracts, measuring CRR frequently is pointless. In contrast, some subscription or pay-as-you-go businesses can benefit from measuring CRR frequently — over time periods as little as a day, in some cases.\nWhy is it important to measure customer retention rate?\nWhen it comes to customer retention, many companies focus on acquisition and forget about the importance of keeping their customers happy. Here are five reasons why customer retention rate is so important:\n- Lower marketing costs: It's estimated that it costs five times more to acquire a new customer than it does to retain an existing one. By focusing on customer retention, you can reduce your marketing costs and reinvest those savings into other areas of your business.\n- Repeat customers means more profit: When customers feel brand loyalty, they're more likely to make repeat purchases. In fact, according to Bain & Company, a five percent increase in customer retention can lead to a 75 percent increase in profit. Plus, repeat customers also increase the customer lifetime value, which is also an important measure of how viable a SaaS business is.\n- Free word-of-mouth advertising: When customers are happy with your product or service, they're more likely to tell their friends and family about it. This word-of-mouth advertising is invaluable because it comes from a trusted source.\n- Gain valuable feedback: Your customer retention rate can give you both direct and indirect feedback about how healthy your SaaS business is. If you see a sudden drop in customer retention, it could be a sign that something is wrong with your product or service. On the other hand, if you see a steady increase in customer retention, it's a good indication that you're on the right track.\n- Higher purchase values: Existing customers are also more likely to spend more money with your company because they trust your brand, know how to use your product or service, and are more likely to take advantage of upsells and cross-sells.\nHow to calculate customer retention rate?\nCRR is relatively straightforward to calculate. In order to do so, you'll have to:\n- Decide on which time period you want to calculate CRR for. This could be a month, a quarter, a year, or another length of time that makes sense for your company and business model.\n- Identify the customers at the start of this period. If you use CRM software like HubSpot or Intercom, this number is easy to find and automatically tracked.\n- Count the total number of customers at the end of that period. Include both existing and new customers — we'll subtract the number of new customers acquired when we're calculating CRR.\n- Count the number of new customers you have acquired during that time period. We'll need to subtract this number from the total number of customers at the end of the period to arrive at an accurate CRR.\nOnce you've done all of that, you can calculate your customer retention rate using this formula:\nCustomer Retention Rate = ((Customers at the end of the period - New customers acquired during that period) / Customers at the start of that period) x 100\nFor example, if you have:\n- 100 customers at the start of the time period\n- 120 customers at the end of that period\n- 30 new customers acquired during that period\nYour CRR would be:\n((120-30) / 100) x 100\nCan you customer retention rate be negative?\nYes, you can have a negative customer retention rate. But the only way for this to happen is for you to lose some or all of the new customers you acquired during that period as well as existing customers at the start of that period.\nFor example, if you started the period with 5 customers, added 150 customers during that period and ended the period with 100 customers, that would imply that you lost at least 50 new customers during that period.\nUsing the formula above, you would technically end up with a negative customer retention rate:\n((100 - 150) / 5) x 100\nor - 1000%\nHow to calculate customer retention rate in Excel?\nFor an easier way to calculate your customer retention rate, we've made a template you can use (it's ungated and completely free to use — all you have to do is make a copy of it).\nOnce you've made a copy, follow these steps to automatically calculate your customer retention rate:\n- Import a list of customers you had at the beginning of the period in column A\n- Import a list of customers you had at the end of the period in column B\n- Import a list of the new customers you added during that period in column C\nAnd then template will calculate your CRR. Find it by clicking on the image above or here.\nIf you want to create the template yourself, here is the formula: =(((COUNTA(B:B)-1)-(COUNTA(C:C)-1))/(COUNTA(A:A)-1))\nJust remember to import the right customers into the right columns as detailed in the bullet list above.\n10 best ways to increase retention\nIf you calculate your CRR and find it lacking, here are some tried-and-tested ways to increase your customer retention rate:\n- Master your onboarding\n- Personalize your customer experiences\n- Make proactive support a habit\n- Build trust and loyalty\n- Always seek and implement customer feedback\n- Start a loyalty program\n- Provide value\n- Use the right tools\n- Offer the right incentives to customers who are churning\n- Measure your performance and improve it\nHave you ever wondered at what points a customer is most likely to churn? One of the major ones is if they sign up for your product and don’t immediately get a sense of what it is, how to use it, or how it can benefit them. You have to demonstrate value from the minute they log on or you risk losing them. The best way to do this is to design a simple but effective onboarding sequence that hooks them immediately. If yours is a particularly complex product, design your onboarding sequence in stages and make sure there is a clear CTA at each one – even if it is as simple as prompting them to add a team member.\nPersonalize your customer experiences\nNo one likes feeling like just another number on a spreadsheet. It’s crucial to remember that those retention targets you are trying to achieve represent real human beings. One of the best ways to retain a customer is to reach out personally when they sign up. You don’t have to do this for every customer (for example, those on your free plan may not be relevant), but there are certain segments you should absolutely make it a point to develop relationships with. This is also one of the best ways to foster a sense of loyalty in your customer base.\nOffer proactive as opposed to reactive support\nIf a customer is reaching out to you with a problem, it’s likely that they have spent at least some time trying to figure it out on their own before giving up. This means that, when they reach out, they are already feeling a sense of frustration and helplessness. This is why it is so crucial to offer proactive support rather than waiting for customers to reach out to you once they have already encountered a problem. The best way to do this is to invest in a session replays tool that records user sessions in your product. You can then monitor these sessions on an ongoing basis to scan for issues.\nBuild trust and loyalty\nLike every good relationship, your relationship with your customers should be built on a foundation of trust if you want to inspire any brand loyalty. SaaS customers have a lot of choice these days, so your brand reputation counts for a lot. One of the best ways to build this trust is to be completely transparent with your customers and take steps to make sure their data and privacy are protected. Another way to build trust is through social proof in the form of testimonials and reviews.\nAlways seek and implement customer feedback\nCustomer feedback should form the bedrock of any good product. After all, if you aren’t building it with your customers in mind, who are you trying to build it for? It’s a good idea to make it a point to solicit their feedback at relevant points in their customer journey. You can build it into your onboarding sequence, send a short CSAT survey after a customer support interaction or email particularly active users with a longer product survey.\nStart a loyalty program\nAnother great way to ensure that your customers stick with you for the long haul is to incentivize that longevity with a loyalty program. Loyalty programs can take many different forms, so you’ll have to design yours around your particular business. You could, for example, give customers who stick around for a particular amount of time discounts on plans or items. You could start a point-based loyalty program, where customers earn points for every dollar spent. Or you could offer a tiered loyalty program and give customers discounts based on the amount they spend on your platform — the more the spend, the bigger the discount. Again, it all depends on your business model.\nThis one should be evident, but it bears repeating: if you don’t demonstrate value to your customers from the moment they sign up, they are likely to leave and never return. One of the most likely moments for customers to churn is during onboarding and then within the first few days or weeks of signing up for your platform. If you can hold their attention and demonstrate immediate value in that time, they will stick around. However, if you don’t demonstrate any value or make it difficult for them to realize this value, they will likely churn.\nUse the right tools\nIn order to prevent as much churn as possible, it is essential to get your tech stack right and make sure you are investing in the right kinds of software. From customer relationship management software, to customer support software, to your MarTech stack, investing in the right kinds of tools for your business can help you create the best customer experiences.\nOffer the right incentives to customers who are churning\nMost CRM platforms these days have mechanisms in place to alert you when a customer is likely to churn. How do they measure this? With product usage benchmarks that you can customize. To do that, you’ll need to think about what constitutes churn for your business and then monitor that in your CRM. So, for example, if your software is something that people typically use daily and a user has not signed in for a few days, you could define that as them being likely to churn. Once you identify which customers are about to churn, tempt them back with discount codes or other incentives to continue using your product.\nMeasure your performance and improve it\nPreventing customer churn is an ongoing process and it is something that you will have to perfect over time. Because this is something that you will be dealing with for the entire lifecycle of your product, the most important thing is to measure your performance and then constantly seek to improve it. We’ve already put together a list of the most important customer support metrics to track, which is a good place to start. But you will also need to track commercial metrics and marketing metrics to see how optimized your pipelines are and how sticky your product is.\nWrapping things up\nCustomer retention rate (CRR) is an important metric for any business, especially in the SaaS industry where it can be more challenging to retain customers. By measuring CRR regularly, companies can identify any potential issues early on and take the necessary steps to improve customer retention. The benefits of a high CRR are numerous, including lower marketing costs, more profit, free word-of-mouth advertising, valuable feedback, and higher purchase values. To calculate CRR, companies can use a simple formula that takes into account the number of customers gained and lost over a specific period of time."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3cd98de8-3bf8-482c-bbb2-4eb30a655e59>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Looking to compare the accessibility of home practice vs. studio classes for yoga - what equipment and safety considerations should I keep in mind for both traditional and aerial yoga? Would love a detailed breakdown! 🤔","answer":"For aerial yoga, specific equipment is required including a trapeze (fabric harness), a mounting bar or ceiling hooks, and adequate space - though surprisingly, even a corner or doorway can suffice since practice is usually done close to the ground. While you can practice at home after learning basics, starting with a class is strongly encouraged. For traditional yoga, the practice is generally safe for most healthy people under trained instruction, but certain conditions require medical clearance first, including herniated disks, severe osteoporosis, pregnancy, and uncontrolled blood pressure. When choosing either type of yoga, it's important to find qualified instructors who understand your needs and can suggest modified poses. While both types can be learned from online resources, beginners typically benefit from in-person instruction for proper form and safety.","context":["The increasingly popular Aerial Yoga is also called Anti-gravity yoga. It sounds space age, but it’s really about taking your yoga practice into the air to achieve better balance. In practice, it involves fighting against gravity with your body to achieve traditional poses without the floor to push against.\nIt is encouraged that you start your aerial yoga journey with a class. However, once you get the hang of the basics, setting up your own space in your home to keep up practice can only improve your mastery. Plus, there are plenty of online resources for continuing to learn. These include videos and blogs.\nBenefits of Aerial Yoga\nJust like many other forms of working out, the bending and repetitive motions of aerial yoga makes it a great activity for strengthening the body. An added benefit of the hanging element of the practice is that it decompresses your spine to help alleviate back pain.\nOn top of this, it is an excellent centering exercise. There is nothing quite like concentrating on holding your form while hanging above the ground.\nWhile on that note, perhaps the most important benefit is that it is fun! This is not always discussed as a benefit of yoga, but twisting around in the air is about as much fun as you can have while still getting fit.\nAerial yoga does require some specialized equipment. Mats for other yoga practice can be used for multiple work out activities, but aerial yoga requires its own tools. Keep this in mind if you are planning a practice space at home. Just like weight lifting, this exercise will require space to be put aside especially for its practice.\nThe basic equipment you will need for Aerial Yoga are a trapeze, a bar to suspend it off of, or hooks to hold it in place. The trapeze is the harness used to suspend yourself. These are pieces of cloth slung like a hammock and in ladder like arrangements for you to work into poses off of. The bar is for stabilizing this contraption in an easy to access horizontal hang, parallel to the floor. The hooks are another hanging option. These are often mounted to the ceiling so the trapeze can hang directly down.\nWhile it can be attractive to imagine hanging free, tens of feet from the floor, aerial yoga is often practiced fairly close to the ground so that reaching it does not become difficult. The lucky thing about this is that when installing gear in the home, it may not be necessary to put aside a huge amount of space for practice. Instead, a corner, or even a doorway, will do.\nSee our review of the best aerial yoga trapeze home setup if you want to find out more.\nBeginning Aerial Yoga\nAerial yoga is very new, and instructors and innovators are working constantly to find new poses that will benefit those practicing it in wholesome ways. The purpose is, after all, improving the body and mind, and not just creating a dazzling display. This does not mean aerial yoga is not beautiful.\nThese basic poses can take many practices to perfect, but the body will always benefit from repeating them. Below you will find an introduction to the basic concepts needed to begin aerial yoga.\nIn aerial yoga, there are several types of poses. Two important ones are poses that you hold for strengthening your body, and transitional poses.\nThe Star Inversion is a transitional one that is used as a base for upside down poses. To get there, sit on the sling of the trapeze so that it sits near your tailbone. Holding onto the sides of the sling, lie back slowly and widen your legs to leverage yourself and stop from slipping. Once you have dropped as far as you can, let your hands free and bring them toward the floor. Hold until stable.\nFrom here you can transition to several more advanced poses.\nA good pose to practice holding, the cross position improves balance and decompresses the spine. This one is simple, though takes some practice to master the balance required. To perform the cross position, balance yourself on the sling just above your waist, then lean back while straightening your legs.\nAerial yoga can be a fun a rewarding version of yoga. With its rise in popularity, there are now an increasing number of products that make home practice accessible for more people. With these basics, you are ready to move forward into the word of aerial yoga!","Is yoga right for you? It is if you want to fight stress, get fit and stay healthy.By Mayo Clinic Staff\nYour mobile phone is ringing, your boss wants to talk to you and your partner wants to know what's for dinner. Stress and anxiety are everywhere. If they're getting the best of you, you might want to hit the mat and give yoga a try.\nYoga is a mind-body practice that combines physical poses, controlled breathing, and meditation or relaxation. Yoga may help reduce stress, lower blood pressure and lower your heart rate. And almost anyone can do it.\nYoga — a mind-body practice — is considered one of many types of complementary and integrative health approaches. Yoga brings together physical and mental disciplines that may help you achieve peacefulness of body and mind. This can help you relax and manage stress and anxiety.\nYoga has many styles, forms and intensities. Hatha yoga, in particular, may be a good choice for stress management. Hatha is one of the most common styles of yoga, and beginners may like its slower pace and easier movements. But most people can benefit from any style of yoga — it's all about your personal preferences.\nThe core components of hatha yoga and most general yoga classes are:\n- Poses. Yoga poses, also called postures, are a series of movements designed to increase strength and flexibility. Poses range from lying on the floor while completely relaxed to difficult postures that may have you stretching your physical limits.\n- Breathing. Controlling your breathing is an important part of yoga. Yoga teaches that controlling your breathing can help you control your body and quiet your mind.\n- Meditation or relaxation. In yoga, you may incorporate meditation or relaxation. Meditation may help you learn to be more mindful and aware of the present moment without judgment.\nThe potential health benefits of yoga include:\n- Stress reduction. A number of studies have shown that yoga may help reduce stress and anxiety. It can also enhance your mood and overall sense of well-being.\n- Improved fitness. Practicing yoga may lead to improved balance, flexibility, range of motion and strength.\n- Management of chronic conditions. Yoga can help reduce risk factors for chronic diseases, such as heart disease and high blood pressure. Yoga might also help alleviate chronic conditions, such as depression, pain, anxiety and insomnia.\nYoga is generally considered safe for most healthy people when practiced under the guidance of a trained instructor. But there are some situations in which yoga might pose a risk.\nSee your health care provider before you begin yoga if you have any of the following conditions or situations:\n- A herniated disk\n- A risk of blood clots\n- Eye conditions, including glaucoma\n- Pregnancy — although yoga is generally safe for pregnant women, certain poses should be avoided\n- Severe balance problems\n- Severe osteoporosis\n- Uncontrolled blood pressure\nYou may be able to practice yoga in these situations if you take certain precautions, such as avoiding certain poses or stretches. If you develop symptoms, such as pain, or have concerns, see your doctor to make sure you're getting benefit and not harm from yoga.\nAlthough you can learn yoga from books and videos, beginners usually find it helpful to learn with an instructor. Classes also offer camaraderie and friendship, which are also important to overall well-being.\nWhen you find a class that sounds interesting, talk with the instructor so that you know what to expect. Questions to ask include:\n- What are the instructor's qualifications? Where did he or she train and how long has he or she been teaching?\n- Does the instructor have experience working with students with your needs or health concerns? If you have a sore knee or an aching shoulder, can the instructor help you find poses that won't aggravate your condition?\n- How demanding is the class? Is it suitable for beginners? Will it be easy enough to follow along if it's your first time?\n- What can you expect from the class? Is it aimed at your needs, such as stress management or relaxation, or is it geared toward people who want to reap other benefits?\nEvery person has a different body with different abilities. You may need to modify yoga postures based on your individual abilities. Your instructor may be able to suggest modified poses. Choosing an instructor who is experienced and who understands your needs is important to safely and effectively practice yoga.\nRegardless of which type of yoga you practice, you don't have to do every pose. If a pose is uncomfortable or you can't hold it as long as the instructor requests, don't do it. Good instructors will understand and encourage you to explore — but not exceed — your personal limits.\nNov. 05, 2015\n- Yoga for health.

{"question":"Could you please compare how fuel pumps perform under different voltage conditions between traditional systems and Fuelab's digital pumps? I'm curious about the technological advancements in this area.","answer":"Traditional fuel pumps show significant performance variation with voltage changes - for example, one manufacturer found a 40% increase in flow volume at 80 psi when voltage increased from 12v to 13.5v. This is because voltage to an electric motor is like fuel pressure to an injector: more pressure equals more volume output. In contrast, Fuelab's digital pumps use advanced brushless motor technology that provides quicker response to changing power demands. Their system includes an electronic fuel pressure regulator that can reduce pump speed when full power isn't needed, generating less heat and providing true on-demand fuel delivery. This digital control allows the pump to run at conservative speeds for street driving and increase output only when needed for high-performance situations.","context":["Consider this – a high 10 second drag car will burn up one gallon of gasoline in 25 seconds or less, but a car that can run a 7 second E.T. will burn the same amount of fuel in half the time. The physics involved with fuel flow to create horsepower is difficult for even experts to understand, but one thing is for certain: if the fuel system is marginal, you won’t be able to get the maximum out of the engine, which could lead to an unhappy customer who will take his engine elsewhere.\nThere are many different components and configurations involved in a racing fuel system – a system largely made up of valves, pumps, diaphragms, seals and orifices. Therefore, several variables come into play when setting up a fuel system for a performance application. The main purpose of the fuel system is to pull fuel from the tank and deliver it to the carburetor or injectors with enough volume and pressure to overcome any forces (G-forces, weather, etc.) that may be working against the system.\nBefore you choose a fuel system and its related pumps, regulators, etc., you will need to know what type of fuel your customer will use. If it’s a different fuel than gasoline such as nitrous or alcohol, for instance, the engine you build will require more fuel (volume) than what you would normally burn for a gasoline engine, so you will likely need a modified system that can flow enough for the engine’s needs.\nTypically, at wide-open throttle (WOT) a gasoline engine will burn approximately .5 lb. of fuel per hour for every horsepower. So that means a 650 hp engine will burn 325 lbs. of fuel every hour. Selecting the proper fuel system components for your customer’s performance application, whether it’s for the street or the track or a combination of both, is as important as the internal components you select.\nFuel systems vary depending on what type of induction system you use. If you are running electronic fuel injection (EFI), you will need a different system than you would if you’re running a carbureted engine. In many forms of racing and on many street performance engines, carburetors are still king. And a high efficiency fuel pump that delivers volume and pressure with a dynamic, return-style regulator, designed for use with carburetors will often solve mysterious fuel problems.\nOften times engine builders only see part of the fuel system such as the carburetor or injectors and the necessary plumbing to and from these components. If you have a stock or modified mechanical pump or belt driven pump, you may get to build a lot more of the system.\nThere are many racing and performance fuel pumps on the market available from several manufacturers built to suit nearly every application. Knowing what to choose for your customer’s engine can be a complicated decision, and you will need to ask many questions and talk to some manufacturers if you still aren’t sure whether the pump is correct for the application.\nJust because the engine runs without a miss or sputter, doesn’t mean that the engine is getting enough fuel or that the system is optimized. After all, the more pounds of fuel an engine can burn efficiently, the more horsepower it will produce. In some racing applications such as certain stock cars classes, when a mechanical fuel pump is specified by the rules, a belt drive or hex drive fuel pump is recommended. These pumps offer higher fuel delivery volume for a mechanical pump while also maintaining lower fuel pressure at lower engine speeds.\nFor drag racing applications, an electric fuel pump is often the best way to go. These pumps will help prevent fuel starvation or “laying down” at mid-track. If your drag racing customer complains of this problem, the engine may be experiencing intermittent fuel starvation.\nThe reason for this is because under hard acceleration the demand for fuel increases. But the quick acceleration (G-forces) can cause the float bowl levels to drop and lead to fuel starvation. In high gear, engine speed increases more slowly allowing the bowls to fill again.\nFuel pump manufacturers, for the most part, rate their pumps based on calculating gallons-per-hour. And while this is an important factor that helps determine which fuel pump is the most suited for a particular engine combination, so too are things such as engine horsepower and fuel efficiency, commonly referred to as BSFC or Brake Specific Fuel Consumption; maximum fuel system pressure and the flow volume at that pressure; available voltage at the pump under load and the flow volume at that voltage. Different engine combinations, power adders, even fuel octane ratings and tuning approaches can have a significant impact on BSFC. You must consider these factors carefully when choosing a fuel pump.\nNaturally aspirated engines are normally most efficient with a BSFC between .4 and .5 pounds of fuel per horsepower per hour (lbs/hp/hr). And engines enhanced by nitrous typically use a little extra fuel and often develop a BSFC from .5 to .6 lbs/hp/hr. Forced induction engines are usually least efficient and BSFC ranges from .6 to .75 lbs/hp/hr.\nFuel pressure should normally be set between 6 and 8 psi for a gasoline carburetor. However, experts point out that fuel pressure is not a substitute for volume. If the fuel bowls are not full, the pressure in the system doesn’t mean anything. In fact, experts say, fuel pressure is simply an indication of the amount of restriction in the fuel system.\nMost electrical fuel pump systems require the use of at least one fuel pressure regulator. It is often recommended to use two regulators in high horsepower engines to avoid excessive fuel restriction and provide adequate volume.\nIn some pumps, such as a mechanical fuel pump, a bypass is often preferred rather than a regulator. A diaphragm bypass without an idle bleed is recommended when constant fuel pressure is needed from an electrical or mechanical pump.\nA belt driven fuel pump, using gasoline or alcohol, requires a diaphragm bypass with an idle bleed. Higher pressure mechanical fuel pumps delivering alcohol require a throttle bypass to supply the variable fuel pressure required by the carburetor.\nUse of a filter is highly recommended as long as it doesn’t restrict fuel flow. But you should always use a fuel filter that is specifically designed for racing. The latest technology in fuel filters allows more filtration as well as higher flow.\nThe fuel filter should be installed in the line before the fuel pump. This prevents any debris from entering the fuel pump or the rest of the system, including inside the engine.\nYou would never think of running a race engine without an oil filter, yet sometimes the fuel filter is not added or upgraded for performance applications.\nSteady and significant improvements to cylinder heads, intake manifolds and carburetors and injectors have necessitated the need for more efficient fuel systems in order to get the maximum power out of the engine.\nDetermining the fuel volume necessary for a particular engine is the first step in selecting a fuel pump. How does fuel pressure affect pump delivery? The effect of rising fuel pressure has significant impact on flow volume. By eliminating unnecessary fuel pressure rise, increases flow, maximizing the power potential of any fuel system.\nAnother factor to consider in fuel pump performance is voltage supply as measured at the fuel pump terminals. Voltage to an electric motor is like fuel pressure to an injector: more pressure in equals more volume out. Higher voltage at the pump terminals increases motor torque, resulting in more rpm and an increased flow volume for a given pressure. To illustrate this, a fuel pump manufacturer tested one of its pumps at 80 psi and had a 40 percent increase in volume when the voltage was increased from 12v to 13.5v.\nThe fuel system’s first priority is to keep the floats from running low enough to uncover the main jet, running the engine out of fuel. It may not seem significant but the weight of fuel above the main jet does impact fuel flow through it, and therefore the air/fuel ratio of the engine under load. Here the typical static fuel system struggles. The fuel is standing in the line, barely moving and to make matters worse, the static style regulator places the check valve between the fuel pump and carburetor, restricting fuel flow across the board.\nTo combat this, fuel pressure in a static system should always be higher from the pump to the regulator than it is from the regulator to the carburetor. This higher line pressure is necessary for two reasons, one to start flow against G-forces and to push fuel through the restrictive regulator valve. The benefits of a dynamic, return style fuel system are many, including longer pump life, a noticeable increase in pump to horsepower ratings (allowing smaller, lighter pumps to fuel more hp), even quieter pump operation is common. Ultimately, combining the right pump and regulator into a dynamic fuel system significantly improves average float level, fueling the bowls more quickly and consistently.\nTo produce torque and horsepower requires a mixture of air and fuel. As explained earlier, a 600 hp engine will require 300 lbs. of gasoline per hour and, by the same formula, an 800 hp engine needs 400 lbs. per hour. Also note that all the fuel has to be delivered past the needles and seats (or injectors in EFI) and the fuel pressure regulator.\nSo what happens if fuel delivery is not optimized? That hot camshaft, carburetor, and flowed set of heads may have overstressed an already taxed fuel delivery system. Carburetors cannot disperse the optimum air/fuel mixture unless the fuel system has the ability to maintain correct float bowl levels. Fuel levels that are too low may not cause the motor to miss or “burn” a piston, but they will reduce fuel flow and lower performance.\nAs an engine builder, the fuel system may not be entirely your responsibility if you are supplying an engine with an external fuel pump. Most modern engines have electric fuel pumps mounted in the fuel tank. Many racing engines use an electric fuel pump mounted to a chassis rail. In many cases the fuel system, which, for the sake of this article, includes the fuel lines, regulator, fittings, pump, filter, rails, tank, etc. These parts of the fuel system must work together harmoniously to produce the right amount of fuel at the right time – like when the driver mashes the gas.\nThe fuel system is your engine’s lifeline and without an adequate supply of fuel, your engine will literally starve to death. Racing and high performance engine applications require special attention to the fuel system and may require upgrading to handle the needs of that application. If you’re building any kind of modified engine, you will likely have to modify the fuel pump, plumbing and filters of the system to keep up with the demands of the engine. No matter if you run fuel injection or carburetor, a stock fuel system is not likely going to supply enough fuel when you need it (or when the driver needs it).\nBG Fuel Systems\nAeromotive Fuel Systems","Fuel On Demand: High Performance Variable Speed Fuel Pumps\nInternal combustion engines require sufficient amounts of fuel to make power. This isn’t just about making power, but preventing self-destruction because we don’t have enough fuel in its important relationship with air. Nitrous, supercharging, and turbocharging create demand to where you must have enough fuel to air to prevent engine damage, yet not overwhelm the engine and lose power.\nImagine a system where you can fine-tune fuel delivery to your engine’s demands. Fuelab, Aeromotive, and Holley have precisely what the doctor ordered for your tough fuel system requirements. You may opt for a variable speed fuel pump system from Fuelab, go with a pressure-regulated conventional high-capacity pump system from Holley, or utilize an adjustable controller for your pump from Aeromotive. The choice is yours.\nChoosing A System\nBefore you can properly select a fuel pump, it’s important to know what kind of power your engine is going to make plus how it will be used most of the time. “In the past, fuel pump manufacturers have rated their offerings based on gallons-per-hour, free-flow (no test pressure), and with no reference to test voltage,” Jesse Powell of Aeromotive tells us. “In the real world, this gave no indication of the horsepower that could be supported by such a pump.” This is why you need to know as much about your engine as is possible before choosing a pump system. We say “pump system” because fuel delivery happens via more elements than just a pump. There’s high-pressure fuel line and a means of regulating fuel pressure. Most systems employ a pressure regulator, which controls return flow to the tank thereby controlling fuel pressure. The pressure regulator gets its vacuum signal from intake manifold vacuum, which is based on throttle position and load.\nPowell tells us pump size is determined by how much horsepower your engine is expected to make and how much fuel will be required to support that power. You must also consider power adders like nitrous and supercharging in your plan. Aeromotive suggests estimating on the high side when it comes to horsepower to play it safe. Better too much fuel than too little. Too little means lean mixture, detonation, and great potential for engine failure.\nIn the past, manufacturers have rated their offerings based on gallons-per-hour, free-flow with no reference to voltage. This gave no indication of the horsepower that could be supported. – Jesse Powell, Aeromotive\nBSFC (Brake Specific Fuel Consumption) is crucial to fuel pump and injector selection – so get familiar with this term and what it means. BSFC boils down to how much fuel we’re going to burn to make a given amount of horsepower. The higher the BSFC number, the more fuel we’re going to have to have.\nAeromotive adds that naturally aspirated engines are most efficient with a BSFC between .4 and .5 lbs/hp/hr.\nNitrous combinations call for additional fuel and often develop a BSFC from .5 to .6 lbs/hp/hr. If you’re going to supercharge or turbocharge, BSFC should range from .6 to .75 lbs/hp/hr. This means you need greater amounts of fuel to meet the demand.\nSo what does all this complicated math mean for you?\nHere are a couple of real world examples:\nIf we have a 650 horsepower engine and multiply horsepower times .4 BSFC, we’re going to burn 260 pounds of gasoline. If we have .75 BSFC, our 650-horse engine becomes very thirsty at 487 pounds of gasoline. This means .75 BSFC is grossly inefficient. Same horsepower, but with huge amounts of fuel consumption. This means you must carefully choose the right pump system for your engine’s demands.\nAvoiding Engine Armageddon\nHow Do I Know How Much Pump I Need?\n- Engine Flywheel Horsepower\n- Engine fuel efficiency, commonly referred to as BSFC or Brake Specific Fuel Consumption\n- Maximum fuel system pressure and the pump’s flow volume at that pressure\n- Available voltage at the fuel pump under engine load and the pump’s flow volume at that voltage\nHere’s what you’re going to need to know about choosing injector size: Take the known amount of gasoline required in pounds and divide by the number of injectors you’re going to need. Again, err to the side of caution. Too much is better than too little. Aeromotive suggests the following formula: take 650 horsepower and multiply by .4 BSFC to get 260 pounds of fuel. Then, take 260 pounds of petrol and divide by eight injectors to get 32.5 lbs/hr or 33 lb/hr injectors. When we take that 33 lb/hr figure and crank in caution with 33 divided by .8, we get 41 lb/hr at an 80-percent duty cycle. And because you care about your engine, it’s a good idea to check these numbers with a seasoned engine builder before buying fuel system components.\nFuelab’s On-Demand Fuel Delivery System\nFuelab is a forward thinking company with digital electric fuel pumps. Your first thoughts are likely how does anyone digitize an electric fuel pump? Fuelab does this via electronic control where fuel pump speed is regulated based on engine power demands.\nWe decided to introduce new brushless pump motor technology into fuel pump design and manufacturing. – Brian Paitz, Fuelab\n“We decided to introduce new brushless pump motor technology into fuel pump design and manufacturing,” Brian Paitz of Fuelab tells us.\nFuelab claims that brushless technology enables them to make a lighter pump that offers a quicker response to changing power demands. What’s more, you can run just about anything through the Fuelab pump — gasoline, methanol, E85, or diesel. And, you can change fuel type at any time.\n“One problem with a high-performance electric pump like this is heat,” Paitz comments. “These pumps require a lot of electric current, which makes heat; and heat causes unwanted vapor lock.” Vapor lock causes fuel stagnation shutting an engine down in short order,” he adds. “To prevent vapor lock, Fuelab has developed an electronic fuel pressure regulator that reduces heat when a vehicle is on the street.” This process reduces pump speed generating less heat. The pump runs at a conservative speed on the street where large quantities of fuel are not needed. When it’s time to lock and load, the Fuelab system kicks into high gear providing plenty of fuel to meet the increased demand. Speed control is based on feedback from the pressure regulator. “It is the first true on-demand type of fuel system,” Paitz adds.\n- 40401 Reduced Size EFI In-Line Fuel Pump 75 GPH @ 45 PSI – rated up to 700 hp\n- 40402 Reduced Size Carbureted In-Line Fuel Pump 160 GPH @ 15 PSI – Rated up to 800 hp\n- 41401 Prodigy Fuel Pump High Pressure EFI In Line 105 GPH @ 45 PSI – rated up to 1000 hp\n- 41402 Prodigy Fuel Pump High Efficiency EFI In Line 140 GPH @ 45 PSI – rated up to 1300 hp\n- 41403 Prodigy Fuel Pump Carbureted In Line 200 GPH @ 20 PSI – rated up to 1800 hp\n- 41404 Prodigy Fuel Pump Carbureted In Line 200 GPH @ 20 PSI – rated up to 1800 hp\n- 42401 Prodigy Fuel Pump High Pressure EFI In Line 170 GPH @ 45 PSI – rated up to 1500 hp\n- 42402 Prodigy Fuel Pump High Power EFI In-Line 190 GPH @ 45 PSI – rated up to 1800 hp\nFew companies are more on top of the fuel game than Holley. Known for legendary carburetors so loved by racers worldwide, it’s no surprise that our friends at Holley have come up with a high-performance fuel delivery system for fuel injected and carbureted systems alike. The in-line Holley HP billet fuel pump is just what the doctor ordered for carbureted and fuel injected vehicles alike. Liz Miles, respected automotive journalist and Holley representative, told us, “The HP line of billet electric fuel pumps feature Gerotor technology for positive displacement providing reliable fuel delivery on the street or on the track.” She adds the HP pump can deliver for 100,000 miles from a good-looking, cost effective package. It can take up to 18.5 volts and deliver up to 80 psi.\nIf you’re going to huff serious horsepower, Holley’s patented twin-pump Dominator is for you. The Dominator, as its name implies, is excellent for nitrous, supercharging, or turbocharging. This guy is machined from solid billet for fierce durability. It’s also fully submersible for in-tank use or you can mount it on the chassis for in-line use. This pump can be triggered from a myriad of sources to bring that additional fuel on demand that your engine requires at wide open throttle.\nHolley Pump Facts\n- HP In-Line Pump 12-700 Up to 700 horsepower EFI or 900 with a carburetor\n- HP In-Line Pump 12-890 Up to 900 horsepower EFI or 1050 with a carburetor. Hi-Flow Pump\n- Dominator Pump 12-1400 Up to 1400 horsepower EFI or 1830 with a carburetor\n- Dominator Pump 12-1800 Up to 1800 horsepower EFI or 2100 with a carburetor\nAeromotive’s Fuel Pump Controller\nWhat if you’d like to continue using the fuel pump that you already own, but want the benefits that a variable speed pump offers? That’s exactly the option that Aeromotive brought to the table with the creation of their Billet Fuel Pump Speed Controller. The device, when used on any pump on any type of vehicle, reduces fuel heating and vapor-lock issues by matching the duty cycle of the fuel pump to the engine RPM. When at low demand, the controller slows down the speed of the fuel pump to reduce suction side cavitation and vapor lock. As demand increases, the controller then returns the pump to 100% duty cycle to achieve maximum flow.\nThe Billet Fuel Pump Speed Controller operates by emitting a pulse modulation signal to the pump motor to reduce or increase the pump speed. Such an operation, that doesn’t alter/reduce voltage, is virtually harmless to the pump motor.\nThe Billet Fuel Pump Speed Controller features LED indicators to confirm ignition signal hookup and verifies action of the manual override circuit, as well as when the circuit is providing full voltage to the pump. Other features include a billet 6061-T651 aircraft aluminum housing with a black anodized finish, a solid-state transistor circuit rated at 40 amps, and an adjustable, full-speed RPM threshold.\nThe Fuel Pump Future is in your hands\nRegardless of which of these routes you opt to take for your fuel system needs, the benefits of a variable speed fuel system are aplenty, and there’s no question that your engine will benefit in the long-term from variable speed operation. Just when you thought selecting the proper pump for you needs was a tricky element, modern technology went and dropped another decision into your lap, but technology’s great, isn’t it?"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9bb2bed5-fabb-4af4-9667-fee70db09258>","<urn:uuid:73845707-9e90-4ed6-bde8-7b8f01f512db>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between physical and emotional symptoms of anxiety, and how do they manifest in patients?","answer":"Physical and emotional symptoms of anxiety manifest differently in patients. Physical symptoms include increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and excessive sweating, with many people fearing that symptoms like racing heart could indicate a heart attack. The emotional symptoms, on the other hand, are characterized by constant stress and worry about ordinary issues that are often disproportionate to actual circumstances, as well as feelings of panic that can develop into panic attacks. While physical symptoms are often the first to be noticed and can lead to diagnosis, emotional symptoms like persistent worry and panic are particularly challenging to control and may cause individuals to isolate themselves from triggers.","context":["What Is Anxiety?\nWhen someone is anxious, they may experience nervousness, concern, feel “on edge”, or worried. Anxiety is a natural emotion that’s the product of your body responding to harm or threat. It does this so you understand something is wrong and want to fix it. There are two types of anxiety, each with its own set of symptoms and processes. These are acute and chronic, and symptoms range anywhere from mild to severe. The level of severity depends on the patient, their genetics, social and personal situation, and stage and site of illness. Sometimes symptoms of anxiety can be mistaken for depression because the two conditions tend to occur together.\nMesothelioma and Mental Health\nPatients that develop mesothelioma or other severe disease go through a range of emotions and experiences they aren’t prepared for. New feelings that never existed may now push past the surface, beyond the patient’s control. It’s common for cancer patients to get feelings of anxiety, depression, and fear, among others, receiving a diagnosis is a very scary and shocking time after all. Additionally, when the body is sick, the immune system responds by sending out stress hormones and other chemicals that may negatively impact the patient’s mental health.\nLiving with mental health issues like anxiety and distress (among others) can really impact the quality of life for those also living with mesothelioma. Additionally, some cancer patients are more at risk for higher levels of distress than others, which is usually exacerbated by growing tumors, genetics, and other external factors. Other triggers that may affect a person’s anxiety levels are:\n- Continued trouble doing everyday activities\n- Issues at home\n- Physical side effects of mesothelioma treatment (pain, nausea)\n- Lack of social or spiritual satisfaction\n- Predisposition for stress, depression, or other mental health complications\nAlmost half of cancer patients report high levels of distress and anxiety. Regardless if it’s mesothelioma, lung cancer, or other debilitating illness, patients usually report a negative correlation to their mental health. When a patient has high levels of anxiety, it can be difficult for them to cope with mesothelioma symptoms, treatments, side effects, or recovery. This makes it vital for patients and their loved ones to effectively identify symptoms of anxiety or distress.\nWhen someone has short, intermittent feelings of distress, it’s known as acute anxiety. Symptoms of this are:\n- Intense feelings of dread or fear\n- Sense of being detached from self or surroundings\n- Rapid heartbeat or heart palpitations\n- Pain or tightness in the chest or abdominal area\n- Loss of breath, feeling suffocated, hyperventilating, or other breathing issues\n- Nausea, diarrhea, heartburn\n- Change in appetite\nAnxiety that’s chronic keeps coming back and lasts longer periods. This can also include multiple instances of acute anxiety. Symptoms can include:\n- Muscle tension\n- Anger and irritability\n- Fatigue or weakness\n- Trouble focusing and making decisions\nReach out to a doctor or healthcare provider if you or someone you know is exhibiting one or more of the above symptoms. These side effects may also be related to mesothelioma or treatments.\nAnxiety Versus Panic Attack\nWhile anxiety and panic attack symptoms are similar, a panic attack usually involves an isolated episode of extreme anxiety. If a person is going through a series of difficult events, they may experience multiple panic attacks in a shorter time. A panic attack encompasses most or all symptoms of acute anxiety at once, and at a higher intensity that can sometimes feel crippling.\nThink you’ve worked somewhere with high asbestos risk? Request a case evaluation to assess your chances for exposure.\nEvaluate My Case\nCoping Techniques for Acute Anxiety\nWhen mesothelioma patients have extreme anxiety or are experiencing a panic attack, it can make a world of difference to have coping techniques at the forefront. When someone is in the middle of a panic attack, they may not be able to think straight, and bettering the situation may be tough or impossible. Bringing yourself back from this state of panic, calming, and refocusing yourself is also known as grounding. If you have issues with anxiety and need help in emergencies or even just extra stressful days, try these coping techniques:\nThis technique is an underestimated, simple, and highly effective coping method. Just a few, simple breaths repeated in a pattern can break a person’s thought process, slow their heart rate, and enable them to regain control. One effective breathing technique therapists recommend is called the 4-7-8 method. This involves the patient breathing in for four seconds, holding that breathe for seven seconds, and then breathing out slowly for eight seconds. Patients have reported this method helps with anxiety, stress, and insomnia. Other breathing practices helpful for patients with distress are:\nAlternate Nostril Breathing\nControlled breathing through alternating nostrils by blocking one at a time.\nStructured breathing while trying to focus on the current moment and nothing else.\nNatural breathing that guides your mind gently on a similar path\nFocused breathing surrounded by happy memories and stories that can help distract from worries.\nSome therapists recommend patients use their five senses to help ground themselves during stressful times. Focusing on elements in these five categories distracts your panicking mind and forces it to comprehend new thoughts, which can almost immediately dissipate feelings of distress. It’s also known as the 5-4-3-2-1 method. Working backwards, you look for five things you can see and acknowledge in your mind and so on. Next, you’ll focus on four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. Once you’ve gone down the list of senses and acknowledged their presence, most people are almost fully calm again. Repeat these steps as many times as necessary until relaxed and able to function.\nUsing senses as a distraction is a coping technique that’s had success with many. Aromatherapy only utilizes the patient’s sense of smell. When using aromatherapy, patients can get oil, incense, or candles with their favorite scents. Activate these items when stress levels are high and watch them begin to plummet.\nNot everyone is affected the same way by these coping techniques, and some may not feel any effects at all. Every patient is different and reacts to therapy accordingly.\nCoping Techniques for Chronic Anxiety\nPatients with chronic anxiety usually have to use different coping methods than those with acute symptoms. Mesothelioma patients with chronic issues can evaluate their triggers, or what makes them feel anxious, and try to get ahead of it.\nExercise and Diet\nIt’s no secret that adequate physical exercise and diet can help the body fight illness, and anxiety is no exception. Just don’t overdo it, too much exercise can cause more damage than good. Talk to your doctor about what level of exercise they recommend for your situation.\nIf mesothelioma symptoms, diagnosis, or treatment cause the patient anxiety, they can seek professional support. Even family members or loved ones can help. Support options include healthcare provider, support pet, family member, therapist, psychiatrist, chaplain, counselor, or loved one. Sometimes, having a person (or pet) be there for the patient is all the support they need to alleviate mesothelioma anxieties. Additionally, therapists or other support can provide more techniques and personal experiences to offer as guidance.\nSpecialized and general support groups are also available either online or in-person for patients. Here, they can share and exchange knowledge with similar people about their experiences, concerns, and ways to cope. When patients acquire knowledge or learn more about their situation, disease, treatments, or recovery, they may feel lasting relief and comfort. Once triggers and gaps in knowledge are identified, the patient can take proactive steps to learn more, avoid triggers, and minimize their chronic anxiety.\nFor severe cases, doctors may prescribe medication. This depends on the patient’s treatment and medication history, as well as their overall mental and physical health. The doctor will screen the patient and ensure medication is the best route. Some physicians may pair medications with other therapy recommendations too.\nConcerned mesothelioma patients should get screened for anxiety, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). Additionally, they recommend screenings take place right after cancer diagnosis and throughout the patient’s mesothelioma timeline. Studies show that cancer patients with anxiety that find adequate support and coping methods can boost immune system function and help the body fight illness.","A Guide to Anxiety Symptoms\nThe symptoms of anxiety can vary from person to person, but there are a handful that are common among many anxiety warriors. Although it is normal for everyone to experience anxiety at some point in their lives, if your symptoms are persistent and unrelenting, you may have an anxiety disorder.\nAnxiety is a natural reaction to stress, but when your anxiousness begins to affect your performance at work, school, or in relationships, it becomes an issue. The symptoms of anxiety can be separated into four distinct categories: physical, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive.\nPhysical Symptoms of Anxiety\nMany of the physical symptoms of anxiety are so common that these physical symptoms often precede an actual diagnosis.\nThere are a number of physical symptoms associated with anxiety, which vary from person to person. The three listed here are very common across a number of anxiety disorders.\nAn increased heart rate or a rapid, irregular heartbeat is an extremely common symptom of anxiety.\nAlthough common, many people fear that a racing heart is a sign of a heart attack. This is why this symptom also leads many people to the emergency room.\nSensing that there is something wrong with your heart can also make anxiety worse, causing more symptoms to develop. If you do begin to feel heart palpitations that you suspect are as a result of anxiety, it is best to start working on calming techniques until you are settled again.\nThroughout your experience with anxiety, take note of your common symptoms. It can ease your mind to know that what you’re feeling is normal.\nShortness of Breath\nWhether you’re hyperventilating or feeling tightness in your chest and throat, making it difficult to breathe, there are many people who associate shortness of breath with anxiety.\nWhat makes this symptom scary for many individuals is the inability to catch your breath, despite your lack of physical activity. You can predict that you’ll begin to breathe harder when running, but if you develop the same sensation while sitting on the couch, this symptom can be troubling.\nDo you notice that your internal body temperature rises if you get scared? Being in a constant state of worry can cause similar side effects.\nMany people who have anxiety disorders experience excessive sweating, resulting from their feelings of panic. Stress will, unfortunately, cause most people to sweat.\nIf you have difficulty controlling your feelings of worry, you may also notice an inability to prevent stress sweat. Unfortunately, excessive sweating may lead to embarrassment, causing more unwanted feelings of stress and shame.\nEmotional Symptoms of Anxiety\nThe emotional symptoms of anxiety are some of the more widely recognizable symptoms of the disorder. Most anxious individuals experience the symptoms below.\nStress and Worry\nFeelings of constant worry and stress are so synonymous with anxiety that some use these terms interchangeably. Although everyone experiences periods of stress in the course of their lives, those with anxiety disorders deal with it on a near-constant basis.\nAnxiety is often defined by persistent and excessive worry about even ordinary issues, which is often out of proportion to the actual circumstance.\nPanic and Panic Attacks\nPanic may be a symptom of anxiety in itself or may be experienced in the form of a panic attack. Feelings of panic are challenging to control and are often disproportionate to any present danger.\nCertain phobias or triggers can quickly induce panic or panic attacks – defined by sudden feelings of intense fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes – making it hard to prevent.\nDue to how unpleasant these feelings can be, many individuals will isolate themselves from the triggers that induce panic.\nNext page: The behavioral and cognitive symptoms of anxiety, and tips for coping with anxiety symptoms."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:47df471d-4379-4054-81c0-a8a341e0df73>","<urn:uuid:32e3591d-b2bf-43a1-85ae-9850472d34be>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What types of oil transfer pumps exist in the industry, and what are the key dangers when operating them near dump trucks at construction sites?","answer":"Three main types of oil transfer pumps exist: 1) Positive Displacement/Gear Pumps, which offer excellent suction characteristics and high-pressure output capability, 2) Centrifugal Pumps, which provide high flow rates at low costs but have limited suction capabilities, and 3) Submersible Turbine Pumps, which eliminate suction issues but have pressure limitations of 50 PSI. When operating these pumps near dump trucks at construction sites, key dangers include the risk of truck rollovers due to speed or road conditions, potential fires from burst oil hoses, tire explosions following contact with overhead power lines, and accidents during loading/unloading operations. Workers must establish and maintain awareness of the danger zone around trucks, which can vary from 5-50 feet depending on the cargo and loading method.","context":["Bulk diesel and fuel oil transfer pumps uses, features, types, advantages & disadvantages\nBulk fuel transfer pump is a very general term, and covers any application where fuels, oils and diesel are handled, The typical use of the fuel oil pump includes the bulk transfer of the fuel from one receptacle to another, whether this is a drum, IBC or storage tank, They can be used to directly fuel the vehicle, machine or generator and may be part of a larger fuel oil transfer pump system or skid, complete with hose reel, valves and meters.\nFuel transfer pumps\nFuel Pumps can move fuel, such as diesel, petrol or another type of fuel, from one place to another, from one storage container into another or, more frequently, from a storage container into a vehicle via the dispensing nozzle, Many fuel transfer pumps are either mains or battery powered, for larger or heavily used refueling stations, but hand pumps are available and can be a good solution for certain types of use.\nManual, or hand fuel transfer pumps have two great benefits over powered pumps, they are cheaper to purchase and run, they can be highly cost-effective when dispensing or transferring small amounts of fuel from one container to another or, dispensing fuel from a drum when there is not huge quantity to be moved, they don’t require any power, They can be used anywhere without worrying about a power source or whether batteries are charged.\nFuel transfer pumps require the utilization of the suction pipe that is cut off close to the base of the tank and screws into the pump bay on the base of the pump, They normally incorporate a 3/4″ or 1″ release hose, A large portion of these convenient fuel exchange pumps give flowrates of 10 to 30 GPM, They are the best when it comes to transporting fuel from one compartment to an alternate holder.\nThey can be utilized to transfer diesel fuel or gasoline in quite a range of machinery ranging from cars, planes, trucks, horticultural ranch apparatus to bulldozers, They are designed for use with non-flammable fluids including antifreeze, hydraulic fluid, non-flammable oil-based solvents and oil-based herbicide carriers.\nFuel transfer pump can exchange exact measures of fluid starting with one holder then onto the next, Some fuel transfer pumps are powered by DC and use siphoning principle, It works by utilizing vacuum weight and hydrostatic weight, it simply implies that a fluid can be exchanged to a holder which is lower than the compartment holding it, DC fuel transfer pump saves you the agony of worrying over the area and weight of fuel you wish to transport.\nTypes of oil transfer pumps\nThere are 3 types of oil transfer pumps which are Positive Displacement / Gear Pumps, Centrifugal Pumps and Submersible Turbine Pumps.\nPositive Displacement / Gear Pumps\nGear pumps can transfer fuel from bulk tanks to generator, filtration polishing systems, generator tank return flow pumps, boiler feed pumps, Common Brands are Viking, Blackmer, and Tuthill, Gear pumps have excellent suction characteristics up to about 20 vertical feet, high-pressure output capability to several hundred PSI, very low to high flow capacities from 0.25 to several hundred GPM, relatively constant output through range of pressures, Positive displacement pumps are available in full range of voltages and horsepower.\nSuction piping characteristics can make starting and keeping prime a problem, Higher flow rate pumps can be higher in cost, Noise and vibration can be higher than alternatives, Most Common issues such as loss of prime in suction piping, Overpressure of discharge piping if improper setting of the pressure regulating valves, Debris in pump head if improper strainer.\nCentrifugal Pumps transfer to and from delivery vehicles to bulk tanks with flooded suction condition, Common Brands are Gorman Rupp and Gould, Centrifugal Pumps offer high flow rates at relatively low costs, but there are some limitations such as limited suction capabilities, Capacity decreases at higher pressures, and the most common problem is difficulty in self-prime.\nSubmersible Turbine Pumps\nSubmersible Turbine Pumps can be used to transfer fuel from underground or aboveground tanks to generator day tanks and boiler feed at limited pressure, Common Brands are Red Jacket and FE Petro, there are no suction or priming issues, there are relatively high flow rates & relatively low costs.\nThere are some limitations such as pressure limitation of 50 PSI, It is not available as 120 VAC, It is not available for low flow applications, It is not applicable for shallow tanks such as generator base tanks, Headroom required above tank for installation in buildings, The most common problems are excessive flow rate, Siphon through pump if missing or incorrect anti-siphon.\nTypes of manual fuel transfer pumps\nManual pumps come in many different mechanisms, the most common are rotary and semi-rotary hand pumps, they work in a very similar way, by turning a handle to move the fuel, Both tend to be very rugged and hard-wearing, the semi-rotary design, which has a simple straight handle, while the rotary handle is mounted at 90 degrees to a crank-shaft, making it slightly easier to turn rapidly.\nAnother option for manually moving fuel is diaphragm pumps, which could be hand or foot operated, They benefit from being very light and easy to transport and set up, they are very cost-effective, They tend to be reliable and hard-wearing, although the diaphragm can occasionally require replacement.\nLevel barrel pumps, whether made of metal or plastic, are another simple and extremely cost-effective solution for mounting to the top of barrels and work by simply raising and lowering a handle, They are suitable for a range of low-viscosity fluids including petrol, and require very little maintenance.\nThe siphon pump can transfer fuel from any higher container to a lower one using only gravity, the user can prime it by pumping a bit of fuel through first by hand, The kind of pump that is best for you depends on a number of factors such as the type of liquid you will be transferring, and the containers you will be transferring from and to.\nType of fluid\nDifferent hand pumps will be suitable for different types of fluids, such as diesel, petrol, oil or water, some plastics may be degraded by petrol but can be safely used by water, or it may be down to the viscosity of the fluid, Even within a particular category, different models may be more suitable for a certain liquid so it is always important to check before you purchase, Others may be suitable for a wide range of fuels, so can be more flexible options.\nType of container\nThere are types of small containers used with manual pumps, you can use a manual pump with a different type of container, Rotary and semi-rotary pumps, for example, can be placed on almost any kind of container.","Worksite Truck Safety.

{"question":"How do animation tools and viral polymerase inhibitors serve as research tools - what's their role in scientific studies?","answer":"Animation tools and viral polymerase inhibitors both serve as important research tools but in different domains. Animation, specifically animated narrative vignette simulations, is used to study empathy in teachers and provides a way to test responses without subjects knowing what researchers are looking for. In one study, it helped reveal that only 10% of teachers-in-training showed high empathy levels. Meanwhile, viral polymerase inhibitors, particularly HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitors, serve as research tools for studying viral infections, with researchers using them to understand drug resistance mutations and antiviral activity profiles. These compounds have led to the development of classification models that help predict inhibitor effectiveness with up to 88.24% accuracy.","context":["Animation can be outlet for victimized children, a tool for research\nChampaign, Ill. -- Animation is a proven vehicle for biting comedy, a la \"The Simpsons\" and \"South Park.\"\nBut some of the same qualities that make it work for comedy make it valuable, too, as an outlet for victimized children and for a new research method that tests the empathy of teachers who may deal with them, says Sharon Tettegah, a professor of curriculum and instruction at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\nTettegah believes so strongly in the value of animation – specifically \"animated narrative vignette simulations\" – that she sought out a computer science professor at Illinois, Brian Bailey, to help develop her concept for a child-friendly program for producing them.\nThe program that resulted, called Clover, gives children, as well as adults, a tool for making and sharing their own vignettes about their personal and sometimes painful stories.\nAccording to Tettegah, the program is the only one she is aware of that allows the user to write the narrative, script the dialogue, storyboard the graphics and add voice and animation, all within one application. Those four major aspects of producing a vignette gave rise to the name \"Clover,\" the plant considered to bring good luck in its four-leaf form.\nA paper about Clover, written by Bailey, Tettegah and graduate student Terry Bradley, has been published in the July issue of the journal Interacting With Computers.\nIn other research, Tettegah has used animations as a tool for gauging the empathy of teachers and others who might deal with children and their stories of victimization. One study with college education majors, or teachers-in-training, showed only one in 10 expressing a high degree of empathy for the victim, she said.\nA paper about that study has been accepted by the journal Contemporary Educational Psychology (CEP), with publication slated for later this year. The co-author of the study is Carolyn Anderson, a professor of educational psychology at Illinois.\nTettegah has done additional empathy studies with hundreds of participants, and will present some of that research at the Association for Computing Machinery's (ACM) SIGGRAPH conference July 30-Aug. 3 in Boston and at the American Psychological Association convention Aug. 10-13 in New Orleans.\nAnimations are valuable in this kind of research because they go beyond just text in visually telling a story, yet don't have the distractions of video, Tettegah said. \"Think about when you watch a cartoon: You focus more on what they're saying and not on how they look,\" she said.\nPsychological research surveys often elicit \"socially desirable\" or \"forced choice\" responses, Tettegah said. An animation, however, can tell a story and then ask for an open-ended response, she said. The subject has little or no clue what the researcher is looking for.\nIn her empathy studies, Tettegah has found that most of the subjects tend to focus on the perpetrator or other issues, rather than showing concern for the victim.\nThis is a concern, she said, because a child being bullied or called names wants the teacher's support. Yet the results also fit with research by others showing that teachers often don't deal with the problem when these incidents occur, the assumption having been that they don't know how, she said.\nIn the study to be published in CEP, each of the 178 subjects (142 women and 36 men), were shown a short animated vignette, based on a story collected by Tettegah in earlier research, involving a boy and girl, both 9 years old.\nIn the vignette, the children are asked to work together on a class project, and the boy tells the girl he doesn't want to work with her because her skin color might rub off on him. (Two different versions were used, with the boy being black and the girl white in one version, and vice versa in the other version. The races of the perpetrator and victim had no significant effect on subject responses to the vignette, Tettegah said.)\nAs the story progresses, the girl tells her father about the incident, and he then talks to the teacher.\nAfter viewing the vignette, each subject was asked an open-ended question about how he or she would have responded as the teacher in the situation. They were given unlimited time and space to respond.\nTettegah and four research assistants then did a line-by-line analysis of the subjects' responses and developed a system for coding the content. They looked for content in four areas related to empathy for the victim: concern for the victim, problem-solving with the victim, mention of the victim and management of the situation with the victim.\nAfter the coding, Anderson, a statistical expert, analyzed the resulting data using sophisticated techniques involving latent variable modeling. The results suggested a single latent variable underlying the responses, showing very few of the pre-service teachers expressing significant empathy for the victim in the vignette.\nOverall, fewer than 50 percent of the study participants exhibited even low levels of empathy and only 10 percent exhibited a high level of empathy.\nIn light of these results, Tettegah, a former elementary teacher, thinks some kind of empathy-awareness training, similar to cultural or ethnic awareness training, should be considered as part of training future teachers.\n\"I think that we are not, as teachers, tapped into those moral emotions … it's not a deliberate thing – you just don't even think about it,\" Tettegah said. \"But we need to be more aware of our victims and what happens to them, because they sometimes get damaged for life.\"\nClover was designed with that concern also in mind, Tettegah said. The program gives students a powerful means for telling their stories, whether of victimization or dealing with other moral or social dilemmas, she said. Ideally, their animated vignettes can be shared anonymously and used in character-building exercises in the classroom.\nThe program \"really engages students and excites them,\" Tettegah said. In producing the vignettes, they gain a strong sense of ownership, she said, and at the same time build their writing, critical thinking and technology skills.\nTettegah has been demonstrating and testing Clover in local schools since last fall, and with positive results, she said.\nThe program is available for download at http://www.icctp.net/interact.php.\nLast reviewed: By John M.

Solution and solid phase analog synthesis focused on the northern region of the template combined with structure based design led to the discovery of several potent and orally bioavailable lead compounds.\nChapter: Viral RNA Polymerase Inhibitors[Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Infections by RNA viruses continue to exist as significant public health problems worldwide. In response to the urgent need for safer and more efficacious treatment options against infections caused by RNA viruses, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have devoted significant efforts over the last two decades to discovering and developing new antiviral agents. As the primary viral enzyme responsible for genome replication and transcription, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) emerged early and remained as one of the most promising targets for therapeutic intervention of RNA virus infections. Advances in both basic research and drug discovery technology have resulted in the identification of a significant number of nucleoside (NIs) and non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) of viral RdRps. In this chapter, we will focus our attention on various classes of viral RdRp inhibitors, with main emphases on those of hepatitis C virus (HCV) due to its significant unmet medical need. Recent progress in understanding their mechanism of action, antiviral activity profiles, and emergence of drug resistance mutations will be discussed.12/2008: pages 527-548;\n- [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Hepatitis C is a viral liver infection considered as the major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) possesses a single positive strand RNA genome encoding a polyprotein composed of approximatively 3000 amino acids. The polyprotein is cleaved at multiple sites by cellular and viral proteases to liberate structural and nonstructural (NS) proteins. NS5B, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which catalyzes the HCV RNA replication has emerged as an attractive target for the development of specifically targeted antiviral therapy for HCV (DAA, for direct-acting antivirals). In the last 10 years, a growing number of non-nucleoside compounds have been reported as RdRp inhibitors and few are undergoing clinical trials. Over the past 5 years, several reviews were published all describing potentially active molecules. To the best of our knowledge, only one review covers the structure-activity relationships.(1) In this review, we will discuss the reported non-nucleoside molecules acting as RdRp inhibitors according to their chemical class especially focusing on structure-activity relationship aspects among each class of compounds. Thereafter, we will attempt to address the global structural requirements needed for the design of specific inhibitors of RdRp.Medicinal Research Reviews 09/2013; 33(5):934-984. · 9.58 Impact Factor\n- [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Using a support vector machine (SVM), three classification models were built to predict whether a compound is an active or weakly active inhibitor based on a dataset of 386 hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase NNIs (non-nucleoside analogue inhibitors) fitting into the pocket of the NNI III binding site. For each molecule, global descriptors, 2D and 3D property autocorrelation descriptors were calculated from the program ADRIANA.Code. Three models were developed with the combination of different types of descriptors.

{"question":"How do Great Lakes fisheries support biodiversity, and what environmental threats are researchers worried about?","answer":"The Great Lakes support at least 179 fish species that contribute to biodiversity and healthy ecosystems, with several ecological issues like water quality and invasive species remaining relevant. According to researchers, climate change is emerging as a critical threat to this biodiversity, with changes occurring at an unprecedented rate that doesn't allow animals enough time to adapt. The situation is further complicated by the need to study not just individual species but their inter- and intra-dependencies on other animals and the environment.","context":["Great Lakes Fisheries Heritage Trail: People, fish and fishing\nCelebrate and experience our Great Lakes fisheries heritage while traveling Michigan.\nFrom lighthouses to shipwrecks, Michigan is rich in maritime heritage tradition. Great Lakes fisheries – fish and people who fish – have significantly benefited coastal communities, the Great Lakes region and the nation throughout history and still today. Ecologically, economically and recreationally valuable, Great Lakes fisheries have supported people and communities for generations. Great Lakes fish and fishing – tribal, commercial, and recreational – have shaped the culture, economy, and quality of life for people in Michigan.\nA new Great Lakes Fisheries Heritage Trail offers opportunity to explore the past, present and future of the lakes through the lens of fish and fishing. Museum exhibits and educational opportunities, events and experiences along this trail highlight our fisheries heritage, ecology, management, and the economic and social issues that have defined Michigan’s coastal communities.\nValued Great Lakes fisheries:\nOf national significance, the Great Lakes encompass more than 11,000 miles of shoreline and contain about 20 percent of world’s surface freshwater. The lakes are home to a diversity of Great Lakes fish species valued for their food and recreational contributions, ecological and economic significance.\n- Food – close to 150 million pounds of Great Lakes fish were harvested annually at the turn of the twentieth century; these fish were consumed locally and also preserved by salt and ice to be shipped by boat, train and truck to help feed the growing populations across the country. Today, nearly 50 million pounds of fish are sustainably harvested for food.\n- Fun –1.8 million U.S. anglers enjoy fishing recreationally in Great Lakes waters today. With Michigan bordering four of the lakes, it comes as no surprise that fisheries contribute greatly to recreational tourism from coast to coast.\n- Economy – Great Lakes fisheries contribute $4 billion to $7 billion in economic value annually through fishing-related sales, commercial and charter fishing, community tournaments and coastal tourism.\n- Ecology – at least 179 species of fish contribute to biodiversity and healthy Great Lakes ecosystems; and many ecological issues of the past, from water quality to invasive species introductions, remain as relevant and important today.\nExplore the Great Lakes Fisheries Heritage Trail\nThe Great Lakes Fisheries Heritage Trail network represents a partnership among museum, maritime heritage, and fisheries partners cooperating across Michigan to promote our fisheries heritage. The collective efforts of these partners is helping to preserve and interpret historical artifacts, enhancing local communities and heritage-based tourism, and offering educational opportunities focusing on Great Lakes literacy and stewardship.\nThe trail includes museums, coastal fishing communities, fish markets and processing facilities, events, research and science centers throughout Michigan. Visitors are offered unique opportunities to explore the dynamic social, technological and environmental changes that have shaped today’s fisheries. View an interactive map of Great Lakes Fisheries Heritage Trail sites online.\nWant to learn more about our Great Lakes fisheries heritage?

In the report, Strychar and his co-authors described the need to increase understanding of the impacts of climate change on ecosystems, water supplies, air quality, fire, disease transmission and species survival.\nOne of the many conclusions reached by the researchers was the need to develop technology that allows real-time monitoring and management of water systems.\n“Climate change has occurred in the past, but this time, the frequency of change is too fast, not allowing animals enough time to adapt,” Strychar said. “Further complicating this issue is that we need not only study individual animals but their inter- and intra-dependencies on other animals and on the environment.\n“Ignoring the problem is no longer a solution. Denying the plausibility of climate change is foolhardy. We need to accept the problem and now, find solutions — or at least minimize its impact on society and our planet as a whole.”\nThe full report focuses on six “grand challenges” that are facing the U.S. in the areas of climate change, water, sustainability, agriculture, energy and education.\nRead more about Strychar’s research here: http://www.gvsu.edu/strychak/\nNate Hoekstra | Eurek Alert!\nSafeguarding sustainability through forest certification mapping\n27.06.2017 | International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)\nDune ecosystem modelling\n26.06.2017 | Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg im Breisgau\nStrong light-matter coupling in these semiconducting tubes may hold the key to electrically pumped lasers\nLight-matter quasi-particles can be generated electrically in semiconducting carbon nanotubes.

{"question":"What similarities exist between the acoustic requirements of a piccolo performance and a modern school classroom in terms of sound quality?","answer":"Both piccolo performances and modern school classrooms require careful attention to acoustics, but in different ways. For piccolo performance, the focus is on sound transmission and tonal quality, with acoustic bridges helping improve sound brightness by shifting the spectral centroid to higher frequencies. For school classrooms, specific soundproofing requirements include protection against airborne noise (Rw ≥ 63 dB between classrooms and corridors) and a reverberation time of around 0.5 seconds to ensure perfect speech intelligibility and high-quality learning environment.","context":["This independent research was conducted by: the Department of Applied Physics and the Centre for Physical Technology: Acoustics, Materials and Astrophysics from the Polytechnic University of Valencia, (Spain) in cooperation with the Professional Music Conservatory of Valencia, (Spain).\nLefreque BV did not commission nor fund the research.Spectral analysis of the behaviour of an acoustic bridge applied to a piccolo\nS. Castiñeira-Ibáñez¹, C. Rubio², J.V. Sánchez-Pérez², R. Pérez Hernández³\n- Department of Applied Physics, Polytechnic University of Valencia, Valencia, (Spain)\n- Centre for Physical Technology: Acoustics, Materials and Astrophysics, Polytechnic University of Valencia, Valencia, (Spain)\n- Professional Music Conservatory of Valencia, Valencia (Spain)\nIt is a well-known fact that professional musicians do not let up on their effort towards improving the aural quality of the instrument that they play. In addition to this, they strive towards making musical performance as simple as possible. The aural vibration that is produced by the embouchure of the piccolo does not just travel through the inside of the body, through the air, but it also transmits via the cylindrical-conic structure, made of metal or wood, that the instrument consists of. The parts that form the piccolo join together and produce interruptions on the path followed by the vibration. An acoustic bridge situated in these linkages would make the vibration transmit itself in a different way, contributing towards a change in the overall sound.\nIn this work, the acoustic spectrum produced by a piccolo with and without an acoustic bridge is analysed. Several notes belonging to different ranges have been analysed and the reason for the improvement in sound quality that use of the acoustic bridge produces has been physically tested.\nKeywords: Piccolo, piccolo flute, acoustic bridge, tone, sonority.\nA piccolo flute (piccolo), in particular, a piccolo flute from the \"Boehm flutes\" family, has two parts: the upper part or head, with a hole where the mouth of the player is located, also called the embouchure, that has a sealing cap with an adjustable seal on its free front end; the other part, called the body, has a series of holes for the fingers and key mechanisms (Figure 1).Figure 1\nPiccolo. This shows the upper part of the opening (embouchure), the joint between the head and the body, and the body with keys that cover over the holes.\nThe head of the piccolo is of a cylindrical shape, whilst the body has a conical shape. On the joint of the head and the body where the vibration transmits across the structure, a certain mismatch can be observed. As with electricity, where a short circuit allows for the electrical current to pass through it, that is to say, it provides an easy path for electrons, an acoustic bridge, when applied to the acoustics of instruments, is a device that when placed at the joint of two parts of an instrument, allows the vibration to pass through from one part to another. In Figure 2 we can see the shape of an acoustic bridge .Figure 2\nFrom left to right: A lefreQue acoustic bridge , a detail of the position of the acoustic bridge and a general view of the piccolo with the acoustic bridge situated on the joint of the head and body.\nThe tone of a sound is the subjective characteristic that makes it possible for the ear to distinguish between two sounds, of the same fundamental frequency and intensity, emitted by sources of a different nature . Thus, for example, our ear is capable of distinguishing a La2\nemitted by a flute from a La2\nemitted by an oboe. As such, when instruments emit two sounds of the same frequency and intensity at the same time, the notes emitted from each of them can be distinguished perfectly. The sound emitted by an instrument is not a pure tone but rather it is a composition of several frequencies with one of them being fundamental and the rest multiples of that frequency, known as overtones. Hence, the explanation of the meaning of the tone lies in the group of overtones or frequencies that accompany the fundamental frequency.\nIn the stationary state of a sound, the tone depends on the distribution of the frequency’s sound power, in other words, on how the sound power is distributed between the fundamental mode and its overtones. For a power spectrum with components Pi fi\n), the spectral centroid fc\nis a frequency that is defined as follows:\nThe definition has a similarity to that of the centre of mass. Many investigators maintain that the tonal quality or brightness is correlated with the increase in power of high frequencies. The hypothesis is that the brightness of tones is simply correlated with the fc\nparameter  .\n2 Methodology & Results\nAchieving the results of experiments, as much in the open field as in controlled conditions, is a powerful source of validation for theoretical models. However, the growing interest the study of acoustic waves has brought about the need to achieve experimental measures in complicated conditions. The experimental set-up used to carry out experimental measures used in this work have been carried out in controlled conditions, in an anechoic chamber belonging to the Centre for Physical Technology at the Polytechnic University of Valencia.\nAn anechoic chamber is a room designed to absorb the sound that strikes its walls, floor and ceiling, cancelling out the sound’s effects of echo and reverberation. It should also be isolated from outside, thus cancelling out possible noise from sources outside the chamber that could distort results. This all allows for a simulation of the acoustic conditions in the open field. The size of items and the range of frequencies that can be analysed depend on the dimensions of the chamber. In our case, the chamber that we are using measures de 8 x 6 x 3 cubic metres.\nFigure 3 shows the layout of the chamber and the availability of the different elements used to carry out the procedures. The microphone is connected to an analyser where the time signal is recorded and then afterwards, the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) is carried out. This analyser is connected to a computer (PC) where results are shown. In addition, there a robotised, three-dimensional system used, for microphone positioning and the movement of the sample (3 DReAMS), synchronised with the data acquisition system.Figure 3\nFrom left to right: Experimental set-up used for the procedures. Relative position of the piccolo to microphone at the time of the procedure. Musician: D. R. Pérez Hernández.\nTo acquire the data, the PCI-4474 card by National Instruments was used. This card allows for dynamic acquisition of data through 4 channels simultaneously. It is designed equally for the analysis of airborne sound signals as those from vibrations, achieving low distortion and low background noise.\nNational Instruments cards PCI-4474 and PCI-7334 are used in conjunction with two LabVIEW packages for the acquisition of data and robot movement control, respectively. When the microphone is in position for the procedure, the engines that move the robot’s axes are turned off to prevent possible distortions and linkage with the acoustic procedures. Then, the sound source and the microphones are activated, with the latter of these acquiring the time signature. The hardware analysis of this, through an FFT analyser, allows for spectra, frequency response and sound levels to be achieved. The time that passes between when the source starts and the user indicates the procedure is to begin, varying in accordance with the characteristics of the test.\nType 1/2\" 4189 B & K pre-polarised microphones were used with a sensitivity of 49.5 mV/Pa, which allow the analysis of a wide range of frequencies.\nThe procedures were carried out first without an acoustic bridge and then with a lefreQue silver acoustic bridge . Three notes were used for the analysis, one for each range: La\nfrom the low range, La\nfrom the middle range and Re\nfrom the high range of the piccolo. In the three cases, the results were comparable. For example, in figure 4 the spectrum of sound pressure level is represented, with and without the acoustic bridge, for the La\nnote of the middle range of the piccolo. In the figure, we can observe the displacement of the overtones towards high frequencies when the silver bridge is used, which brings about a change of tone in the sound. The arrows indicate the position of the central frequencies as much of the fundamental as the overtones. Only the band of frequencies going from 0 to 5000 Hz was taken into account. For the case of the La\nnote of the middle range without the bridge, the centroid is located at fc=2624.2 Hz, whilst for the same note but with the silver acoustic bridge, the centroid is located at fc=2672.2 Hz. The tonal quality or brightness of the sound has improved due to the change in position of the spectral centroid, fc, towards high frequencies, as predicted by the theory.\nThe sensations that the instrumentalist said had been noted when he used the acoustic bridge can be summed up as being an improvement in sound quality, with more brightness and greater ease of staying in tune. These improvements are not unfounded since we have seen that physically it is proven that the availability of the acoustic bridge on the piccolo has made the harmonic spectrum change. This change is towards higher frequencies, displacing the spectral centroid and, as such, improving sound quality.\n lefreQue, www.lefreque.com [the original document shows ‘legregue.com’ - an error].\n Llinares J. et al.

In addition, the school should set a positive example in terms of ecology and sustainability.\n1. Details of the task 2008\nThe school should fit to its surrounding natural and cultural environment while the choice of location is completely unrestricted. Emphasis should be placed on feasibility, which in turn requires structurally effective and cost-efficient solutions.\nThe school's outside space could also be designed in an environmentally friendly way, including for example some pedagogical elements such as a bio-garden, biotope, playground, etc.\nThe premises can be chosen freely and must be represented on a plan of the site. For the purpose of better illustration, the premises or the surrounding natural and cultural environment can be photographed (the construction site does not need to be real in the legal sense).\nWithin the scope of the project, participants are free to design and propose all facilities of modern learning such as experimental laboratories, exhibition and performance rooms, a sports hall, a library, internet and communications room, etc. These facilities can be designed separately or combined depending on the individual concept.\nFurthermore, safety aspects, e.g. fire protection and escape routes as well as practical issues such as a canteen, a cloakroom and access for handicapped people should also be taken into consideration.\nIn addition, the social and ecological benefits offered by the school can be further used as an evening school for adults and as a cultural meeting point for the neighborhood.\n2. Type of construction, technical parameters:\nBasically, the construction method (static system, wood, mineral or steel construction) can be chosen freely - ISOVER products shall be preferred.\nThe school should be designed by using the passive house construction method. In order to achieve the passive house standard, on the one hand there should be installed high-performance thermal insulation. On the other hand the principles of energy-optimized buildings should be taken into consideration.\nTechnical parameters for heat insulation:\nThe exterior structural components should have the following U-values:\nU-value for all opaque external structural components U ≤ 0.15 W/ (m2K)\nU-value for windows and doors U Wtotal ≤ 0.8 W/ (m2K)\nIn the case of very small volumes or a poor surface-to-volume ratio, the opaque structural components should have an U-value of up to 0.1 W/ (m2K).\nProtection against overheating in summer:\nThe planning should include sufficient external protection from the sun for the east-, south-and west-facing windows.\nTechnical parameters for fire protection:\nFire protection requirements for structural components: The fire protection should meet the respective national standards.\nTechnical parameters for soundproofing:\nLearning with all your senses requires excellent sound insulation and room acoustics to ensure perfect speech intelligibility. Reverberation time should therefore be around 0.5 seconds.\nIn order to assure a high quality of the learning environment the following soundproofing protection should be taken into consideration:\nExterior walls and roof - protection against airborne noise: Rw ≥ 55 dB\nProtection against airborne noise between classrooms and corridors etc: Rw ≥ 63 dB\nFootfall soundproofing for ceilings: Lnt,w ≤ 40 dB\nIn practice, sufficient soundproofing for windows and doors as well as for sanitary installations and ventilation systems should be fulfilled.\nThe most important factor for speech intelligibility is an excellent room acoustic. Therefore, reverberation time should be around 0.5 seconds\n3. Competition requirements\nThe following minimum requirements should be observed:\nPlan of site 1:200 or 1:500, according to requirements\nFloor plan and cross-section 1:100\nIsometric representation or perspective of the building(s), or model photos\nHorizontal facade cross-section 1:10\nVertical facade cross-section 1:10\nView of the south facade 1:10\nConstruction details 1:5\nList of extensions with U-values\nDesign report - description of the design concept\nDescription of construction\nIn addition, the following may also be submitted:\nDescription of the process of construction or assembly, with particular emphasis on the air tightness of the building\nRepresentation of the possibilities for coupling or terracing of buildings - designing a compact development structure\nAdditional ecological installations, e.g. active use of solar energy, etc.\nUse of rainwater for watering gardens and toilet flushing\nFormalities for the submission:\nFor the competition's national stage projects should be submitted in any poster format (e.g. 79 x 120 cm). At the international stage of the competition, the projects will be presented on roll-ups. To fit perfectly, the roll-up presentation's maximum size should be 79 x 205 cm. In addition the projects are needed in a digital form for printing a brochure.\n4. Assessment criteria\nThe general assessment criteria are:\n70 % architectural design:\nStructural arrangement, development of the property and creation of a perfect learning environment, usefulness of the floor plans, the attention paid to the surrounding natural and cultural environment.\n30 % technical understanding and implementation of the MULTICOMFORT HOUSE Concept:\nBasic suitability of the Passive House Concept, the constructional knowledge and compliance including technical parameters as well as feasible and cost-effective realization."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cd3840a0-4e71-4581-a390-9336dd0c45f2>","<urn:uuid:a7c4b415-ec27-4763-8c57-7da698b59533>"],"error":null}

It's worth mentioning that as with many other camps, there's a group discount that might be of interest.\n2. 選課 / Class Selection\n哪種舞 / What Kind of Dance\n每個 camp 所提供的課程都不一樣，通常 lindy hop 或 balboa 是最常見的（有許多 camp 只提供一種舞，比方純 bal 的 Berlin Balboa Weekend）。Rock that Swing 有提供：Boogie Woogie, Balboa, Lindy Hop, 還有 Solo Jazz。除此之外，Rock that Swing 每天都有一拖拉庫的 \"Taster\" 課程，提供學生在最後一節課自由嘗試其他的 style，比方 Shag 或是 Blues。Rock that Swing 每天有四堂課，從 11 點到下午 5 點。聽起來以能不多 - 但是每天搞下來真的大腦要塞爆了。\n哪個等級 / What Kind of Level\n每個 swing camp 所定義的等級都不同，所以選課之前最好去網站查看一下自己比較適合哪種 level。在多數的 camp, 超過某個 level 就需要先通過甄選 (audition)，所以最好注意 audition 的時間是什麼時候以確保你已經抵達並起可以參加～\nRock that Swing 比較特殊的地方是不限定你只能參加你所註冊的課程。比方我註冊的是初學者 Lindy Hop, 我也可以臨時決定去參加中級 Balboa。除了需要甄選的課程以及需要固定舞伴的課程（所以拋接的課都需要固定舞伴），都開放學生自由挑選，所以彈性很大！壞處則是人數不一定會湊 lead 跟 follow 完全平衡，而且你上一堂課暗戀的帥哥下一堂課可能就不知道上那去了（哭哭）。\nThere were many types of classes on offer: boogie woogie, balboa, lindy hop, solo jazz, and tasters including shag and blues and what have yous. Classes ran from 11 to 5 pm which may not sound like a lot but was enough to almost kill me. As with other camps, you join the level which you think you are fit for, except for the topmost level which requires an advance audition. What's special about Rock that Swing though is that you don't NEED to stay in the track/level you have preselected. Other than audition/partner-required classes, students can move freely between tracks and levels. This is great for flexibility but takes away a little from bonding with your fellow classmates. A few handsome young men from one of my first classes were nowhere to be found on my second day...\n上完課之後晚上的 party 永遠是重頭戲！Rock that Swing 的 party 非常的壯觀，最盛大的兩個晚上是在慕尼黑的大戲院舉辦（容納量 1,600 個人，雖然我們沒有塞進那麼多，但是還是滿擠的）。在小一點的 camp，晚上的 party 通常是一個舞池，可能頂多 2 個樂團，但是 Rock that Swing 有兩個大舞池，一個中型舞池，兩個小舞池，而且每個晚上都有 2-3 個樂團以及 3-4 個不同的 DJ。因為場地大，所以買跳舞票需要選座位，而座位離舞池越近，價格就越高。我建議可以買最便宜的，因為坐位可以只拿來放外套包包就好，整晚就在舞池上度過吧 ～ 另外，因為活動規模大所以舞者的程度幾乎是破錶的高。值得一提的是：主辦單位有特別請求舞者們以正式穿著出場，所以整晚上我光是看俊男美女的行頭就快要忙死了 XD 哎，有穿的美美的時候整個活動的氣氛真的有差！\nParties at Rock that Swing were quite impressive. The main events were held on Saturday and Sunday nights at the Deutsches Theater, a gigantic venue with a capacity of 1,600 (I don't think we filled it - people dancing take up more room than people sitting). Because of the size of the event, tickets came with assigned seating which got more expensive as one nears the dance floor. I don't think it matters where you choose to sit if the seat is only for stacking coats and bags. I sat on the top most floor in the nosebleed section but only went to my seat at the beginning and end of the event.\nThe best part by far about Rock that Swing was the variety: 2 main ballrooms with constant live music (I think 11 bands in total for the whole camp), a medium sized dance floor with 3-4 DJs, the foyer for blues, and also another small room for just boogie woogie which I failed to even locate. If anything, I would consider just coming for the socials because they are such wonderful productions. The level of social dancing was also quite high (I think), which is always a plus. Also, the organizers specifically request that dancers dress up for these balls and it really was a parade of drop-dead gorgeous vintage fashion on both guys and girls...\n通常 swing camp 晚上的 party 也是老師們大顯身手的表演時間，Rock that Swing 邀請了 50 多位國際水準的 swing 老師所以場面很壯觀... 但是不想看表演只想跳舞的話，所以次要的 ballroom 都還是有舞伴有音樂，所以不一定要去擠破頭的看現場演出 ^^\nOf course evening parties are where instructors strut their stuff. At Rock that Swing there were over 50 international swing instructors so the performances were something to behold. But if watching performances is not your thing, music and dancing continues in all but the main ballroom so you can easily just carry on dancing.\n4. 其他零星 / Others\n以一個這麼大規模的活動來說 Rock that Swing 真的規劃得很一板一眼，每個小小的細節都進行得很順暢～ 我因為睡晚了所以第一天參加活動去報名的時候看到了大排長龍以為一定會等很久，但是工作人員很多而且很熟練，所以一下下就搞定了 ^^ 另外，在活動辦公室附近整天都有各種 vintage 攤位，買衣服，舞鞋，飾品等等，真是太體貼舞者了 XDDD\nFor such a large festival, Rock that Swing was run like a well oiled machine. I was late to check-in on my first day at the camp and worried that the long line would make me late for class. But there were many volunteers working alongside each other and everything was extremely efficient and friendly. Also the extensive vintage market with clothing, shoes, accessories and such provided enough of a distraction to make me late for much better reasons. I wish I had gotten more photos but I was too shy to keep taking photos of people's merchandise!\n總結 / Finally\n如果想來歐洲參加 swing camp 的話，Rock that Swing 是個不錯的選擇。但是需要注意的是因為規模大而且慕尼黑本身消費不低，所以價格也不便宜～ 另外，每個人所喜歡的氣氛不同，在 Rock that Swing 這種大雜燴比較難像在小規模的 dance camp 一樣更深度的跟少數投機的舞者互動（因為共舞一次之後你可能就再也找不到他/她了），所以挑選 camp 真的要考慮自己的需求與偏好是什麼 ^^\nI enjoyed my time at Rock that Swing and would definitely attend again, circumstances permitting. But the scale of the event as well as the fact that Munich is not the cheapest city in the world means that the cost is also quite substantial. Also, everyone prefers different environments. Rock that Swing is a little less personal than small weekend events where I had more of a chance to get to know a few like-minded dancers more in-depth. At Rock that Swing I found it much harder to FIND anyone specific - so that kind of bonding didn't happen. However, I also danced with a much larger number of different people - so it just depends on what one is looking for in an event!\n自從大學時代開始跳 swing 就常常需要解釋 swing 是什麼玩意，而 swing 好玩的地方真的不是個三言兩語就可以交代清楚的事。以下借用了 Toe Tappin' Swing 所做的圖解翻譯成中文跟大家推銷我個人最投入的嗜好～ 希望你也會來參加！\nLindy Hop - 從古至今\n看完了懶人包的介紹應該參考一下古今的 swing 影片，以下是一些我自己喜歡的 ^^ 請注意： 1944 年 Swing Fever 中的年輕美女 Jean Veloz 今年 90 歲，還是在跳舞喔！最後一個影片是 Jean 在 2012 年的演出（當年 88 歲）。\n1.

Herräng Dance Camp, 瑞典，2012\n來加入 swing dance 的大家庭吧 ^^ 我們等著跟你共舞！\n這個週末從 Tübingen 到 München 參加 Rock that Swing，順便跟大家分享我有點龜毛的收拾行李三部曲。不是什麼前所未有的大發明啦，只是幫助我都能井井有條的整理而已 :)\nI'm in Munich this weekend for Rock that Swing and thought I'd share my three-step program for organized packing. Nothing revolutionary, but it works for me :)\n1. 清單：我都用同一份清單來檢查必需品都有帶，而且這個清單存在 google 月曆的 To Do List 上面，所以哪裡都能存取，而且可以用過再重用，也可以隨時修改 ^^ 公開一下給大家參考裡面的內容：\n1. The list: I use the same packing list to check-off essential items every time. The list is saved on the to do list function of google calendar so it's reusable and printable and accessible from anywhere. Here's the contents.\n其中：不怕一萬只怕萬一！帶著止痛藥真的很方便，不用在語言不通的藥房裡面摸索。至於毛巾、吹風機、衣架等就要看下榻的地方是不是有提供！如果是國外的 hostel, 這些東西最好是自己準備，因為大概不會有免費借用的噢。最後，如果有帶任何貴重物品的話，順手帶一個鎖頭比較安全，因為有些 hostel 一間房睡 6 個人，自己的貴重物品可以鎖起來。\nOf these: it's really a lot easier to bring painkillers JUST IN CASE, rather than fumble around in a pharmacy in a country where you don't speak the language. As for towels, hair dryers, hangers etc. - it all depends on where I'm staying. I find most hostels do not provide these amenities (at least, not free of charge). Lastly, I like to bring a padlock so I can lock up my valuables in a 6-person dorm room.\n2. 裝袋：我收拾行李的方法是把所有需要的東西都先攤出來點清，都齊全後就用布袋一個個裝起來（一袋是長褲，一袋是襯衫等等，最後再多帶一個空布袋用來裝髒衣服）。都裝好之後看起來好整齊 :D 與其去買現成的收納袋，我都是用免費贈送的購物袋裝... 比較省！\n2. Bag it: My packing method is to spread out everything I need and check them off on the list. Then I put them all into separate cloth bags (one for trousers, one for shirts, and always one extra for laundry). Everything looks very neat and tidy once they're all bagged. Rather than bags specifically for packing luggage, I just use any old cloth bags from grocery shopping.\n3. 裝箱：所有的東西都已經裝在布袋裡之後要放到行李箱或背包就很簡單了。常需要用的東西（手機錢包等）放在小小的斜肩包，social dance 的鞋子與必備放在手提包（去 social 就帶這個），剩下的都是背包（順便塞點餅乾）～ done!\n3. Pack it: It's easy to fit everything into my suitcase or rucksack once they're all individually bagged. Frequently used items like phone and wallet I keep in a small shoulder bag for easy access. My dancing shoes and other social dancing essentials I put into a small leather tote. Everything else is in the rucksack (extra packet of biscuits for the road).\nThat's me all ready to go. The hat is optional.\n自從搬回歐洲之後比較多機會參加 swing dance camp，想跟大家分享一下我去跳舞的時候一定會帶的 10 個配件。有些是為了保護自己，有些是為了體貼舞伴，有些則是經驗之談～ 希望對你有幫助 ^^\nSince I moved back to Europe I've had more opportunities to attend swing camps. These are just 10 items that I always bring to socials - sometimes for my own sake, sometimes for my partners', and some are just good things to have. Hope you find the suggestions helpful :)\n～前十名～ Top 10 ～\n1. 參加 swing camp 的時候會跟各地來的舞者跳舞，因此會接觸到很。多。的。細。菌。不管是上 workshop 也好還是 social dance 也好，我都會帶著酒精清潔液，隔一陣子就消毒一下手，不然跳舞跳到半夜，第二天早上又起來上課一整天，再加上開車坐飛機等等，抵抗力本來就下降，很可能一從 camp 回到家就感冒了（更慘的是在 camp 的時候感冒，沒人要跟你跳舞，嗚嗚嗚）。\nA a swing camp attendees dance with other attendees from absolutely everywhere. This means a ton of germs. Whether during workshops or social dances I bring hand sanitizer and sanitize every once in a little while. Otherwise dancing all night and workshops all day, combined with travel fatigue from driving or flying - all this adds up to compromised immune system and a cold as soon as you get home. Or worse, a cold AT THE CAMP, so no one will dance with you (sob).\nMints or gum - anything that freshens your breath. Surely this is self-explanatory?\n3. 跳舞跳得香汗淋漓的時候掏出手帕或是毛巾，體貼自己，體貼舞伴，體貼環境。不要用紙巾擦擦後揉成一團，又不環保又難看。Vintage 手帕設計多，有秀氣的刺繡的也有挺 man 的男性化設計，可以放口袋也可以放胸前裝飾，妙用無窮。如果是汗量很大的話不用客氣，直接帶幾條小毛巾吧。\nHandkerchiefs or a towel to wipe away your dancing sweat - good for you, your partner, and the environment. I sometimes see people using paper towels and then scrunch it up and throw it out. It's ugly and not environmentally friendly. Vintage hankies come in so many designs - pretty embroidered ones as well as masculine ones. You can put it your back pocket or put it in your breast pocket - it's decorative, stylish, and pragmatic. If you sweat a lot, nothing wrong with just using face towels.\nIf you have nice dancing shoes it's worth taking good care of them. Sweaty and warm leather shoes can warp and get mouldy if you don't let them air out. Shoe trees allow shoes to ventilate and keep their shape. The best are made of wood (naturally deodorizing), but when I travel I like to use metal or plastic ones as they are more light weight.\nIf you shove your feet into your shoes without a shoe horn every time, the back of your shoes won't last very long. A shoe horn fits in your palm and easily takes care of that problem. I've had my dancing shoes for 7 years and they are still serviceable, so I think it makes a difference.\nEven if you don't need to change socks during a social, I find it nice to change into some non-sweaty socks after I take my dance shoes off. Nicer to go home in.\nA little fan to fan yourself and your favourite leads/follows while you take a break. A good conversation starter and flirtation device too.\nAnything can happen to pretty dresses on the dance floor. A handful of safety pins is the difference between a quick trip to the bathroom for a fixer-upper and spending the rest of the night sitting down because dancing means exposing yourself to everyone else due to the tear in the hem of your skirt (don't laugh, it's happened to me!).\nDinner at 7 and dancing till 3. Venue possibly out in the middle of nowhere with not a shop in sight. A bar of dark chocolate to treat yourself and your friends is always a win.\n10. 跳舞的 venue 通常有 bar 但是不一定會有茶有咖啡。我自己喜歡帶熱茶，中場休息或是收攤回家的時候喝，非常幸福的感覺。\nVenues probably have a bar, but they don't always have tea or coffee. I like to bring a thermos of tea for a pick me up half way through or at the end of a dance.\n最後兩個給男生的 BONUS - Two Bonuses for the Guys\n知道自己跳起舞來就不停的流汗的話，就多帶幾件上衣吧！不一定要是襯衫，t-shirt 也 ok。重點是 follower 不用因為你滿身臭汗怕把手搭在你肩上。有些 leader 每次去跳舞都是 4-6 件上衣，寧願多換幾次也不要讓 followers 反感。\nIf you sweat a lot, bring a few extra shirts or t-shirts. Followers would be much less hesitant to put their arms on your shoulder. Some leads take 4-6 tops to a dance. It's better to change more often rather than put people off.\nAs above. Self-explanatory.\nFeel free to share if you have your own must-bring items for social dancing :)","The swing movement has seen several peaks through history. It was first introduced in the late 20s as another form of jazz. While jazz has a very distinctive style, swing incorporated more brass and heavy rhythm sections, usually manned by larger numbers of band members than traditional jazz. Artists such as Benny Goodman and Count Basie dominated the scene and brought swing music to the masses by the mid 40s.\nBy 1935 swing had become a worldwide phenomenon. Popular musicians were popping up in parts of Europe. British and American swing had dominated the charts, but German swing was also making a name. Unfortunately, the war aided in the decline of the music. Nazi officials created a campaign trying to squash the appeal of western music, going as far to create their own propaganda albums that degraded leaders of the western world and dropping them in by parachute.\nIn the late 40s pop music began to gain popularity and swingers had to move to a new form of music to keep enjoying the clubs. It was expensive to employ large bands to create the big band sound, and pop music required fewer players. A recording ban from 42-48 also hurt the industry.\nEven though swing music did start to decline, crooners started to make a way in to the scene. Musicians like Frank Sinatra kept some swing elements in their style as they rose to fame.\nThe 90s brought on a rise in the genre. Music from 40 years before started to make a comeback as artists started to incorporate the older styles in their new music. Groups like the Squirrel Nut Zippers and Cherry Poppin Daddies brought a new light to the old genre. By the end of the decade swing music once again dominated the charts, and swing clubs started to pop up all over the country.\nThe style of jazz popular after the turn of the century had a sophisticated feel to it. It was popular in night clubs and bars all over the US after beginning in New Orleans. In the mid to late 20s many artists started to experiment with different sounds, adding more brass instruments and faster beats. This new style required more people playing to pull off, and the name ‘big band swing’ was born. From here its popularity skyrocketed, making way for many notable artists to make history.\nBenny Goodman has always been associated with the early swing movement. Sing Sing Sing composed and performed by Benny Goodman is still widely acclaimed and played in clubs and movies everywhere. But he wasn’t the only noteworthy artist. Art Tatum, Count Basie, Buddy Rich, Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Glenn Miller, and many others made huge names for their selves, and still remain popular today.\nOnce swing music gained world wide popularity other artists wanted to incorporate this style in to their music. This led to the advent of Western swing- a style of country that used swing as its base. Western swing tends to focus more on vocals and fiddles, but also keeps with the same basic concept as jazz swing. Rockabilly became popular as a way to mix the new rock and roll style with swing. Elvis was one famous example of this. Gypsy swing features a dominate swing style minus the heavy brass and percussion. Guitars and bass created the backbone for gypsy swing. Even today swing music still has influences on modern artists.\nIn the beginning of the swinger music movement many unknown musicians were given an opportunity to make it pretty big. As the movement grew, the different types of swing music grew and expanded as well. Today swing still remains popular, and many artists still regularly release albums.\nWhen swing music started to hit its peak in the 30s and 40s, many musicians and groups gained worldwide notoriety. Art Tatum, Benny Goodman, Billie Holiday, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Glen Miller, and Ella Fitzgerald all enjoyed success in this genre. The list of noteworthy artists from this era is exhaustive, but a quick trip to a local music store or a browse through your favorite mp3 download program will yield hundreds of artists that still enjoy popularity.\nShortly after the rise of big band swing, the country music industry started to capitalize on this trend. Western swing features the same styling but with a stronger focus on harmonizing vocals and fiddles. Many western swing groups still used brass instruments, but it wasn’t in the forefront of the music. Groups such as the Texas Playboys, Milton Brown, and Spade Cooley all enjoyed success.\nMedia attention brought about a swing revival. Groups such as the Squirrel Nut Zippers, Brian Setzer, and Cherry Poppin Daddies helped to move swing in to the new century. By the late 90s a revival of swing music led way to new speak easy type bars and dance clubs that featured swing music nights. Even modern artists like Christina Aguilera incorporated swing successfully in to their style.\nWith the resurgence of the swing scene in the 90s, it was only a matter of time before someone created a musical based on that. Paul Kelly came up with the idea of Swing! and watched it come to life in 1999.\nSwing! takes classic music from the swing era from famous artists such as Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman, and forms a story around the music. Unlike other musicals, Swing! features no dialogue. The story is told through high energy dance and the music alone. While many people feared the show would fail, it ended up winning nominations for Tony Awards and other accolades from the musical community. It was nominated for Best Musical, Best Choreography, Best Orchestration, as well as many others.\nSwing! was premiered in December 1999 and ran through January 2001 on Broadway. Even after the show officially closes, many touring productions were able to capitalize on the success by taking the show on the road. It can still be found on the touring circuit if you visit the website devoted to the show. During the touring phase it could be found throughout the US as well as the UK.\nSoundtrack and DVDs\nIf you aren’t able to catch this show live, you can find the soundtrack to the show online or in many music retailers. The soundtrack features 40 tracks from some of the most influential swing artists of the original era. You can also find DVDs from the original Broadway production. This way you can bring the fun and excitement of the show to your living room.\nSwing music is a form of jazz that became popular in the early 30s. It features strong rhythms and brass instruments such as trombones and saxophones. The tempo is typically a faster pace, and doesn’t always have lyrics associated. Swing has been popular since its introduction, and has experienced several revivals over the decades.\nBy 1935 swing music was huge in the United States. By the 40s it was popular in England and Germany. Unfortunately, World War II introduced a decline in the popularity for several reasons. Many of the big band artists were called to fight overseas, the large orchestras known with swing were difficult to finance during the depression, and recording bans due to musician strikes helped to keep the music from hitting the streets.\nBy the beginning of 1949 the ban had ended and swing styles evolved in to new styles. Jump blues and bebop both became popular as a result of swing. The style could be seen crossing all genres of music, including country and rock by the early 50s.\nNew Age Swing\nIn the late 90s another resurgence of popularity occurred. Groups like Big Bad Voodoo Daddies, Squirrel Nut Zippers, and Cherry Poppin Daddies brought swing back to a new generation. Using lyrics that the youth could relate to, and the classic orchestra style swing, it was popping up on the radio and in dance clubs all over the world.\nIt hasn’t faded in to the background quite yet. Many newer musicians still incorporate swing elements in to their albums, and swing music clubs can still be found across the nation.\nIn the early 1900s jazz music began to make its way on the music scene. First being popular only in African American communities, it didn’t take long for everyone to take notice. Before the 20s came rolling in, jazz music could be heard in virtually every club in the states, and was making its way to other countries.\nIn the late 20s musicians were starting to add more players with the addition of large brass and woodwind ensembles. The beats were changed and more syncopation added. This new form of music was edgier, and easier to dance to. The name ‘big band’ was coined, and because the music made you ‘swing’, the name was born.\nThanks to swing music, many forms of dance also evolved. The Lindy Hop was made popular in the early days of swing, and remains popular today. The Jitterbug became hugely popular, and even today dance competitions centered around this style can be found. Shagging was another form that had a more sexual feel to it, and still remains a favorite in many clubs.\nThe dance styles of swing feature high energy moves combined with elements of tap.\nSwing music gave birth to many sub-genres, and some still coming in to the spotlight today. As rock and roll started to become popular, many artists combined the harder sounds with the energy of swing, creating the birth of rockabilly. Country music started to incorporate swing without the brass and woodwind, but with a stronger focus on the fiddle and country lyrics. This is still well liked in the country scene and is referred to as Western swing.\nThe swing music scene was huge in the 30s and 40s, but maintained popularity through today. In the early 90s it hit the scene again in a big way.\nA New Generation\nIn the early 90s the new swing movement (often called the neo-swing movement) was largely underground. Media attention grew, and retro swing started being used in more movies. The soundtrack to the 1993 movie The Mask featured several neo-swing artists, such as Brian Setzer and the Royal Crown Revue. Later in 1993 the movie Swing Kids gained critical acclaim, and brought swing music back in to households all over the world. By the end of the 90s swing music could be found in Gap commercials.\nLater in the 90s ska bands started to introduce the new swing movement to the public. Groups such as The Mighty Mighty Bosstones mixed old school swing with new punk and ska, and the combination worked. By the late 90s swing music was making its way on the air and hitting the charts again. Some of the top charting groups included The Cherry Poppin Daddies, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, the Brian Setzer Orchestra. Older swing music from the 30s and 40s also enjoyed sudden increases in sales.\nSwing music still remains popular, although the popularity has decreased slightly. Those who enjoy the music can still find clubs throughout the US and the UK that dedicate certain nights to swing music. Modern jive is huge in the UK, and vacations can actually be planned around swing events.\nLondon swing has been popular since the 40s, but has more recently enjoyed success again.\nIntroduction in Europe\nWhile swing music originated in the United States in the late 20s, Europe wasn’t far behind. This style of music quickly spread across the pond, and many artists created their own styles of swing. By the late 40s and early 50s swing music could be found globally.\nLondon has long been a hot spot for up and coming artists. While probably more known for rock, swing enjoyed a large influence as well. Rockabilly has been said to have started in London. While no one knows this for sure, it’s not a far out assumption.\nToday swing music remains popular in all parts of the world. In London, a new form of swing that mixes hip hop and house music with a swing backbone has become all the rage with London Swingers. This new form of swing is referred to as electroswing. Heavy dance clubs have long been popular in London, and the Electro Swing clubs of today are no exception to this. Some notable artists include Mr. Scruff, Parov Stelar, and F.M. Einheit. Many of the popular songs take old school swing, such as Duke Ellington, and mixed it with more modern electropop. This new style is gaining popularity and slowly moving to other parts of the world, including the United States.\nThe turn of the century was instrumental in music. In the southern region of the United States, the African American community brought about a form of music that combined blues with syncopation, and jazz was born.\nJazz began popping up in underground clubs, and spread through the communities like wildfire. It spurred several sub-genres of music, including Ragtime, Dixieland Jazz, and the ever popular Swing Jazz.\nSwing jazz was different than the traditional jazz sounds of the early years. By the mid 30s musicians were adding heavy rhythm sections along with brass and woodwind instruments. The result was a large band that belted out music that was smooth and easily danced to. The arrangements for swing tended to be edgier than its predecessor.\nSwing music became huge in the night club scene. Its popularity spread throughout the United States, and started crossing the pond in to parts of Europe. Even German artists were starting to make it big in the swing scene by the end of the 30s.\nThe popularity of the genre couldn’t be squashed, even with declines seen in the aftermath of the war and the depression. While sales declined, the genre led the way for many newer forms of swing music. The rockabilly movement, gypsy swing, western swing, and more modern forms of ska-swing took its place.\nToday swing music remains a commodity. Many newer bands use swing as the base for other forms of music. Acid jazz is a form of swing that is popular in the club scene today. It combines more modern hip hop and funk in with a swing backbone.\nThe New York swing scene has been a large part of pop culture dating back to the 30s. When swing first made its way on the scene in New Orleans in the 20s, it wasn’t long before the style was adopted in New York. During the prohibition era, swing was huge in New York and many swinger clubs were used as a front for alcohol consumption. Beyond that it remained large, and became a part of the culture that has remained strong through today.\nArguably, one of the more notable incarnations of swing in New York was the Acid Jazz movement. This genre of music took a strong swing backbone and incorporated hip hop and funk in to the mix. The result was a more garage feel in music. While acid jazz originated in the UK, it became hugely popular in the New York scene with many New York Swingers. By the 90s, it was hard not to find a club that didn’t feature this type of music.\nSwing and Broadway\nOne of the most famous aspects of New York is the musical theater scene. Swing didn’t escape this avenue. Shows such as Bring in Da Noise, Bring in Da Funk used strong swing elements to captivate audiences. The show combined elements of tap, jazz, and swing to create a continuous rhythm that the dancers used to create a story. Swing! the musical also ran a decent stint on Broadway in the 90s. Elements of swing can still be found in today’s musicals thanks to the influence of musical theater on the New York and worldwide culture."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c7d47673-cfa7-4da5-a8ac-6a963971b53a>","<urn:uuid:2ff707bb-7ec3-4e94-9e01-a0d6bab3c8db>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the story archetypes 'Quest' and 'Voyage and Return' differ from each other in literature?","answer":"While both involve journeys, they have distinct characteristics. In 'The Quest', the protagonist strives toward a specific far-off goal, often trying to acquire a significant object or discover a lost world, and is supported by travelling companions who face obstacles together. In 'Voyage and Return', the hero is transported to a strange land and returns changed by the experience - this journey can be physical, interior, allegorical, or spiritual, and may not even involve traveling far, as shown in Joyce's Ulysses where the entire story takes place in Dublin in a single day.","context":["by Stephen Carver\nWhen Professor Chaos first hit South Park, he was hampered in his evil schemes by the realisation, at every turn, that ‘The Simpsons already did it.’ And as any writer or criminal genius will tell you, the quest for originality routinely brings you to your knees. How many promising projects have you abandoned because the story reminded you of something else? And just to add insult to injury, something that has been done before then storms the Booker and the box office just to taunt you.\nBut when you strip away the individualities of character, setting, and style that form an ‘original’ plot, how many basic storylines are there? Take a minute to think about this.\nHow many did you come up with?\nNever one to dodge a challenge, the controversial journalist Christopher Booker took this on in his 2004 book The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories. Drawing on narratology and Jungian theory, from Aristotle to The Terminator, Booker distilled all the stories of the world down to seven clearly identifiable archetypes.\nSo now we know.\nStill worried about originality?\nAnyway, these archetypes are, in no particular order:\n1. Overcoming the Monster\nThe protagonist sets out to defeat a antagonistic force. You can see the roots of this in Beowulf. Jaws is a great example, also The Exorcist (in fact most horror stories – Booker cites Dracula), thrillers in which the hero matches wits with an ingenious serial killer, alien invasions, and basically anything with a villain.\n2. Rags to Riches\nThe protagonist is plucked from obscurity to greatness, gaining high status and immense wealth, before losing it all and then winning it back after growing as a person, like Bill Murray in his Scrooged/Groundhog Day period and Q & A (Slumdog Millionaire) by Vikas Swarup.\n3. The Quest\nThe protagonist strives to meet a far-off goal, often the acquisition of a significant object, or the discovery of a lost world or a safe haven. The hero is supported by travelling companions, facing many obstacles and temptations along the way. Chrétien de Troyes’s Conte del Graal (‘Story of the Grail’) is a key example. Then there’s Watership Down – The Aeniad with rabbits, brilliant.\n4. Voyage and Return\nMuch like the ‘Quest,’ the ‘Voyage and Return’ story is based around a journey, and as the name suggests the hero is transported to a strange land and then back again, returning changed by the experience. This may or may not involve a long physical journey, and can be interior, allegorical and spiritual. Obvious examples include The Odyssey and the original Star Wars. And your hero does not have to voyage very far. In Joyce’s Ulysses, Leopold Bloom’s adventures are based on the wanderings of Odysseus but take place in Dublin in a single day.\nIn his Poetics, Aristotle described comedy as showing people to be worse than they are and tragedy as showing people to be greater than they are. In comedy, characters are thrown into a state of confusion, darkness and bewilderment. Resolution can only come when these constricting factors have been played out to their extremes, as in A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Booker defines Comedy as: ‘The protagonists are destined to be in love, but something is keeping them from being together, which is resolved by the end of the story.’ You know, like Four Weddings and a Funeral.\nIn Aristotelian terms, the ‘tragic hero’ is an individual (usually of great status) who has a ‘fatal flaw’ (the hamartia, if you want to be flashy) which initiates a series of actions and decisions that unwittingly brings about their downfall (the peripeteia). Classical drama and Shakespeare’s tragedies are the obvious examples, but George Lucas uses the model in the second Star Wars trilogy, which collectively represent the tragedy of Darth Vader.\nIn the ‘Rebirth’ story, the protagonist is often cast under some dark spell either instigated by his or herself or an outside force. The protagonist can sometimes be a villainous or otherwise unlikable character who redeems his or herself over the course of the story, for example Scrooge in A Christmas Carol. The hero’s liberation can only be achieved through the actions of other good forces, often the redemptive power of love.\nSo, there you go. You’ll find different critics use slightly different names for these archetypes, sometimes offering alternative or subcategories. Nonetheless, pretty much the same story groups do come up again and again in the study of narrative – the common root being classical drama.\nAnd archetypes merge and blend as well. The Lord of the Rings is both a ‘quest’ and a ‘voyage and return’ story; the Harry Potter series starts out as a ‘quest’ but becomes ‘overcoming the monster.’ Love stories can be comedies and tragedies, and don’t get me started on the ‘Hero’s Journey,’ the so-called ‘Monomyth’ that reflects life itself.\nBut regardless of how you chop them up, the essential commonality of story archetypes does seem to be a fact. So, if there are only a limited number of stories available to us to tell, how can we ever be ‘original’ as writers?\nThe shocking truth is that it doesn’t really matter. There are no new stories, so there’s little purpose in stressing yourself out trying to invent one. In fact, if you look at commercial film and fiction it’s obvious that most writers don’t even bother to try. They just lift an existing story and re-plot it with different settings and characters.\nIn short, stop worrying about this! Create your own characters and settings, don’t directly copy, and approach your story with originality and insight. Remember how different Ulysses is from the Odyssey. We will never run out of ways to tell the same stories. There are so many potential characters, settings, and events that the combinations thereof should be close to infinite. When you strip it right down, there are only seven musical notes as well.\nAs Asha Dornfest so wisely put it: ‘I think new writers are too worried that it has all been said before. Sure it has, but not by you.’"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9693968d-1bc4-4c69-b79b-899584b9f281>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do science journalists and trade journalists differ in their specialization requirements?","answer":"Science journalists require increasingly extensive preparation due to the broader scope of scientific subjects and must be able to handle multiple communication channels, while trade journalists focus on specific business sectors or industries like oil, gas, or finance. Science journalists need to understand complex scientific topics broadly enough to ensure comprehensive discussion from multiple sources, whereas trade journalists can be more technical and analytical within their specific industry focus. Additionally, science journalists in Italy often lack dedicated positions in news organizations, while trade journalism has established specialized outlets like The Wall Street Journal dedicated to their specific field.","context":["Science journalism in a changing world\nThe media is undergoing deep changes. How is it possible to communicate science well in this setting? What is the correct relationship between the researcher and the journalist today? Can the scientist perform the role of the journalist? In economic hard times, does the quality of scientific information suffer or does it improve? Several questions arise as the daily news media takes on a new dimension, a new existence, and is forced to assimilate technologies that deeply modify their work. At the basis of this transformation is the change in the measure and significance of time that affects radically any diffusion of the news.\nThe answer to the first question is that, thanks to the amplification of possibilities offered by new technologies, today science can be spread and reported better than in the past. But communication skills acquired by scientists are more sophisticated making the journalist’s position more difficult: he/she can be overwhelmed by too much information and be influenced by the personality of the scientist, without verifying the contents. The only way to balance the relationship is through higher knowledge on the part of the journalists, who must learn more about the topics they cover. They must do this, or risk being overwhelmed by their interviewees. In addition to more preparation, method itself needs to be strengthened and expanded. Verification, always valid and fundamental to establishing the quality of any kind of information, must be performed more rigorously, even as it becomes more difficult.\nInformation sources today have multiplied dramatically, thanks to the web, and it is often difficult to ascertain their level of reliability. This requires broader and more thorough verification, even though this conflicts with the need for faster diffusion of the news.\nTo better respond to such needs, journalists should seek opportunities to experience the professional life of scientist; not so much to \"feel\" more like a scientist (danger to be avoided) but to get more in tune with the new area in which they operate. In addition to providing an update on practical aspects that can be integrated with theoretical considerations, this provides a more accurate perception of the speed with which the world of research is changing.\nThis was the aim of the initiative organized in 2013 by the UGIS (Italian Union of Science Journalists) at IFOM (FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology). During this program, a selected group of UGIS (The Union of Italian Science Journalists) members and science journalism students from SISSA, the International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste, experienced a full week at IFOM where they followed an intensive experimental program. The aim was to update them on research methods used for cancer, a complex disease with a thousand faces and, for that reason, very difficult to understand. The participants praised the effectiveness of the experience offered by IFOM and tailored on their needs through interactive sessions with the researchers, in addition to laboratory activities. Experiencing life and research inside the Institute raised issues that would be difficult to understand from a simple visit, suggesting that similar initiatives in other scientific domains would be extremely useful.\nThere is no doubt that today science journalists require more preparation to properly perform their role. This is due, not only to the broader scope of the subject, but also to the use of new communication channels that allow different kinds of usage: online media requires a quicker language, while providing the possibility of links to further reading for those who need it; whereas, printed editions usually go directly into a deeper examination, integrating everything with the news headline. Moreover, any news of great scientific impact is now discussed in the popular online channels and therefore must be addressed in all of its aspects.\nThe quality of scientific information in Italy may be adversely affected because online editors are still not organized to ensure high quality information within the tight deadlines that this medium imposes.\nThis aspect compounds another evident serious lack in the national media: public and private newspapers, television and radio news sources generally do not have science editors in their staff. Some newspapers assign occasional science stories to regular journalists, but what is missing is a stable figure that continuously covers this area, as exists for politics, economics or sports.\nThe absence of this kind of internal specialization, unlike what happens in other countries where science newsrooms are an established tradition, not only highlights the lack of adequate professional vision to meet the needs of the themes prevalent in today's information, but has produced another anomaly: to tackle these issues, scientists are often asked to intervene directly. Although collaboration between researchers and the media is important, and should be strengthened, the intervention of a specialist should not replace that of the science journalist. Journalists have more appropriate communication tools for this task, thereby ensuring the kind of comprehensive discussion based on a plurality of sources that is essential for a proper analysis. The best role for scientists in the media, when appropriate, should be that of a commentator who adds value to the news provided by the science journalist.\nThese roles, competencies and aims are radically different and must remain so to avoid confusing the readers. The proliferation of information and sources requires more clarity. Time plays a different role in science news than it did in the past. The tempo with which news is produced and spread urges readers with a rhythm that they are not accustomed to, and scientific news is no longer seen as a fundamental path to knowledge on which to dwell, but as a relative, albeit important, step. This changes its meaning to those who receive it, and can be interpreted positively or negatively depending on one’s reading capacity and background. This is exactly why the role of science journalists is essential, because it is their responsibility to establish the right balance, bridging the natural limitations of the reader.\nFinally, looking at the cuts to research imposed in some countries, the doubt arises that the ongoing economic crisis damages also scientific information. This doubt is legitimate because budget cuts are often followed by a reappraisal of priorities for the remaining funds. Studies in areas with direct applications may be favoured, with the aim of supporting economic recovery. Nevertheless, this legitimate need should not alter the availability of resources dedicated to basic research with more distant perspectives. To overcome the limitations imposed by budget cuts, new avenues of funding such as crowdfunding have been established.\nHowever, these are extraordinary measures that can be used in special situations, but cannot support the continuity and evolution of research. These new methods do show an important aspect: direct involvement by the population that raises awareness of issues that would otherwise seem distant and inaccessible. This presents a new perspective for journalists, positioning them to expand their analysis and their frame of reference in order to observe, evaluate and possibly to criticize the initiatives emerging from the natural process of selection and funding.\nThe world of research evolves fast and this must be matched in the world of science journalism, especially in Italy, considering that it will assume a growing role in future communication.","If you say you are a doctor, the next question is usually, “Well, what kind of doctor are you?”\nThe same applies to journalism. Being a journalist is a broad statement, especially when there are nine different types of journalism in America.\nWith so many subdivisions of journalism, it is a good thing about 32,900 full-time journalists are working hard across the nation.\nDo you know all of the different types of journalistic categories? Let’s explore.\n1. Investigative Journalism\nAs the name suggests, investigative journalism requires a professional to do some detective work to get to the bottom of a story. An investigative matter may be deliberately concealed, such as to protect a person in power. Or a subject could be surrounded by chaos, making it tedious to get to the bottom of what occurred.\nInvestigative journalism may include anonymous or open sources. It is a critical and in-depth sector of journalism.\nInvestigative Journalism in Action\nOne of the most noteworthy investigative pieces published by US media is Upton Sinclair’s novel, The Jungle. Sinclair detailed the horrific and exploitative conditions in Chicago’s meatpacking plants.\n2. Watchdog Journalism\nWatchdog journalism refers to journalists gathering facts and using the information to expose the wrongdoings of people in power.\nWatchdog journalism is a key component of a democratic society.\nThe journalists promote change and hold leaders accountable for their actions. Articles, documentaries, and radio shows shine a light on poor behavior to invoke positive change.\nWatchdog Journalism in Action\nThe most notable example of watchdog journalism in US history is Watergate, which was spearheaded by The Washington Post.\nThe journalists uncovered the lies, bribes, and other criminal acts that occurred. The reporting was directly responsible for President Nixon’s resignation and the convictions of several other congress members.\n3. Online (Digital) Journalism\nOnline journalism, sometimes referred to as digital journalism, reports news through digital media. Reports can come in the form of blogs, digital newspapers, and social media. Most online journalism is free to view, although its credibility may vary.\nThe biggest benefit of online journalism is its speed.\nReporters can gather facts and share them immediately. Journalists can get information distributed to the public in a matter of hours as opposed to waiting to convey the details in the morning paper.\nOnline Journalism in Action\nIn the digital era we live in today, online journalism is all around us.\nMajor news outlets like ABC News use their websites to deliver updated news to their audience. Reporters also take to mediums like Twitter to brief followers on developing stories.\n4. Opinion Journalism\nThe average journalistic story should be unbiased. But this standard does not apply to opinion journalism, where a reporter may creature a feature with a subjective viewpoint.\nOpinion journalism allows the producer to create a personalized piece. It can contain first-person statements (such as “I believe”), sarcasm, and exaggeration.\nOpinion Journalism in Action\nOpinion pieces include:\n- Op-ed contributions\n- Political commentary\n- Newspaper columns\n- Analysis pieces\nSome big-name opinion journalists include Mollie Hemingway, who contributes to The Federalist, and Michael Goodwin, who runs a column in The New York Post.\n5. Broadcast Journalism\nInstead of printing the news, broadcast journalists report via television, digital videos, and radio. Broadcast journalism can be prerecorded or presented live.\nBroadcast journalists include news anchors, producers, correspondents, audio technicians, and more.\nBroadcast Journalism in Action\nYears ago, people would turn on their television for the nightly five o’clock news, which is an example of broadcast journalism.\nToday, many broadcast journalists stream live videos so viewers can tune in from their computers or phones at any time.\n6. Sports Journalism\nSports journalism is a specific segment that only covers sport-related news. It includes live sporting events, recaps, and stories about professional athletes.\nSports journalism dates back to the 1800s. As the popularity of athletic competitions increased, journalists starting covering the events in newspaper columns.\nA sports journalist knows more than the average person about one or multiple sports. They can provide detailed insights and analyze sports-related data.\nSports Journalism in Action\nMost news networks feature sports journalism, whether it be a brief segment during a broadcast or a column on their website.\nThe most popular example of sports journalism is ESPN. The news outlet covers all American sports. They publish online pieces, highlight reels, and athlete interviews.\n7. Trade (Business) Journalism\nTrade journalism covers developments in the business world. These articles can be technical, analytical, or industry-specific.\nPublications by trade journalists often focus on commodities, like oil and gas. Or, they may report on specific sectors, like the finance industry.\nTrade Journalism in Action\nTrade journalism is any piece that is specific to one industry or field.\nA prime example is The Wall Street Journal, which is a news outlet devoted to covering finance and business-related topics. Another example is Accounting Today, a publication that focuses on accounting news.\n8. Entertainment Journalism\nEntertainment journalism produces news related to pop culture and current trends. It may focus on:\n- Celebrities and musicians\n- Popular products\n- Upcoming releases (albums, movies, video games, etc.)\n- Premiers and award shows\n- Lifestyle topics\nWhile trade journalism focuses on educating viewers, entertainment journalism emphasizes entertaining its audience.\nEntertainment Journalism in Action\nEntertainment Tonight is the most well-known entertainment news source in America. The news outlet covers everything from interviewing celebrities on the red carpet to reality show recaps.\nOther well-known entertainment news sources include The Daily Mail and TMZ.\n9. Political Journalism\nPolitical journalists cover news related to politics, politicians, and political science.\nPolitical journalism is a key part of a democratic society. It aims to publish unbiased reports on government officials, policy changes, and supreme court cases.\nThe goal of political journalism is to keep voters informed. Political journalists are experts in political science and strive to provide factual and honest information.\nPolitical Journalism in Action\nPolitical journalism can be found on the radio, television screen, and radio.\nIn 2019, 16% of Americans tuned into Fox News for political updates, while 12% relied on CNN. Other political news sources include MSNBC and NPR.\nThe Types of Journalism & More\nAll Americans should familiarize themselves with the various types of journalism recognized in this nation. From entertainment news to trade journalism, there are always new developments being covered.\nAre you looking to learn more about journalism and its related topics?

{"question":"What are the technical principles behind wind turbine power generation, and what environmental impact does it have on bird and bat populations?","answer":"Wind turbines generate power by converting wind's kinetic energy into mechanical power, with total power being proportional to air density, rotor swept area, and the cube of wind velocity. The system uses horizontal axis turbines with 2-3 blades, housed in a nacelle containing components like gears and generators. Regarding environmental impact, wind farms pose two main hazards to birds and bats: displacement/disturbance and collision mortality. While breeding birds show limited impact, non-breeding birds like geese and waders avoid wind farms by several hundred meters. Collision rates vary from 0 to over 50 per turbine annually, with gulls and raptors being frequent victims. Notably, Germany has documented concerning numbers of Red Kite (41) and White-tailed Eagle (13) fatalities. Bat collisions occur mainly during late summer migration periods, particularly near forests.","context":["Wind energy is an indirect form of solar energy since wind is produced chiefly by the uneven heating of the earth’s crust by the sun. The kinetic energy of the wind can be utilized to produce with the help of wind turbine.\nWind Power Plant Working Principle\nAs the free wind stream interacts with turbine rotor, it transfers a part of the kinetic energy to the rotor due to which its speed decreases. This difference in kinetic energy is converted into mechanical power. This is the basic wind power plant working principle.\nThe total wind power is equal to the incoming kinetic energy of the wind stream. It can be expressed as:\nTotal wind power, Pt = (ρACi3)/2\nWhere, ρ = density of air (in kg/m3)\nA = rotor swept area = πr2 (r = radius of blades in meters)\nCi = incoming wind velocity (in m/s).\nThe density of air (ρ) is somewhat complicated since it depends on the definition of “ideal” air, the temperature, the altitude, and the water vapor content. It is approximately 1.2 kg/m3 at sea level and room temperature, a value which is sufficiently accurate for our purposes.\nFrom the above equation, it is clear that total power of a wind stream is proportional to the cube of incoming wind velocity, the density of air and the rotor swept area. Hence, any small increase in wind speed can produce a significant rise in developed wind power.\nHorizontal Axis Wind Turbine Generator\nHorizontal axis wind turbine generators are being used all over the world successfully. The main components of a propeller type wind generator are shown in Figure.\n- Usually, it has two of three blades made of high-density glass fiber reinforced plastic. The diameter of rotor ranges from 2 to 25 m. Modern rotors may be up to 100 m in diameter. Rotor blades are assembled on a hub.\n- The hub, brakes, gearbox, generator with electrical controls is accommodated in a box called nacelle.\n- Electromagnetic brakes are provided for automatic application of brakes if wind speed exceeds the designed speed.\n- The whole system is mounted on a tower top. It is designed to bear up the wind loads during storms.\n- A yaw control mechanism is also provided to adjust the nacelle around a vertical axis to keep it wind facing. A servomechanism operated by a wind direction sensor controls the nacelle so that the turbine blades are always oriented in the direction perpendicular to wind to have the maximum wind stream area.\n- The pitch of the blade (0o to 30o) is controlled automatically so as to provide the feathering action. Thereby the power and speed of wind turbine shaft are adjusted to match with generator speed and its electrical output. The pitch control mechanism adjusts the pitch to obtain the optimum performance.\n- The wind energy is converted into mechanical energy by an aero turbine. This mechanical power is transferred through gears to the generator to increase its speed. Since rotor speeds are low, a gear system is necessary to match the synchronous speed of the generator.\n- Due to fluctuations in wind speed, it not possible to obtain a power supply of a fixed frequency from windmills. To overcome this problem, the output of 3 phase generator is rectified and converted into AC with the help of a PWM inverter operating at 50 or 60 Hz.\nSite Selection for Wind Power Plant\nAs we know that the total wind power from free wind stream increases as the cube of the wind speed, therefore, the location of wind power plant should be decided very carefully. Wind energy can be used where wind speeds are reasonably high in the range of 8 to 40 km/hr.\nSuch wind speeds are available along the sea coast at high altitudes and in hilly terrain. Some of the important criteria for selection of a site for wind energy conversion system (WECS) are as under:\n- The WECS should be located where high average wind velocities available are in the range of 6 m/s to 30 m/s throughout the year.\n- The WECS must be located far away from cities and forests since buildings and forests offer resistance to wind.\n- Wind velocities must be measured at several heights as the velocity of wind increases with height.\n- Tower design must be adequate to withstand maximum wind speeds observed in the last few years in the area of installation.\nWind Power Plant Advantages and Disadvantages\n- It is a free and un-exhaustible source of energy.\n- It is a clean and non-polluting source of energy.\n- It has a low maintenance cost.\n- It has a low cost of power generation (about Rs. 2.25/kWH).\n- At present capital cost of wind power plants is high. It is about Rs. 3.5 crores/MW.\n- Wind energy is very fluctuating in nature. It is very difficult to design a wind energy system due to these fluctuations. This problem also requires the provision of a suitable storage device to ensure continuous power supply.\n- Large variations in wind speed during storms may cause damage to windmills.\n- The efficiency of the system is in the range of 35 to 44%.\n- Windmill causes sound pollution. A large unit can be heard few kilometers away.\nThanks for reading about wind power plant working principle.\n- MHD Generator Working Principle\n- Closed | Open Cycle MHD System\n- Tidal Power Plant Working Principle\n- Working Principle of Hydroelectric Power Plant\n- Nuclear Power Plant Working Principle\n- Wind Power Plant Working Advantages | Disadvantages\n- Concentrating Solar Collector Types | Power Plants\n- Solar Panel Working Principle\n- How Geothermal Energy Works\n- OTEC | Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion System Working","Impacts on biodiversity of exploitation of renewable energy sources: the example of birds and bats – facts, gaps in knowledge, demands for further research, and ornithological guidelines for the development of renewable energy exploitation.\nThe purpose of this report is to collect and to evaluate the available information on the impacts of exploitation of renewable energy sources on birds and bats. The focus is on wind energy as there is only little information on the impact on birds and bats of other sources of renewable energy. The report aims at better understanding the size of the impact, the potential effects of re-powering (exchanging small old wind turbines by new big turbines), and possible measures to reduce the negative impact on birds by wind turbines. In addition the need for further research is highlighted.\nThe evaluation is based on 127 separate studies (wind farms) in ten countries, most of them in Germany. Most studies were brief (not more than two years) and did not include the preconstruction period. Before-After Control Impact studies that combine data collection before and after, in this case construction of a wind farm, on both the proposed development site and at least one reference site were rare. In only a few cases, would the design of the study and the length of the study period theoretically allow statistically significant effects of wind farms on birds and bats to be found at all. Assessments of impacts, therefore, are usually based on few studies only. This report includes all studies readily available to the authors, irrespective of the length of the study period and the quality of the study design. In order to base the assessments on as many independent samples as possible even rather unsystematic observations were included. The information of the data was reduced to a level that justified the application of sign tests. The compilation of many different individual studies gave the following results:\nThe main potential hazards to birds and bats from wind farms are disturbance leading to displacement or exclusion and collision mortality. Although there is a high degree of agreement among experts that wind farms may have negative impacts on bird populations no statistically significant evidence of negative impacts on populations of breeding birds could be found. There was a tendency waders nesting on open grounds to be displaced by wind farms. Some passerines obviously profited from wind farms. They were probably affected by secondary impacts, e.g. changes in land management or abandonment from agricultural use next to the wind plants.\nThe impact of wind farms on non-breeding birds was stronger. Wind farms had significantly negative effects on local populations of geese, Wigeons, Golden Plovers and Lapwings.\nWith the exceptions of Lapwings, Black-tailed Godwits and Redshanks most bird species used the space close to wind turbines during the breeding season. The minimal distances observed between birds and pylons rarely exceeded 100 m during the breeding season. Some passerines showed a tendency to settle closer to bigger than to smaller wind turbines.\nDuring the non-breeding season many bird species of open landscapes avoided approaching wind parks closer than a few hundred metres. This particularly held true for geese and waders. In accordance with published information disturbance of geese may occur at least up to 500 m from wind turbines. For most species during the non-breeding season, the distances at which disturbance could be noted increased with the size of the wind turbines. For Lapwings this relationship was statistically significant. There was no evidence that birds generally became „habituated“ to wind farms in the years after their construction. The results of the few studies lasting longer than one season revealed about as many cases of birds occurring closer to wind farms (indications for the existence of habituation) over the years as those of birds occurring further away from wind farms (indications for the lack of habituation).\nThe question whether wind farms act as barriers to movement of birds has so far received relatively little systematic scientific attention. Wind farms are thought to be barriers if birds approaching them change their flight direction, both on migration or during other regular flights.\nThere is evidence for the occurrence of a barrier effect in 81 bird species. Geese, Common Cranes, waders and small passerines were affected in particular. However, the extent to which the disturbances due to wind farms of migrating or flying birds influences energy budgets or the timing of migration of birds remains unknown.\nCollision rates (annual number of killed individuals per turbine) have only rarely been studied with appropriate methods (e. g. with controls of scarvenger activities). In particular, such studies are missing for Germany. Collision rates varied between 0 and more than 50 collisions per turbine per year for both birds and bats. Obviously the habitat influenced the number of collisions. Birds were at high risks at wind farms close to wetlands where gulls were the most common victims and at wind farms on mountain ridges (USA, Spain), where many raptors were killed. Wind farms in or close to forests posed high collision risks for bats. For both birds and bats, the collision risk increased with increasing size of the wind turbine. The relationship, however, was not statistically significant.\nGulls and raptors accounted for most of the victims. In Germany the relatively high numbers of White-tailed Eagles (13) and Red Kites (41) killed give cause for concern. Germany hosts about half of the world population of breeding Red Kites and has a particular responsibility for this species. Bird species that were easily disturbed by wind farms (geese, waders) were only rarely found among the victims. Bats were struck by wind turbines mostly in late summer or autumn during the period of migration and dispersal.\nPopulation models created by the software VORTEX revealed that significant decreases in size of bird and bat populations may be caused by relatively small (0,1 %) additive increases in annual mortality rates, provided they are not counter acted by density dependent increases in reproduction rates. Short-lived species with high reproductive rates are more affected than long-lived species with low reproductive rates. The latter, however, are less able to substitute additional mortality by increasing reproductive rates.\nThe effects of „repowering“ (substitution of old, small turbines by new turbines with higher capacity) on birds and bats is assessed by the available data and by simple models. There is no information, however, on the effects of the newest generation of very large wind turbines. According to current knowledge, repowering will reduce negative impacts on birds and bats (disturbance and mortality) if the total capacity of a wind farm is not changed (many small turbines are replaced by few big turbines). In a scenario in which the capacity of a wind farm is increased 1.5 fold, negative impacts start to dominate. In case of a doubling of wind farm capacity, repowering increases the negative impacts of the wind farm. Repowering offers the chance to remove wind farms from sites that are associated with high impacts or risks for birds and bats. New turbines could be constructed on sites that are likely to be less problematic with respect to birds and bats.\nEffective methods of reducing the negative impacts of wind energy use on birds and bats include:\n- choice of the right site for wind farms (avoidance of wetands, woodlands, important sites for sensitive non-breeding birds and mountain ridges with high numbers of raptors and vultures),\n- measures to reduce the attractivness of wind farm sites for potential collision victims,\n- configuration of turbines within wind farms (placement of turbines parallel to and not accross the main migration or flight directions of birds),\n- construction of wind turbines: replacement of lattice towers, wire-cables and overhead power lines.\nMeasures to increase the visibility of wind turbines and to reduce the effects of illumination remain to be studied.\nIn spite of many publications on windfarms and birds there still is a great demand for further research. First of all there is an urgent need for reliable data on collision rates at wind turbines of birds and bats in Germany. This holds true particularly for the new and big turbines which will replace the present generation of wind turbines.\nIt is still unclear whether these big and necessarily illuminated turbines pose a high collision risk to nocturnal migrants which have not yet been greatly affected by smaller turbines. The high collision rates of Red Kites in Germany also merit urgently study. The aim of the research has to be a quick reduction of the collision rates.

{"question":"What measures are taken to protect maritime heritage sites and marine mammals in coastal waters?","answer":"The Sea Venture wreck site is now protected as a restricted area where recreational diving is not allowed, preserving this important historical site that marked Bermuda's first settlement. Similarly, protective measures exist for marine mammals in Hawaiian waters, with particular attention to species facing multiple threats. The U.S. Endangered Species Act provides protection for certain species, such as the recently listed main Hawaiian Islands population of false killer whales, which faces threats from fishing interactions and prey base reduction. Various research efforts are ongoing to study and address factors that put different species at risk in Hawaiian waters.","context":["Sunk in July 1609\nThis ship Sea Venture\nhad actually started the history of Bermuda\nand brought in the first settlers in the island. They were all originally headed for the English colony Jamestown but were forced to land in Bermuda due to a fierce storm. Here is the story of Sea Venture:\nIn July 1609, Sir George Somers had started with a fleet of 9 ships from Plymouth (England) towards the new English colony Jamestown in Virginia. He was carrying settlers and food supplies for the new colony. As a chief commander, he was aboard the lead ship (or the flagship) called the Sea Venture. There were 150 sailors and settlers aboard the vessels, and a dog.\nThe fleet was caught in a severe storm. The sailors were somehow able to spot the east-end reefs of Bermuda (near St. George) and were able to steer the ship towards the rocks. The ship however got wrecked at the reefs off Gate's Bay (i.e. the bay of St. Catherine's Beach\n). But luckily all men on board survived including the dog :-). All came ashore and but few were asked to stay back to retain British claim of the newly found island... they started the first human settlement in Bermuda.\nThe survivors later built two new ships - The Deliverance\nand The Patience\n. The Deliverance was constructed primarily out the materials stripped from the Sea Venture itself. Having built the two new vessels, most of them had set sail again for Jamestown except the few who stayed back.\nAn artist's depiction of Sea Venture caught in a storm\nPainting by Christopher Grimes, Bermuda\nFor a long time this 300 ton single timbered ship of London Company sat on top of the reefs and was largely stripped off its cargo and many other parts over time by the early settlers. However whatever remained finally sank and sat below the sea amongst underwater reefs. But the exact location of the wreck remained unknown for a long time.\nHowever two canon guns were recovered from the wreck in 1612 and used in the eastern-end military forts built by the British in early 17th century. One can be seen at Castle Island Fort\nand the other one at Governor's Island fort located opposite to Paget Fort.\nNearly 350 years after the Sea Venture got wrecked, Edmund Downing set out to find the Sea Ventures\nremains in 1958. He found a wreck in 30 feet of water. The Smithsonian's, Mendel Peterson and the legendary Bermuda diver Teddy Tucker\nwere called to verify the site. They recovered a stone jug, a clay pipe, and a vase and confirmed that they belonged to the period when the original Sea Venture ship had sunk. They also took timber measurements and concluded that this was indeed the vessel that had brought Bermuda's first colonists in the year 1609.\n2) There is a new monument built in St. George Bermuda in memory of the survivors of the Sea Venture. Read Monument for Sea Venture\nto know the details.\nMichael W McClure (September 2018)\nCan the wreckage of the original Sea Venture (1609) be reached by any diving opportunities in Bermuda?\nRaj (bermuda-attractions.com) September 2018\nOriginal Sea Venture wreck is a restricted site and recreational diving is not allowed there. What is available for dive is Sea Venture Ferry wreck at the Eastern Blue Cut (off the north-western coast of the island and quite far away from the original location)... this was a government ferry which was sunk in October 2007 and made into a dive site. It lies at a depth of about 50 ft. The wreck was named after the original Sea Venture but does not have an iota of resemblance with the original one. It's more like a modern ferry that sits upright.\nMonica Hake (February 2018)\nMy ancestors, Samuel Jordan and William Bass also survived the 1609 shipwreck of the Sea Venture and continued on to Jamestown.\nSusan Wellborn (November 2017)\nMy ancestors were among the shipwrecked..\"John Wellborn\" who arrived in Jamestown in 1609.","A pantropical spotted dolphin with a wound from a vessel propeller. Photo by Annie Gorgone\nThe most well-publicized threat to Hawaiian odontocetes is the issue of harassment and potential displacement of spinner dolphins from their resting areas by swimmers, snorkelers, and small boats. Spinner dolphins are the only species of cetacean that rests near shore in protected bays around the main Hawaiian Islands, and this behavior puts them at risk from usually well-intentioned people that will follow groups of dolphins for extended periods. While some individual spinner dolphins, particularly juveniles, may show interest in swimmers or bowride on vessels, even when the majority of the group is resting, interacting with spinner dolphins in their resting areas may result in them moving out of their preferred resting areas, potentially exposing them to greater risk of attacks by sharks and disruption of their daily cycles. But is harassment the biggest conservation threat to Hawaiian odontocetes? A list of threats, some of which are more important to certain species than others, is below.\n|Threat||Species most likely to be affected|\n|Hook ingestion||false killer whale, bottlenose dolphin, rough-toothed dolphin|\n|Navy sonar||beaked whales, dwarf sperm whales, melon-headed whales, possibly others|\n|Vessel collisions||short-finned pilot whales, sperm whales, pantropical spotted dolphins, possibly others|\n|Reduction in prey base||false killer whales, possibly bottlenose dolphins|\n|Deliberate shooting||rough-toothed dolphins, melon-headed whales, possibly others|\n|Vessel/human disturbance||pantropical spotted dolphins, spinner dolphins, short-finned pilot whales, probably other species|\n|Line injuries/hooking||pantropical spotted dolphins, dwarf sperm whales, pygmy killer whales,others|\n|Persistent organic pollutants||false killer whales, probably others|\n|Entanglements in nearshore nets||bottlenose dolphins|\nSome of these threats may cause the immediate death of individuals, and some may cause injuries that could later lead to death. Other threats could make it harder to “make a living” (e.g., reduction in prey base), or could increase an individual’s susceptibility to infection or disease (e.g., persistent organic pollutants).\nWhat puts a species most at risk?\n- Low abundance\n- Population structure/sub-division\n- “Slow” life history (e.g., long inter-birth intervals, delayed age of first reproduction)\n- Known threats\n- High trophic level\n- High uncertainty (e.g., about threats, abundance, population structure)\nOf the 18 species of odontocetes in Hawaiian waters, until December 2012 only one was listed as Endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, the sperm whale. But is it the most at risk? Sperm whales were listed as Endangered because of large reductions in abundance world-wide due to commercial whaling. Although there is no recent abundance estimate available for the North Pacific, “on the basis of total abundance, current distribution, and regulatory measures that are currently in place, it is unlikely that this stock is in danger of extinction” (Allen and Angliss 2009). The species of toothed whale most at risk in Hawai‘i was listed as Endangered in December 2012, the main Hawaiian Islands population of false killer whales. False killer whales have the lowest known abundance of any of the 18 species in Hawaiian waters, are divided into three discrete populations (an open-ocean or pelagic population, a Northwestern Hawaiian Islands populatoin and the insular population around the main Hawaiian Islands), is slow to reproduce, is known to be threatened by a number of different anthropogenic activities, and is very high on the food web.\nBut many other species face a diversity of threats which could be impacting their populations in Hawaiian waters. Much of our research is focused on studying the factors that put species at risk in Hawaiian waters.\nBottlenose dolphin with hook in mouth (trailing a monofilament line) off the west coast of the island of Hawai‘i, July 5, 2009, evidence that this population does interact with local fisheries.

{"question":"How has Latin American literature documented societal changes, and what role does the Amazon play in global climate stability?","answer":"Latin American literature has served as a blueprint for tracking social developments, with women writers documenting everything from economic hardships and subjugation to themes of exile and dictatorial regimes, spanning from colonial times to present day. This literary evolution reflects the unique struggles of 20 sovereign nations after colonization. Meanwhile, the Amazon rainforest plays a crucial role in global climate stability by acting as one of Earth's largest carbon dioxide reservoirs, helping regulate climate patterns through carbon sequestration. The forest also maintains the world's largest 'flying rivers' that provide vital rainfall to the continent, while housing the planet's richest biological reservoir of species.","context":["Latin America is immense not only in its size—twice the area of Europe, and stretching from the Rio Grande in Texas to Cape Horn in Patagonia—but in its range of cultural and literary expression. What we call \"Latin American culture\" is a composite of the rich and diverse output of 20 sovereign countries. Each had its unique struggle for independence and particular ways in which it evolved after the end of colonization.\nLiterature is the best blueprint for following the social and cultural developments within these Ibero-American nations. In Latin American Women Writers, Alexander Street presents an electronic collection of literature by Latin American women from the colonial period in the 17th century forward to the present. Literary works, along with memoirs and essays, comprise the 100,000 pages of works in their original language. The collection showcases how, throughout the centuries, women wrote about their families, their economic hardships, their subjugation, and their identity. They wrote about folklore, food, indigence, abolitionism, and race. They wrote from the heart, whether poetry, prose, or memoir. With Latin American Women Writers, Alexander Street brings together all the voices of Latin American women and presents a tool for understanding the diversity and development of Latin America through a feminine perspective.\nThe project begins with the autobiographical writing of nuns who, like their 17th-century European counterparts, wrote accounts of their spiritual journeys. Representative are the works of the Mexican mestiza Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, a sister in the Convent in the Order of St. Jerome, a prolific writer of plays, poetry, and other meditative texts.\nAs the collection moves through 18th-century works into the 19th century, it shows how women writers incrementally gained access to the writing world outside of religious contexts. Initially, they wrote under pseudonyms or anonymously, but from this position they were able to start the critique of their own status within heavily patriarchal societies. Included from this period are works by Clorinda Matto de Turner (Peru), Juana M. Gorriti (Argentina), Gertrudis Gomez de Avellaneda (Cuba), Delmira Agustini (Argentina), and Julia Lopes Almeida (Brazil), among others. A number of important figures from the early 20th century are also present, such as Alfonsina Storni (Argentina), Juana de Ibarbourou (Uruguay), Gabriela Mistral (Chile), and Clarice Lispector (Brazil).\nThe production and publication of women’s writing during the second half of the twentieth century shows how the ongoing critique became sharper, more direct, and more feminist. Other women, influenced by broader political currents sweeping these nations during the time, focused on dictatorial regimes, censorship, and themes of exile, as in the works of Luisa Valenzuela (Argentina), Isabel Allende (Chile), and Cristina Peri Rossi (Uruguay).\nBibliographies consulted include these and many other works:\nA scholarly editorial board, including scholars and librarians from around the world helped in the selection of the content. A significant portion of the collection consists of materials that have never been published before.\nWriters from the following countries are represented: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Uruguay, and Venezuela.","Why should we be concerned about the Amazon rainforest?\nThe Amazon forests play a vital role in stabilizing the global climate, through holding trapped carbon and defining weather patterns. The Amazon is also responsible for the circulation of moisture and humidity; the world’s largest ‘flying rivers’ that supply the continent with life-giving rainfall.\nWhat are the dangers of the Amazon?\nAccording to Goparoo Travel Guide, the biggest threat comes from mosquitoes carrying malaria and yellow fever. These are both serious illnesses, so get the appropriate vaccinations before you go to the Amazon. Visitors may also get sick from the local food and water.\nWhat would happen if the Amazon was destroyed?\nAnd there are other very serious long-term consequences to destroying Earth’s most biodiverse region. Burning away the Amazon would condemn millions of living species to extinction and destroy their habitats. Many of these plants, animals, and other forms of life haven’t even been identified by science yet.\nWhy is the Amazon so important to us?\nThe Amazon is the most biodiverse terrestrial place on the planet. The outstanding biodiversity in the Amazon isn’t only important for the natural ecosystems, it also provides many benefits to us humans. The plants and animals here are used for food, research, medicines and textiles.\nHow much of our air comes from the Amazon?\nHow does the Amazon help the Earth?\nThe Amazon rainforest serves as one of Earth’s largest reservoirs of carbon dioxide, helping regulate global climate patterns through the sequestration and storage of carbon dioxide in above-ground bio mass and soil.\nWhy do we need to protect our rainforests?\nPRESERVING THE RAINFORESTS We need the rain forests to produce oxygen and clean the atmosphere to help us breathe. We also know that the earth’s climate can be affected, as well as the water cycle. Rainforests also provide us with many valuable medicinal plants, and may be a source of a cure from some deadly diseases.\nWhat is Amazon forest famous for?\nThe Amazon Rainforest is the world’s richest and most-varied biological reservoir, containing several million species of insects, plants, birds, and other forms of life, many still unrecorded by science. The luxuriant vegetation encompasses a wide variety of trees.\nHow do rainforests benefit humans?\nThey make much of the oxygen humans and animals depend on. Without them, there would be less air to breathe! Rainforests also help maintain Earth’s climate. By taking in carbon dioxide, they help to reduce the greenhouse effect.\nWhy are rainforests in danger?\nLogging interests cut down rain forest trees for timber used in flooring, furniture, and other items. Power plants and other industries cut and burn trees to generate electricity. The paper industry turns huge tracts of rain forest trees into pulp.\nWhat medicine is found in the rainforest?\nQuinine. Quinine was the first effective medicine used to treat malaria. It was originally discovered by the Quechua tribe, who mixed the ground bark of cinchona trees with sweetened water to prevent shivering in cold weather, and the mix of bark and water became known as tonic.\nWhy are forests called the lungs of the earth?\nTropical rainforests are often called the “lungs of the planet” because they generally draw in carbon dioxide and breathe out oxygen. But the amount of carbon dioxide they absorb, or produce, varies hugely with year-to-year variations in the climate.\nWhich country is called lungs of the world?\nAre trees the lungs of the planet?\nGlobally, trees are often recognized as the ‘lungs of the world’ because they exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with the atmosphere. Similarly, trees are like the intestines of the world exchanging nutrients between the soil and the vegetation, fueling the nutrient and carbon cycle.\nWhat is the lungs of the planet?\nPlants and trees take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen back into the air in their process of photosynthesis. This is why the Amazon, which covers 2.1 million square miles, is often referred to as the “lungs of the planet”: The forest produces 20% of the oxygen in our planet’s atmosphere.\nAre rainforests the lungs of the earth?\nThe Amazon rainforest functions as the Earth’s ‘lungs. In fact, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, seasonal phytoplankton blooms are responsible for more than half of atmospheric oxygen production on Earth.\nWhy is the Amazon rainforest often described as the lungs of our planet?\nThe Amazon Rainforest has been described as the “Lungs of our Planet” because it provides the essential environmental world service of continuously recycling carbon dioxide into oxygen.\nWhat forest produces the most oxygen?\nIs Amazon forest fully explored?\nRepresenting over half of the remaining rainforest on Earth, the Amazon covers an unimaginable area of approximately 2.5 million square miles. A recent expedition into a previously unexplored and undocumented region in the Brazilian Amazon has found exactly this.\nWhat are three facts about the rainforest?\n9 Rainforest Facts Everyone Should KnowRainforests are a powerful natural climate solution. Tropical forests have become a net carbon emitters. Tropical rainforests cover less than 3% of Earth’s area, yet they are home to more than half our planet’s terrestrial animal species."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1079cd30-c43e-43d1-9166-bbd7c5efa694>","<urn:uuid:9c4c6aae-a70a-4fa7-a999-892b305c3776>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between historical private herbarium collections and modern public herbaria in terms of their accessibility and research value, and how might this evolution continue to impact botanical science?","answer":"Historical private herbaria, starting with medicinal plant collections in the 15th century, were primarily personal collections traded among botanists for individual research. In contrast, modern public herbaria serve multiple functions as museums, libraries, and laboratories, providing broader access and research opportunities. Today's herbaria support scientific research through specimen preservation for species identification, distributional studies, and even forensic evidence. They maintain historical specimens like those from Linnaeus's collection while adding modern documentation including GPS coordinates and barcodes. The transition to public institutions has dramatically increased accessibility, with specimens available year-round regardless of seasonal availability or geographical limitations. The digital transformation is further democratizing access, allowing researchers worldwide to view specimens online. This evolution has expanded research possibilities, enabling studies from basic taxonomy to DNA analysis of century-old specimens, and supporting broader scientific collaboration through specimen sharing between institutions.","context":["Why do we collect plants?\nPeople have been collecting plant specimens since the late 15th century when they were gathered as a reference for medicinal, herbal, or ceremonial uses. Today they are collected and placed in herbaria for scientific research, which includes the positive identification of each known species. These specimens also provide a record of when a plant was growing in a specific place for distributional studies, genetic material for the study of plant systematics, and even to assist forensic scientists when plant evidence is presented in criminal cases.\nIn West Tennessee there’s a special need to collect plant specimens, since over time comparatively little work has been done. Species richness, or how many different species can be found in a defined space, varies greatly across the 21 counties. I’m seeing too much contrast in plant diversity among the counties, and even after considering land development the species richness over all counties is low. More than 3,100 species have been documented from all of West Tennessee, but some counties report fewer than 300 species. This suggests many species are missing from the record, and that perhaps rare or even new species exist here.\n(number of species/km² x 100)\nNOTE: I’m currently gathering the data for each county, and will have it updated soon\nKNOX COUNTY, EAST TENNESSEE (for comparison)\nWhat is a herbarium?\nA herbarium is a natural history collection of preserved plant specimens. These specimens are recorded and stored systematically for study and reference—much like a library. A herbarium is also the name given to a museum where these specimens are housed.\nBelow is a picture taken at the US National Herbarium located in the Smithsonian Institution.\nThere are three herbaria in West Tennessee: The University of Memphis Herbarium, which has been reopened after 30 years in storage, and two small herbaria at Rhodes College and the University of Tennessee Martin. These herbaria support researchers and West Tennessee communities by providing valuable information about the regional flora through their collections and the knowledge of their staff.\nTo learn more about how a herbarium operates and the value of plant collections, click the image below to watch a short video produced by the Botanical Research Institute of Texas.\nHow can I get involved?\nCollecting plants in the field and submitting them to a herbarium\nHelping out in a herbarium to preserve and document collected specimens\nUsing Notes From Nature at home to record label data for imaged specimens\nIf you’re new to plant collecting, see the COLLECTING section of this website for an overview of the process. You can also contact me through this website if you like, and we can set up a time to meet at the University of Memphis where I can go over the procedures of scientific collecting with you. I’m always willing to help out, and I keep an open invitation to anyone who would like to join me on a local collecting trip for first-hand experience.\nIf you’d like to volunteer at the University of Memphis Herbarium, we’d be more than happy to have you join us. When new specimens arrive they need to be mounted on archival paper, documented in the database, and filed away. There’s always a backlog of specimens, and lots of other little projects to be done around the herbarium to keep things going. To visit the herbarium for an orientation, just send a quick message to me saying you'd like to check it out and we'll set up a time for you to come in.","History and Modern Uses of a Herbarium\nThe History of Herbaria\nThe term herbarium was first used as a collection of dried medicinal plants cataloged within a bound book3.\nIn the 16th century, Luca Ghini (1490?-1556) is credited to be the first person to press and preserve plants under pressure, then bind the specimens within a book3. He was a Botany Professor at the University of Bologna, Italy. This practice quickly became the usual practice throughout Europe. Specimens were housed in researchers’ personal collections, and extra specimens were traded with other botanists3.\nPortrait of Italian Botanist Luca Ghini5 (left) and a book containing pressed plant specimens6 (right)\nIn the 18th century, Carl Linneaus (1707-1778), known as the “Father of Taxonomy” was faced with a challenge while preserving plants according to this Italian practice. As his collections expanded, it was difficult to catalog when binding the specimens within a book. He came up with a system that mounted one specimen per large sheet of paper7. After that, it would be cataloged with other closely-related plants and stored in cabinets, which provided room to add new material and allowed the shelves to function as a file cabinet. He decided the sheets of paper should be one size, that way when traded with other botanists, the collection remained uniform7. These standards are still used today, several hundred years later.\nPortrait of Carl Linneaus1 (left), a photograph of his custom built cabinets7 (center), and a specimen of Delphinium grandiflorum from his personal collection4 (right)\nNot only do the standards remain, but so do the specimens. The pressed specimen (above), Delphinium grandiflorum, with blue flowers was in Carl Linneaus’ collection (likely preserved during his lifetime)4. The specimen is now housed at The Linnean Society of London and was photographed in 2001 to be added to a digital collection4. The flowers are still blue, papery and translucent, and pollen is still visible. For a close-up of the specimen, visit http://linnean-online.org/6501/.\nThe Digital Age\nWhile the basic principles of collecting, preserving, and cataloging specimens are generations old, herbaria are not falling behind in the digital age. Many herbaria are no longer housed in private collections, but managed for the general public, usually by museums and universities. In the last ten years, many of the collections have been photographed and made available online, allowing anyone in the world to view the specimens from their home. The University of Washington Burke Herbarium displays their collection digitally with other herbaria on the Consortium of Pacific Northwest Herbaria located at http://www.pnwherbaria.org/index.php. UW Bothell Herbarium is hoping to be published on this website by the end of 2017.\nHow a Herbarium Functions as a Museum, Library, and Lab\nA herbarium is a storage facility that catalogues and holds dried plant specimens secured onto sheets of paper. There are specimens that have been collected by famous scientists, like Luca Ghini and Carl Linneaus. A herbarium is the depository where these plants are stored and exhibited because of their historical and cultural significance. Not only are famous collectors featured, but the rare specimens are too. Some species have become extinct, or are evolving, and having records of the plants that span centuries is invaluable to taxonomy. Museums also house beautiful artwork to look at, and herbarium specimens are no exception. A cross of scientific documentation and artistic composition, many people like to just look through the specimens because they are lovely to look at. Eve Rickenbaker, Collections Manager at the UW Otis Hyde Herbarium in Seattle, says, “It is always Springtime at the herbarium, even on cold gloomy winter days in Seattle. Whenever I feel bad, I just open a cabinet.”\nUW Bothell Herbarium finished specimen showing information placard, herbarium stamp, accession number, and barcode8(left).\nSince plants are collected when reproductive structures are present (flower/fruit) the specimens are available year-round. This allows researchers to view the specimens outside of their seasonal availability. In addition to the collection being available off-season, the collection is also accessible to interested parties that may be physically unable to do their own field work or manage difficult terrain.\nHerbaria collaborate with other herbaria and function as a worldwide library. Instead of walls of book shelves, there are cabinets of plant cards. Once a herbarium is registered officially, it can trade specimens with other herbaria2. If there is a scientist at a UW herbarium studying the plant wapato, Saggitaria latifolia, and she wants to see how the form (phenotype) changes according to geographic location, the UW herbarium can borrow specimens from other North American herbaria. The UW herbarium will host the specimens so the scientist can view a comprehensive collection from many places like Florida, Minnesota, Texas, California, and Alaska all in one room at the same time. When the scientist is finished with her research, the specimens will be returned to the original herbaria.\nA herbarium is also a scientific laboratory and an extension to classrooms for hand-on learning. Real plants, not photographs, are stored, so scientists can use real plant tissues for experiments. Collectors may store extra tissues in an envelope on the plant card for this purpose. Scientists can successfully pull DNA and proteins from the leaves and flowers, even if they are one hundred years old2. A herbarium also has botanical tools, including a microscope, to view the specimens’ small features up close which is an ideal place for students to learn about plant identification and taxonomy.\nInformation Listed with Each Specimen\nOutdoors in the field, the collector will choose a set of plants they want preserved. At this time, they would document what species they are collecting (to the best of their knowledge), as well as valuable information about the ecology and environment. When the collector returns to the lab, they will use a dichotomous key and other resources to help narrow down the identity of the species. This information is listed on the placard (lower right hand corner) which also lists the family name, genus, species, GPS points, collector name, collection number, and date. The herbarium logo and accession number are stamped in an upper corner. This code is the identifying number used to organize the herbarium’s database, and used when the specimen is cited by a scientist. The last item on the specimen is a barcode, which is scanned and helpful when managing the digital collection.\nWritten by Sarah Verlinde, 24 October 2016\nCarl Linneaus portrait [Internet]. 1738 [cited 2016 Oct 24].

{"question":"How do TLR7 and vagus nerve stimulation differ in their biological mechanisms for affecting autoimmune conditions and pain regulation, and what evidence supports their therapeutic potential?","answer":"TLR7 and vagus nerve stimulation work through distinct biological mechanisms. TLR7's role involves inducing interferon-α release, a cytokine increased in lupus patients' serum, though research showed no significant relationship between TLR7 gene copy numbers and lupus symptoms or autoantibody profiles. Meanwhile, vagus nerve stimulation works by stimulating one of the 12 pairs of cranial nerves that run from the brainstem through the neck, chest, and abdomen. VNS functions by interrupting pain signals through electrical pulses delivered to the vagus nerve, showing effectiveness in treating and preventing migraines in clinical trials. While VNS has demonstrated practical therapeutic benefits for migraine treatment, the relationship between TLR7 and autoimmune conditions remains more complex and requires further investigation beyond simple gene copy number variations.","context":["Variation in the relative copy number of the TLR7 gene in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and healthy control subjects.код для вставкиСкачать\nARTHRITIS & RHEUMATISM Vol. 56, No. 10, October 2007, pp 3375–3378 DOI 10.1002/art.22916 © 2007, American College of Rheumatology Variation in the Relative Copy Number of the TLR7 Gene in Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Healthy Control Subjects James Kelley, Martin R. Johnson, Graciela S. Alarcón, Robert P. Kimberly, and Jeffrey C. Edberg Objective. To determine whether there is an increase in the number of TLR7 gene copies in patients diagnosed as having systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and whether gene amplification influences the autoantibody profiles in SLE patients, as has recently been reported in the BXSB/Yaa mouse model of lupus. Methods. We used a modified real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction protocol to calculate the relative TLR7 gene copy number according to the comparative 2–⌬⌬Ct method in 99 SLE patients and 91 healthy controls matched for sex and ethnicity. Autoantibody profiles were determined by standard methods. Results. The relative number of TLR7 gene copies in SLE patients and healthy controls varied; however, no significant concordance between the number of relative gene copies and the SLE phenotype was found. There was also no difference in variation by ethnic group. Comparison of the relative gene copy numbers according to the presence or absence of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), the ANA staining patterns, and the presence or absence of anti-RNA–associated antigen antibody showed no statistically significant difference in the SLE patients. Conclusion. We determined that although the relative gene copy number of TLR7 varied in both SLE patients and healthy controls, it was not significantly increased among our SLE patients as compared with our controls. We found no detectable trend for an association between the relative gene copy number and the autoantibody profile in SLE patients. A recent article in Science (1) reported that a genomic segmental duplication, which included the murine Toll-like receptor 7 (Tlr7) gene, and the translocation of this segment to the Y-linked autoimmune accelerator (Yaa) locus were associated with autoreactive B cell responses to RNA-related antigens. Similar findings of a duplication of the Yaa locus have been independently reported (2). The Yaa locus has previously been shown to increase the severity of lupus-like disease in males of the BXSB mouse strain (3) and to change their autoantibody specificity (4), leading to the suggestion that increased expression of Tlr7 due to this increase in genomic DNA may affect the autoimmune phenotype of these mice. Mouse models can provide important insights into human immune function and disease; however, the mechanisms require careful validation, since many known immunologic differences exist between the two species (5). A role of TLR7 in humans with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is consistent with its ability to induce the release of interferon-␣ (IFN␣), a cytokine that has been shown to be increased in the serum of patients with SLE (6). Since TLR7 is located in a syntenic region of the X chromosome in humans and mice and since an increased prevalence of SLE in women (7) suggests an X-linked genetic component, we sought to determine whether, similar to the findings in the Yaa mouse, there were increased gene copy numbers of TLR7 in humans with SLE.

Relative number of copies of the TLR7 gene in genomic DNA from male and female patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and healthy controls. Relative gene copy number of TLR7 in genomic DNA refers to the ratio of the quantity of TLR7 produced in a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) compared with that of a housekeeping gene, either A, GAPDH or B, HPRT1, as calculated by the 2–⌬⌬Ct method. Each sample was compared with 1 sample that was selected as a calibrator, to allow comparison of the relative amounts between individuals; therefore, these values reflect the comparison of the relative amount and not the absolute copy number. Given that the amount of resulting PCR product corresponds to the amount of genomic template DNA in each subject, the data presented here show no difference in the quantitative level of TLR7 in genomic DNA from SLE patients and healthy controls. Normalization against a housekeeping gene corrects for any sample-to-sample variation in the amount of template genomic DNA present in the PCR product. Symbols represent individual subjects. Bars show the mean ⫾ SD for each group. PATIENTS AND METHODS The relative number of copies of the TLR7 gene in genomic DNA from 50 Caucasian and 49 African-American patients with SLE (55 women and 44 men) along with 91 sexand ethnicity-matched healthy control subjects was determined using a modified real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method similar to that previously described for the detection of copy number polymorphisms in an immunologically related gene family (8). Samples were collected at The University of Alabama at Birmingham. All subjects gave their informed consent, and the Institutional Review Board approved the study. The SLE patients met the revised and updated criteria established by the American College of Rheumatology (9,10). We collected laboratory clinical data from as early as 1998, when available, on 63 of our 99 SLE patients, which included results of tests for anti-DNA antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, antinuclear antibodies (ANAs; including reactivity pattern, such as speckled, homogeneous, or nucleolar), and RNA–associated antigen autoantibodies (including anti-SSA/ Ro, anti-SSB/La, anti-Sm, and anti-RNP). We performed PCR quantitations in quadruplicate for each of the 190 samples, using Assay-by-Design TaqMan primers and FAM-labeled minor groove binder probes (all from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for TLR7 (Xp22.3). Sequences were as follows: for the forward primer, 5⬘-CAGTATTGTGCTGTCTTTGAAATGTAAA-3⬘; for the reverse primer, 5⬘-TGGGCCCAATAGCATCAACT-3⬘; and for the probe, 5⬘-TTGATGTCTTCTCTTTCTC-3⬘. To ensure that only genomic DNA was detected, the primers were designed to span an intron–exon border, and each sample was treated with an RNA-degrading enzyme during the DNA extraction process. We controlled for differences in DNA concentration between samples by normalizing against hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1; Xq26.1) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 12p13), both of which have been previously reported to be housekeeping genes (11). Reactions were conducted on the ABI 7900HT system, and calculations were performed using the 2–⌬⌬Ct method (12,13). Briefly, this method calculates the difference in cycle thresholds (the number of PCR cycles required to produce a set of fixed thresholds) between the gene of interest and a housekeeping gene (⌬Ct). Subsequent calculations normalize the ⌬Ct of each sample to a calibrator that is assigned a relative expression value of 1.00 (⌬⌬Ct). Assuming that the amount of PCR product doubles with each successive PCR cycle, calculating the 2–⌬⌬Ct value will provide the relative amount of DNA initially available for amplification in each quantitative PCR run. Therefore, the 2–⌬⌬Ct method reveals differences in the relative gene copy numbers between the samples tested (12). A range for each expression value was calculated based on the standard deviation(s) of the ⌬⌬Ct value, where 2⫺(⌬⌬Ct ⫹ s) is the lower limit and 2–(⌬⌬Ct ⫺ s) is the upper limit. All statistical TLR7 GENE COPY NUMBER VARIATIONS IN PATIENTS WITH SLE measures were calculated with GraphPad Prism 4.03 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). RESULTS Although the relative number of copies of the TLR7 gene in patients with SLE and in healthy control subjects varied, no significant concordance between the relative number of gene copies and the SLE phenotype was found. There was also no difference in variation by ethnic group. Therefore, we conclude that there is not an increase in relative copy number of the TLR7 gene in our population of SLE patients as compared with our population of controls (Figure 1). Correlational analysis (P ⬍ 0.0001) of both housekeeping genes, which were independently used in this study to normalize the amount of DNA in each sample, demonstrated that either gene could be used separately to calculate relative expression levels of TLR7. We are also confident in the technical precision of this method because the average variation in cycle 3377 number for our PCR results, which were performed in quadruplicate for each of the 3 assays (TLR7, GAPDH, and HPRT1) on each of the 190 samples, was ⬍1% (0.86%) in this measure of intraassay precision (13). Additionally, when this study was repeated on a selection of 22 samples and then a selection of 54 samples (27 with SLE and 27 controls) using all 3 assays on different days, there was a significant correlation between samples for the interassay data (P ⫽ 0.0016) (13). Since the Tlr7 copy number in mice has been shown to influence the titer and pattern of antibodies against nuclear antigens (1), we additionally attempted to correlate the relative gene copy number of TLR7 with autoantibody presence, titer, and pattern. Stratifying the relative gene copy number results by both positive and negative ANA titers, by ANA patterns, and by anti– RNA–associated antigen antibody presence showed neither a statistically significant difference nor an unequal distribution. This finding led us to conclude that the relative gene copy number of TLR7 does not have a significant pattern or relationship to the autoantibody profile in patients with SLE (Figure 2). DISCUSSION Figure 2. Autoantibody profile versus the relative TLR7 gene copy number normalized against HPRT1 in systemic lupus erythematosus patients, by antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity (in a speckled or homogeneous fluorescence staining pattern), ANA negativity, RNAassociated antigen (RNA-AA) autoantibody (anti-SSA/Ro, anti-SSB/ La, anti-Sm, and anti-RNP) positivity, and RNA-AA negativity, and in healthy controls. To eliminate any variation due to sex, only data for the relative copy number of the TLR7 gene normalized against HPRT1 were used in this analysis. The distribution of each pattern among the range of relative gene copy numbers presents no significant relationships, as determined by analysis of variance (P ⫽ 0.7514). Symbols represent individual subjects. Bars show the mean ⫾ SD for each group. While Pisitkun and colleagues (1) demonstrated an example of copy number variation in a gene that influenced a complex disease in mice, their specific finding of a genomic increase in Tlr7 in a murine model of lupus cannot be translated directly to humans with SLE. Our findings in SLE patients do not preclude a role for TLR7 genetic variants, since coding region and/or regulatory variants (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) in the TLR7 gene are largely unexplored. In addition, an increase in the amount of message RNA for TLR7 may influence SLE. We detected variations in the relative copy number of the TLR7 gene among a portion of both the patient and controls samples tested in our study. Due to the presence of this variation in both groups, we could not statistically associate this observed structural variation directly with the SLE phenotype. However, given the complex genetic nature of this autoimmune disease and given that TLR7 has potential functional relevance to SLE (6), we cannot rule out the possibility that copy number variations in TLR7 may influence the genetic background susceptibility for SLE. Since additional genetic variants are associated with lupus-like disease in mice, along with a TLR7 gene copy number variation (1), such a variant in the presence of other genetic 3378 KELLEY ET AL factors may have a contributive, additive effect on the human SLE phenotype in a subset of patients. Another recent study has emphasized sex differences in TLR7 function that might influence the SLE phenotype. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from healthy women release more IFN␣ after TLR-7 stimulation as compared with PBLs from healthy men, an effect that was not seen after stimulation with TLR-9, another inducer of IFN␣ (14). The increase in IFN␣ among PBLs from women was not due to a defect in X chromosome inactivation (14). Our results validate the findings of that study, since a significant difference in the relative TLR7 gene copy number in genomic DNA normalized against GAPDH was observed between men and women (P ⫽ 0.0138). While TLR7 may influence the genetic background of SLE pathogenesis and contribute to the difference in disease prevalence between the sexes, such a contribution in humans cannot be directly attributed to an increase in gene copy number in a standardized quantity of genomic DNA as was seen in the Yaa mouse.

Some help treat the pain of a migraine headache and others help reduce the frequency of attacks. One treatment option currently being explored is vagus nerve stimulation (VNS).\nVNS isn’t considered a widely accessible therapy, but it has been FDA-cleared for the treatment and prevention of migraine and cluster headache.\nIf you’re curious about VNS for migraine, here’s the important information you need to know. You’ll learn about noninvasive VNS devices, how they work, and how much they cost.\nAs the name suggests, VNS is a treatment that stimulates the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is one of 12 pairs of cranial nerves that originate in your brain. These nerves help your brain communicate with your body in a variety of different ways.\nThe vagus nerves — you have one on each side of your body — run from your brainstem down through your neck, chest, and abdomen.\nVNS for epilepsy and depression\nThe VNS device is implanted underneath your skin, and a wire is inserted to connect the device to the vagus nerve. The device sends mild electrical pulses through the vagus nerve, up into your brain. While this may sound intimidating, people with VNS devices don’t typically feel the electrical pulses.\nOnce the device is implanted, people are able to activate it by swiping a magnet in front of their chest.\nNew developments in VNS technology have led to more convenient, noninvasive therapies. These noninvasive therapies are what are currently being used for migraine and cluster headache.\nThe gammaCore device is a handheld VNS device that delivers electrical pulses through the skin. People use it at home by holding the device up against their neck.\nDuring a 2-minute treatment session, the device sends a series of gentle electrical pulses into the skin, toward the vagus nerve. It can be used several times per day to treat migraine pain or on a regular basis to prevent migraine attacks before they start.\nBecause the vagus nerve is one of the main super highways between your brain and your body, stimulating it helps interrupt pain signals and relieve migraine pain.\nIt’s FDA cleared for the treatment and prevention of migraine in adults and adolescents over the age of 12. It’s also FDA cleared for the treatment and prevention of cluster headache in adults.\nFDA-cleared vs. FDA-approved\nIt’s important to understand that many medical devices are FDA cleared and not FDA approved. This has to do with the way devices are regulated in the United States.\nFDA approval is only required for class III medical devices, which are those that pose a significant risk to someone’s health, such as a pacemaker or an insulin pump. Devices that resemble other devices currently on the market that have a proven safety record are typically cleared rather than approved.\nNoninvasive VNS devices such as the gammaCore are FDA cleared for the treatment and prevention of migraine and cluster headache.\nVNS may not work for all individuals with these conditions, but clinical trials have shown that, for many people, it’s more effective than a sham (fake) device at treating migraine headaches.\nIt might be particularly helpful in cases where medications are ineffective in alleviating symptoms.\nPotential side effects\nThe most common side effects of the gammaCore device are redness and discomfort at the application site, along with dizziness. These effects typically resolve quickly after the treatment session is over.\nAnother study also found mixed results from a noninvasive VNS device. While the treatment wasn’t found to be as effective as researchers hoped, it performed well against various points of measurement. For example, participants showed lowered pain intensity and pain relief at various points in the hours following treatment.\nThe 2020 study above suggests that while VNS is effective in migraine treatment, it may not work as well as medications. Still, due to its safety profile, VNS may be preferable over continuously using medications to treat migraine attacks.\nOne of the biggest drawbacks to noninvasive VNS therapy is that it’s not usually covered by insurance. This means it can be cost prohibitive for many people. The gammaCore device is available, with a prescription, for $450 for the first 3 months of treatment. After that, the 3-month refills can be purchased for $600.\nIf VNS is something you want to try for migraine treatment, you may have one option to help lower the financial burden. If you have a flexible spending account or health savings account through work, you may be able to use those pretax dollars to pay some of the out-of-pocket costs.\nResearchers believe that VNS therapy is safe for most people.\nVNS therapy may be a good option for people who can’t take other medications to treat migraine attacks, such as pregnant people or people with heart conditions.\nIt may also be helpful in lowering medication overuse headaches. In fact, it’s thought that VNS may be used multiple times per day without any side effects.\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is another type of noninvasive procedure that produces electrical currents in the brain. TMS is an in-office procedure where you wear a device on your head during each treatment session.\nTMS is primarily used to treat mental health conditions, including depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nOne study reported that TMS may help prevent migraine attacks in people with chronic migraine. Study participants reported fewer attacks, attacks that resolved quicker than usual, and lowered pain intensity.\nIt’s important to talk with a doctor about all migraine treatment options, including up-and-coming therapies such as VNS, as well as conventional treatments. Always ask a doctor before taking any supplements or herbs. These may interact with medications you take.\nConventional migraine treatment options may include abortive (rescue) treatments to stop a migraine attack and preventive medications, such as:\n- Triptans: As perhaps the most common migraine medication, triptans work best when you take them as soon as you start feeling mild symptoms of migraine.\n- Ergotamine drugs: This older class of medications targets migraine pathways to provide pain relief.\n- CGRP antagonists: These are the newest group of medications approved for the prevention of migraine attacks.\n- Botox: Botox injections are an FDA approved treatment for migraine prevention.\n- Pain relievers: Also called analgesics, these work to alleviate pain in multiple areas of the body — not just pain from headaches.\nAdditionally, a doctor may recommend a combination of the following strategies:\nMigraine is a chronic condition that doesn’t have a cure. Researchers are continuing to explore new treatments that help stop migraine attacks and prevent them from happening.\nVNS is one such possibility. While VNS could potentially become a mainstream migraine treatment in the future, it’s not currently FDA approved for such purposes. The treatment measure is also expensive, and may not be appropriate if you have certain underlying conditions.\nIf you’re not seeing results from your current migraine treatment, talk with a doctor about other options you may have. It’s important to keep in mind that, just as migraine triggers may vary, treatment efficacy is highly individual. You may need to try multiple treatments before you find what works for you."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8c79f2f0-e24f-421f-a8bf-0c130ef9a8d7>","<urn:uuid:36cdec80-79f4-4130-adec-033cdc7c2483>"],"error":null}

Among all of the renewable energies, wind energy holds a prominent place because of its high output and the maturity of the technology. However, like all of the other renewable energies, integration of wind energy into the power grid causes some quality and control issues, such as overvoltage or undervoltage and frequency excursion. ^ Other issues include: 1) wind power generation may require a broader safety margin of the capacity reserve, 2) the excessive energy may be rejected by the transmission because of the mismatch between generation and load demand, and 3) induction wind turbines may not be able to ride through a voltage sag event because a critical voltage has to be guaranteed to produce the fundamental magnetic field. ^ To mitigate these issues and build a robust wind power system, a novel structure referred to as a compressed-air-assisted wind energy conversion system (CA-WECS) is proposed in this dissertation. The CA-WECS converts the wind-generated mechanical spillage to compressed air when the wind is a surplus and regenerates power from the compressed air storage when the wind is a deficit. The addition of a compressed air storage subsystem decouples wind power and electric power allowing a higher level of dispatchable generation and providing another degree of freedom for power management. The key component of the new system is a variable displacement machine (VDM), which can work as a compressor or air motor/expander depending on the power gap between wind power and load/command. ^ This work addresses the configuration of the CA-WECS in detail. The functions of the system components are explained and the fundamentals of the proposed VDM are explicitly described. A regulation policy for dispatchable generation is simulated and studied. The economical issues associated with the implementation of the proposed system are split into two parts, the sizing problem and the offering problem. The sizing problem refers to finding the proper sizes of different components for the proposed system. The offering problem refers to determining the appropriate offer to the day-ahead electricity market for a wind farm consisting of the proposed system. A two-stage stochastic framework is used to solve the optimization model each problem. The simulation studies validate the benefits of the proposed system. The results show that renewable generation is increased by 15-20% under various wind conditions, accounting for a 20-30% revenue increment in a dynamic market environment.^\nAlternative Energy|Electrical engineering\nCheng, Jie, \"Configuration and optimization of a novel compressed-air-assisted wind energy conversion system\" (2016).
