{"question":"List the key differences in nitrogen application between fall-planted strawberries after storm damage and normal spring fertilization","answer":"After storm damage in fall, additional nitrogen through drip irrigation should be limited as excess nitrogen can harm root system development rather than help it. The focus should be on proper irrigation to establish healthy roots. For normal spring conditions, fertilizer should not be applied at all during this season as it will soften the fruit. The only recommended fertilization is during rejuvenation after harvest, using an equal analysis fertilizer such as 16-16-16 at 2 lbs per 100 square feet.","context":["Disaster Aftermath: Delayed Planting and Row Covers\nEl inglés es el idioma de control de esta página.

Out of courtesy, I won’t provide pictures of the damages in this forum, unless it is for educational purposes.\nHowever, as you all know, the biggest problem in terms of strawberry is to get the field dry enough to lay plastic, fumigate, and to get planting material in time.\nOverall, the storm has delayed planting dates in many areas for several weeks. In the last two weeks, many of you have approached me and have asked for guidance on how to increase the growth of strawberry plants over a shorter period of time.\nThere is no handbook or silver bullet solution to this situation! The bad news is that there is a good chance that yields will be affected by the storm next year. And for some, it might be too late, no matter what. If fields are still under water or too wet, equipment damaged, etc.\nMy team at NC State University also has decided not to conduct some of my research this year, since it would delay planting even further and wouldn’t make a lot of sense.\nEspecially with varieties such as ‘Camarosa,’ planting dates are more important and play a major role in fruit development and yield capacity.\nHowever, the good news is that there a few things you can do and a few things you should not do to help your plants to get established, even with a late planting date.\nThe enhancement of Growing Degree Days (GDD) in fall might be one of the most important things to consider and I will elaborate on this quite a bit in the following.\nAlso, many have contacted me with the wish to know additional N rates to apply through the drip line, in addition to the pre-plant. Here a few considerations and my thoughts on that:\nA. Be Careful with Nitrogen\nIt is very unlikely that an over-supply of nitrogen will help your plants to grow faster. Please be careful with the amount of additional Nitrogen you intend to apply through the drip tape. An excess of nitrogen can harm the plant’s root system rather help developing it. However, making sure that your beds are well irrigated through the drip line will help to establish a healthy root system.\nB. Using Row Covers to increase Growing Degree Days (GDD)\nGrowing Degree Days (GDDs) are important after dormancy (see Dr. Barclay Polings post).\nHowever, GDDs also play a role during the initial development of the root system and crowns before your plants go into dormancy. Dr. Jeremy Pattison (Driscolls’, CA, former NC State University) did research on GDD improvement in fall over three consecutive years in North Carolina growing regions (Coastal Plains, Piedmont, Sandhills) to improve fruiting capacity and he found that he could as much a 14% of fruiting capacity, compared to non-covered controls.\nModeling Yield of ‘Chandler’ and ‘Camarosa’ as a Function of Accumulated Fall Growing Degree Days and Practical Row Cover Intervention Strategies\nDiscussion With Dr. Jeremy Pattison About 3 Years of Planting Date and Row Cover Research\nRow covers (Figure 1) can be used to increase plant growth in Fall and help to increase GDDs. Different varieties will respond differently to this treatment and there is only limited data and experience available.\nFigure 1: Row covers on or off? (Picture: B. Poling)\nHowever, it is crucial to understand how to use row covers in Fall, so that mistakes can be avoided.\nDr. Pattison’s results show that Fall applications before temperatures dropped below an average daily high of 64 °F can result in a 14% increase in yield compared to the uncovered treatments.\nHis research showed that even late planting dates responded positively to early applications of row covers and resulted in an increase of yield.\nThere is a very good chance that you will be able to increase your crop if you apply row covers in late October/early November.\nPlease only apply row covers if temperatures drop below 64 °F. You should monitor temperatures under the row cover, using a handheld thermometer. You should maintain a temperature between 65-85 F under a row cover.\nC. Water Management\nEven less is known on the water management after a late planting. However, as I have mentioned before, it will be crucial to keep irrigate your plants in order to promote a good root system growth.\nAs always, feel free to ask questions any time and stay safe,","There are two different types of strawberries, June bearing and Everbearing (day-neutral). June bearers will produce one large crop lasting about 2 to 4 weeks in the spring. They are planted the first year and produce a full crop the second year. If properly cared for, they can produce for up to 3-7 years. Everbearing strawberries can produce berries virtually all summer and fall up until frost. The total number of strawberries picked off an Everbearer the entire year seldom equals the volume picked off a healthy plot of June bearers.\nThe correct planting of strawberries is VERY important. It is important for the crown of the root to be planted at the soil level, not below or above with the roots exposed. Also make sure that the roots are not bent. Dig your hole deep enough for the roots to be straight. Plant strawberries at least 4 feet apart and space the plants 1 to 2 feet apart down the row for June Bearers, and 6 inches apart for Everbearers. Do not use a starter fertilizer when planting strawberries, as plant roots are very sensitive and will be burned.\nStrawberries can be grown in most soil types, but they must have good drainage. It water pools after a rain, then that is a sign of bad drainage and the chance for diseases and fruit rot will greatly increase. Select an area with full sun most of the day. Also avoid areas prone to spring frosts. Do not plant strawberries in the same ground were they had been previously grown. Wait at last 3 to 4 years before replanting in the same site.\nAfter planting, the plant will produce flowers. These flowers should be pinched or cut off. By not letting the first year plants fruit they will produce more runners earlier in the season. These runners need to be pulled into the row and then they “peg” or grow roots and become new plants. You should try to have a new plant every 6 inches in every direction in a matted row that is 12 to 18 inches wide. Allowing plants to be closer than 6 inches will crowd the plants and they will produce smaller and less fruit. DO NOT ALLOW YOUR PLANTING TO OVERPOPULATE. Keep weeds under control, and place runners were you want them In the late fall of the first year you should cover your planting with a straw mulch. This protects them from cold winters, moderating the temperature. Mulch until you can no longer see any of the green through the covering. You should mulch after the third evening of A HARD frost or freeze. Usually just after Thanksgiving in most northern states. It is all right to mulch over frozen ground.\nRemove the straw mulch in early spring (when growth starts). DO NOT allow plants to turn yellow under the straw. Remove the straw by parting it slightly allowing for a narrow row 12 to 18 inches wide to grow up through the mulch. Keeping the parted straw up against the narrow row will allow the fruit to sit on the straw bed while ripening. This will create a barrier to protect the fruit from rain splashing dirt up onto the fruit. This is important as many of the fruit rots come from the soil.. The thick straw mulch between rows will also help in weed control. DO NOT apply fertilizer in the spring as it will soften the fruit. Remember that frosts can will the blossoms, and to protect your plants with row covers. We sell row covers by the foot, or in pre-cut packages. Small green fruit are seldom affected by frosts. Keep the planting well watered while the fruit is ripening (1 inch per week). Make sure to pick ripe berries, unpicked berries will attract beetles. Pick every 2 to 3 days at maximum ripeness. It is normal for berry size to decrease as the season goes on. The later fruit is smaller but the flavor is usually great.\nRejuvenating your patch after harvesting is very important. First mow the leaves off. DO NOT MOW SO LOW THAT YOU DAMAGE THE CROWNS. Trimming off the old leaves will decrease the disease problems for the rest of the summer. Second, lightly fertilize your patch with an equal analysis fertilizer such as Anderson’s 16-16-16 at 2 lbs. per 100 spare feet. Third, till between the rows narrowing down the row to 10 to 12 inches. This is a very hard process for many people as they think they are destroying their patch. Thinning the rows will ensure a longer lasting, producing patch.\nThis type is grown differently than June bearers. You can harvest a crop the first year after planting. Most people remove the first set of blossoms form the newly planted plant. This allows the plant to become better established before trying to produce fruit. After removal of the first blossoms, straw mulch around the plants to provide a nice bed for the fruit to lie on. Remove most of the runners that form so as not to overpopulate the bed. Help runners you do want to have root by pushing them through the straw bed to be in contact with the soil. You should be able to harvest three months from planting, harvesting from July until frost the first year.\nEverbearers may be planted in hanging baskets, barrels, flower boxes, through plastic mulch and numerous other ways. They can be used on slopes, terraces, even in shaded areas. Even when grown solid, they will produce some fruit along the edges. The dark green foliage is attractive and the color remains though most of the year.\nIf grown on well drained soil, properly thinned and rejuvenated, diseases should not be a major problem. Strawberries will naturally show some leaf spots, and unless they cover the leaves completely, they will not cause serious long term problems.\nAllstar- With an almost perfect strawberry shape, Allstar has become a major variety during the late mid-season time. The glossy firm fruit, which holds its size very well, is an excellent u-pick or home garden choice. High yields and very large fruit along with Allstar’s vigor and resistance to red stele, verticillium wilt, moderate resistance to powdery mildew and leaf scorch makes it suitable to almost any growing region and soil condition.\nHecker- With high yields, medium size fruit with firm skin, Hecker is a great choice for all summer enjoyment.\nFort Laramie- This is an older Everbearing variety with firm, wedge-shaped fruit, glossy red-fleshed fruit. Very good quality with an appetizing aroma. Very good processing strawberry."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6d2c8ce0-8297-4062-8a6d-9c02bb617294>","<urn:uuid:e00d9516-09d8-4d84-a773-4ee527f73132>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What similarities and differences exist between Mong-Lan's and Tagore's approaches to multicultural artistic expression?","answer":"Both artists embraced multicultural influences, but expressed them differently. Mong-Lan incorporated diverse cultural elements from her experiences in multiple countries including Mexico, France, Switzerland, Argentina, Indonesia, Thailand, and Japan into her poetry and artwork, which has been exhibited internationally. Her work spans poetry, visual art, and tango-inspired creations. Tagore, on the other hand, specifically focused on bridging East and West, creating Western-inspired educational systems in India and developing a multilingual, multi-ethnic, and multicultural pedagogy.

Since the 21st century may turn out to be the Chinese/Indian century or the century of the global south, we will likely hear more, not less, about Tagore.\nLast year, during the 150th anniversary of Tagore’s birth, the West learned much about the “Shakespeare of India.” He is one of the world’s best-known poets, and in the East, the term poet still means something greater than a writer of verse. A blend of Dr. Seuss, Socrates and Shakespeare would only begin to approach the reach of Tagore in the Indian imagination. His work is studied by every schoolchild from Gujarat, on the Arabian Sea, to Kolkata, Tagore’s birthplace, on the Bay of Bengal. In the United States, where there are more Indians than Episcopalians, and in Canada, where there are more Indians than Muslims, one can easily find millions schooled on Tagore’s ideas.\nPrimarily Tagore is remembered for his contributions to education, religion and politics.\nAs an educator, he created an alternative school that grew into a university. It was informed by what we now commonly refer to as the values of the “global village.” His pedagogy was multilingual, multi-ethnic and multicultural. He valued all religious traditions and taught that all people could and should realize the wonders of “the expansion of the human spirit.” This shocked the protectors of the caste system, in which he himself had been raised.\nIn religion also Tagore forged an original path. He built upon the broad possibilities in his native Hinduism, expanding the message of divine love and embrace to people of all faiths and backgrounds. He attempted to overcome barriers between people of faith. At Oxford University in 1930, he said, “The God of humanity has arrived at the gates of the ruined temple of tribe.”\nPolitically, Tagore was a defender of Indian nationalism. But he often spoke against any nationalism that leads to separatism because his first loyalty was to humankind. “Pride patriotism is not for me,” he once famously said. “I earnestly hope that I shall find my home anywhere in the world before I leave it.”\nPersonally, Tagore grew familiar with death; he lost his mother while still a boy and later grieved over the suicide of his sister-in-law. When he was 41, his beloved wife, Mrinalini, died, followed by the deaths of three of his children, all under 10. His poems are full of searching for love, dwelling in darkness and offerings of everyday moments to God.\nMore than a poet and educator, Tagore was also a novelist, a playwright, a musician, a social reformer, a visual artist, a philosopher and the author of hundreds of short stories and morality tales. His verses are sung as the national anthems of India and Bangladesh. A polymath from a wealthy Brahmin family, he used much of his wealth to create Western-inspired educational systems for the children of India. He traveled in the West to learn how East and West might create a sustainable future together.\nTagore’s intellectual path was similar to that of his contemporary, Mohandas Gandhi. Both men traveled to England as teenagers. After taking classes at the University of London in English literature, Tagore said he felt East and West meeting in friendship inside of him. He spent the next decade in rural East Bengal managing his family’s estates. There he began to eschew his aristocratic lifestyle, becoming his country’s most innovative social reformer and educator. He did this by making art that was accessible to the average Indian and by writing novels, like Home and the World, and plays, like “The Immovable,” that revealed the corrupt influence the religious elite can have on politics.\nBoth Tagore and Gandhi were deeply religious men. But Tagore shared neither Gandhi’s asceticism nor his view that asceticism would somehow save the poor and oppressed in Indian society. The two men debated important issues, including the purpose of war and how India might best gain independence. Early on, Tagore criticized the spiritualizing of Gandhi’s principle of satyagraha, or passive resistance, writing: “Passive resistance is a force which is not, in itself, necessarily moral. It can be used against truth as well as for it.” The notion that the current generations of living Indians should sacrifice their educations, their families, their very lives for the cause of satyagraha was never acceptable to Tagore.\nW. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound and others trumpeted Tagore’s writings; they had heard his public readings in London after the 1912 publication of Gitanjali: Song Offerings. Still, Tagore was rarely understood in the West. He lectured often in the United States, but Americans, seeing the poet’s flowing beard as he read his mystical verse, regarded him as one who had just stepped out of a Bengali forest. Gitanjali, still in print and widely read, sounds as if phrases were lifted directly from the King James Bible. “Here is thy footstool,” one verse begins. “Thou hast made me endless,” begins another. In translating his own work, Tagore retained constructions that were older, hence alluring. The book became a bestseller because the language was more, not less, florid and fantastic than the contemporary idiom. In 1913, to the surprise of the world’s literati, Tagore was named the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.\nHe lived to see his homeland on the cusp of independence, something Tagore had spent much of a century working for, but he was a citizen of more than India.\nThough Tagore lived through World War I and witnessed some devastations of the next war, he could see beyond the violent destruction. In his final public lecture on April 14, 1941, Tagore said: “As I look around I see the crumbling ruins of a proud civilization strewn like a vast heap of futility. And yet I shall not commit the grievous sin of losing faith in Man. I would rather look forward to the opening of a new chapter in his history after the cataclysm is over and the atmosphere rendered clean with the spirit of service and sacrifice.”\nHis values and worldview still resonate for those who seek to bring about the kingdom of God. For Tagore urged being conscious of the ways the natural, human and divine world commingle; developing a sense of wonder that lives beyond childhood; and holding within ourselves the kinship of all other human beings.\nToday, one most easily finds Tagore’s books in New Age shops. But that is unfortunate, for he was a realist and a lover of truth. Embracing the world while standing with both feet firmly planted among his native people earned him the reputation of a prophet. More important, Tagore was a profoundly human being.\nBrowse the poetry of Rabindranath Tagore."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7452f55e-0ee1-427f-ac0c-a3db363a8b0f>","<urn:uuid:dda4e2dc-f92e-4f7a-a470-bde28280ab47>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do manual knife sharpeners compare to diamond sharpening steel in terms of effectiveness and ease of use?","answer":"Manual knife sharpeners and diamond sharpening steel have distinct characteristics. Manual sharpeners feature non-motorized wheels or V-shaped chambers and have tall walls to keep the knife steady, making them user-friendly and effective for various commercial kitchen knives. They're also affordable and can handle full bolster knives. Diamond sharpening steel, measuring 10-14 inches in length, is made of monocrystalline diamonds and is valued by chefs for its durability and fast sharpening capability. However, it has grooves that make it more challenging to use compared to other tools, and requires a non-slip grip to prevent dropping during use.","context":["Kitchen safety includes using the right tools to sharpen knives when they get dull. You can injure yourself with a dull knife, and you’ll slow down your cooking time if you don’t have properly sharpened knives to work with. There’s an entire industry built around knife supplies, and new and old sharpening tools are available for you to choose from. Your decision will boil down to what you can afford, how often you cook and how you use your knives.\n1 - Electric Knife Sharpeners\nSharpen knives with serrated or straight blades using an electric knife sharpener. A quality one will sharpen knives and polish them. They are built with angle guides so that you don’t have to worry about placing the knife just right, the way you would with free hand sharpening. When you place the knife in the machine, it does the work for you.\n2 – Diamond Sharpening Steel\nThese are handy tools to have in your apartment kitchen to sharpen knives. They are a round piece of steel made of monocrystalline diamonds, with a handle for you to grip and use it easily. Chefs recommend diamond steel because of its durability, and because it sharpens knives fast. Be sure to buy one with a non-slip grip, because it’s frustrating to drop the steel in the middle of sharpening. A steel with a ring attached to the handle will also make storage easy. Buy one that measures from 10 to 14 inches in length, which is suitable for most (if not all) of your kitchen knives.\n3 – Ceramic Sharpening Steel\nIf you want to sharpen knives with fine blades, then go ceramic. Like the diamond sharpening steel, a ceramic sharpening steel is round with a handle for gripping. You don’t have to worry about these breaking on you, because they won’t. Weight is not an issue either, even though it’s ceramic. The kind that you’ll use in in the kitchen are lightweight. It’s also a smooth steel, which is easier to use than diamond steels, because those have grooves.\n4 – Sharpening Stones\nKnife sharpening stones are an alternative to sharpening steels. Three kinds most often used to sharpen knives in the kitchen are water stones, diamond stones and bench stones. When you’re working with these, you should by a coarse stone and a fine stone, to cover the different types of kitchen knives you own. A size that’s at least 6 inches long and 2 inches wide should meet your needs. You will be doing free hand sharpening when using stones to sharpen knives. Acquire the skills to do it by watching a friend, watching a video or taking a basic cooking class before attempting it. You can also buy a knife guide to help angle the blade on the stone, and hold it in place a little, as you sharpen.\nRemember to stay safe while you sharpen knives. Focus on the job at hand, and keep your hands and feet out of the way. If a knife does slip as you sharpen it, it should fall to the floor or counter top without hurting you.","Table of Contents Hide\nJapanese knives are among the best globally but are useless if not sharp enough.

If you sharpen unnecessarily, you remove those metal pieces unnecessarily, making your knife wear out quickly.\nBut this doesn’t mean that you’ll have to wait for your knife to be blunt to sharpen it. As stated above, it will make the process hard and take much of your time. Regarding this, you may wonder the best time to sharpen a Japanese knife? Here is the answer;\nThe Best Time to Sharpen a Japanese Knife\nWhen you notice that your knife has started becoming dull in its operations, it’s time to have its edge sharpened. It involves the removal of some amounts of metal using a sharpener. Knife sharpeners come in various categories as follows;\nKnife Sharpeners used to Sharpen Japanese Knives\nI. An Electric Knife Sharpener\nMost chefs love using electric knife sharpeners because they are easy to use. Since the sharpeners are electric, the abrasives rest on motorized wheels, which turn against the blade. Most manufacturers offer user instructions to avoid mistakes.\nAfter putting on the sharpener, hold your knife to the abrasive lightly, but secure enough not to avoid the knife falling off. The machine comes with various slots for sharpening. Place your knife’s blade in the ideal space, smoothly and slowly. Then allow the device to do its work.\nThis method is ideal for less valuable Japanese knives. Sharpen your precious knives from Japan with a whetstone (will be discussed hereinbelow). A wrong move with an electric knife sharpener can ruin your priced and valued knife.\nElectric knife sharpers get recommended because of the following benefits;\nAdvantages of an Electric Knife Sharpener\n- The machines contain several grinding slots with different blade coarseness to prevent over-sharpening.\n- The first slot comes aggressive to repair extensive damage quickly.\n- Thanks to the spring-loaded guides that restrict the knife from moving to allow a steady contact of its blade with the abrasive, the sharpening process is easy.\nWith the above benefits, it doesn’t mean that electric sharpeners do not have some shortcomings. They include the following;\nDisadvantages of Electric Knife Sharpeners\n- You will need to dig deeper into your pockets to own one\n- If your knife has a full bolster, sharpening it with an electric machine is impossible.\nII. Manual Knife Sharpeners\nUnlike the electric sharpeners, these devices consist of non-motorized wheels or a V-shaped chamber for the abrasive material. While sharpening your knife, you need to pull the blade through the section using consistent pressure. If unsure of how to sharpen your knife, check the instructions manual that comes with the machine.\nManual knife sharpeners have won the hearts of many chefs globally. Are you wondering why? Here is the insight;\nAdvantages of Manual Knife Sharpeners\n- Most users can afford them\n- The machines come with tall walls responsible for keeping the knife steady while the user draws it through the sharpening chamber using constant pressure\n- The devices consist of thin bodies, making them easy to store in a kitchen drawer for convenient use.\n- Sharpens various commercial kitchen knives excellently and fast\n- Perfectly sharpens full bolster knives\nThe machines seem perfect but come with the following drawback;\nDisadvantages of Manual Knife Sharpeners\n- The sharpener cannot repair a severely damaged blade, such as removing notches\nLike their name, they are devices that look like stone and come designed to sharpen knives. You can buy one from a store next to you. Using a whetstone requires practice and a set procedure. Here is how to use one;\nHow to Sharpen Your Japanese Knife Using a Whetstone\nStep 1: Place the Stone Securely on a Countertop\nThe first thing to do is to set the whetstone securely. If your whetstone does not come with a unique stand for holding it firm while sharpening your knife, place a damp paper towel or rubberized shelf liner under it.\nStep 2: Start Sharpening One of the Knife’s Sides\nTurn the knife’s blade away from you and place it on the whetstone. Hold the knife’s handle with one hand and its middle part with your other hand. Ensure your fingers stay flat. Also, avoid the knife’s sharp edge. Then start pushing the blade down and in a circular motion.\nMaintain holding the exact angle of the blade until the knife’s tip runs off to the other side. Keep on doing it until the knife’s dullness disappears.\nStep 3: Confirm the First Side’s Sharpness\nAfter several rounds of gliding the knife’s blade against the whetstone, check whether it has gotten sharpened enough. Test by running your thumb perpendicularly to your knife’s blade edge. If you feel the burr from the knife’s handle to its tip, that side’s sharpness is okay.\nStep 4: Sharpen the Other Side\nSwitch your knife to the other direction and start sharpening using the same process. Repeat several times until the sharpness is as intended.\nStep 5: Turn the Whetstone on Fine Side and Repeat the Sharpening of Both Sides\nA whetstone consists of a fine and rough side. The above sharpening process begins with the coarse side. After sharpening, turn the whetstone to the fine side and repeat the sharpening procedure until both sides get optimally sharpened.\nLike other sharpening methods, whetstones come with several benefits. Here is what you’ll enjoy when you sharpen your knife using a whetstone;\nAdvantages of Whetstones\n- The sharpeners come at pocket-friendly prices\n- You will enjoy the device’s services for many years\n- It adapts excellently as the user holds the knife at an angle that matches the blade\n- Whetstone sharpens knives with full bolster\n- It contains a fine and coarse side for regulating the sharpness\nAs someone not familiar with using a whetstone, you may not like the following;\nDisadvantages of a Whetstone\n- Restoring a dull blade may take long\n- Using this device requires practice, which might take time to master\nFor optimal results, you need to soak your whetstone while sharpening your knife. But avoid over-soaking as it will reduce the whetstone’s quality. Always dry the sharpening stone with a dry, clean towel (read our article on how to clean a Japanese knife.) after using it. Then place it in an airy place to dry. It is advisable to store it while wrapped in a towel to guarantee dryness and prevent it from getting molds.\nAs explained above, sharpening a Japanese knife can be done in many ways. But whatever method you choose, you need to consider some things for safety and maximum results. The following are things to note when sharpening a Japanese knife;\nEssential Things to Put in Mind While Sharpening a Japanese Knife\n- You may need to touch the blade directly to test the degree of sharpness. It would help if you were careful because the sharp edge can cut you.\n- Avoid sharpening the blade’s edge so thinly. As a result, the cutting edge may develop nicks that make it lose its sharpness.\n- While sharpening the knife, handle it with care as the blade keeps on getting thinner as you sharpen it.\nAfter spending time sharpening your knife, you may wonder if you’ve done an incredible job. To know whether your knife is sharp, you can carry out the following tests;\nHow To Check a Sharp Knife\n1) Paper Test\nIt’s a straightforward procedure. You only need to use your knife’s blade to shave thin paper strips. If your knife is sharp, it will cut through the paper smoothly and very fast. A blunt knife may get caught as you cut the paper and leave jagged edges. While carrying out this test, both the paper and knife shouldn’t be wet or damp for optimal results.\n2) Food Method\nUsing food is the best method to test your knife’s sharpness. You can cut or slice vegetables like onions, tomatoes, and scallion. If the blade cuts precise slices quickly without squashing the food item, then its sharpness is okay.\nIf you find yourself exerting more pressure to cut the vegetable, and it seems squashed or damaged, it means that your knife is dull or blunt.\n3) Nail Test\nTake your knife and gently place its blade on one of your fingernails. Do not apply pressure but use the knife’s weight to press into the nail. If the edge digs a little into your nail, your knife is sharp. If it slips across your nail, the blade is blunt or dull.\nNow that your Japanese knife is well-sharpened and ready for the task, you need to be careful how you store it. Keeping the sharp blade with other cutlery and small kitchen tools is not a wise decision. The knife’s sharp edge may damage other things stored together. You may also cut yourself if stored poorly or in a place you can’t spot it.\nThe sharp knives may also become dull fast when they slid against other metal items. To avoid all these problems, here is how you should store your sharp knife.\nHow to Store a Sharp Japanese Knife\ni. Magnetic Knife Blocks\nThey are accessories designed to store sharp knives. The blocks contain magnets that help stick the knives safely onto the board. But according to experts, the magnetic blocks and racks may make the knives’ molecular level misalign.\nii. Non-Magnetic Knife Blocks\nThe blocks are the opposite of the magnetic ones discussed above. Instead of having magnets to stick the knives, the block comes with slots for storing the blades. Consider the size and design of your knife before buying one. Some knives may not fit in these blocks. The best option is to buy a universal knife block with slots of various sizes.\niii. Wall-Mounted Magnetic Blade Strips\nIt comes as a strip incorporated with magnets. You only need to mount it on your kitchen wall then place the sharp knives on them. Because of the attraction, the blades will stick securely, freeing up your kitchen drawer. If you have many knives to store, consider a long strip.\niv. Knife Saya\nA knife Saya is a protective sheath made for storing blades. It is an individual cover that keeps the knife safe and looking better. The polypropylene material used in making the Saya makes it safe to store with other cutlery and kitchen tools.\nAs illustrated above, it is essential to use a sharp knife. It will help you prepare a delicious meal fast and ensure your foodstuffs’ taste and texture remain intact. Because of their many uses, Japanese knives usually go dull or blunt.\nFortunately, there are various ways of sharpening a dull knife, as discussed above. Please do not allow your knife to become extremely blunt to sharpen it. You will use more time and energy to bring it back to its functional state. To avoid that, sharpen your knives often.\nAvoid keeping sharp knives with other kitchen tools, as explained above. They may chip or become damaged. Cutlery or small metal items may suffer from scratches or dents from the sharp blade. Use the storing methods explained above to store knives. Also, consider the discussed tips when sharpening your Japanese knife."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e65197f1-763a-4f28-8f6a-1aea094b4ee2>","<urn:uuid:818762e6-934d-41f3-b48e-93fddc9da959>"],"error":null}

In England, they earn an NVQ Diploma, Diploma, Functional Skills and Employment Rights and Responsibilities. In Wales, they receive an NVQ Diploma, Diploma, Essential Skills and Employment Rights and Responsibilities. In Scotland, they obtain an Industry Approved Qualification. Additionally, all apprentices achieve an NVQ or SVQ qualification that enables them to qualify for industry card schemes necessary for site access.","context":["About CITB Apprenticeships\nA CITB Apprenticeship combines on-site experience with college learning to provide the right balance of training and real life experience.\nWhat is a CITB Apprenticeship?\nA CITB Apprenticeship usually lasts between two and four years depending on where you are based and what level of qualification you are studying for. During this time you will be allocated an Apprenticeship Officer to support and guide you through your training programme.\nSee details of what a CITB Apprenticeship can offer you below.\nAs an apprentice, you will:\n- be in full-time employment\n- be paid at least National Minimum Wage for Apprentices - many apprentices earn considerably more\n- gain a nationally recognised qualification\n- get hands-on experience to help you develop the skills you need to kick start a successful career.\nOn the job training is structured and agreed with your employer to ensure you learn the right skills.\nOff the job training is arranged for you at a college or training centre. You can complete this training on day release or over consecutive days in a series of blocks.\nPlastering, scaffolding, bricklaying and carpentry are just a few of the many different apprenticeships available in construction. You might be familiar with some of the choices, but there are plenty of others that might just surprise you. You can find out more about what's available on Go Construct.\nLevels of apprenticeship\nThe CITB Apprenticeship Scheme offers apprenticeships at three levels, depending on where you live in Great Britain:\n- Level 2 - which is equivalent to GCSEs/Standard Grades\n- Level 3 - which is equivalent to A Levels/Highers\n- Level 4 - which is equivalent to Foundation Degree/Advanced Highers.\nAn apprenticeship to Level 2 takes two years to complete. Apprentices may continue for an additional year to achieve Level 3.\nA Level 4 is for people who want to progress into Technical, Design and Management careers.\nWhat will I be doing as an apprentice?\nYou'll be working for a company operating in the construction industry. The days are often long and it can be hard work but the rewards are excellent if you stick with it.\nEmployers vary in size from small businesses to large national and even international companies, so there could be plenty of opportunity to travel, maybe even abroad. You may also need to live away from home, so being independent will help you adjust quickly to your new life.\nNaturally, you'll start at the bottom of the ladder learning how to do everything correctly, but as your skills and knowledge increase you'll be given more demanding, challenging and rewarding tasks. Many employers started out as an apprentice themselves and are now running their own successful businesses.\nYour day will normally start before 8am, so that means you'll have to be up early to get to the site or workshop and you'll usually have to find your own way there. As well as leaving enough time for travelling, you'll also need to make your own arrangements to get there.\nThere is a minimum wage of £95 per week to start with but if you work hard and your skills and experience increase, so will your wage. Some employers pay more than this from the outset.\nApprentices don't save all their money, some of it will be needed for your new social life with the friends you've met at work and college. You'll have to keep some back to buy some quality tools as well, as this is just the start of your life as a tradesman and having the right equipment is vital if you want to progress.\nYou'll constantly learn new skills at college and put them into practice in a real working environment. These skills are vital to your apprenticeship and you'll need to record what you've done in your qualifications portfolio to prove you are competent in your chosen trade.\nFind out what apprentices think of their careers at Go Construct\nQualifications as well as skills\nMost apprentices follow a Traditional Apprenticeship route, which combines college (or training provider) attendance with learning on site.\nCITB also offers Specialist Apprenticeship Programmes which include training from a corporate manufacturer or trade association instead of college.\nAs part of your apprenticeship, you will achieve an NVQ or SVQ which is the main qualification to show you can do your job. You can also use this to qualify for one of the industry card schemes, which are essential for getting on site.\nThe following qualifications will also be part of your apprenticeship:\n- England - NVQ Diploma, Diploma, Functional Skills and Employment Rights and Responsibilities\n- Wales - NVQ Diploma, Diploma, Essential Skills and Employment Rights and Responsibilities\n- Scotland - Industry Approved Qualification\nSpecialist Apprenticeship Programmes\nCITB Specialist Apprenticeships have been designed with trade associations and independent training groups. They provide training for those sectors and employers that can't access specialist apprenticeships through local colleges or training providers.\nPeople working in specialist trades need to be very flexible with learning, so Specialist Apprentice Programmes allow apprentices to learn mostly while on the job.

{"question":"What are the current challenges facing the development of aquaculture? I'm researching industry constraints.","answer":"The main challenges facing aquaculture development include: 1) Shortage of fertilizers in developing countries, as they're primarily allocated to agriculture, 2) Increasing prices and limited availability of fish meal, which is a crucial ingredient in fish feeds, 3) Environmental concerns about water discharge containing fish metabolites that might lead to eutrophication in recipient waters, though this requires authentic proof to establish aquaculture as a polluter, 4) Regulatory discharge requirements in some countries, and 5) Aquatic pollution from agricultural pesticides, domestic wastes, trade effluents, and oil spills that adversely affect aquaculture operations.","context":["However, much has happened since it went up, including the Blogger outage. Scroll down for a report on that. More new posts will be added below this one.\nThe expressions capture and culture fisheries are self-explanatory. In the former, one reaps the aquatic harvest without having to sow, whereas, in the latter, one has to sow Rice duck farming feasibility study seed, nurse it, tend it, rear it and harvest it when it grows to marketable size.\nExamples of capture fisheries are the natural fisheries of the seas, estuaries, rivers, lagoons, large lakes etc. Pen culture, cage culture, culture in running waters, in recirculating systems and in reconditioned water are special types of aquaculture.\nAll shades of intermediate stages between true capture and culture fisheries exist such as in man-made-lakes, which are stocked extraneously but where no manuring, fertilizing and feeding are generally done.\nThe principles of management of capture and culture fisheries are very different from each other. In the case of capture fisheries one has to attempt to harvest maximum sustainable yield by regulating fishing effort and mesh after taking into account parameters of population dynamics such as rates of recruitment, natural and fishing mortalities, fish growth and size at which recruitment occurs.\nManagement of capture fisheries requires knowledge of the dynamics of the fish populations under exploitation. The extended exclusive economic zone of miles brings into focus the national and international complexities of regulating the capture fisheries of the seas and the oceans and apportionment of the marine harvest because fish populations do not abide by man-made boundaries.\nIn the case of culture fisheries, no detailed knowledge of the population dynamics of the cultivated finfish or shell fish is involved. Here, one has to breed, if one technically can, the chosen fish under controlled conditions, if it does not breed naturally, and develop fish husbandry practices so as to be able to formulate economically viable technologies.\nFor effective aquaculture, one has to gain familiarity and control water quality to enhance its biological productivity; one has to understand fish nutrition so as to be able to formulate nutritionally balanced fish diet; one has to delve deep into fish genetics so as to be able to evolve new varieties and strains which bestow commercial advantages to the product in terms of superior growth rate, nutritive value, bonelesness, taste, odour etc.\nWith this background information, a definition of aquaculture can be attempted. The crop may be that of an animal or a plant.\nNaturally, the organism cultured has to be ordained by nature as aquatic.

Water chestnut Trapa natans. During the last decade or so there has been noticeable a global upsurge for aquaculture.\nSome of the factors which have contributed to the upsurge are: Increased and continuously rising cost of fishing operations due to steep rise of the price of fuel. Fear of reduction in marine fish landings by countries that depend on fishing in the territorical waters of other countries as a result of the new laws of the sea of miles exclusive economic zone.\nA persistent demand in most developed countries for high cost species like shrimps and prawns. This has greatly promoted interest in aquaculture in countries that wish to increase their foreign exchange earnings.\nThe behaviour of one of the world's most productive capture fisheries viz. Factors which have been unfavourable to the development of aquaculture are: Shortage of fertilizers in most developing countries and their allocation to agriculture.\nIn this respect, there is a measure of conflict between agriculture and aquaculture. Increasing prices and even the availability of fish meal, which, as stated earlier, is the ingredient of most fish-feeds. This is linked with the Peruvian Anchovy crisis, which, apart from aquaculture, adversely hit agriculture, through scarcity of guano and fertilizer, and poultry industry through scarcity of fish meal.\nThis has led to search for cheaper protein substitutes in fish feeds and spurt of research activity in that direction in different countries. While a general global environmental consciousness has ameliorated aquatic pollution and has thus helped fish culture, aquaculture itself is considered by some as a polluting agent, through release of water containing fish metabolites leading to eutrophication in the recipient waters, which may be a stream or a river or another kind of natural water-body.\nDischarge regulations which are applicable to aquaculture by authorities in some countries.

{"question":"What are the key differences in Christmas meal traditions between Canadian and Russian Orthodox celebrations?","answer":"Canadian Christmas meals typically feature a breakfast of ham, eggs or pancakes, followed by lunch with stuffed turkey, potatoes, cranberry sauce, and desserts like Christmas pudding or plum. In contrast, Russian Orthodox Christmas meals are strictly regulated by the Nativity Fast, consisting of 12 meatless dishes (representing the Twelve Apostles) called the Holy Supper. This Russian meal includes dishes like kutya (a mixture of nuts, seeds, dried fruits, and honey), borsch, solyanka, and traditional drinks such as kompot and sbiten'. The Russian Christmas Eve meal begins only after the first star appears in the sky.","context":["Canada is a multicultural country, where people from different backgrounds have made it their home. Christmas in Canada is a holiday; it is customary for people to exchange gifts, enjoy a special meal together and attend a church service on this day i.e. 25th of December. In provinces of Canada such as Quebec, people celebrate not only on Christmas Day, but also on Christmas Eve. Although the birth of Christ is rejoiced similarly in most parts of the world, the Canadians have incorporated and developed their own customs and traditions. For example, the Christmas Tree, Advent Calendars and the Gingerbread House have had their origin from Germany while the concept of Greeting Cards was introduced by the British. The Irish initiated decoration of lights on their windows, the United States introduced them to the popular Santa Claus and the French gave them the idea of Creche and Carols. Owing to this, a Canadian Christmas is a mixture of various cultures from all over the world.\nChristmas Traditions and Customs In Canada\nChristians in Canada who follow the Eastern Orthodox tradition celebrated the birth of Jesus on January 7th while the Armenian Apostolic Church marked January 6th as the birth of Jesus.\nFamilies in Canada tell the story of the mythical figure called Santa Claus, who was believed to travel around the world on a sledge powered by a rain-deer. He entered the homes of kids through a chimney to deliver gifts and candy into Christmas stockings. During this time, people of the house exchange gifts which could range from toys, games, chocolates, music and clothes to luxury items such as watches and wine.\nCelebrations In Different Provinces\nIn some provinces of Canada, Eskimos celebrate Sinck Tuck which is a winter festival accompanied by dance. In Nova Scotia, 'masked mummers' are known to visit the neighbourhood with loud ringing bells and sought candy and other gifts. Then, the host would try to identify the mummer, failing which the loud ringing sounds continue! On guessing right, the mummer would be revealed. In the same province, people sing carols and songs on the Christmas morning. In Quebec, creches are displayed as part of Christmas celebrations. In Labrador City in Newfoundland, houses are decorated with lights and gardens will have ice sculptures.\nA traditional Christmas Day in Canada starts with ham, eggs or pancakes. Lunch typically would comprise of stuffed or dressed roast turkey, potatoes and cranberry sauce, savoury snacks such as oranges or mandarin, nuts and butter tarts and finally, the Christmas pudding or plum. Numerous sweets such as barley candy and chicken bones (creamy milk chocolate once melted) are served.\nA few families in Canada like to conduct cookie baking parties. Here, a cake is baked and cookies are exchanged. At the end of the party, each guest goes home stomach- full!\nLa Fete du Roi\nChristmas season ends on January 6th with people in Quebec celebrating an event called \"La Fete du Roi. During this time, a cake is baked and a bean is placed in the middle of it. The person who is lucky enough to discover the bean is the King or Queen, as per the tradition.\nCanada celebrates Christmas with a spirit of friendship, love, brotherhood and secularity. This is the reason why it is called a community festival rather than a religious one.\nRead about Christmas, its traditions and customs in Canada and also the Canadian Christmas celebrations.","Russian Christmas (Рождество́ Христо́во in Russian) is probably the most important Orthodox holiday after Easter. Orthodox Christmas is celebrated on the 7th of January (the 25th of December on the Julian calendar) because the Russian Orthodox church operates on a Julian calendar that is currently 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar.\nIn the Soviet Union, Christmas along with other church holidays were banned and it was stated as a national holiday only in 1991. Since the Soviet Era, many Christmas traditions were moved to New Year’s, which has been the most popular holiday in Russia ever since. For most Russians, the main winter holiday is still New Year, the time of the year when families gather, present each other with gifts and decorate a pine tree. Christmas is celebrated mostly by the religious Russians, but it is still very popular.\nMany of Russia’s Christmas customs originated with the pagan culture that existed in Russia before the arrival of Christianity. There are several Russian Christmas customs such as caroling and fortune-telling. Christmas Eve is anticipated by a strict Nativity Fast for forty days leading up to Christmas Eve. During the Fast, no animal products except for seafood on certain days are allowed.\nRussian Christmas Customs\nRussian Orthodox Church\nChristmas in Russia is followed by the Christmastide (Свя́тки in Russian) that are twelve days closely associated with the pagan traditions of fortune-telling and caroling. It starts on the 7th of January and lasts until the 19th of January, the Epiphany (Богоявле́ние in Russian). The baptism of Jesus Christ is celebrated in Russia by diving into special baptismal holes cut out in the icy rivers and lakes.\nRussian Christmastide is a celebration of the winter solstice that starts the solar year. During the Christmastide, Russians dress up and go carol-singing (Колядова́ние in Russian). The songs are called ‘Kolyadki’, these are old songs that don’t have any author.\nThe other popular pastime during the Christmastide is fortune-telling. It is usually performed by girls who want to know when they will get married and who their groom would be. They use a lot of different ways to tell the future: special amulets, mirrors, wax, cards.\nOrthodox Christmas Services\nTypically, there are several long church services that Russians attend during Christmas: three masses are held on Christmas Eve (the 6th of January). These are the Royal Hours, Vespers, and the Divine Liturgy. Some believers also attend All-night vigil and then the Devine liturgy of the Nativity on Christmas morning. Also, there is a Midnight walk that is a walk around the church at the stroke of 12 to commemorate Christ’s birth.\nRussian Traditional Christmas Cuisine\nAfter the Church services families return home for the Holy Supper that concludes the Nativity Fast. This traditional Christmas Eve meal consists of 12 dishes that commemorate the Twelve Apostles. The meal starts after the first star is seen in the sky; it symbolizes the appearance of the Star of Bethlehem that inspired wise men from the East to travel to Jerusalem.\nThe Holy Supper is usually meatless. Typical dishes are sochiva or kutya, which is a mixture of nuts, seeds, dried fruits, and honey; lenten bread is served with vegetarian soups – a beet soup that is called borsch and a salty soup solyanka (that can also be made with meat). Some families prefer a meat main course, others cook fish or a vegetarian dish. The meals are accompanied by a variety of side dishes like aspic, stuffed pies, and desserts in various forms. Often there also are Russian sweet or salty pies ‘pirogi’ and crepes ‘blini’. Typical drinks are kompot (sweet fruit beverage), kissel (viscous fruit drink), and sbiten’ (hot honey drink).\nСчастли́вого Рождества́! – Merry Christmas!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:63efb97b-2f58-4092-9666-30f6486be08b>","<urn:uuid:cd331ed0-5dc9-41ec-a877-48e6b09156b8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Compare the placement requirements for evaporation pans versus DIY rain gauges for accurate measurements.","answer":"Both devices have specific placement requirements for accurate measurements. Evaporation pans must be placed on a flat wooden platform (like a pallet) approximately 150mm above ground, in an area with maintained grass that's free from weeds, bushes, and trees to avoid shading. They should be covered with chicken wire to prevent animal interference and need a nearby water supply. DIY rain gauges must be placed in a secure outside location that is unobstructed by tree branches, building eaves, or electrical cables. The gauge needs to be positioned where it can capture rainfall without interference from natural obstacles that could affect measurement accuracy.","context":["Construction of an Evaporation Pan for Irrigation Scheduling\nNote Number: AG0293\nPublished: September 2000\nUpdated: December 2009\nPlants suck up water from the soil and lose the majority of this water to the air through their leaves by a process known as evapotranspiration. Ideally we would like to measure plant water use so that irrigations can be accurately scheduled, however, the technology is complex and currently not suited to practical irrigation management. Alternatively, plant water use can be estimated from the measurements of evaporation from an open surface of water. From evaporation readings irrigations can be timed so that the soil is at the right moisture level and irrigations run long enough to replace the water the plants have used.\nThere are many types of evaporation pans used by farmers. However, the universal pan is the United States Weather Bureau Class A pan evaporimeter (Figure 1). It is important to use the same dimensions as this universal pan, mainly because the effect of wind and temperature on evaporation will vary with the surface area and the depth of water in the pan. Evaporation and irrigation replacements cannot be compared between sites if non standard pans are used.\nThere are three parts to an evaporimeter (Figure 2). All parts can be made very cheaply with common materials. Alternatively a complete unit can be purchased at considerably greater cost. The following is a description of how to construct the three components of the evaporimeter.\nThe evaporation pan must be made to the standard specifications of an internal diameter of 1207 mm and height of 254 mm using 20 gauge galvanised iron. The standard material is galvanised iron as alternatives will have different thermal and reflectance properties, therefore altering the evaporation rate. It is best to have the pan made by either a galvanised tank manufacturer or an engineering firm. Before the pan is sited in the field it should be checked for leaks.\nThe fixed pointer that sits inside the pan can be made from standard irrigation fittings and a piece of stainless steel rod (Figure 3). There are three parts to the fixed pointer:\n- the base, a 100 mm PVC flange\n- the pointer support, a 230 mm long piece of 100 mm PVC pipe. Four equally spaced 9 mm holes 70 mm from the base are drilled to allow the water height around the fixed pointer to quickly adjust to the water height in the pan. A single 15 mm long 5 mm wide elongated hole is also drilled 70 mm from the base of the PVC pipe.\n- the pointer, a 170 mm long piece of 5 mm stainless steel rod bent at a right angle 60 mm from one end. From the shorter end a thread is tapped for about 15 mm and a point is ground on the other end of the rod.\nAfter fitting the PVC pipe into the flange, the stainless steel rod is inserted into the elongated hole with nuts located on the inside and outside of the PVC pipe. To initially set the stainless steel rod in the correct position, the fixed pointer is placed in the pan and the pan is filled with water to a depth of 190 mm. The rod is then slid up or down in the 5 mm elongated hole so that the point of the rod just breaks the surface of the water.\nTo measure evaporation the pan must be refilled with a known volume of water. The surface area of the pan is 1.14 square metres, so for every mm of evaporation 1.14 litres of water must be added to the pan. A transparent plastic 2 litre measuring jug with vertical sides is an excellent measuring cylinder if it is scaled properly. It is important that the jug actually holds more water than 2 litres so the sides of the jug must extend past the 2 litre mark. The jug is filled with 2.28 litres of water and the water level marked. This can conveniently be done by weighing the jug and adding 2.28 kilograms of water. For most jugs this will just about overflow, which is perfect.\nA jug of water filled to the marker will be equivalent to 2 mm of evaporation. To scale the jug when less than 2 mm of water is required to fill the pan, the distance from the top marker to the bottom of the jug is measured and divided by 20. The numbers 0 to 2.0 in increments of 0.1 are then written with a permanent marking pen from the top marker to the bottom of the jug. These numbers are equivalent to the same number of mm of evaporation from the pan.\nWith evaporation the water level in the pan will fall. To measure the amount of evaporation, water is added to the pan with the measuring jug filled to the top mark. Water is added until the pointer just breaks the surface of the water. The PVC pipe supporting the pointer will help by reducing wave motion. It is important to keep track of the number of jugs used to refill the pan and the reading on the last jug when the pan water level is just broken by the pointer. The total amount of water added equals the amount of evaporation.\nIt is also essential to measure rainfall in conjunction with evaporation. Both measurements enable evaporation to be calculated on rainy days. After heavy rain the pan may have to be emptied to bring the water level down to the pointer. After rainfall on a hot summer's day, less water may have to be removed than actually fell as rain. For example, after a 25 mm rainfall there might only be 12 mm of water removed from the pan with the measuring jug to bring the water level back to the pointer. The difference between the rainfall (25 mm) and the water removed from the pan (12 mm) is the evaporation. In this example it is 13 mm.\nIf the rain does not fill the pan above the pointer, the rainfall must still be added onto the measured evaporation to give the actual evaporation. For example, if there was 7 mm of rainfall and 6 mm of water was added to the pan with the measuring jug then the evaporation would be 13 mm.\nEvaporation measurements should be routinely done every day at 9.00 am and clearly recorded. If measurements are not done routinely then the volume of water in the pan will decrease and take less time to heat up during the day and cool at night. This will induce an error which will become greater as the volume of water in the pan decreases. Evaporation measurements are very simple and take less than 5 minutes.\nThe pan should be placed on a flat wooden platform about 150 mm above the ground surface. A pallet is perfect. To avoid animals and birds interfering with the water in the pan we strongly advise covering the pan with chicken wire. This is not a USWB standard but is recommended for all agricultural situations. The error from covering the pan with bird wire will be small, much less than that introduced by animal interference.\nTo construct a simple chicken wire cage over the pan, bend a piece of 6 mm steel rod around the outside of the pan, welding the ends together to form a hoop.\nChicken wire is then loosely tied to the perimeter of the hoop. This cage can then be slipped over the pan.\nThe area around the pan must be grassed and free from weeds, bushes and trees so that no shading can occur. The grass around the pan must be mown regularly and kept green. A nearby water supply is advised for refilling the pan and watering the grass around the pan.\nThe pan should be cleaned at least once a year. After cleaning and every month an algaecide should be added at the same rate as for swimming pools. If an algaecide is not added then the pan should be emptied and cleaned monthly.\nIf the maintenance or siting of the pan or the construction of the pan is not standard, then there will be a different relationship between evaporation and plant water use, but this difference is not critical if the differences are small and consistent. Variations from month to month like algae growth, unmown grass or reading at very irregular intervals are far worse than a consistent difference. For example we suggest that if the grass cannot be kept green and mown then the area around the pan should be kept bare with a herbicide. It should be recognised here that non-standard evaporation pans can still be very useful for irrigation scheduling. They must, however, be evaluated on their own. Published irrigation replacement factors will be less accurate than for a standard evaporation pan. We recommend that if a non standard evaporation pan is used for irrigation scheduling then soil moisture and plant performance must be monitored to determine appropriate irrigation replacements from evaporation.\nThis Agnote was developed by Ian Goodwin, Future Farming Systems Research in September 2000.\nIt was reviewed by Ian Goodwin, Future Farming Systems Research.

Your children can use common household objects to create a rain gauge. They can regularly measure the amount of rain and then record their findings in a journal. A rain gauge can be a do-it-yourself science project, a component of a weather station for kids or a device to help them estimate the water requirements of a garden.\nThe Gauge's Function\nWhen your child gauges rainfall, she’s recording the depth of precipitation accumulating over a set time period. Because you can’t accurately measure rainfall in natural places for various reasons -- ground absorption of rain, evaporation or the run-off of precipitation into streams or lower ground -- a rain gauge is required. The gauge typically consists of a cylinder with a scale -- millimeters or inches -- running vertically along its side. Your child can place the rain gauge in a secure outside location that is unobstructed by tree branches, building eaves or electrical cables.\nTwo Types of Gauges\nThe two main types of rain gauges have different shapes. The first type is cylindrical with straight sides. When using this type of gauge, the height of captured precipitation equals the actual amount of rainfall. If your child collects an inch of rain, she records a rainfall measurement of 1 inch. The second type of rain gauge has a funnel top and is best suited for capturing small amounts of precipitation. To measure rainfall, you have to use a ratio of the cylinder’s diameter to the funnel’s diameter. For example, if the ratio is 1:5, then 10 inches of water captured in the cylinder equals 2 inches of actual rainfall.\nBuilding a DIY Gauge\nHave your kids gather a 2-liter soda bottle, scissors, tape and pebbles. Begin by cutting off the top half of the bottle just below the point where the bottle’s shape starts to narrow. Place pebbles in the bottle’s bottom to weight it down. Invert the bottle's top half and insert it into the bottom half. Match the rims of the top and bottom halves and then tape them together. Attach a piece of tape that runs from the top of the bottle to the point just above the stones, or the base of the gauge. Position a 12-inch ruler to the side of the bottle so its zero-line matches up to the gauge’s base. Use a marker to draw every 1/8-inch or 1/4-inch mark, and then number each inch. Add water to the gauge until the water reaches its baseline or zero point. By doing so, your child can measure additional water -- captured rainfall -- from the zero line.\nHave your child monitor the rain gauge on a daily basis. She should measure rainfall at the same time everyday. For an accurate measurement, your child needs to be at eye level with the gauge. After recording the rainfall on a chart, she should empty the gauge, according to “ScienceWorks for Kids: Weather, Grades 4-6+,” by Mike Graf and Michelle Rose. Alternatively, she can subtract the current reading from the previous day’s reading to arrive at accumulated rainfall. She can also describe rainfall as heavy, moderate or light. While heavy rainfall is more than 0.3 inch of rain per hour, moderate rainfall ranges between 0.1 and 0.3 inch of rain per hour. Light rainfall is lower than 0.1 inch of rain per hour."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e6f0a932-d456-4e38-97b6-c5ecc1edd0e3>","<urn:uuid:9526badf-e97e-4eb3-b1d5-803e2c4d0da5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How many passengers died when the S.S. Central America sank in 1857?","answer":"Over 400 passengers died when the S.S. Central America, known as the 'ship of gold,' sank in the Atlantic Ocean in September 1857.","context":["The Sixth Circuit’s opinion in Williamson v. Recovery Limited Partnership begins with a fascinating account of a shipwreck that ultimately spawned decades of litigation: “This appeal is the latest skirmish in the legal battle over the treasures recovered from the 19th century steamship S.S. Central America, a battle that has spanned three decades in numerous courts. Dubbed the ‘ship of gold,’ the Central America sank in the Atlantic Ocean in September 1857, taking over 400 passengers and many tons of gold with her. Her wreckage was discovered over 130 years later by a group of explorers lead by Thomas Thompson, in what remains one of the significant finds in maritime history.” But this history was a troubled one: “The individuals who dedicated their time and talent to the recovery of the Central America have not seen a dime of their promised share of the spoils; Mr. Thompson is a fugitive from the law, actively pursued by United States Marshalls; and the vast wealth representing the ship’s golden cargo is as lost today as it was before September 1988.”\nAlthough the opinion is rich with history and intrigue, the case actually before the Court turns on some drier issues, such as appellate jurisdiction (there’s a lot of that going around recently). The plaintiffs were individuals who had worked on the project to recover the ship for companies controlled by Mr. Thompson, and they were suing on their non-disclosure agreements, which entitled them to a share of the recovery. The district court had granted summary judgment on defendants’ counterclaims and issued an injunction against them. The Sixth Circuit began its analysis with considering appellate jurisdiction over the defendants’ appeal of summary adjudication of the counterclaims and the injunction that also provided for prejudgment attachment. The defendants invoked 28 USC § 1292(a)(3), allowing for interlocutory appeals of cases “determining the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases,” as a basis for jurisdiction. The Sixth Circuit recognized that it had not previously delineated the standard for appellate jurisdiction concerning admiralty jurisdiction section, and accordingly turned to a survey of other circuits. The Sixth Circuit effectively rejected the interpretations offered by several other circuits concerning how to apply Section 1292(a)(3). Instead, it followed a plain language reading of the statute itself. Finding no ambiguity in the statute, and relying on guidance in the advisory committee notes that militated in favor of jurisdiction on these facts, the Court determined that the order was appealable.\nAfter sorting through the jurisdictional morass, the Court turned to a “complex procedural issue” concerning whether the plaintiff’s case is time barred under 46 USC § 80107(c). The Sixth Circuit found that provision to be inapplicable because the plaintiffs were not suing on their employment contracts, rather they were suing on their non-disclosure agreements, which provided them for a percentage of the net recovery. Therefore, the Court upheld summary judgment and ultimately the injunction as well.\nThis case may not have a significant impact in the Circuit’s jurisprudence, because although it is the first case to definitely apply the admiralty appellate jurisdiction statute, the Sixth Circuit is not exactly a hotbed of those types of cases. Nevertheless, the background story here makes for a fascinating read."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:60e928b1-cc83-408d-8433-331c81fe01e4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the main difference between how GFCIs and standard circuit breakers protect against electrical hazards, and at what current levels do they typically operate?","answer":"GFCIs and standard circuit breakers serve different protective purposes. While fuses and circuit breakers are designed to protect equipment and facilities from short circuits and large electrical faults that could cause fires and property damage, GFCIs are specifically designed to prevent bodily harm from electrical faults that could cause electricity to flow through a person to ground. In terms of operating levels, most GFCIs trip at around 6 mA, while standard breakers and fuses operate at current levels that far exceed lethal amounts.","context":["A ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) is one of the most common residential, commercial, and industrial safety devices. The most common types are single-phase electrical outlets used in households near water sources, such as in kitchens, bathrooms, and outdoor receptacles. Most states have required GFCIs in certain areas of residential installations for decades. However, NFPA 79, the Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery, also dictates their use in industrial applications.\nGFCI uses and maintenance\nGFCIs are designed to prevent bodily harm from electrical faults that could cause electricity to flow through you to ground. It quickly disconnects the current flowing through an unintended ground path even if the amount of current is too small to trip a typical circuit breaker. Although fuses and circuit breakers are also protective devices, they are designed to protect equipment and facilities from short circuits and large magnitude electrical faults that could cause electrical fires and property damage. The actuating energy for standard breakers and fuses far exceeds the lethal amount, but most GFCIs trip at around 6 mA.\nA GFCI uses a current transformer to detect the difference between the line current supplied to the load and the neutral current returning from the load. Ideally, this difference should be zero because both currents cancel. If there is a current differential, it becomes the input to a comparator within the GFCI, which changes states when the differential is around 6 mA. When the comparator changes states, it triggers a silicon-controlled rectifier, which disconnects the power from the output of the GFCI.\nGFCIs should be checked monthly by operating the pushbuttons on the front labeled \"Test\" and \"Reset.\" In addition to checking for proper operation, monthly testing exercises the mechanical components of the receptacle. Simple GFCI testers are available for less than $15 or for less than $150 a high-quality industrial electrical tester can check for energized circuits, test ac and dc voltages, resistance, continuity, phase rotation between any two phases, and GFCIs.\nGFCI tripping causes and impacts\nWhen a GFCI trips, there must be a reason. Instead of just resetting the GFCI, you also must investigate the cause of the trip.\nGround faults occur when electrical current finds an unintended path to ground. The usual suspects for ground-faults include worn insulation, conductive dusts, water, or other \"soft grounds.\" Ground faults account for more than 80% of equipment short circuits and in 90% of those cases it is caused by insulation deterioration on wires and cables. If a human becomes the unintended path, current as low as 75 mA can trigger ventricular fibrillation (i.e., when the heart stops pumping, leads to cardiac arrest).\nAnother name for a ground fault is leakage current. Although wiring insulation is designed to keep electricity in the conductor, all insulators have some conductivity. While not perfect, even air can be an insulator. Insulation conducts current through both electrically resistive and capacitive paths. If insulation is old or damaged its resistance is lower and leakage current could become substantial. The insulation protecting longer conductors has higher capacitance, which can cause even more leakage current.\nOn GFCI-protected circuits, leakage current can cause unnecessary and intermittent tripping. When troubleshooting these intermittent \"ghost\" trips, sometimes looking for the leakage current culprit can be costly. When many pieces of equipment are operating on a circuit, the leakage current is cumulative and could be in the order of milliamps. Adding more equipment to a GFCI-protected circuit could trip the GFCI randomly, making the problem difficult to diagnose.\nDiagnosing GFCI trips\nStart by measuring the leakage current and then identifying the source. Use a leakage current clamp meter to make these measurements. Leakage current clamp meters are like clamp meters used for measuring load currents; however, leakage current clamp meters perform much better when measuring current below 5 mA.\nTest single-phase circuits by clamping the phase and neutral conductors. Test three-phase circuits by clamping around all phase conductors. If a neutral is present, clamp it too. The measured value will be any current flowing to ground. To measure the total leakage flowing to the intended ground connection, place the clamp around the ground conductor.\nMeasure the leakage current on each leg of the circuit to identify which one has considerably more leakage than the others. If one leg has a suspiciously high leakage current, ensure that the equipment is operating properly. Remember that surge suppression filters and capacitors on the power input of some electronic equipment can increase the overall circuit capacitance, which can increase leakage current. Determine loaded circuit leg leakage with the equipment \"on\"—switching the equipment \"off\" allows you to determine just the circuit wiring leakage.\nIf equipment on all legs is operating properly and the wiring is acceptable, it could be that the cumulative leakage current due to electronic equipment input filtering is just high enough to trigger the random GFCI trips. In this case, consider redistributing the loading on each circuit leg or adding circuits to provide more capacity."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d706de1f-a431-478e-b3cc-9cd76cc58ccf>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between optimizing graphics performance in Pepper 3D versus developing immersive virtual reality applications using modern rendering techniques?","answer":"In Pepper 3D optimization, key focus areas include minimizing glFlush and glFinish calls, avoiding glReadPixels, structuring vertex data efficiently (combining position/normal/texcoord data in single buffers), and carefully managing buffer updates to prevent performance penalties. For VR applications, optimization involves a broader scope including stereoscopic rendering techniques, sensor fusion (using complementary and Kalman filters), handling IMU data, implementing lens distortion shaders, and ensuring low latency for head tracking. VR development also requires understanding multimodal human perception aspects and maintaining presence, which goes beyond pure graphics performance considerations.","context":["Pepper 3D on Chrome provides a secure implementation of OpenGL ES 2.0. Here are some tips for getting maximum performance.For security all indices must be validated. If you change them we have to validate them again. Therefore structure your code so indices are not updated often.\nIn OpenGL ES 2.0 you can use client side data with glVertexAttribPointer and glDrawElements. It’s REALLY SLOW! Don’t use them. Instead, whenever possible use VBOs (Vertex Buffer Objects). Side-note: Client side buffers have been removed from OpenGL 4.0.\nActually this is off by default. In real OpenGL ES 2.0 you can create a single buffer and bind it to both GL_ARRAY_BUFFER and GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER. In Pepper 3D, by default, you can only bind buffers to 1 bind point. There is the option to enable binding buffers to both points. Doing so requires expensive work so don’t do it.\nFor dynamic textures (ie, video) or dynamic vertex data (skinning / particles) consider using CHROMIUM_map_subhttp://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/gpu/GLES2/extensions/CHROMIUM/CHROMIUM_map_sub.txt\nCalling either of those stalls our multi-process pipeline. This is normal advice for OpenGL programs but is particularly important for 3D on Chrome. This includes glGetError – avoid calling it in release builds.\nIn OpenGL you MUST enable Attrib 0. In OpenGL ES 2.0 you don’t have to enable Attrib 0. What that means is that in order to emulate OpenGL ES 2.0 on top of OpenGL we have to do some expensive work.\nIn practice most programs don’t have an issue here but just in case, the most obvious way this might bite you is if you bind your own locations and don’t start with 0. Example: Imagine you have a vertex shader with 2 attributes “positions” and “normals”\nThose 2 functions would make make your shader NOT use attrib 0 in which case we’d have to do some expensive work internally\nIt is generally good practice to minimize explicit calls to glFlush and avoid using glFinish. Particularly so on Native Client where they incur additional overhead.\nIn other words, don't call glReadPixels. This is slow.\nWhen benchmarking, avoid comparing results where one system is limited by vsync and another is not.It’s not supported in OpenGL and so emulation for OpenGL ES 2.0 is slow. By default GL_FIXED support is turned off Pepper 3D. There is the option to turn it on. Don’t do it.\nThe size your plugin renders and the size it displays in the page are set separately. CSS controls the size your plugin displays where as the width and height attribute of your <embed> element control the size your plugin renders.\nIf you’re used to making native games you’re probably used to rendering everything yourself. The browser though can already render text and UI very well and it will composite that HTML with your plugin using all the standard HTML5 and CSS methods available.\nAvoid updating a small portion of a large buffer\nThis is especially an issue in Windows where we emulate OpenGL ES 2.0 on top of DirectX. In the current implementation, updating a portion of a buffer requires re-processing the entire buffer. In other words if you make a buffer (glBufferData) of 10000 bytes and then later call glSubBufferData to update just 3 of those bytes, all 10000 bytes will have to be re-converted. (Yea, I know, lame)\n3 buffers of [position,position,position], [normal,normal,normal], [texcoord,texcoord,texcoord] is slower than 1 buffer of [position,normal,texcoord,position,normal,texcoord,position,normal,texcoord].\nAssume you have positions, normals and texcoords. Further assume you update positions every frame. It would be best to put positions in 1 buffer and normals + texcoords in a separate buffer. That way, you can call glBufferData or glBufferSubData on a smaller range of data.\nConsider putting multiple meshes in a single buffer and using offsets (as long as the buffers are static, see above)\nNot every GPU supports every extension nor has the same amount of textures units, vertex attributes, etc. Make sure you check for the features you need.\nFor example, if you are using non power of 2 texture with mips make sure GL_OES_texture_npot exists. If you are using floating point textures make sure GL_OES_texture_float exists. If you are using DXT1, DXT3 or DXT5 texture make sure GL_ETC_texture_compression_dxt1, GL_CHROMIUM_texture_compression_dxt3 and GL_CHROMIUM_texture_compression_dxt5 exist.\nIf you are using textures in vertex shaders make sure glGetIntegerv(GL_MAX_VERTEX_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS, …) returns a value greater than 0.\nIf you are using more than 8 textures in a single shader make sure glGetIntegerv(GL_MAX_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS, …) returns a value greater than or equal to the number of simulatious textures you need.","OpenGL and WebGL, real-time rendering, 3D display systems, display optics & electronics, IMUs and sensors, tracking, haptics, rendering pipeline, multimodal human perception and depth perception, stereo rendering, presence.

{"question":"As someone interested in marine life adaptation: how do modern Iñupiaq hunters adapt to environmental changes compared to how humpback whales adapt to different water environments?","answer":"Iñupiaq hunters have had to adapt to changing sea ice conditions by being flexible in their hunting methods, switching between traditional skin boats and aluminum boats to ensure they can continue providing food for their community. Meanwhile, humpback whales adapt to different water environments through regular migration patterns, typically moving between temperate and polar waters for feeding in summer, and tropical waters for mating and calving in winter - though some populations, like those in the Arabian Sea, maintain a non-migratory pattern.","context":["AK Natives on the Front Line: Hunting & Whaling Practices\nThis episode features brothers Jack and Brower Frantz, Iñupiaq hunters and whalers born and raised in Utqiaġvik, Alaska. Brower Tiġitquuraq Frantz is a subsistence research coordinator for the Wildlife Department at the North Slope Borough, and a father of five children. And Jack Ikusik Frantz, also a father and step father to seven children is an avid hunter/gatherer with an associates degree in media arts and currently works as an advisor to the mayor of the North Slope Borough. AK Natives on the Front Line is a special series of Coffee & Quaq highlighting the adaptability and resilience of the Iñupiat in the face of climate change, a project funded by the Pulitzer Center Connected Coastlines program, done in partnership with journalist Jenna Kunze. We travelled up to Utqiaġvik earlier this year at the peak of winter when the sun had returned back to the Arctic and interviewed residents about the various aspects of how Iñupiat life has changed, but also how it has remained the same. Throughout this series we explore topics like subsistence whaling practices, research, anthropological work, and more.\n\"We’ve always hunted and we’ve always hunted with an umiapiaq, skin boat, in the spring time. Really, that was how we had to do it back then. That was how we had to get meat on the table. If you look at it from our perspective, that’s the most important thing: we get food on the table. Personally, I love using the umiapiaq. I love sitting there discussing stuff with my uncles, discussing how to hunt, discussing stories, discussing how they want to hunt the whale and waiting for the whale at the edge of the ice. That’s how I would prefer to hunt in the spring time, but if that’s not available, I’m all for getting in the aluminum boat and going out and catching a whale because that might be the only way to do it. If that’s how we have to do it, then that’s how we have to do it. The Utqiagvik mentality, for the most part, is that we want to feed our community. We want to make sure to get whales and bring them in and share it with our friends, our family, and everybody in the community.\" -Jack Frantz\nRapid environmental changes have pressured Iñupiaq hunters to adapt and find new ways to fill freezers and put food on the table, not just individually, but for the entire community. The knowledge and expertise needed to hunt and whale safely in the Arctic requires years of patience, observation, and practice. And even more so now that the sea ice conditions are changing. The Iñupiat have relied on hunting and whaling since as far back as we can remember, and the general consensus seems to be that our people will continue to hunt and whale well into the future. The unique relationship that Iñupiaq hunters have with the environment is intimate and strong and one built on thousands of years of trial and error. Quyanaqpak to Jack and Brower Frantz again for shedding light on hunting and whaling practices in Utqiagvik, especially knowing that all too often our knowledges, practices, and traditions have been knowingly or unknowingly used against us in the past.

One of the larger rorqual species, adults range in length from 12-16 metres (40-50 ft) and weigh approximately 36,000 kilograms (79,000 lb). The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with unusually long pectoral fins and a knobbly head. It is an acrobatic animal, often breaching and slapping the water. Males produce a complex whale song, which lasts for 10 to 20 minutes and is repeated for hours at a time. The purpose of the song is not yet clear, although it appears to have a role in mating.\nFound in oceans and seas around the world, humpback whales typically migrate up to 25,000 kilometers each year. Humpbacks migrate from the polar waters of South America between July and October and from the cold waters of North America to warmer tropical waters between the months of January and April. The whales come to the warm and quiet waters surrounding the Marino Ballena National Park, Caño Island, and Osa Peninsula area to give birth to their young.\nLike other large whales, the humpback was and is a target for the whaling industry. Due to over-hunting, its population fell by an estimated 90% before a whaling moratorium was introduced in 1966. Stocks of the species have since partially recovered; however, entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships, and noise pollution also remain concerns. It is believed they number about 30,000-40,000 at present, or about 30-35% of the original population.\nPhysical description of the humpback whale\nThe head of a humpback whale is broad and rounded when viewed from above, but slim in profile. The body is quite round, narrowing to a slender peduncle (tail stock). The top of the head and lower jaw have rounded, bump-like knobs, each containing at least one stiff hair. The purpose of these hairs is not known. There are between 20-50 ventral grooves which extend slightly beyond the navel.\nColors of the humpback whale\nThe body is black on the dorsal (upper) side, and black and white on the ventral (under) side. This color pattern extends to the flukes. When the humpback whale “sounds” (goes into a long or deep dive) it usually throws its flukes upward, exposing the black and white patterned underside. This pattern is distinctive to each whale. The flippers range from all white to all black dorsally, but are usually white ventrally.\nFins and flukes, length and weight of the humpback whale\nAbout 2/3 of the way back on the body is an irregularly shaped dorsal (top) fin. Its flippers are very long, between 1/4 and 1/3 the length of its body, and have large knobs on the leading edge. The flukes (tail), which can be 18 feet (5.5 m) wide, is serrated and pointed at the tips. Adult males measure 40-48 feet (12.2-14.6 m), adult females measure 45-50 feet (13.7-15.2 m). They weigh 25 to 40 tons (22,680-36,287 kg).\nFeeding habits of the humpback whale\nHumpback whales feed on krill, small shrimp-like crustaceans, and various kinds of small fish. Each whale eats up to 1 and 1/2 tons (1,361 kg) of food a day. As a baleen whale, it has a series of 270-400 fringed overlapping plates hanging from each side of the upper jaw, where teeth might otherwise be located. These plates consist of a fingernail-like material called keratin that frays out into fine hairs on the ends inside the mouth near the tongue. The plates are black and measure about 30 inches (76 cm) in length. During feeding, large volumes of water and food can be taken into the mouth because the pleated grooves in the throat expand. As the mouth closes water is expelled through the baleen plates, which trap the food on the inside near the tongue to be swallowed.\nHumpback whales mating and breeding\nHumpback whales reach sexual maturity at 6-10 years of age or when males reach the length of 35 feet (11.6 m) and females reach 40 feet (12 m). Each female typically bears a calf every 2-3 years and the gestation period is 12 months. A humpback whale calf is between 10-15 feet (3-4.5 m) long at birth, and weighs up to 1 ton (907 kg). It nurses frequently on the mother’s rich milk, which has a 45% to 60% fat content. The calf is weaned to solid food when it is about a year old.\nDistribution and migration of humpback whales\nFound in all the world’s oceans, most populations of humpback whales follow a regular migration route, summering in temperate and polar waters for feeding, and wintering in tropical waters for mating and calving. In the Arabian Sea, a year-round non-migratory population of humpbacks appears not to follow this general rule.\nNatural history of the humpback whale\nAt least 3 different species of barnacles are commonly found on both the flippers and the body of the humpback whale. It is also home for a species of whale lice, Cyamus bops. Humpback whales are active, acrobatic whales. They can throw themselves completely out of the water (breaching), and swim on their backs with both flippers in the air. They also engage in “tail lobbing” (raising their huge flukes out of the water and then slapping it on the surface) and “flipper slapping” (using their flippers to slap the water). It is possible that these behaviors are important in communication between humpbacks.\nPerhaps the most interesting behavior of humpback whales is their “singing.” Scientists have discovered that humpback whales sing long, complex “songs”. Whales in the North American Atlantic population sing the same song, and all the whales in the North American Pacific population sing the same song. However, the songs of each of these populations and of those in other areas of the world are uniquely different. A typical song lasts from 10-20 minutes, is repeated continuously for hours at a time, and changes gradually from year to year. Singing whales are males, and the songs may be a part of mating behavior.\nStatus of the humpback whale\nBecause their feeding, mating, and calving grounds are close to shore and because they are slow swimmers, the humpback whales were an easy target for early whalers. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) gave them worldwide protection status in 1966, but there were large illegal kills by the Soviets until the 1970’s. It is believed they number about 30,000-40,000 at present, or about 30-35% of the original population.\n*Adapted from American Cetacean Society for educational purposes."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:950aba5e-8f07-477f-b6e4-57d20e3fbdf9>","<urn:uuid:af2c801b-74cb-491d-885a-6a80bb3ed24d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the difference between the default sampling rate used in audio CDs versus the recommended sampling rate for improving amp sim sound quality?","answer":"Audio CDs use a sampling rate of 44.1kHz, while a higher sampling rate of 96kHz is recommended for improving amp sim sound quality. The higher 96kHz sampling rate can produce a clearer sound by preventing harmonic interactions with the digital system's clock frequency that typically create a 'wooliness' in the sound.","context":["ECE505 Digital Signal Processing\n1 Problem Description:\nIn this project we are going to design and construct a digital 5-channel equalizer for processing audio\nfiles. Equalizers are used for adjusting the gain of an audio signal in different frequency bands.\n2 Project Definition:\nThe equalizer design will have 5 bandpass filters in parallel, each multiplied by a gain constant (i.e.,\nthe band weight). The overall equalizer system can be drawn in block diagram form as follows:\nSo we have a parallel group of bandpass filters. The equivalent system transfer function can be written\nH(z) = a1H1(z) + a2H2(z) + a3H3(z) + a4H4(z) + a5H5(z),\nwhich leads to the total system impulse response,\nh[n] = a1h1[n] + a2h2[n] + a3h3[n] + a4h4[n] + a5h5[n].\nWe are going to design each bandpass filter as an FIR using the windowing method. To begin, we\nstart with an ideal frequency response for a bandpass filter with lower and upper cutoff frequencies,\nωl and ωu, respectively, i.e.,\n1, if − ωu ≤ n ≤ −ωl\n, ωl ≤ n ≤ ωu\nWe can then obtain the impulse response hi\n[n] for this filter by applying the definition of the inverse\nDTFT. The resulting impulse response will exist from (−∞, ∞) and we thus must window and shift\n[n] to make it a causal FIR filter for implementation. For each filter stage we have\nhk[n] = hi\n[n + (M − 1)/2]w[n + (M − 1)/2],\nwhere k ∈ (1, 5) and w[n] is a windowing function of length M, with M odd. Once these filters are\ncombined to produce the overall impulse response h[n], we can process our audio file via convolution,\ny[n] = x[n] ∗ h[n].\n3 Design Tasks:\nWe will assume the input audio files are sampled at a rate of 44.1kHz, which is the rate used on audio\nCDs. With our sampling rate fs = 44.1kHz (T = 1/44100 seconds), the effective continuous frequency\nresponses of the five filters should have a combined bandwidth ranging from 0 to 22.5kHz. I suggest\nyou divide the combined bandwidth up into five equal bands on a logarithmic scale. The reason for\nsuch a selection is due to the logarithmic way in which humans perceive frequency.\nI have provided a MATLAB function, bpw, that implements a causal FIR bandpass filter using the\nwindowing method. To use it, all you need to specify are the lower and upper digital cutoff frequencies\n(in radians per sample), the length of the filter M, and the type of windowing function to apply (i.e.,\nI’ve done the hard part). For additional help with the function open the .m file and read the help\nsection at the beginning of the file.\nYour task is to design and create the 5 bandpass filters, which simply involves determining the cutoff\nfrequency for each filter and choosing a window type. For each filter use a length of M = 501. Also,\nnote that h1[n] and h5[n] will be lowpass and highpass filters, respectively. This is easily accounted\nfor by setting ωl = 0 for h1[n] and ωu = π for h5[n]. Once you have created each filter in MATLAB,\nyou simply need to multiply each filter by its respective gain factor (which are tuning parameters)\nand sum the scaled impulse responses together. Then, apply the filter via convolution, i.e., using the\nMATLAB command conv(x, h). Once processed, the reconstruction process is to be done using the\nsound() command in MATLAB so that you can listen to the results of applying your filter.\nTo design your equalizer perform the following design tasks. Include any results generated in this\nsection in the Design section of the document your submit for this project.\n1. Use the inverse DTFT to derive the impulse response hi\n[n] for an ideal bandpass filter with\nlower cutoff ωl and upper cutoff ωh.\n2. Determine the upper and lower analog cutoff frequencies for each bandpass filter in radians per\nsecond. I suggest using a logarithmic scale and dividing the frequency axis into five nearly equal\nsegments from the range of 22.5Hz to 22.05kHz. Once you determine these analog frequencies,\nmap each one to their corresponding digital frequency in radians per sample.\n3. Create the five filters in MATLAB using the bpw function with the digital frequencies you\ndetermined above. Create h3[n] using a rectangular window. Then generate h3[n] again using\na Blackman window. For the other four filters select windows of your choosing. Create the five\ngain factors as configurable parameters. Now, multiply each impulse response by its respective\nfilter gain and sum them all together to obtain the total impulse response.\n4. Let’s also generate 10th order IIR bandpass filters using ωl and ωu from h3[n] based upon\nButterworth, Chebychev, and Elliptic filters. Create each filter using these commands:\n[b1, a1] = butter(5, [wl/pi wu/pi])\n[b2, a2] = cheby1(5, 1, [wl/pi wu/pi])\n[b3, a3] = ellip(5, 1, 80, [wl/pi wu/pi])\nIn each case, notice that the digital cutoff frequencies are normalized by π. The reason for this is\nbecause MATLAB expects the [0, π] range to be normalized to the [0, 1] range. These functions\nreturn the numerator transfer function coefficients in b and the denominator transfer function\ncoefficients in a that can then be used to generate the frequency response and corresponding\n5. Now, read in an audio file using the audioread command (there are several music clips on the\nclass website that have been sampled at 44.1kHz). Convolve the audio file with the total impulse\nresponse. Listen to the result using the sound command. Now, tune the gain parameters until\nyou find a set of values that you like.","Regardless of whether you think playing back audio at 96kHz sounds better than 44.1kHz, recording at 96kHz can improve some amp sims’ sound—specifically, those without an oversampling option. This is because the harmonics generated by distortion can interact with a digital system’s clock frequency and create audible artifacts that usually add a “wooliness” to the sound. Higher sampling rates, however, can produce a clearer sound.\nBut recording at a higher sample rate isn’t always practical, because it stresses your computer more. This can cause reduced track counts, or less stable operation. Fortunately, the workaround may be simple. Some amp sims have an internal oversampling option. Essentially, the sim itself runs at a higher sample rate than the project hosting it. So check the sim’s preferences for an Oversampling, High Resolution, or Higher CPU Consumption setting. (Avoid power-saving “eco” options. For more information, see “Checked Your Sim Preferences Lately?” in the July 2014 Guitar Player).\nFig. 1—The site src.infinitewave.ca shows sample rate conversion quality for all major programs. Closer to a single curved line is better (Apple QuickTime Pro 7.6.6).\nIf your sim doesn’t have these options, there’s a workaround.\n• Record your guitar track as you normally would in the 44.1kHz project, using your amp sim and preset of choice.\n• After recording your part, save the amp sim preset.\n• Regardless of where you started recording your guitar part, extend its beginning—even if it’s silence—to the project start. This may require dragging the clip start to the beginning, or inserting silence.\n• Export the dry guitar track without processing by the sim at 96kHz, assuming your host program has quality sample-rate conversion (Fig. 1). Otherwise, export at 44.1 kHz.\n• Open a new project set to 96kHz, and import your guitar part starting at the project beginning. If you couldn’t export at 96kHz, some hosts will convert when importing. Otherwise, do sample-rate conversion in a separate program (such as Audacity) prior to importing.\n• Load the amp sim and its preset.\n• Render (bounce) the file with the amp sim sound, and then export the processed file at 44.1kHz.\nNow, you have a 44.1kHz file to import into your 44.1kHz project, starting at the project beginning. It’s counterintuitive that you’ll retain the 96kHz project’s higher quality at 44.1kHz, but you’ve “freezedried” the higher-quality sound as audio that can be reproduced at a 44.1kHz sample rate. You’re no longer using an amp sim to create the audio.\nPlease note that I’m not a “cork-sniffer” audio guy who insists on cables made from unobtainium. Depending on the amp sim, the effect will be sufficiently obvious that anyone will notice it. It’s not subtle.\nSo, at least when recording, higher sample rates can be useful (this same technique can also apply to virtual instruments and some dynamics processors). But do they make a difference on playback? I’ll let others argue about that one...\nCraig Anderton has played on or produced more than 20 major label releases, mastered hundreds of tracks, and written dozens of books.

{"question":"How will fish protein supplements help elderly people?","answer":"Fish protein supplements, specifically a soluble protein hydrolysate powder, may help improve muscular health in elderly people. This is important because decreased muscular strength and muscle wasting in the elderly population can cause weakness, increase fall risk, limit independence and decrease quality of life. Research is being conducted through clinical studies with elderly subjects taking nutritional supplements alongside physical exercise programs to assess the impact on muscle metabolism.","context":["Fish have long been part of the human diet and often considered as ‘brain food’. Recent research in this area suggests that eating fish is good for early brain development and may also prevent many brain-related conditions.\nOur ocean may also offer a vast resource of new substances that could lead to new food products with human health benefits. As marine organisms live in complex habitats and are exposed to extreme conditions, they produce a wide variety of specific substances that cannot be found elsewhere.\nMany marine organisms could be a potential reservoir for chemical compounds that may be used as food ingredients which could offer human health benefits.\nIn 2018, Bio-marine Ingredients Ireland (BII) in collaboration with Dublin College University and University of Limerick, were awarded funding of €200,000 under the Marine Institute’s Industry-Led Awards Scheme to conduct research with the goal of developing a new health supplement based on blue whiting fish protein.\nUnder this research project, BII has produced a soluble protein hydrolysate powder, which may be rich in nutrients and vitamins to improve the muscular health of elderly people.\nDecreased muscular strength and muscle wasting are of concern in the elderly population. Muscle loss can be significant enough to cause weakness, increase fall risk, and limit a person’s independence and decrease quality of life.\nThe next stage of the research project, will include a clinical study at Dublin College University with healthy elderly subjects taking the nutritional supplements alongside an 8-12 week physical exercise program.\nBlood samples will be assessed before and after the clinical study to indicate the level of healthy muscle metabolism. The impact of the soluble protein hydrolysate powder on muscle metabolism will be assessed using human muscle cells at the University of Limerick.\nBII extracts proteins, oil and calcium from fish caught in the Atlantic for use in food ingredients and nutrition products.

In Lough Egish, Co Monaghan, BII have built the most advanced, food-grade, bio-refinery in the world.\nDr Snehal Gite, Senior Research and Development Technologist at BII said, “We are one of the first companies globally to take under-utilised raw fish materials and transform them into powders suited to applications for human nutrition.\n“At BII, we are processing a low value Blue Whiting fish into a high value nutritional ingredient which could offer enormous benefits for skeletal health in older people. The outcome of this research project could see BII enter a valuable global market, which will ultimately benefit Irish fishermen, industry and the associated supply chain.”\nThe successful outcome of this project could see the introduction of a new Irish health ingredient into a global market worth €12.4 billion. In developing value added products from fish biomass, the project can also enhance sustainability in the fisheries sector.\nDr Paul Connolly, CEO of the Marine Institute said, “Supporting research such as these, enables Irish companies to build their research and development capacity and to innovate, creating new business opportunities and jobs.

{"question":"How do both Gruumsh and Ekajati demonstrate their dominance over enemies in their respective mythologies?","answer":"Both deities show dominance over their enemies through violent imagery and actions. Gruumsh rules his pantheon through brute power and spreads hatred toward non-orcs, particularly showing enmity toward Corellon Larethian and the Seldarine. Ekajati similarly demonstrates her power by trampling upon a female enemy on her golden sun disc, wielding a corpse-club made from a mummified enemy body, and holding a torn-out enemy heart. She also wears a garland of fifty freshly severed heads strung on intestines and is described as being extremely wrathful, protecting her followers from demonic forces.","context":["In Dungeons & Dragons , Gruumsh, also known as Gruumsh One-Eye, is the patron deity of orcs, who regard him as the god of Conquest, Survival, Strength, and Territory. He is also considered a member of the default D&D pantheon of deities. His symbol is an empty eye socket, or (in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting) his missing unwinking eye.\nGruumsh appears as a powerful orc with one eye. A figure of fury and driven cruelty, Gruumsh rules his pantheon with brute power. His favored weapon is the spear.\nGruumsh is the husband of Luthic and father of Bahgtru. Ilneval is his most capable lieutenant.\nGruumsh considers himself supreme, and considers every non-orc his enemy, holding special enmity for some. Gruumsh hates Corellon Larethian with a passion. He spreads this hatred to all of the Seldarine, especially Sehanine Moonbow, who fooled the orcish god many times to protect Corellon and her other family members. Gruumsh also loathes Moradin and the dwarven pantheon.\nIn his own pantheon, Gruumsh rules over all the other gods (although Shargaas and Yurtrus bear him little real loyalty beside that made from fear), and has his orders carried out through his lieutenant Ilneval.\nGruumsh's divine realm is the Iron Fortress in Nishrek. In the standard cosmology represented by the Greyhawk and Planescape campaign settings, Nishrek is a part of Acheron, while in the Forgotten Realms cosmology this is a plane of its own.\nGruumsh shares his home in the Iron Fortress with his son Bahgtru and his lieutenant Ilneval.\nAs orcs that are not clerics or adepts are forbidden to speak his name, Gruumsh is also known as \"One-Eye,\" \"The One-Eyed God,\" \"He-Who-Never-Sleeps,\" and \"He-Who-Watches.\"\nClergy, temples, and rituals\nGruumsh's priests wear dark red vestments, war helms, and black plate mail. His sacred animal is the giant rat. His holy day is the new moon, and he is worshipped in orcish lairs. A sacrifice of blood is made to him monthly.\nMyths and legends\nIn a past time, Gruumsh had two eyes but he lost one in a fight with the chief elven god Corellon Larethian. Gruumsh meant to paralyze Corellon with his magical spear; this attack failed and initiated an epic battle. During the course of this battle Gruumsh injured Corellon and, according to legend, from the blood shed the elven people were created. Corellon ended the fight by putting out Gruumsh's left eye, which is how Gruumsh earned his moniker \"One-Eye.\" Some orcish clerics deny this tale, dismissing it as elven propaganda, and claim that Gruumsh always had one eye.\nGruumsh created the orcs in his image to be his servants in the world but was cheated out of a home for his people by the other gods, according to the following excerpt by Roger E. Moore (from Unearthed Arcana):\nIn the beginning all the gods met and drew lots for the parts of the world in which their representative races would dwell. The human gods drew the lot that allowed humans to dwell where they pleased, in any environment. The elven gods drew the green forests, the dwarven deities drew the high mountains, the gnomish gods the rocky, sunlit hills, and the halfling gods picked the lot that gave them the fields and meadows. Then the assembled gods turned to the orcish gods and laughed loud and long. \"All the lots are taken!\" they said tauntingly. \"Where will your people dwell, One-Eye? There is no place left!\"\nThere was silence upon the world then, as Gruumsh One-Eye lifted his great iron spear and stretched it over the world. The shaft blotted the sun over a great part of the lands as he spoke: \"No! You Lie! You have rigged the drawing of the lots, hoping to cheat me and my followers. But One-Eye never sleeps. One-Eye sees all. There is a place for orcs to dwell…here!,\" he bellowed, and his spear pierced the mountains, opening a mighty rift and chasms. \"And here!,\" and the spearhead split the hills and made them shake and covered them in dust. \"And here!,\" and the black spear gouged the meadows and made them bare.\n\"There!\" roared He-Who-Watches triumphantly, and his voice carried to the ends of the world. \"There is where the orcs shall dwell! There they will survive, and multiply, and grow stronger, and a day will come when they cover the world, and they will slay all of your collective peoples! Orcs shall inherit the world you sought to cheat me of!\"\nGruumsh once had an alliance with the conniving drow goddess Araushnee, to bring down the gods of the elves once and for all. His plan failed, despite a divine force brought against the elven gods consisting of the Seldarine's enemies in all the goblinoid and elf-hating pantheons, and Araushnee was transformed into Lolth. The two deities have been great foes ever since, though Gruumsh's alliance with another assisting deity, Malar, has not been so badly corrupted.\n- Eric L. Boyd, and Erik Mona.

Ral Chikma), meaning the “Single Braid or Hair-lock” (Skt. eka-jata), is a powerful female deity of Indian Buddhist origin who serves as a protector of mantras, and is regarded as the “Queen of the mamo” or wrathful mother goddesses. Along with Rahula and Vajrasadhu (Tib. Dorje Legpa) she is one of the three main Nyingma protectors of the Dzogchen teachings. In Tibetan she is known by a number of names, including the 'Sole Mother with a Braid', the 'Mistress of the Life-force Spirits and Mother Goddesses', and 'Queen of the Enemy-gods'. These various classes of spirits may be considered as obstructive enemies over which Ekajati has control. As a protective goddess she guards the traditions of secret mantras and terma or 'revealed treasures', grants the wishes of all her practitioners, and protects them from demonic forces.\nEkajati leans towards the right in standing pratyalidha posture with her right leg bent and her left extended, as she tramples upon the head and legs of a female enemy that lies prone upon her golden sun disc, lotus, and vajra-rock formation. Ekajati is extremely wrathful and dark maroon in colour, with a fierce face and two extended arms. Her tawny-yellow hair is disheveled and hangs freely down her back, with one single twisted iron-like braid rising up above the crown of her head. She possesses the peculiarities of a one round red eye in the centre of her forehead, one long and sharp white tooth that bites down on her lower lip, and one distended and sagging breast.\nHer single eye represents the unity of her pristine awareness, while her two other eye sockets are empty. She has a gaping mouth, a twisting tongue, and upward blazing facial hair. She wears the five bone ornaments of a dakini, along with golden earrings, bracelets, armlets, anklets, a necklace, and a crown adorned with five dry white skulls. Around her neck hangs a garland of fifty freshly severed heads that are strung upon a thread of intestines. As a lower garment she wears a tiger-skin skirt or loincloth, the flayed skin of a human enemy, and a cloud-shaped collar and cape of smoke. The human-skin is looped around her neck and hangs behind her back like a shawl, and her smoke cape is edged with an indigo border and billows out behind her body. Nectar streams from her sagging single breast, symbolizing how she protects the teachings as if they were her only son, and nourishes practitioners with the great bliss of her compassion and wisdom-awareness.\nWith her right hand she wields aloft a corpse-club that is fashioned from the mummified body of an enemy, which symbolizes how her understanding of emptiness has dried-out the corpse of appearances. With her left hand she holds the torn-out heart of an enemy with three twisting life-veins hanging beneath it, which she consumes as food. This heart represents the dharmakaya, and her holding of it reveals how her awareness is 'fused' with reality. With this hand she also releases the female iron-wolf that serves as her principal 'messenger' to swiftly lure all demonic enemies into her sphere of activity. Light rays emanate from the pores of Ekajati's body and she is encircled by a blazing aura of awareness fire. In front of her is an upturned skull with scalped hair that contains the five torn-out sense organs of eyes, ears, a nose, a tongue and a heart; and flanking this are two cloud-borne skull-cups that contain swirling blue nectar and fresh blood.\n© text by Robert Beer"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f1284418-cc4a-40e1-b97b-acc32f95a307>","<urn:uuid:ab528f80-5ee8-4067-abb9-6c55ed7070a9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does antigenic drift in influenza viruses affect pandemic preparedness compared to ventilator capacity planning?","answer":"Antigenic drift and ventilator capacity planning present different challenges for pandemic preparedness. Antigenic drift occurs through regular mutations during viral replication (approximately 1 mutation per replication) that gradually alter the structure of surface antigens like hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, making existing vaccines and acquired immunity ineffective over time. This requires constant development of new vaccines. Meanwhile, ventilator capacity planning focuses on the immediate response to a severe pandemic, with studies showing a need for 35,000-60,500 additional ventilators (plus trained staff and supplies) even in a moderate scenario with a 30% attack rate and 0.5% case fatality rate. Without these resources, 200,000-300,000 Americans could die from lack of ventilator access. While antigenic drift poses an ongoing challenge for prevention through vaccination, ventilator shortages represent an acute crisis in treatment capacity during peak pandemic periods.","context":["Antigenic drift is the accidental alteration of genes encoding antigens. It typically occurs in viruses and enables the pathogen to evade the immune system, triggering an infection once more.\nCredit: Kateryna Kon/Shutterstock.com\nAntigens are molecules which can be bound by immune cell receptors in order to trigger an immune response. This mechanism of binding and recognition is used to detect threats to the body, including bacterium, viruses and various chemicals. The cells of the body also display antigens, which enable them to be distinguished from foreign material.\nWhat is antigenic drift?\nReceptors of the immune system bind to foreign antigens specifically, like a key inserting into a lock, which triggers an immune response to eliminate the threat. Once the infection is resolved, the body can produce many more of these specific receptors which can detect these specific antigens upon reinfection.\nThis functions as an acquired immune response, preventing future infections of the same antigen. If the same antigen is detected, the body can make the specific receptor very quickly, producing a fast and effective immune response, and preventing a second infection.\nVaccinations work with this acquired immune response, stimulating the production of receptors without the individual having to face the primary infection. Non-threatening antigens are introduced into the body which stimulates the production of specific immune receptors. Therefore, if the actual antigen is detected, an acquired immune response can be mounted and the body can fight off the infection more effectively.\nHowever, both vaccinations and the acquired immune response can only function if the antigenic structure remains the same. If the structure is altered, such as in antigenic drift and antigenic shift, then the highly specific receptors will no longer bind and so the acquired immune system will no longer be able to detect the threat.\nAn individual who has previously suffered with a specific viral infection, for example, can become ill for a second time. Therefore, altering the structure of surface antigens provides a potential mechanism for the evasion of the immune system by pathogens.\nAntigenic drift and influenza\nThe surface antigens of influenza include hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Hemagglutinin binds to epithelial cells and allows entry of the virion, whereas NA functions in the process of new virions budding from body cells.\nWhen influenza replicates its RNA to reproduce, errors can be made which lead to a mutation. Around 1 in 10000 nucleotides are transcribed incorrectly, which roughly is the length of the influenza genome, meaning that there is approximately 1 mutation every time influenza replicates. RNA, unlike DNA, lacks the ability to fix these mutations as it does not have proofreading enzymes, and therefore these errors lead to a small but permanent change in the genetic code.\nThis means that every time influenza replicates, the progeny are slightly different and can have slightly different HA and NA. Over time these differences accumulate and produce antigens which are substantially different to their ancestors. Therefore, their antigens “drift” which means they can no longer be detected by the acquired immune system of the body.\nAn individual who has previously suffered from one strain can then be reinfected as the body has no way of detecting that this is the same infection.\nAntigenic drift is a major problem in the design of vaccinations, particularly in influenza A. The slight changes in antigen structure mean that previous vaccines are no longer viable and new vaccines are constantly required. In the future, vaccines which can bind to different variants of HA and NA may provide protection against antigenic drift.\nVIDEO Further Reading","|Flu Viruses With Pandemic Potential - Credit CDC|\nBetween next Monday's 3 hour Smithsonian Livestream: “The Next Pandemic: Are We Prepared?\", next year's 100th anniversary of the deadliest influenza pandemic on record, and the recent rise in the number of novel flu viruses viewed to have pandemic potential (H7N9, H5N6, H5N8, etc.) - now seems a pretty good time to begin a new series on how we would (or wouldn't) cope during a severe pandemic.\nAdmittedly, not all pandemics are created equal - and as we saw in 2009 - their impact can vary widely. The CDC currently evaluates 14 novel flu viruses for their pandemic potential - ranking two H7N9 viruses (A & B in the chart above) at the top of their severity/impact list.There are other pandemic contenders - including MERS, SARS, Nipah, Pneumonic plague, and even Monkeypox - but novel influenza has the longest, and most worrisome track record.\nThe old Pandemic Severity Index (see graphic below) was adopted in the 2007 Community Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Mitigation plan as a way to quantify the likely impact of any pandemic outbreak. It was based on the initial CFR (Case Fatality Ratio) of the virus, and was modeled in many respects after the 5 category Saffir-Simpson wind scale used for hurricanes.\nLast April, in PSAF Is The New Pandemic Severity Index, we looked at the revised 2017 CDC/HHS Community Pandemic Mitigation Plan, which provided a new gauge of pandemic intensity based on multiple criteria; the PSAF (Pandemic Severity Assessment Framework).\nWhile the 1918 pandemic (upper right) is off by itself in terms of both transmissibility and clinical severity - and resulted in the deaths of between 50 and 100 million people - that isn't necessarily the top of the scale. It is just the worst we've seen in modern times.\nA moderately severe pandemic - like 1957's H2N2 influenza - could still kill hundreds of thousands of Americans, and millions worldwide.Even in 1918, most people who contracted the Spanish flu survived. Estimates are that up to 50% of the world's population fell ill, but in the United States and Europe the mortality rate was on the order of 2%, meaning that about 650,000 Americans (out of 100 million) perished.\nToday, with a population triple that of 1918, that number could approach two million.Reports from other parts of the globe, particularly India and Asia, suggested a much higher (10%-15%) toll in 1918, and low resource countries today would almost certainly suffer greater losses in a severe pandemic (see Are We Prepared to Help Low-Resource Populations Mitigate a Severe Pandemic?).\nWhile modern medicine - including antibiotics, antivirals, and ventilators - will likely have some impact on a severe pandemic, the expectation is that most medical facilities will be quickly overwhelmed, many HCWs will be out sick or taking care of family members, and medical interventions will be in short supply.\nThe supply chain, which keeps hospitals in IV fluids, disposable gowns, gloves, masks and respirators - and everything from aspirin to oxygen - will quickly falter. The same supply line collapse will likely mirror itself to some degree at your local grocery store and pharmacy.\nThe reality is that 90% of flu cases will never see the inside of a hospital. They will have to be treated at home, by family or friends (see Pandemic Solutions: Flu Buddies).While these challenges in our modern society may sound far-fetched, this is precisely the sort of scenario a study - published a couple of years ago in Clinical Infectious Diseases and written by researchers at our own CDC & HHS - envisioned in:\nEstimates of the demand for mechanical ventilation in the United States during an influenza pandemic.\nMeltzer MI1, Patel A2, Ajao A3, Nystrom SV4, Koonin LM5.\nAn outbreak in China in April 2013 of human illnesses due to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus provided reason for US public health officials to revisit existing national pandemic response plans. We built a spreadsheet model to examine the potential demand for invasive mechanical ventilation (excluding \"rescue therapy\" ventilation).\nWe considered scenarios of either 20% or 30% gross influenza clinical attack rate (CAR), with a \"low severity\" scenario with case fatality rates (CFR) of 0.05%-0.1%, or a \"high severity\" scenario (CFR: 0.25%-0.5%).\nWe used rates-of-influenza-related illness to calculate the numbers of potential clinical cases, hospitalizations, admissions to intensive care units, and need for mechanical ventilation. We assumed 10 days ventilator use per ventilated patient, 13% of total ventilator demand will occur at peak, and a 33.7% weighted average mortality risk while on a ventilator.\nAt peak, for a 20% CAR, low severity scenario, an additional 7000 to 11,000 ventilators will be needed, averting a pandemic total of 35,000 to 55,000 deaths.\nA 30% CAR, high severity scenario, will need approximately 35,000 to 60,500 additional ventilators, averting a pandemic total 178,000 to 308,000 deaths.\nEstimates of deaths averted may not be realized because successful ventilation also depends on sufficient numbers of suitably trained staff, needed supplies (eg, drugs, reliable oxygen sources, suction apparatus, circuits, and monitoring equipment) and timely ability to match access to ventilators with critically ill cases. There is a clear challenge to plan and prepare to meet demands for mechanical ventilators for a future severe pandemic.\nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Infectious Diseases Society of America 2015. This work is written by (a) US Government employee(s) and is in the public domain in the US.Worth noting, the `severe' scenario presented - a 30% attack rate and a CFR of .5% - is nowhere near the severity seen in 1918 (CFR of 2%), and could potentially be dwarfed by an avian flu pandemic with even a higher attack or mortality rate.\nEven so, their scenario finds without the unlikely rapid addition of 35,000 to 60,500 ventilators (and trained staff, oxygen, drugs, and electricity to run them), 200,000 to 300,000 Americans would die for the lack of ventilator resources.And this opens up the thorny problem of who gets a ventilator, and for how long? When do you withdraw ventilator support from one patient in order to give it to another? Who makes these decisions? And how will the public react to the heartbreaking realities of triage during a pandemic?\nThese are topics we visited repeatedly back in 2008 (see Ventilator Triage During A Pandemic , Triage In A Pandemic , Fear And Loathing Of Pandemic Triage, and The Allocation of Medical Resources) and while new guidelines have been published, answers remain murky.\nThe CDC's 2011 document Ethical Considerations for Decision Making Regarding Allocation of Mechanical Ventilators during a Severe Influenza Pandemic or Other Public Health Emergency spends 27 pages looking at a myriad of legal and ethical considerations, but concludes that `policy decisions need to be set and implemented by the responsible public health officials.'In 2015 the State of New York released a 266 page manual called VENTILATOR ALLOCATION GUIDELINES, which is broken up into Adult, Pediatric, and Neonatal sections. While this massive document probes deeply into the complexity of triage, it admits:\nWhile the Adult Guidelines developed by the Task Force and the 2006 and 2009 Adult Clinical Workgroups assist a triage officer/committee as they evaluate potential patients for ventilator therapy, decisions regarding treatment should be made on an individual (patient) basis, and all relevant clinical factors should be considered.\nA triage decision is not performed in a vacuum; instead, it is an adaptive process, based on fluctuating resources and the overall health of a patient. Examining each patient within the context of his/her health status and of available resources provides a more flexible decision-making process, which results in a fair, equitable plan that saves the most lives.Adding to the confusion, standards and guidelines will vary from one state to the next, and none have the benefit of having ever been tested under real pandemic conditions. Not to disparage the work that has gone into them, but the old adage that `No battle plan survives contact with the enemy' comes to mind.\nThese are issues that as a society, we don't tend to think about. We assume there will be a hospital bed, or ventilator, or medicines available to treat us if we need it. But in a severe pandemic we could find our medical infrastructure seriously overwhelmed, and those things we take for granted quickly unavailable.\nOne take away is the very last job you would want to take on in a severe pandemic is that of a hospital's triage officer, or member of a triage committee. And yet, many people will be called upon to make those horrendously difficult decisions.While you may be one of the lucky 50%-70% who are not infected, or among the 90% who only experience mild or moderate illness, a severe pandemic could still compromise your access to medical care. Routine surgeries, cancer treatments, dialysis, regular doctor's office visits and getting routine prescriptions from the pharmacy could all be severely affected.\nIn the months to come we'll look at other possible impacts of a severe pandemic on our society. In the meantime, now would be a very good time to talk with family, friends, and neighbors on how you would deal - and help one another - with a pandemic (or any other disaster) should it come our way.\nFor more on all of this, you may wish to revisit:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:81728ae8-e6af-4ff4-9f68-9a822101e241>","<urn:uuid:bf5cf5f4-e46f-4ca7-ab3f-40b10dedafd9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do soil degradation and deforestation together affect biodiversity loss and food security globally?","answer":"Soil degradation and deforestation create a compound threat to biodiversity and food security. About 20-25% of global soil resources are already degraded, with an additional 5-10 million hectares degraded annually, directly affecting 1.5 billion people's food security. This is further exacerbated by deforestation, as rainforests, which cover only 6-7% of Earth's surface but contain over half of all plant and animal species, are being rapidly destroyed. The combined effect leads to soil erosion, habitat fragmentation, species extinctions (137 species daily), and threatens global food production capacity.","context":["Table of Contents\nThe need for fertile soils is increasing due to the growing global demand for renewable raw materials and meat, and persistent population growth. At the same time, we are seeing a loss of fertile, healthy soils as a result of degradation processes such as erosion, salinisation and contamination. It is estimated that as much as 20-25% of global soil resources is degraded, i.e. has a reduced functional capacity. Soil degradation is an ongoing process which affects an additional 5-10 million hectares each year (for comparison, Austria has an area of 8.4 million hectares). Soil degradation across the world will therefore jeopardize global food security in the long run and deprive rural regions in particular of one of their main sources of income and economic development. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has stated that 1.5 billion people, i.e. more than a fifth of the global population, are already directly affected by soil degradation today. Soil degradation is a global phenomenon. That is why in 2011 the German Environment Agency, together with international institutions such as the Secretariat of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP ) and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), issued a call for action demanding a coordinated global approach to soil protection.\nThe Rio+20 Conference and the concept of a “land degradation neutral world”\nAt the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, held in Rio de Janeiro in 2012 (Rio+20 Conference), Heads of State and Government pledged to strive for a “land degradation neutral world”.\nThis means that in the future net soil loss through e.g. erosion, sealing and other forms of soil degradation must be balanced out by soil restoration. Since soil degradation cannot be prevented completely, it must at least be minimized and non-avoidable soil degradation must be offset by restoration and rehabilitation measures.\nThis declaration of intent must now be implemented at global, regional and national level.\nGlobal sustainable development goals (SDGs)\nLike the ‘land degradation neutrality’ concept, the sustainable development goals are an outcome of the 2012 Rio+20 Conference. The SDGs aim at sustainable global development on a social, ecological and economic basis. In particular, Goal 15 “Life on Land” promotes sustainable use of land and soils and the reversal of land degradation:\n„Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss”.\nThe German Environment Agency supports the implementation process of the SDGs relevant to soils by specific research activities.\nIt has been explored what methodological options exist for making soil degradation measurable at global level. Furthermore, soil organic carbon and its potential as globally relevant indicator for land and soil degradation has been investigated. Currently, options for the implementation of “land degradation neutrality” are being analyzed in a further research project.\nMonitoring and assessment\nInformation forms the basis for political decisions. Especially important is information on soil degradation trends and drivers. However, obtaining such information comes up against numerous obstacles. This is compounded by the problem that opinions differ on what soil degradation may be. Practicable and informative solutions need to be found to address this.\nThe implementation of international soil protection, and of the goal of a “land degradation neutral world” in particular, requires legal instruments at both national and international level. The stipulations of international law in this regard are insufficient so far. Proposals (“best practices”) must also be developed for implementation at national level. read more","What is Deforestation?\nDeforestation refers to the cutting, clearing, and removal of rainforest or related ecosystems into less bio-diverse ecosystems such as pasture, cropland, or plantations (Kricher, 1997).\nWhat are the causes of deforestation?\nIII. Oil and gas extraction\nIV. Cattle ranching\nV. Agriculture: Cash crops\nVI.

This disturbes the animals' habitat and may force them to enter habitats which are already occupied. This can pose many problems such as territorial conflicts, homelessness (loss of habitat), lack of food availability, migration disturbances, etc.\n- Soil erosion occurs when trees and plants are removed; the rain water washes the nutrients in the top soil away.\n- Changes in watershed geomorphology.\n- Desertification (dry, hot, arid conditions).\n- Edge effects can change microclimates (small climates) which affect endemic species (native species which can only live in specific environmental and habitat conditions).\n- Climate change (more carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, thus increasing the effects of global warming).\n- Pollution (ground, water and air pollution from oil extraction and mining chemicals).\n- Loss of culture (indigenous peoples subsistence living in the rainforest). People who live in the rainforest depend on the natural environment for food, shelter, materials for cooking, clothing, etc. If the forest is cut down or if their environment becomes polluted from oil extraction and mining, they are forced to move or risk starvation and sickness.\n- Displacement of people (loss of farmland, forest resources, etc).\n- Social conflicts and struggles over land and natural resources.\n- Conflicts over racial and ethnic rights.\n- Poisoning from oil and mining waste.\n- Economic uncertainty (price fluctuations and high interest rates on outstanding international loans with The World Bank and International Monetary Fund.\nWhat can we do to STOP or at least lessen the amount of deforestation and conserve our own use of natural resources such as wood, oil and gas, electricity, minerals and elements, and water?

Think of pencils as gold (you'll never lose them if you do).\n- Encourage your parents, relatives, and friends to buy furniture and wood that is Certified. That means the wood was legally cut-down.\n- If you buy a product and you notice they use wood chips to package it, write to the company and suggest they use another packaging material.\n- Trees get cut down for cattle to graze. Instead of eating meat, think of eating other sources of protein such as fish, soy, beans, whole-wheat, and nuts.\n- Buy organic fruits and vegetables. That means there are no insecticides or pesticides (poisonous chemicals) sprayed on the food. If these chemicals kill insects and pests that try and eat the vegetables, think about how harmful they can be to you and the environment.\n- Instead of buying gold or diamonds, which are mined and cause environmental damage, consider jewelry that is made from materials that are not mined...such as glass.\n- Encourage your parents, relatives, and friends to drive fuel efficient cars that get good gas mileage. Hybrid and bio-diesel cars get great mileage and use less or no gasoline.\n- Even better, whenever possible, walk, bike, carpool or use mass transit (bus or train).\n- Save electricity by turning off lights, t.v., radio, computer, etc when you are not using them.\n- Save water by NOT taking baths; instead take quick showers (turning off the water while you soap up) and then turning it back on to rinse quickly.\n- While washing your hands and brushing your teeth, turn off the water. You'll save gallons if you do.\n- When washing the dishes or your parent's car, turn off the water while washing it with soap.

{"question":"I want to understand the different communication styles when advocating for disability rights. What similarities exist between the assertive communication approach described in modern advocacy guidelines and the successful advocacy tactics used during the Reagan administration's attempted IDEA changes?","answer":"The assertive communication approach and the successful advocacy tactics during Reagan's era share key elements. Modern advocacy guidelines promote expressing thoughts clearly and directly while being respectful, using facts, and considering others' feelings. This aligns with how disability activists like Patrisha Wright and Evan Kemp approached their opposition to Reagan's proposed IDEA changes. They organized an effective campaign that presented clear facts through 40,000 letters and used personal stories from affected community members. Both approaches emphasize being firm but respectful - modern guidelines suggest using a calm but firm tone, while the 1980s activists maintained persistent pressure through organized protests and letter-writing while engaging constructively with officials, ultimately leading Vice President Bush to acknowledge their concerns and maintain IDEA intact.","context":["My advocacy plan\nWhat do you think?\nBefore you get started, think about how you would answer the following questions.\n- How do you decide what movie to go to in your group of friends?\n- What would you do if you received the wrong order at a restaurant?\n- How do you ask for what you want?\n- What laws protect students with disabilities?\nBe an advocate\nPart of getting older and gaining independence means becoming a “self-advocate.”\nWhat does self-advocacy mean?\nIt means speaking up for yourself and communicating what you need to others. It involves knowing your strengths and weaknesses, knowing what your rights are and effectively communicating through speaking and listening.\nThese advocacy skills are needed in many aspects of life (i.e., in school with your teachers, at home with your family, at work with your boss and co-workers and with your friends). Advocacy skills are equally important in college.\nWhat doesn’t it mean?\nBeing a self-advocate does not mean that you will always get what you want. However, many times, effective communication does change the behavior of others.\nSelf-advocacy involves effective communication. Using assertive communication to advocate for our wants and needs can help us achieve our goals, help us feel good about ourselves, develop positive relationships with others built on respect and support our decision-making abilities.\nThere are three types of communication — passive, aggressive and assertive.\n- Passive communicators never stand up for what they want or need and are often afraid of hurting others’ feelings or being rejected.\n- Aggressive communicators, on the other hand, may be impulsive, bold and overbearing. They may even include sarcastic or belittling comments to communicate.\n- Assertive communicators express both positive and negative thoughts and ideas in a clear, direct way, without stepping on anyone’s toes. Effective self-advocacy involves assertive communication.\nHere are some tips to help you communicate assertively.\n- Use “I” statements and consider the feelings of others.\n- Be conscious of your tone of voice. Be firm and calm but nice.\n- Stick to the facts.\n- Be respectful of others’ opinions and feelings.\n- Use appropriate body language such as make eye contact, face the individual you are talking with and have a pleasant but serious facial expression.\n- Listen to the individual you are talking with about their opinions or feelings.\nWhat are your rights?\nAs an individual with a disability, you are protected under three laws. It is important to know your rights in order to ask for what you want and require.\nThe Individuals with Disability Education Act is the law stating students with disabilities in high school have the right to a free and appropriate education where you will get appropriate special education services.\nIn college, qualified students with disabilities are eligible for services and are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. There are no special education classes in college, but students with disabilities can receive accommodations. Accommodations are modifications or adjustments to help you perform tasks. For example, one type of accommodation in college is receiving extended time on exams.","Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (1975)\nIn 1975, the United States Congress passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, referred to as the IDEA, which codified the right of all American children to a free and appropriate public education regardless of disability status. The IDEA requires all public schools that accept federal funds to provide education that meets the needs of students with disabilities at the public expense. Prior to IDEA, many students with disabilities went without any educational opportunities, and many faced confinement in institutions. The IDEA enshrined the right to education for children with disabilities, allowing millions of children to learn in a public-school classroom by setting guidelines for accessibility and the instruction of students with disabilities in American public schools.\nDuring most of the twentieth century, children with disabilities frequently faced discrimination in public education either through the lack of appropriate accommodations or complete exclusion from local schools. At the start of the 1970s, only about twenty percent of children with disabilities attended a public school. Often, instead of attending local schools, children who were blind, deaf, had physical disabilities like cerebral palsy, or had intellectual disabilities like Down syndrome were sent to institutions with little to no educational instruction. Parents and disability activists at the time called for an end to forcing children with disabilities into separate learning facilities.\nThe IDEA came about after decades of civil rights struggles involving the American education system. In the 1954 case Brown v. Board of Education, the US Supreme Court found that racial segregation of students in public schools violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Equal Protection Clause requires all people to be subject to equal treatment under the law. Following the end of segregation based on race, disability advocates began to file lawsuits of their own against the continued segregation of students with disabilities in public education. Two 1972 federal court cases, Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens (PARC) v. Pennsylvania, hereafter PARC, and Mills v. Board of Education, hereafter Mills, ended with the decision that schools are required to provide education to fit the needs of students with disabilities. Despite the judicial victory, there was still a lack of a federal standard for special education programming, and enforcement of accessibility requirements, so disabilities advocates pushed for a federal law enshrining education rights.\nThe legislative history of the IDEA began in 1960 with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, which was the first time the federal government allocated direct aid to states for public education. A portion of the money included funding for state-run institutions for the Blind, Deaf, and people who were, at the time, called mentally retarded, a term which is unacceptable for describing people with disabilities as of 2022. The following year, Congress amended the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to create the Bureau for the Education of the Handicapped. A few years later, Congress passed the Education of the Handicapped Act of 1970, or the EHA, which expanded the grant offerings by the federal government for special education programming in state public schools. After the decisions in PARC and Mills, Congress amended the EHA to allow states to receive federal funds only if they implemented policies to fully integrate students with disabilities in their schools.\nIn 1975, Congress passed Amendments to the EHA called the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, or the EAHCA. The EAHCA included a bill of rights for students with disabilities that specified the right to access a free and appropriate public education, or FAPE. FAPE includes special education programming designed to meet the individual needs of a student at no cost to their family. In 1990, the EAHCA was amended once again and renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The 1990 amendments included several changes, including the addition of autism and traumatic brain injury as eligible for IDEA benefits.\nCongress once again reauthorized the IDEA in 1997, under President William Clinton. The 1997 amendments to the IDEA included allowances for disciplinary actions schools can take with students with disabilities. Among the provisions was the right for a school to remove a student from the school for up to forty-five days if they are involved with drugs or weapon use. Additionally, the amendments codify the right of students with disabilities to continue to receive educational services even when they are expelled or suspended.\nThe most recent reauthorization as of 2022 occurred in 2004 under President George W. Bush with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, or IDEA 2004. Several of the amendments in IDEA 2004 involved learning disabilities, including requirements for states to develop criteria for identifying and assessing students with learning disabilities, along with a requirement that the criteria cannot include a discrepancy in intellectual ability and achievement. Additional changes required special education teachers who teach core subjects to their students to be highly qualified, which requires a bachelor’s degree, state licensure, and satisfactory completion of appropriate state examinations. The 2004 reauthorization of the IDEA established the National Center for Special Education Research within the Department of Education, which examines and improves the implementation of the IDEA and special education programs.\nIDEA is divided into four sections, labeled parts A, B, C, and D. Part A defines terms used throughout the IDEA and mandates the formation of the Office of Special Education Programs, which monitors special education funding to states. Part B outlines the requirements for schools to educate students from ages three to twenty-one as well as ensures federal funding. Additionally, Part B codifies the rights to FAPE, student evaluations for disability, input by parents and students, and learning in a least restrictive environment, which means students with disabilities should learn in settings with non-disabled peers as much as possible. Another component of Part B is individualized education plans, or IEPs. IEPs are developed in coordination with the school, parents, and the student to specify what actions the school will take to achieve a child's development goals. Finally, Part B mandates that children and parents are entitled to due process rights to determine if the child is receiving the proper services.\nParts C and D expanded the programing offered by the IDEA. Part C focuses on early intervention for infants and toddlers with disabilities from birth to two years of age. Similar to IEPs, Part C requires states that receive federal funds from IDEA to develop Individualized Family Service Plans, or IFSPs, to clarify resources and goals for families with physically or developmentally disabled children. Part D provides resources for national activities intended to improve education outcomes for students with disabilities. Some Part D expenditures include improving the training for qualified special educators, translating academic research into practical tools in special education, and funding research and deployment of assistive technologies for students with disabilities.\nIDEA enforcement has primarily occurred through federal oversight and parents filing lawsuits against school districts that fail to meet their child's needs, however, the effectiveness of that enforcement came under threat at the start of the 1980s. Initially, in 1981, the newly elected Ronald Reagan administration declared plans to eliminate IDEA in its entirety to reduce the size of the federal government by ending the oversight required to ensure students with disabilities received FAPE. However, public outcry led them to attempt to less overtly curtail some of the rights outlined in the IDEA. One proposed change was to reduce or eliminate many of the oversight measures on school districts to reduce the burden on schools. Another proposed change was to reduce the number of students who would qualify for services by narrowing the definitions of handicaps under the law. Under such a change, simply having a disability would not necessarily deem a child eligible for services under IDEA. The administration also sought to reduce the ability of parents to challenge changes to their child's education plans and IEPs. Schools would no longer be required to consult parents to change an IEP. Finally, the proposed changes would have nullified all mandates for students to learn in a least restrictive environment not explicitly outlined in the IDEA itself. Overall, the proposed amendments would have reduced federal spending on special education services under IDEA by thirty percent by drastically cutting educational resources for children with disabilities.\nThe Reagan Administration's proposed changes to IDEA and attempts to revoke implementation of other disability legislation like Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which forbade organizations that accepted federal funds from discriminating against people with disabilities, drew responses from tens of thousands of concerned parents and disability activists. Disability activists, primarily Patrisha Wright and Evan Kemp, organized a national letter-writing campaign that collected over 40,000 letters from concerned Americans, dropping off hundreds of bags containing pleas to keep the IDEA and Section 504 intact at the White House in protest. Wright and Kemp were both disabled self-advocates with decades of leadership experience in the disability rights movement. Additional protests included thousands of parents and disability community advocates attending public hearing events held throughout the country. By 1983, the administration relented, with Vice President George H. W. Bush writing a letter to Kemp saying that the IDEA and Section 504 would remain unchanged. Bush cited the outpouring of opposition from community members and parents, especially the personal stories of the people facing the loss of necessary services, as the reason for the change in policy direction.\nThe IDEA served as a clear acknowledgment of the inadequacies of American public education in service to students with disabilities. After several decades of legal development and policy implementation, nearly all children with disabilities in the United States have access to accessible education as of 2022. The US Department of Education reported that 7.5 million students with disabilities received services under the IDEA during the 2018 to 2019 school year. Millions of children who would have otherwise received little to no formal education are fully integrated into public school classrooms across the United States. While disparities in graduation rates and post-secondary education attainment persist between disabled and non-disabled students as of 2022, implementation of the IDEA continues to close the gap by ensuring students with disabilities have the opportunity to learn in public school classrooms with their non-disabled peers.\n- American Psychological Association. \"Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).\" American Psychological Association. https://dictionary.apa.org/individuals-with-disabilities-education-act (Accessed October 4, 2022).\n- Anderson, Susan Heller. \"Goals on Handicapped Meet Wide Resistance.\" New York Times, November 14, 1982. https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/14/education/the-reagan-effect-goals-on-handicapped-meet-wide-resistance.html (Accessed October 4, 2022).\n- Brown v.

{"question":"What are the key differences between Medicare Initial Enrollment Period and Social Security early retirement eligibility in terms of timing and age requirements?","answer":"The Medicare Initial Enrollment Period occurs around age 65, with a seven-month window that includes three months before the 65th birthday, the birthday month itself, and three months after. In contrast, Social Security early retirement eligibility begins at age 62, though taking benefits this early results in a 25% reduction from the full retirement age benefit amount. The full retirement age for Social Security is 66 or 67 depending on birth year, while Medicare eligibility remains fixed at 65 for most people, unless they qualify earlier due to disability, ALS, or ESRD.","context":["The decision of when to draw social security benefits can have a lifelong impact on one’s ability to have sufficient enough funds to afford retirement. For too many retirees, an insufficient social security nest egg is all they have.\nWaiting to collect social security benefits versus not waiting to collect social security benefits can be a difficult decision make. A number of factors need to be taken into account in order to make an intelligent and well-informed decision.\nThis article will highlight the impact of various situations on this decision.\nUS News makes the following case about whether or not it ever makes sense to take social security before the full retirement age:\nWhile you’re eligible to start drawing Social Security at age 62, your monthly benefit is reduced by 25 percent from what you would receive at your full retirement age (66 or 67, depending on when you were born). If you wait until age 70, you can expect your monthly Social Security benefit to be 76 percent more than if you start drawing at 62.\nIn the article, Leann Sullivan, vice president at TFC Financial Management in Boston, makes this interesting point: “Probably the primary time is when there’s a health issue.”\nSomeone who can no longer work because of illness or who doesn’t expect to live very long would be smart to draw sooner rather than later, she says.\nIn addition, here are four situations in which it may make sense to take Social Security early, as US News also noted:\n1. You can’t live without the money. For those who have no other source of income or not enough money to pay expenses, early Social Security may be necessary to put food on the table. “A lot of times it’s going to make sense for one of the spouses to collect a little bit earlier,” Lucey says. “There’s just a lot of cases where additional cash flow earlier in retirement makes a lot of sense.”\n2. You don’t expect to live past age 80. According to the Social Security administration, a man turning 65 this year can expect to live to just over 84. For a woman, the expected age is 86 1/2. But people with terminal illnesses or serious health issues may know they won’t live that long, so taking Social Security early makes sense.\n3. You can’t work but you aren’t eligible for disability benefits. Someone who had a physically demanding job may not be able to do that particular job anymore but isn’t considered disabled because he or she can do other kinds of work. For individuals who are otherwise in good health, seeking a new job at 62 may make sense. Others might be better off drawing Social Security.\n4. You’re a widow or widower. Widows or widowers can draw from their former spouse’s benefits starting at age 60, and that does not affect their ability to draw their own benefits later. Divorced spouses or minor children may also be eligible for benefits.\nThis analysis looks at it from a similar but slightly different angle. The following five steps guide you on a methodical approach to evaluating this important decision:\nStep #1 – Find Out Where You Stand\nYou need to know how much your benefits will be and when, exactly, you'll reach what the Social Security Administration (SSA) considers \"full retirement age,\" the age at which you can receive those benefits without penalty. Your benefits are based on your lifetime earnings. If you're over 60 but not yet receiving benefits, you should receive a statement in the mail from the SSA reviewing your potential benefits at different retirement ages.\nStep #2 – If you’re out of work or in financial trouble, take the money as soon as you can.\nThe earliest you can collect benefits is age 62. But you'll pay a penalty of 25% or more in your monthly benefits by filing before full retirement age. You also could lose more if you continue working while collecting a monthly Social Security check. Until the year you reach full retirement age, your benefits will be cut by $1 for every $2 you earn over a certain amount annually. That is why retirement experts generally suggest you wait until you reach full retirement age, or even older, before filing for benefits. But if you're unemployed and out of savings, or if you're only working part-time and finding it impossible to make ends meet, then none of the above is as important as your immediate need. The decision is really a no-brainer. Take the money as soon as you qualify.\nStep #3 – If you’re working and in good health, wait at least until full retirement age.\nIf you're married, and you die before your spouse, he or she can often collect a survivor's benefit based on your earnings. But if you elect to take early benefits, your spouse will receive a reduced check after you're gone.\nStep #4 – If you really like your job, wait even longer, but not beyond 70.\nOne of the oddities of Social Security is that full retirement age isn't the point at which you reach your maximum possible benefits. Keep working and paying into the system, and you can earn even more later.\nStep #5 – Apply with Uncle Sam.\nOnce you've decided the time is right, applying is pretty simple. You can do it over the phone or online. The government says it can take as little as 15 minutes.\nIn conclusion, besides following the approaches outlined in the two reports above, we highly recommend you engage the services of a financial planner or other suitable professional should you have a desire to learn more about adding social security benefits to your portfolio.","When and how to apply for Medicare\nLearn about Medicare enrollment periods and how to sign up for Medicare Parts A, B, C and D\nYou’re about to get Medicare! That’s great news because the program helps pay for your health care costs and brings peace of mind. But learning how Medicare works and how to apply can be overwhelming. You might have questions, like:\nWhat does Medicare cover?\nWhen can I sign up for Parts A and B?\nWhat about signing up for the optional Parts C and D?\nOr is a Medigap plan right for me?\nExactly how do I sign up for Medicare?\nDo I have to sign up every year?\nHow will I know when I’m enrolled?\nWe’ll help you get answers to all your questions. Let’s take a look at all the steps to get you to the finish line.\nLearn how Medicare works\nBefore you apply for Medicare, spend time learning about what Medicare covers and when you can sign up or change plans.\nGet helpful information at these official sites:\n- The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) manages the Medicare program. You can get information at medicare.gov.\n- The Social Security Administration works with CMS to enroll people in the Medicare program and administers Social Security benefits.\nMedicare has two “parts”:\n- Part A is hospital insurance. It covers inpatient hospital stays, home health care and skilled nursing facility care. Most people don’t have to pay a premium for Part A.\n- Part B is medical insurance. It covers doctor visits, outpatient services, lab tests and screenings, and durable medical equipment. Part B has a monthly premium, based on income.\nMedicare from the federal government, also called Original Medicare, covers Part A and Part B. It doesn’t cover all your health care costs, and it doesn’t include coverage for most outpatient prescription drugs (Part D). That’s where a private Medicare plan can help. For more on what these different parts of Medicare cover, check out Medicare parts explained.\nWhen to apply for Medicare\nPeople often ask, “Is it mandatory to sign up for Medicare at age 65?” Enrolling in Medicare is tricky if you don’t know when you’re eligible. There are certain times when you can sign up for Medicare or switch plans. If you don’t apply for Medicare at the right time, you may end up paying a late enrollment penalty when you sign up later.\nHere are the general guidelines to sign up for Medicare.\n- Most people apply for Medicare when they are going to turn age 65\n- Or you may qualify at any age if you have a disability, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), or End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)\nIt’s smart to sign up for Medicare Part A when you’re eligible. You can enroll in Medicare Part B at the same time as Part A. Or you can delay enrolling in Part B for a variety of reasons.\nUsually people delay Part B if they have primary health insurance from their job or a spouse’s. Check with your human resources department to make sure the group or union plan meets the requirements to delay Part B enrollment. If so, once your coverage from an employer or union stops, you have eight months to sign up for Part B without any penalty.\nRemember, if you don’t sign up for Medicare when you should, you could pay a late enrollment penalty. That penalty would be added to your monthly premium permanently. So it’s best to know the right time to sign up.\nThe key periods to apply for Medicare are: Initial Enrollment Period, General Enrollment Period, Annual Enrollment Period and Special Enrollment Period. Here’s how they work:\nMedicare Initial Enrollment Period\nYour first chance to enroll in Medicare is around age 65 when you have a seven-month window to apply. During the Medicare Initial Enrollment Period, you can enroll in Original Medicare Parts A and B. You can look at plans or sign up at any time during the three months before, the month of, and the three months after your 65th birthday. Need coverage the month you turn 65? Sign up in the three-month window before your birthday.\nAfter you enroll in Parts A and/or B, you may be able to enroll in a Medicare Part C or Part D plan to get extra medical and prescription drug coverage. We’ll talk more about that below.\nMedicare General Enrollment Period\nIf you don’t sign up for Medicare Part A and/or Part B when you’re eligible, you can apply for Medicare for the first time using the General Enrollment Period from Jan. 1 through March 31 every year. This enrollment period is only available to people who didn’t sign up during their Initial Enrollment Period and who aren’t eligible for a Special Enrollment Period (see below). Coverage would begin July 1. You may have to pay a higher premium for Part A and/or Part B due to late enrollment.\nMedicare Annual Enrollment Period\nOnce you sign up for Original Medicare Part A and Part B, you have the coverage and don’t need to renew it. But every year you have an opportunity to sign up for Part C (Medicare Advantage plan) or add Part D (Medicare Prescription Drug Plan) to Original Medicare if you want more coverage. Private insurance companies offer Part C and Part D plans through contracts with the Medicare program. You can apply for these plans during the Medicare Annual Enrollment Period (also known as Medicare Annual Election Period or open enrollment). This happens every year from Oct. 15 through Dec. 7. Your new plan would be effective Jan. 1 of the following year.\nMedicare Special Enrollment Periods\nSituations come up throughout the year that give you the chance to sign up for or change your Medicare plan. These special times are outside of your Initial Enrollment Period or the Annual Enrollment Period.\nThere are several special cases that trigger a Special Enrollment Period. Visit medicare.gov to find out more. Here are some common situations:\n- You move: Whether you move to a new address, a new county or state, or into a nursing home, you’ll be able to apply for a new Medicare plan.\n- You want to switch to a 5-star Medicare plan: Every year, Medicare evaluates plans based on a 5-star rating system. Medicare considers these plans “excellent.” You can make the switch once to a 5-star plan anytime from Dec. 8 through Nov. 30 if one is available in your area.\n- You lose your current coverage: This applies if you or your spouse will retire or change to a job that doesn’t offer coverage. It doesn’t apply if your insurance company cancels your coverage because you didn’t pay your monthly premiums.\n- Your plan changes its contract with Medicare: Enrollment in a plan depends on the plan’s contract with Medicare, and for various reasons these contracts could change.\nHow to sign up for Medicare\n- If you aren’t yet getting Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits, you need to apply for Medicare.\n- If you already get Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits, the SSA or RRB will automatically sign you up for Medicare Part A and B so it’s effective the month of your 65th birthday.\nHow to apply for Medicare through Social Security\nApply online: The easiest way to complete the Medicare enrollment application is online at ssa.gov. It’s convenient to sign up from home. You can start and stop the application and save your information. After you submit your application, you’ll get a receipt to print and keep. You can also check the status of your application.\nApply in person: Visit your local Social Security office. You can find the nearest office with the Social Security office locator. They recommend that you make an appointment.\nApply by phone: Call Social Security at 800-772-1213 (TTY 800-325-0778).\nHow to apply for Medicare through the RRB\nIf you worked for the railroad, contact the RRB at 877-772-5772 (TTY 711) to apply for Medicare.\nCan my spouse and I sign up for Medicare together?\nAs a married couple, you’ve probably done everything together for quite some time. So it makes sense that you’d like to find out if you and your spouse can sign up for Medicare together. Unfortunately, it’s not possible.\nMedicare only offers plans for individuals. You can’t have a dependent or be one on a Medicare plan. You and your spouse are eligible based on your birthdates. Your seven-month Initial Enrollment Period may overlap with your spouse’s sign-up window. But you each need to sign up for Medicare individually and select your own plan.\nWant more coverage than Original Medicare?\nParts A and B cover a portion of your health care costs. Many people choose to enroll in a private Medicare plan that offers more coverage. You’ll need to be eligible for and/or enrolled in Part A and Part B for these types of plans. So it’s best to have your Part A and Part B effective dates and your Medicare ID number when you’re ready to enroll.\nYou can apply for private Medicare plans that have medical only or Part D only coverage. There are also convenient plans that combine medical and Part D coverage. You’ll want to check which plans are available in the county where you live. Learn more about the different types of private Medicare plans in these articles:\nMedicare Advantage (Part C) usually combines medical and Part D coverage in one plan.\nMedicare Supplement (Medigap) is medical-only coverage.\nMedicare Cost can be a medical-only plan or combined medical and Part D coverage.\nMedicare Prescription Drug Plan (Part D) is a Part D drug plan only\nYou can sign up for Medicare Advantage, Medicare Cost or Medicare Prescription Drug plans during your Initial Enrollment Period, the Medicare Annual Enrollment Period or if you qualify for a Special Enrollment Period. You can apply for a Medigap plan during the six-month period that starts the month of your 65th birthday. During this period you have a guaranteed issue right, which means you don’t have to provide your health information.\nYou do not apply for a private Medicare plan through SSA or RRB. Here are some ways to apply for a private Medicare plan:\n- Use the online Medicare Plan Finder\n- Call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227 or TTY 1-877-486-2048). Talk to a counselor about the options and how to enroll, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n- Work directly with the Medicare plan you want, either at their website or by calling or meeting with a sales representative.\n- Work with a licensed independent broker who represents different Medicare plans.\n- Call the Minnesota Senior LinkAge Line. This is a free information and assistance service. Call 800-333-2433 (TTY 711).\nWhat happens after you apply for Medicare?\nCMS will review and process your application. They’ll contact you if they need more information.\nWhen you’re approved for Medicare Part A and/or Part B, CMS will send you a welcome packet that includes the following:\n- your confirmation letter\n- your red, white and blue Medicare ID card\n- a “Welcome to Medicare” booklet that walks you through decisions you may have to make with your Medicare coverage\n- the Medicare & You handbook\nIf you’ve applied for a private Medicare plan such as a Medicare Advantage, Medicare Cost, Medigap or Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, when your enrollment is accepted you’ll get a separate confirmation letter and ID card.\nMedicare helps pay for your health care costs, and that brings peace of mind. The program also wants you to stay healthy and covers a preventive visit with your doctor each year. So once you get Medicare Part B, schedule your initial “Welcome to Medicare” visit with your doctor. And each year you get an “Annual Wellness Visit” with your doctor.

Monitor therapy\nAlso see individual agents.\nEndocrine & metabolic: Hypoglycemia (26% to 40%)\nImmunologic: Antibody development (21% to 26%)\n1% to 10%:\nCentral nervous system: Headache (5%)\nEndocrine & metabolic: Severe hypoglycemia (≤1%)\nGastrointestinal: Nausea (10%), diarrhea (7%)\nLocal: Injection site reaction (2%)\nRespiratory: Nasopharyngitis (7%), upper respiratory tract infection (6%)\nFrequency not defined: Local: Hypertrophy at injection site, lipoatrophy at injection site\n<1% (Limited to important or life-threatening): Abdominal distention, abdominal pain, constipation, decreased appetite, dyspepsia, flatulence, gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, vomiting\nConcerns related to adverse effects:\n• Antibody formation: Development of antibodies to insulin and lixisenatide may occur; in clinical trials with lixisenatide, high titers were observed in 2.4% of patients and were associated with an attenuated glycemic response. Allergic reactions and injection site reactions were more frequent in antibody positive patients; consider alternative antidiabetic therapy in patients not achieving targeted glycemic control or with worsening glycemic control and/or significant allergic or injection site reactions.\n• Hypersensitivity: Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with lixisenatide and with insulin glargine; discontinue use if hypersensitivity reactions occur and treat promptly as indicated. It is not known if patients with a history of hypersensitivity to other GLP-1 agonists are at increased risk for hypersensitivity reactions with lixisenatide; patients with prior serious reactions to similar agents should be monitored closely.\n• Hypoglycemia: The most common adverse effect of insulin is hypoglycemia. The timing of hypoglycemia differs among various insulin formulations. Hypoglycemia may result from increased work or exercise without eating; use of long-acting insulin preparations (eg, insulin detemir, insulin glargine, insulin degludec) may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. Profound and prolonged episodes of hypoglycemia may result in convulsions, unconsciousness, temporary or permanent brain damage, or even death. Insulin requirements may be altered during illness, emotional disturbances, or other stressors. Instruct patients to use caution with ethanol; may increase risk of hypoglycemia.\n• Hypokalemia: Insulin (especially IV insulin) causes a shift of potassium from the extracellular space to the intracellular space, possibly producing hypokalemia. If left untreated, hypokalemia may result in respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia and even death. Use with caution in patients at risk for hypokalemia (eg, loop diuretic use). Monitor serum potassium and supplement potassium when necessary.\n• Pancreatitis: Cases of acute pancreatitis (including hemorrhagic and necrotizing with some fatalities) have been reported with GLP-1 receptor agonists; monitor for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (eg, persistent severe abdominal pain which may radiate to the back, and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue use. Do not resume unless an alternative etiology of pancreatitis is confirmed. Consider alternative antidiabetic therapy in patients with a history of pancreatitis (has not been studied).\n• Gastroparesis: Lixisenatide slows gastric emptying and is not recommended for use in patients with gastroparesis (has not been studied); do not initiate therapy in patients with severe gastroparesis.\n• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment. Dosage adjustments may be necessary. Patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 to 89 mL/minute/1.73 m2) may be at increased risk of adverse effects (eg, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) which may lead to dehydration, acute kidney injury, and worsening of chronic renal failure. There is limited experience with severe impairment (eGFR 15 to <30 mL/minute/1.73 m2); lixisenatide exposure may be increased in these patients. Monitor all patients with renal impairment closely for decreasing renal function. Use is not recommended in patients with end-stage renal disease (eGFR <15 mL/minute/1.73 m2) (has not been studied).\n• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.\nConcurrent drug therapy issues:\n• Drug-drug interactions: Potentially significant interactions may exist, requiring dose or frequency adjustment, additional monitoring, and/or selection of alternative therapy. Consult drug interactions database for more detailed information.\nDosage form specific issues:\n• Multiple dose injection pens: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), pen-shaped injection devices should never be used for more than one person (even when the needle is changed) because of the risk of infection. The injection device should be clearly labeled with individual patient information to ensure that the correct pen is used (CDC 2012).\n• Appropriate use: Not approved for use in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (insulin-dependent, IDDM).\n• Patient education: Diabetes self-management education (DSME) is essential to maximize the effectiveness of therapy.\nDiabetes mellitus: Plasma glucose, electrolytes, HbA1c (at least twice yearly in patients who have stable glycemic control and are meeting treatment goals; quarterly in patients not meeting treatment goals or with therapy change [ADA 2016a]), potassium (in patients at risk for hypokalemia; renal function, signs/symptoms of pancreatitis; signs/symptoms of adverse GI effects (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting); signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity\nAdverse events were observed in some animal reproduction studies. Refer to individual monographs.\n• Discuss specific use of drug and side effects with patient as it relates to treatment. (HCAHPS: During this hospital stay, were you given any medicine that you had not taken before? Before giving you any new medicine, how often did hospital staff tell you what the medicine was for? How often did hospital staff describe possible side effects in a way you could understand?)\n• Patient may experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, flatulence, lack of appetite, rhinitis, pharyngitis, common cold symptoms, headache, weight gain, or injection site irritation. Have patient report immediately to prescriber signs of pancreatitis (severe abdominal pain, severe back pain, severe nausea, or vomiting), signs of kidney problems (urinary retention, hematuria, change in amount of urine passed, or weight gain), signs of low potassium (muscle pain or weakness, muscle cramps, or an abnormal heartbeat), difficulty swallowing, vision changes, dizziness, passing out, seizures, change in skin to thick or thin at injection site, shortness of breath, excessive weight gain, swelling in the arms or legs, or signs of low blood sugar (dizziness, headache, fatigue, feeling weak, shaking, tachycardia, confusion, increased hunger, or sweating) (HCAHPS).\n• Educate patient about signs of a significant reaction (eg, wheezing; chest tightness; fever; itching; bad cough; blue skin color; seizures; or swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat).

{"question":"What are the unique characteristics of the recently discovered Etruscan pyramids in Orvieto, and how do they compare to traditional burial customs in Western countries?","answer":"The recently discovered Etruscan pyramids in Orvieto, Italy, date back to at least the 5th Century BCE and were carved into the plateau rock. These structures were found filled and covered by a modern wine cellar floor, with well-dressed walls that suggest they were likely tombs or part of a sanctuary. They have no known parallels in Italy. The excavation has revealed Etruscan tunnels, pottery, and artifacts dating back to 1200 BCE. As for Western burial customs, bodies are typically placed in graves within cemetery plots, with the deceased usually positioned on their back with legs fully extended. Burials may also occur in vaults, chambers, or mausoleums, and tombs can include graves, burial vaults, and burial monuments.","context":["Tip o’ the pileus to Explorator reader Don Buck for pointing us to a version of this story, which really should be getting wider attention. Here’s the version from St Anselm College:\nClassics professor David George and a group of Saint Anselm students and alumni discovered for the first time a series of pyramidal structures under the city of Orvieto, Italy.\nFor 20 years, George has led students to archaeological dig sites to uncover the mysteries of the past including trips to Greece and most recently Castel Viscardo and Orvieto, towns in the southwest edge of Umbria, Italy.\nThis year, George and co-driector, Claudio Bizzarri of the Parco Archeogico Ambientale dell’Orvietanoas, an expert in Orvieto archaeology, worked at a second site in addition to the first at Castel Viscardo. There they discovered pyramids dating to at least the 5th Century BCE carved into the plateau rock on which Orvieto stands.\nThe archaeologists and students uncovered a series of Etruscan tunnels, 5th century BCE Etruscan pottery, as well as material dating back to 1200 BCE. George believes the subterranean pyramids were likely tombs or part of a sanctuary. He says there are no parallels to this anywhere in Italy.\n“We know its not a quarry or a cistern; the walls are too well dressed to be a quarry and there is no evidence of mud which would point to a cistern. That leaves just a couple of things, some sort of a religious structure or a tomb, both of which are without precedent here,” says George.\nAt the time of their discovery, the structures were filled, covered by a top floor that had been modified for modern use, most currently, a wine cellar. Upon noting some Etruscan construction techniques in the stone stairwell, Drs. George and Bizzarri obtained a permit to dig deeper.\nExcavation of the site began on May 21 where the group dug through a mid 20th century floor reaching a medieval floor. Immediately beneath this subfloor, George and Bizzarri with their team excavated a layer of fill containing materials and artifacts ranging from the middle of the 5th century BCE to 1000 BCE.\nThe archaeologists believe they are currently at least 12 meters from the bottom, having already dug down 5 meters. The Etruscan stone steps continue to descend and the group discovered a caniculo leading into the second pyramid. The site will sit idle until May 2013, when Drs. George and Bizzarri return with their crews.\nIn May 2013, George will also resume his work at the original site in Coriglia, near Castel Viscardo for his eighth season. You can read about George and his crew at http://www.digumbria.com. Over the past seven seasons, they have uncovered evidence for occupation of the site dating from the 10th c. BCE all the way to the 16th c. CE (as well as random regalia from World War II). To date, the site’s strongest phases are Etruscan and Roman (Republican, Early Imperial, and Late Antique). This year they discovered an Etruscan foundation deposit dating to the 6th century BCE underneath one of the walls.\n- via: Classics Professor Discovers First Ever Etruscan Pyramids in Italy (St Anselm College)\nThe original article has links to a flickr set of photos from the dig (including one which will, not doubt, have some group claiming the Egyptians were in Italy). There is also a link to this interview with Dr George by an Italian station taken inside the ‘pyramid':\nAlso worth a look is the news and video coverage from WMUR:","Burial and funeral customs are the methods and ceremonies used in the disposing\nof bodies of dead persons. People have always had a deep reverence for the dead.\nThe funeral ceremonies they have adopted have grown out of their views on death\nand the after life. The most common methods of disposing of bodies are;\ninterment (burial) and cremation (burning). Other forms of disposition include:\nmummification, bequeathing of the body, direct disposition, cryogenics, and\nvarious forms of natural decomposition. Many practices are based upon religious\nbeliefs, and may directly effect the disposition choice.\n|Disposal of the Dead\nBurial, the method most common in Western countries, is usually in a grave in a\ncemetery plot. Sometimes burial is in a vault, or chamber. There are burial vaults\nin some churches, and some cemeteries have buildings (often called mausoleums)\ncontaining vaults. Burial may also be in a stone coffin, or sarcophagus, which\nserves as a monument to the dead. Graves, burial vaults, and burial monuments\nare all called tombs.\nIn Western countries the body is usually placed in the grave on its back, with the\nlegs fully extended. Moslems are buried in the right side, facing holy Mecca. When\nBuddhists use burial they put the head to the north with the face upward, as\nBuddha was buried.\nEarly Christians adopted the custom of putting the feet toward the east so that at\nthe resurrection the reborn might hurry toward the sunrise. Many primitive\npeoples buried their dead in the fetal position, with knees drawn up toward the\nchin. There was a belief that death is related to birth, and that the body in the\ngrave is awaiting rebirth.\nIn former times almost every cemetery had elaborate and impressive tombstones.\nNow the trend is toward the simple, and often the stone is merely a marker.\n|This main topic focuses on all subjects,\nbut not limited to, topics dealing with\nmodern funeral traditions and customs\nfrom the U.S., and abroad. It also covers,\nfuneral etiquette, disposition options,\nReligious rites, wakes, vigils, traditional\nfuneral alternatives, as well as, mourning\nand grieving practices. It also includes\npallbearers, eulogies, processions,\nobituaries and more.\n|Additional Traditions Information\nBurial at Sea was once a common practice in the west.

{"question":"How does China justify its South China Sea claims historically, and what legal challenges does it face internationally?","answer":"China justifies its South China Sea claims by asserting the region has been 'China's historical territory since ancient times,' with Premier Wen Jiabao and other officials citing historical and jurisprudential evidence. However, this stance faces significant legal challenges. The vast majority of international legal experts have concluded that China's claim to historic title over the South China Sea is invalid. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) largely rejects historically-based claims. Additionally, China's claims conflict with its own historical positions - while Beijing historically maintained that its land boundaries were never defined and delimited, it contradictorily claims its maritime boundaries were always clearly defined. The 2021 South China Sea Arbitral Tribunal ruled that China's claims to historic rights within the 'nine-dash line' are contrary to UNCLOS and without lawful effect. As a party to UNCLOS, China has a legal obligation to comply with this ruling.","context":["By: Mr Mohan Malik\n(Mohan Malik is a professor in Asian security at Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, in Honolulu. The views expressed are his own. His most recent book is China and India: Great Power Rivals. This article was published in World Affairs, May/June 2013 issue.)\nThe Spratly Islands—not so long ago known primarily as a rich fishing ground—have turned into an international flashpoint as Chinese leaders insist with increasing truculence that the islands, rocks, and reefs have been, in the words of Premier Wen Jiabao, “China’s historical territory since ancient times.” Normally, the overlapping territorial claims to sovereignty and maritime boundaries ought to be resolved through a combination of customary international law, adjudication before the International Court of Justice or the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, or arbitration under Annex VII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). While China has ratified UNCLOS, the treaty by and large rejects “historically based” claims, which are precisely the type Beijing periodically asserts. On September 4, 2012, China’s foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, told US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that there is “plenty of historical and jurisprudence evidence to show that China has sovereignty over the islands in the South China Sea and the adjacent waters.”\nAs far as the “jurisprudence evidence” is concerned, the vast majority of international legal experts have concluded that China’s claim to historic title over the South China Sea, implying full sovereign authority and consent for other states to transit, is invalid. The historical evidence, if anything, is even less persuasive. There are several contradictions in China’s use of history to justify its claims to islands and reefs in the South China Sea, not least of which is its polemical assertion of parallels with imperialist expansion by the United States and European powers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Justifying China’s attempts to expand its maritime frontiers by claiming islands and reefs far from its shores, Jia Qingguo, professor at Beijing University’s School of International Studies, argues that China is merely following the example set by the West. “The United States has Guam in Asia which is very far away from the US and the French have islands in the South Pacific, so it is nothing new,” Jia told AFP recently.\nChina’s claim to the Spratlys on the basis of history runs aground on the fact that the region’s past empires did not exercise sovereignty. In pre-modern Asia, empires were characterized by undefined, unprotected, and often changing frontiers. The notion of suzerainty prevailed. Unlike a nation-state, the frontiers of Chinese empires were neither carefully drawn nor policed but were more like circles or zones, tapering off from the center of civilization to the undefined periphery of alien barbarians. More importantly, in its territorial disputes with neighboring India, Burma, and Vietnam, Beijing always took the position that its land boundaries were never defined, demarcated, and delimited. But now, when it comes to islands, shoals, and reefs in the South China Sea, Beijing claims otherwise. In other words, China’s claim that its land boundaries were historically never defined and delimited stands in sharp contrast with the stance that China’s maritime boundaries were always clearly defined and delimited. Herein lies a basic contradiction in the Chinese stand on land and maritime boundaries which is untenable. Actually, it is the mid-twentieth-century attempts to convert the undefined frontiers of ancient civilizations and kingdoms enjoying suzerainty into clearly defined, delimited, and demarcated boundaries of modern nation-states exercising sovereignty that lie at the center of China’s territorial and maritime disputes with neighboring countries. Put simply, sovereignty is a post-imperial notion ascribed to nation-states, not ancient empires.\nChina’s present borders largely reflect the frontiers established during the spectacular episode of eighteenth-century Qing (Manchu) expansionism, which over time hardened into fixed national boundaries following the imposition of the Westphalian nation-state system over Asia in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Official Chinese history today often distorts this complex history, however, claiming that Mongols, Tibetans, Manchus, and Hans were all Chinese, when in fact the Great Wall was built by the Chinese dynasties to keep out the northern Mongol and Manchu tribes that repeatedly overran Han China; the wall actually represented the Han Chinese empire’s outer security perimeter. While most historians see the onslaught of the Mongol hordes led by Genghis Khan in the early 1200s as an apocalyptic event that threatened the very survival of ancient civilizations in India, Persia, and other nations (China chief among them), the Chinese have consciously promoted the myth that he was actually “Chinese,” and therefore all areas that the Mongols (the Yuan dynasty) had once occupied or conquered (such as Tibet and much of Central and Inner Asia) belong to China. China’s claims on Taiwan and in the South China Sea are also based on the grounds that both were parts of the Manchu empire. (Actually, in the Manchu or Qing dynasty maps, it is Hainan Island, not the Paracel and Spratly Islands, that is depicted as China’s southern-most border.) In this version of history, any territory conquered by “Chinese” in the past remains immutably so, no matter when the conquest may have occurred.\nSuch writing and rewriting of history from a nationalistic perspective to promote national unity and regime legitimacy has been accorded the highest priority by China’s rulers, both Nationalists and Communists. The Chinese Communist Party leadership consciously conducts itself as the heir to China’s imperial legacy, often employing the symbolism and rhetoric of empire. From primary-school textbooks to television historical dramas, the state-controlled information system has force-fed generations of Chinese a diet of imperial China’s grandeur. As the Australian Sinologist Geremie Barmé points out, “For decades Chinese education and propaganda have emphasized the role of history in the fate of the Chinese nation-state . . . While Marxism-Leninism and Mao Thought have been abandoned in all but name, the role of history in China’s future remains steadfast.” So much so that history has been refined as an instrument of statecraft (also known as “cartographic aggression”) by state-controlled research institutions, media, and education bodies.\nChina uses folklore, myths, and legends, as well as history, to bolster greater territorial and maritime claims. Chinese textbooks preach the notion of the Middle Kingdom as being the oldest and most advanced civilization that was at the very center of the universe, surrounded by lesser, partially Sinicized states in East and Southeast Asia that must constantly bow and pay their respects. China’s version of history often deliberately blurs the distinction between what was no more than hegemonic influence, tributary relationships, suzerainty, and actual control. Subscribing to the notion that those who have mastered the past control their present and chart their own futures, Beijing has always placed a very high value on “the history card” (often a revisionist interpretation of history) in its diplomatic efforts to achieve foreign policy objectives, especially to extract territorial and diplomatic concessions from other countries. Almost every contiguous state has, at one time or another, felt the force of Chinese arms—Mongolia, Tibet, Burma, Korea, Russia, India, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Taiwan—and been a subject of China’s revisionist history. As Martin Jacques notes in When China Rules the World, “Imperial Sinocentrism shapes and underpins modern Chinese nationalism.”\nIf the idea of national sovereignty goes back to seventeenth-century Europe and the system that originated with the Treaty of Westphalia, the idea of maritime sovereignty is largely a mid-twentieth-century American concoction China has seized upon to extend its maritime frontiers. As Jacques notes, “The idea of maritime sovereignty is a relatively recent invention, dating from 1945 when the United States declared that it intended to exercise sovereignty over its territorial waters.” In fact, the UN’s Law of the Sea agreement represented the most prominent international effort to apply the land-based notion of sovereignty to the maritime domain worldwide—although, importantly, it rejects the idea of justification by historical right. Thus although Beijing claims around eighty percent of the South China Sea as its “historic waters” (and is now seeking to elevate this claim to a “core interest” akin with its claims on Taiwan and Tibet), China has, historically speaking, about as much right to claim the South China Sea as Mexico has to claim the Gulf of Mexico for its exclusive use, or Iran the Persian Gulf, or India the Indian Ocean.\nAncient empires either won control over territories through aggression, annexation, or assimilation or lost them to rivals who possessed superior firepower or statecraft. Territorial expansion and contraction was the norm, determined by the strength or weakness of a kingdom or empire. The very idea of “sacred lands” is ahistorical because control of territory was based on who grabbed or stole what last from whom. The frontiers of the Qin, Han, Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties waxed and waned throughout history. A strong and powerful imperial China, much like czarist Russia, was expansionist in Inner Asia and Indochina as opportunity arose and strength allowed. The gradual expansion over the centuries under the non-Chinese Mongol and Manchu dynasties extended imperial China’s control over Tibet and parts of Central Asia (now Xinjiang), Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. Modern China is, in fact, an “empire-state” masquerading as a nation-state.\nIf China’s claims are justified on the basis of history, then so are the historical claims of Vietnamese and Filipinos based on their histories. Students of Asian history know, for instance, that Malay peoples related to today’s Filipinos have a better claim to Taiwan than Beijing does. Taiwan was originally settled by people of Malay-Polynesian descent—ancestors of the present-day aborigine groups—who populated the low-lying coastal plains. In the words of noted Asia-watcher Philip Bowring, writing last year in the South China Morning Post, “The fact that China has a long record of written history does not invalidate other nations’ histories as illustrated by artifacts, language, lineage and genetic affinities, the evidence of trade and travel.” Unless one subscribes to the notion of Chinese exceptionalism, imperial China’s “historical claims” are as valid as those of other kingdoms and empires in Southeast and South Asia. China laying claim to the Mongol and Manchu empires’ colonial possessions would be equivalent to India laying claim to Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Burma, Malaysia (Srivijaya), Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka on the grounds that they were all parts of either the Maurya, Chola, or the Moghul and the British Indian empires.\nChina’s claims in the South China Sea are also a major shift from its longstanding geopolitical orientation to continental power. In claiming a strong maritime tradition, China makes much of the early-fifteenth-century expeditions of Zheng He to the Indian Ocean and Africa. But, as Bowring points out, “Chinese were actually latecomers to navigation beyond coastal waters. For centuries, the masters of the oceans were the Malayo-Polynesian peoples who colonized much of the world, from Taiwan to New Zealand and Hawaii to the south and east, and to Madagascar in the west. Bronze vessels were being traded with Palawan, just south of Scarborough, at the time of Confucius. When Chinese Buddhist pilgrims like Faxian went to Sri Lanka and India in the fifth century, they went in ships owned and operated by Malay peoples. Ships from what is now the Philippines traded with Funan, a state in what is now southern Vietnam, a thousand years before the Yuan dynasty.”\nAnd finally, China’s so-called “historic claims” to the South China Sea are actually not “centuries old.” They only go back to 1947, when Chiang Kai-shek’s nationalist government drew the so-called “eleven-dash line” on Chinese maps of the South China Sea, enclosing the Spratly Islands and other chains that the ruling Kuomintang party declared were now under Chinese sovereignty. Chiang himself, saying he saw German fascism as a model for China, was fascinated by the Nazi concept of an expandedLebensraum (“living space”) for the Chinese nation. He did not have the opportunity to be expansionist himself because the Japanese put him on the defensive, but cartographers of the nationalist regime drew the U-shape of eleven dashes in an attempt to enlarge China’s “living space” in the South China Sea. Following the victory of the Chinese Communist Party in the civil war in 1949, the People’s Republic of China adopted this cartographic coup, revising Chiang’s notion into a “nine-dash line” after erasing two dashes in the Gulf of Tonkin in 1953.\nSince the end of the Second World War, China has been redrawing its maps, redefining borders, manufacturing historical evidence, using force to create new territorial realities, renaming islands, and seeking to impose its version of history on the waters of the region. The passage of domestic legislation in 1992, “Law on the Territorial Waters and Their Contiguous Areas,” which claimed four-fifths of the South China Sea, was followed by armed skirmishes with the Philippines and Vietnamese navies throughout the 1990s. More recently, the dispatch of large numbers of Chinese fishing boats and maritime surveillance vessels to the disputed waters in what is tantamount to a “people’s war on the high seas” has further heightened tensions. To quote commentator Sujit Dutta, “China’s unmitigated irredentism [is] based on the . . . theory that the periphery must be occupied in order to secure the core. [This] is an essentially imperial notion that was internalized by the Chinese nationalists—both Kuomintang and Communist. The [current] regime’s attempts to reach its imagined geographical frontiers often with little historical basis have had and continue to have highly destabilizing strategic consequences.”\nOne reason Southeast Asians find it difficult to accept Chinese territorial claims is that they carry with them an assertion of Han racial superiority over other Asian races and empires. Says Jay Batongbacal of the University of the Philippines law school: “Intuitively, acceptance of the nine-dash line is a corresponding denial of the very identity and history of the ancestors of the Vietnamese, Filipinos, and Malays; it is practically a modern revival of China’s denigration of non-Chinese as ‘barbarians’ not entitled to equal respect and dignity as peoples.”\nEmpires and kingdoms never exercised sovereignty. If historical claims had any validity then Mongolia could claim all of Asia simply because it once conquered the lands of the continent. There is absolutely no historical basis to support either of the dash-line claims, especially considering that the territories of Chinese empires were never as carefully delimited as nation-states, but rather existed as zones of influence tapering away from a civilized center. This is the position contemporary China took starting in the 1960s, while negotiating its land boundaries with several of its neighboring countries. But this is not the position it takes today in the cartographic, diplomatic, and low-intensity military skirmishes to define its maritime borders. The continued reinterpretation of history to advance contemporary political, territorial, and maritime claims, coupled with the Communist leadership’s ability to turn “nationalistic eruptions” on and off like a tap during moments of tension with the United States, Japan, South Korea, India, Vietnam, and the Philippines, makes it difficult for Beijing to reassure neighbors that its “peaceful rise” is wholly peaceful. Since there are six claimants to various atolls, islands, rocks, and oil deposits in the South China Sea, the Spratly Islands disputes are, by definition, multilateral disputes requiring international arbitration. But Beijing has insisted that these disputes are bilateral in order to place its opponents between the anvil of its revisionist history and the hammer of its growing military power.\nFor more on the South China Sea Issue, pls read:","- Raul Pedrozo\nChina and the Rules-Based Legal Order for the Indo-Pacific\nFor once, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has made an accurate observation about the South China Sea. On August 9, 2021, a London-based “journalist” and guest contributor to China Global Television Network wrote an article indicating the United States “cannot make the rules in the South China Sea.” Naderi is absolute correct—the United States does not make the rules, but neither does China.\nAs with all the world’s oceans, the South China Sea is governed by customary international law rules, most recently codified in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), that have been developed over the past two centuries. The United States Navy has championed these customary norms since the beginning of the Republic, and it has, on more than one occasion, gone to war to preserve these navigational rights and freedoms. If challenged, the United States would inevitably fight again to preserve a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\nAs in by-gone days, the rules-based order that has effectively regulated lawful uses of the seas is once again under attack, this time by China, Russia, and other rogue nations that want to change the rules to advance their nationalistic agendas. So, while the United States may not make the rules, it certainly has a right and obligation, along with other states governed by the rule of law, to safeguard freedoms of navigation and overflight and other internationally lawful uses of the sea associated with those freedoms.\nII. The China Threat\nNaderi tows the CCP line that China does not pose a threat to its neighbors and that U.S.-led naval exercises are being used by Washington to fraudulently project the illusion of the “China threat.” Yet some dozen partners from India to Oceania are combining efforts and strengthening their armed forces in recognition that China poses the greatest threat to peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region since World War II. Naderi’s assertion that China’s efforts to create a new regional order should be supported because it is based on strict respect for international law and the U.N. Charter, as well as the right of states “to decide their futures freely and without external threat and pressure” is equally incredulous. Such a misrepresentation is disingenuous at best.\nOn the eve of the opening ceremonies of the Tokyo Olympics, the CCP aired a video where China threatened Japan with continuous nuclear strikes and “full-scale war” if Tokyo interfered in Chain’s handling of Taiwan. This statement was made despite the fact that China has a “no first use policy,” which states China will only use nuclear weapons in response to an nuclear attack against China and unconditionally undertakes not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear-weapon states (like Japan). Perhaps it is time for Tokyo to join the nuclear club as a counterbalance to China’s increasing nuclear capabilities?\nMoreover, China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels continue to illegally intrude into the waters surrounding the Senkaku Islands, which are clearly Japanese territory and have been under the administrative control of Tokyo since 1972. In 2021, CCG vessels operated in Japanese waters for 152 consecutive days, the highest number on record since 2012. It should, therefore, come as no surprise that Japan identified China as its number one security threat in its 2021 White Paper.\nThe CCP’s threat against Japan should come as no surprise given the increasing level of aggression directed at Taiwan since September 2020. Between 1954 and 2020, the Davis Line (the median line in the Taiwan Strait) was reportedly breeched only four times by Chinese aircraft. Beginning in September 2020, however, Chinese intrusions have increased in both scope and size raising the possibility that these unprecedented incursions are not consistent with the peacetime right of overflight in international airspace, but rather constitute a threat to use force against Taiwan in violation of Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. Four of the more provocative intrusions occurred in September 2020 (19 combat aircraft), March 2021 (20 combat aircraft), April 2021 (25 combat aircraft), and August 2021 (11 combat aircraft). Moreover, between January 1 and November 30, 2020, Chinese warplanes penetrated Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) about 380 times, compared to six intrusions in 2016 and 20 intrusions in 2017. Given the heightened cross-strait tensions, these acts of coercion by combat aircraft are designed to alter the status quo in the Taiwan Strait and clearly raise the risk of miscalculation and military confrontation.\nAlthough the United States maintains a “One-China Policy,” this policy is premised on the condition “that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means” and that any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means would be viewed with grave concern by the United States. Moreover, China recently sought to increase tensions by publicly telling Taipei that the United States would abandon the idea of defending Taiwan, citing the recent fall of Kabul to the Taliban as precedent. China’s current aggression toward Taiwan demonstrates it has not lived up to its end of the bargain. Perhaps it is time for the United States to reconsider and abandon the misguided “One-China Policy” and reestablish diplomatic ties with Taipei.\nSouth China Sea and ASEAN Regional States\nChina routinely ignores the provisions of the Declaration of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) by threatening and using force against the other South China Sea claimants and engaging in activities that raise tensions and undermine regional peace and stability, such as occupying, reclaiming, and militarizing a number of uninhabited South China Sea features. China routinely interferes with the resource rights of the regional states, purporting to control their exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and continental shelves by arresting or sinking fishing boats, harassing survey vessels and offshore oil rigs, and illegally seizing fishing equipment and fish catch. China has blocked access to over $2.5 trillion in unexploited oil and gas resources, resulting in enormous economic loss for the other South China Sea claimants. This aggression upends the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of the regional states and runs counter to their ability to fulfill U.N. goals of sustainable development.\nChina has also established seven military outposts on massive artificial islands that have changed the status quo of the South China Sea. Militarization of these outposts clearly violates China’s commitment to exercise self-restraint in conducting activities that could complicate or escalate the ongoing disputes and affect regional peace and stability. These shore-based infrastructure improvements, such as airfields and hangars for combat aircraft, port facilities and deep-water channels to improve access for large warships, communications and surveillance facilities, fixed-weapons positions, and improved logistics hubs (water and fuel storage facilities), provide China with a persistent and robust power projection presence that will be used to threaten the sovereignty of regional nations, impede free and open access to the South China Sea, and endanger global prosperity.\nAt an August 2021 meeting of the U.N. Security Council, under the chairmanship of India, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken discussed many of these concerns, underscoring the importance to defend, uphold, and revitalize the rules-based international order reflected in UNCLOS, which regulates all activities in the oceans and is critical to global stability and the security and prosperity of all nations. He emphasized that the international order is under serious threat in the South China Sea where China has engaged in dangerous and provocative actions to advance its illegal maritime claims and intimidate and bully other claimant states “from lawfully accessing their maritime resources.”\nChina objected to the discussion of the South China Sea issue in the U.N. Security Council, indicating that the U.S. remarks were irresponsible, that China and ASEAN countries were capable of maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea, and that the United States was stirring up trouble by sending ships and aircraft to the region. China additionally emphasized that the United States has no credibility on maritime issues given that Washington has failed to join UNCLOS, “but considers itself a judge of the convention.”\nChina has a point—the United States is not a party to UNCLOS and maybe it should be so it can deflect future Chinese criticism. Nonetheless, since 1983, the United States has publicly accepted and acted in accordance with the provisions of the convention regarding traditional uses of the oceans and recognized the rights of other states in waters off their coasts, as reflected in UNCLOS, so long as the rights and freedoms of the United States and other nations are recognized by the coastal states. Concomitantly, the United States has also exercised and asserted its navigational rights and freedoms on a worldwide basis, consistent with the convention, and has demonstrated its non-acquiescence in unilateral acts of other states that restrict the navigational rights and freedoms of, and other lawful uses of the sea, by the international community.\nChina, on the other hand, despite being a party to UNCLOS, is recognized globally as a serial violator of the convention. Virtually all of its domestic legislation applicable to its maritime claims is inconsistent with UNCLOS and customary international law. Most of China’s claimed straight baselines along its mainland coast do not meet the geographic requirements of UNCLOS (articles 5 and 7) and are therefore illegal. Similarly, China’s claimed baselines around the disputed Paracel Islands and part of the Senkaku Islands are unlawful. As a continental state, China may not draw straight baselines around its claimed mid-ocean archipelagoes (UNCLOS articles 46 and 47). China has failed to demonstrate its open, notorious, effective, and continuous exercise of authority over the Gulf of Bohai and Hainan Strait, as well as a showing of actual acquiescence by foreign states in the exercise of that authority. Thus, China’s claim that the gulf and strait constitute internal waters based on historic rights is inconsistent with international law.\nLikewise, China’s requirement in its 1992 territorial sea law that foreign warships and other government non-commercial vessels require prior permission to conduct innocent passage through the territorial sea is contrary to UNCLOS (articles 17 and 19) so long as the ship does not engage in any activities that is considered to be prejudicial to the peace, good order, or security of the coastal state. China’s claim that it has jurisdiction over security-related matters in its contiguous zone violates the plain language of UNCLOS (article 33), which limits coastal states authority in the contiguous zone to prevent and punish infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations committed within its territory or territorial sea.\nChina’s purported authority to regulate all foreign military activities in its EEZ is equally untenable and in direct contravention of international law. While China exercises exclusive rights to the resources of the zone and jurisdiction over marine scientific research (MSR), all states have an absolute right under international law to conduct military activities beyond the territorial sea of another state. Within the EEZ, all states enjoy high seas freedoms of navigation and overflight and other internationally lawful uses of the seas related to those freedoms (UNCLOS articles 56, 86 and 89). Military operations, exercises, and activities, to include military marine data collection and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations, have always been regarded as internationally lawful uses of the sea and the right to conduct military activities in the EEZ is not affected by the convention.\nChina’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ), which was established in 2013 and encompasses much of the East China Sea, also does not comport with state practice and customary international law. All nations enjoy freedom of overflight in international airspace seaward of the territorial sea. The purported application of ADIZ regulations to transiting aircraft that do not intend to enter Chinese national airspace interferes with the freedom of overflight and is therefore inconsistent with international law.\nFinally, China’s reprehensible refusal to comply with the award of the South China Sea Arbitral Tribunal reaffirms Beijing’s disdain for contemporary international law and accentuates its devious plans to alter the rules-based international order to advance its illegal maritime claims. The tribunal ruled that “China’s claims to historic rights, or other sovereign rights or jurisdiction, with respect to the maritime areas of the South China Sea encompassed by the relevant part of the ‘nine-dash line’ are contrary to the Convention and without lawful effect….” The tribunal’s award is final and binding, and as a party to the convention China has a legal obligation to comply with the ruling (UNCLOS article 296, Annex VII article 11). Beijing cannot pick and chose which decisions it will observe or reject.\nIV. “Policing” the South China Sea\nIf China acted as a responsible state actor and did not engage in activities that intimidate its neighbors, no one would have to police the South China Sea. But, Naderi is correct in saying that no one has deputized the U.S. Navy to be the South China Sea policeman. Nonetheless, as Secretary Blinken astutely observed before the Security Council in August 2021, every state has the responsibility “to defend the rules that we’ve all agreed to follow and peacefully resolve maritime disputes” and if a state like China “faces no consequences for ignoring these rules, it fuels greater impunity and instability everywhere.”\nA conflict in the South China Sea would devastate the global economy and have serious, long-term consequences for international peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region. Some of the world’s busiest and most strategic sea lines of communication (SLOC) traverse the South China Sea, with nearly one-third of global maritime trade and two-thirds of the world’s oil shipments transiting these waters annually. This includes between $3.4 and $5.3 trillion in ship-borne trade, including $1.2 trillion bound for U.S. ports. Thus, the United States has an abiding interest in “policing” and ensuring the South China Sea SLOCs remain open to protect U.S. and allied economic interests and maintain regional and global peace and security.\nLike it or not, the Indo-Pacific region will only enjoy continued stability, economic growth, and prosperity if the United States and its partners maintain peaceful and deliberate military operations in the region to counter Chinese hegemony. As a maritime domain, the Indo-Pacific requires the continuous presence of naval and air forces of allies and partners to ensure it remains free and open. Continued U.S. naval operations in the Indo-Pacific will buttress regional peace, stability, and security and counterbalance China’s efforts to alter the rules-based international legal order that has preserved peace and stability in the region for eight decades. As a Pacific nation, global leader, and premier maritime power, the United States remains committed to countering China’s unlawful intimidation and coercion against its neighbors, which threaten their sovereignty and reinforce China’s efforts to advance its illegal maritime claims. The rules-based order has benefited all nations and it will continue to do so unless bullies like China are allowed to change the status quo and alter the rules that have effectively governed the world’s oceans for centuries.\n*** The views expressed herein belong solely to the author and do not necessarily represent the opinions of JTMS or the Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies.

{"question":"What are the spiritual and cultural practices associated with the Pongal festival, and how does it promote social unity and family bonding across Tamil communities?","answer":"The Pongal festival combines spiritual rituals with cultural unity. In Hindu temples, the occasion is celebrated with bells, drums, clarinets, and conch shells, while rice is cooked in new pots until boiling over to symbolize abundance. Rituals include prayer chanting, offering vegetables, sugar cane, and spices to gods, with devotees consuming the offerings to absolve past sins. On the cultural side, the festival promotes social cohesiveness by bringing people together in common functions. Families gather early in the morning, wear new clothes, and cook traditional Pongal (rice pudding) in their front garden. The dish is shared with neighbors, friends, and relatives, making sharing an important feature of the celebration. The festival also serves as an occasion for family reunions, healing estrangements, and fostering reconciliation, with old enmities and personal animosities being forgotten.","context":["Tamil Nadu Tour\nPongal is the only festival of Hindu that follows a solar calendar and is celebrated on the fourteenth of January every year. Pongal has astronomical significance: it marks the beginning of Uttarayana, the Sun’s movement northward for a six month period. In Hinduism, Uttarayana is considered auspicious, as opposed to Dakshinaayana, or the southern movement of the sun. All important events are scheduled during this period. Makara Sankranthi refers to the event of the Sun entering the zodiac sign of Makara or Capricorn.\nIn Hindu temples bells, drums, clarinets and conch shells herald the joyous occasion of Pongal. To symbolize a bountiful harvest, rice is cooked in new pots until they boil over. Some of the rituals performed in the temple include the preparation of rice, the chanting of prayers and the offering of vegetables, sugar cane and spices to the gods. Devotees then consume the offerings to exonerate themselves of past sins.\nPongal signals the end of the traditional farming season, giving farmers a break from their monotonous routine. Farmers also perform puja to some crops, signaling the end of the traditional farming season. It also sets the pace for a series of festivals to follow in a calendar year. In fact, four festivals are celebrated in Tamil Nadu for four consecutive days in that week. ‘Bogi’ is celebrated on January 13, ‘Pongal’ on Jan 14, ‘Maattuppongal’ on Jan 15, and ‘Thiruvalluvar Day’ on Jan 16.\nThe festival is celebrated for four days. On, the first day, Bhogi, the old clothes and materials are thrown away and fired, marking the beginning of a new life. The second day, the Pongal day, is celebrated by boiling fresh milk early in the morning and allowing it to boil over the vessel – a tradition that is the literal translation for Pongal. People also prepare savories and sweets, visit each other’s homes, and exchange greetings. The third day, Mattu Pongal, is meant to offer thanks to the cows and buffaloes, as they are used to plough the lands. On the last day, Kanum Pongal, people go out to picnic.\nA festival called Jalli kathu is held in Madurai, Tiruchirapalli and Tanjavur,all in Tamil Nadu, on this day. Bundles of money are tied to the horns of Pongal ferocious bulls which the villagers try to retrieve. Everyone joins in the community meal, at which the food is made of the freshly harvested grain. This day is named and celebrated asTamilian Tirunal in a fitting manner through out Tamil Nadu.\nThus, the harvest festival of Pongal symbolizes the veneration of the first fruit. The crop is harvested only after a certain time of the year, and cutting the crop before that time is strictly prohibited. Even though Pongal was originally a festival for the farming community, today it is celebrated by all. In south India, all three days of Pongal are considered important. However, those south Indians who have settled in the north usually celebrate only the second day. Coinciding with Makara Sankranti and Lohri of the north, it is also called Pongal Sankranti.","Thai Pongal is celebrated on the first day of the month Thai of the Tamil calendar. The day normally falls between 12th and 15th of the month of January in the Christian calendar. Thus, Thai is the first month of the Tamil Almanac, and Pongal is a dish of sweet concoction of rice, moong dal, jaggery and milk. This festival is celebrated by one and all as it is non-relevance to any particular religious faith. The whole Tamil population of the world celebrate it without any differences. Therefore it is widely known as \"Tamil Thai Pongal\" or the \"Festival of the Tamils\".\nThe Tamil festival of Thai Pongal is a thanks giving ceremony in which the farmers celebrate the event to thank the spirits of nature spirit, the Sun and the farm animals for their assistance in providing a successful harvest. The rest of the people celebrate the festival to pay their thanks to the farmers for the production of food. Overall, it is a festival to encourage social cohesiveness and unite people by bringing them together in a common function. There are many songs about Thai Pongal and there is much Tamil literature about it.\nThai Pongal generally includes customs & celebrations that are the expression of jubilation over life's renewal. On Thai Pongal, the family begins the day early. Every member of the family gets up early in the morning, bathes, puts on new clothes and gathers in the front of the garden (muttram) to cook the traditional Pongal (rice pudding). The front garden is pre-prepared for this ceremonious cooking. A flat square pitch is made and decorated with kolam drawings, and it is exposed to the direct sun light. A fire wood hearth will be set up using three bricks. The cooking begins by putting a clay pot with water on the hearth.\nA senior member of the family conduct the cooking and the rest of the family dutifully assists him or her or watches the event. When the water has boiled the rice is put into the pot - after a member the family ceremoniously puts three handful of rice in first. The other ingredients of this special dish are chakkarai (brown cane sugar) or katkandu (sugar candy), milk (cow's milk or coconut milk), roasted green gram (payaru), raisins, cashew nuts and few pods of cardamom.\nWhen the meal is ready it is first put on a banana leaf and the family pray for few minutes to thank the nature sprit, the sun and farmers.\nThen the meal (Pongal) is served with fruits (banana and mango) among the family. Later it will be shared with neighbors, friends and relatives. Although every household makes the food, sharing each others 'Pongal' is the one of the important features of the event. Some Hindu scholars believe that the rice is ceremoniously cooked on the Thai Pongal day because of its importance as a potent symbol of auspiciousness and fertility. The evenings are spent attending cultural events or visiting relatives and friends.Thanksgiving Day,\nThe day of the Thai Pongal is devoted to thanksgiving to cattle. The farmers pay great attention to the animals which have ploughed the fields and drawn the carts throughout the year. To show his gratitude for this invaluable service the animals are bathed, their horns are painted in red, blue, yellow and green. Their foreheads are smeared with turmeric and kumkum. Their necks are adorned with colorful garlands. Pooja is offered to them and Pongal is given in plenty. This is called Mattu Pongal.Meaning & Significance\nThai Pongal is an occasion for family re-unions and get-together. Old enmities, personal animosities and rivalries are forgotten.

{"question":"When implementing online paywalls, what has been the balance between advertising revenue losses versus subscription gains across different news platforms?","answer":"Research on the New York Times' 2011 paywall implementation showed a complex balance of losses and gains. While the Times lost online visitors and advertising revenue (specifically 13 cents in online advertising for every $1 in subscription revenue), they experienced an unexpected benefit in print subscriptions, gaining between 0.2 to 0.5 share points in weekday and weekend print subscriptions. This offset translated to a 54-cent gain via the spillover effect of stopping print subscription decline. However, the situation varies across platforms, as many websites still receive more unsubscribed visitors than subscribers, leading some outlets to experiment with freemium models to bridge this gap while maintaining revenue streams.","context":["All the News That’s Fit to Paywall\nResearch by Professors Puneet Manchanda and S. Sriram explores the spillover effects of online news paywalls.\nNewspapers have tried various ways to monetize online content, with many turning to paywalls as a new source of income.\nPaywalls require readers to buy a subscription to read stories online, sometimes after a set number of free articles. New research by Michigan Ross Professors Puneet Manchanda and S. Sriram, along with PhD alumnus Adithya Pattabhiramaih, takes a deep dive into all of the side effects of online paywalls, including its effect on print subscriptions. Pattabhiramaih is professor at Georgia Tech’s Scheller College of Business.\nStudying the New York Times after it instituted its paywall in 2011, they found that while the paper lost online visitors and ad revenue, it also saw a halt in the print subscription decline. In fact, the New York Times saved enough print subscription revenue to more than offset the lost online ad revenue.\n“People tend to focus on one issue with paywalls — the web traffic and online subscription revenue,” says Manchanda, the Isadore and Leon Winkelman Professor of Marketing. “But a paywall starts in motion many parts of a machine, and unless you look at them in totality you can’t determine whether it’s working or not.”\nTheir study is one of the first to empirically examine total economic returns from charging readers for online content, and can help give news organizations a clearer picture of their efforts to monetize online content.\nThe authors collected web analytics data from comScore from January 2010 through December 2013, which includes time before, during, and after the March 2011 launch of the New York Times paywall. For print data, they examined annual reports from the Alliance of Audited Media.\nThey also compared the New York Times data to newspapers with similar popularity — USA Today and the Washington Post.\nThey found the number of unique visitors to the New York Times website decreased by 13.1 percent as a result of the paywall. While overall engagement metrics were unchanged, there was a difference among heavy and light users. Heavy users prior to the paywall significantly reduced their visits and time spent on the website, while it had no effect on light users.\nThe surprising finding was the effect on print subscriptions — the paywall halted the decline in print subscriptions. They estimate the New York Times gained between 0.2 to 0.5 share points in weekday and weekend print subscriptions with the paywall, compared with a scenario without it.\nSo, for every $1 generated in online subscription revenue, the Times lost 13 cents in online advertising revenue, but gained 54 cents via the spillover effect of arresting the print subscription decline.\n“The New York Times turned out to be better off financially, although the heavy readers of the online version became less engaged in terms of time spent on the site and how many pages they read,” says Sriram, associate professor of marketing. “If the objective is purely revenue, this strategy clearly worked. But we have to be mindful of long-term consequences.”\nThe paper is titled “Paywalls: Monetizing Online Content.”\nMedia Contact: firstname.lastname@example.org","Paywalls are barriers that restrict a user’s access to premium content at a given website and usually charge a fee or offer a subscription model, to those willing to gain full access. Since their introduction, paywalls have become a popular source of revenue for online businesses, especially news agencies that have started banking on online readership in the wake of the significant reduction in print readership. The subscription-based model of revenue has found success with numerous newspapers around the world like the Boston Globe, The Athletic, The Guardian, The Spectator, etc. but there are also those news outlets that think paywalls will make business difficult.\nAs mentioned already, paywalls are a source of necessary revenue and the access to the content of such websites depends upon either direct purchase or subscription to the service. Websites that follow paywall models vary in ways they offer services; there are many news agencies or academic websites that offer limited access to their content in the form of free access to a certain amount of articles per month, a soft paywall design. A hard paywall design – another type of paywall – is more strict in providing access to its content, such websites work on subscription first policy and content later.\nEven though many websites have found success in the subscription model, it is generally considered that experimenting with revenue models is the only sure way to keep generating revenue for online businesses. What works now will indeed become redundant tomorrow or what might not work today becomes a potential jackpot tomorrow.\nAs is with every case, paywalls might allow you to form a dedicated base of users, but these websites still receive many unsubscribed visitors that are greater in numbers than the already existing subscribers. Given that, it is obvious there is a large number of users that are not interested or don’t have the means to afford the paywall models. This situation has created an opportunity to come up with a solution to bank on its potential. The freemium model or the case of giving free access to a certain number of articles per month is a step towards bridging the above-mentioned gap.\nNow, there is another situation looming over the head of such websites. The demand for paywall labels for a better user experience in accessing information has taken up a contentious position on the internet. As was highlighted by this recently conducted poll, a staggeringly high percentage (just over 67%) had preferred the idea of a label and found the service to be of great use. The argument for greater transparency is valid, but it can create challenges for such websites that are already adapting themselves to a newfound way of generating revenue through paywalls. The demand of users facing friction in accessing information and the consequent frustration has allowed them to voice their uneasiness.\nThe paywall labels will filter and label both the free and paid content in the search results page that will enable the user to skip over the content and direct their attention towards smaller sites that provide similar information with free access. This simply does not bode well for sites that run on hard paywall designs and subscription-based revenue structures.\nUnless they find a way to get around it, in theory, these online businesses should get most affected by paywall labels if they stick to hard revenue models such as The Boston Globe, Wired, Handelsblatt, The Financial Times, and The Athletic to name a few.\nAs an option where all parties are satisfied, the current best thinking would see an adaptation to hard paywall structures and opening up towards a more inclusive premium model that allows both those that signed up and casual visitors enough quality content to continually generate traffic and create new subscriptions going forward."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3f41e967-e043-4ff9-a695-f15809e9a3d0>","<urn:uuid:d705e715-14a7-402b-a696-82d3572ca4f3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"My apartment has varying light conditions. Looking to understand how differently Anthurium Clarinervium and Rattlesnake plants respond to sunlight - what are optimal light conditions for each?","answer":"Both plants prefer indirect light but have slightly different requirements. The Rattlesnake plant needs bright indirect light or partial shade, and while morning sunlight is beneficial, afternoon sunlight should be avoided. If placed in a dark location, the plant will not thrive. For Anthurium Clarinervium, intense direct sunlight must be avoided as it can damage both mature leaves and new growth. Both plants can benefit from LED grow lights if natural light is insufficient. The Rattlesnake plant may lose its distinctive green spots if exposed to direct sunlight, while the Anthurium Clarinervium needs proper light levels for successful growth, especially during propagation.","context":["The once rare Anthurium Clarinervium is now a staple in most houseplant shops around the world. Their incredible large flat leaves with strong white veins mean they really stand out amongst other plants! Propagating these plants is relatively easy to do but there is only really one method that is successful. In this post, we will cover a step by step guide, as well as what tools you will need and how to solve any common problems you may encounter!\nWhy propagate an Anthurium Clarinervium?\nFirstly, it’s the best way to get new plants for free! These can make great gifts for friends and family or simply just help expand your urban jungle!\nYou may also want to take a cutting if you notice that part of it is starting to look a little unhealthy or starting to die. If you are unable to revive your plant, then removing the healthy parts of it is a great way to save your plant.\nMake sure that you only use the healthy parts of your Anthurium Clarinervium though, as trying to propagate leaves that are rotting or have pests will just transfer these problems onto your new plant.\nWhat tools will I need to propagate my Anthurium Clarinervium?\nLet’s start off with the easy part – knowing what equipment you’ll need to propagate an Anthurium Clarinervium. It’s important to make sure you have all the right things before you start the process.\nHealthy and mature Anthurium Clarinervium plant\nFresh soil and water\nNewspaper or plastic sheet if you’re propagating indoors\nWhat are the different methods I can use to propagate my Anthurium Clarinervium?\nThe only downside to these plants is that there is only really one successful method; division of the mother plant. This is because they grow from a central part rather than growing nodes along a main stem like you’ll find on Monstera or Pothos plants.\nThis does mean that you will have to have a fairly mature Anthurium Clarinervium plant to be able to divide it nicely into two or more plants.\nHow to propagate an Anthurium Clarinervium through division\nTake your Anthurium Clarinervium out of its pot\nTo propagate your plant through division, you’ll need to find what natural offshoots there are on your mother plant. The first step is to carefully take your plant out of its pot. Hold on to the strongest stems whilst you slowly pull out the plant. You may find that the roots are getting stuck on the drainage holes so gently detangle them rather than tugging at them as they will snap.\nLoosen the soil\nOnce your plant is safely out of its pot, you’ll need to loosen the potting mix around the root system to make the division easier. A good way to do this is to run your fingers through the roots to start to separate them.\nLocate the various offshoots\nWhen looking for a part of the plant to divide it will become very obvious if there are various offshoots on your Anthurium Clarinervium. They will be completely separate and growth will stem from the middle of each section. These are called rhizomes.\nSeparate the sections of your plant\nYou may have to trim off the odd root if the sections aren’t detangling easily but you should be able to carefully pull them apart. If there is only one central section on your plant then you will need to slice this in half making sure that each part has a good amount of the overall root system as this will help it be a success.\nPlace the section(s) in water or fresh potting mix\nPot the main mother plant back into its original pot (or downsize if you have taken a substantial amount off the plant). You will then need to decide whether you want to pot the sections in water or potting mix.\nIf the section has quite mature roots then it will be totally fine growing straight in potting mix already. You’ll need to use fresh high-quality potting mix to ensure your new plants get all the nutrients they need. Never reuse old soil as this can transfer bacteria and pests to your new plant. If you feel the roots on your new Anthurium Clarinervium need to grow a little more then we recommend placing the cutting into water as a middle step.\nYou can use a light monitor to figure out if your cuttings are getting the right amount of sunlight. You can also supplement sunlight levels by using an LED grow light which are great at encouraging growth in cuttings. We love this one which is available on Amazon here.\nRefresh the water regularly\nIf you chose to pop your cutting into water first you need to make sure you are changing it out regularly (every 2-3 days). This will prevent the water from stagnating and breeding bacteria which can harm your plant’s health, especially if it isn’t very mature yet.\nContinue normal Anthurium Clarinervium care\nOnce your new plant is in fresh potting mix you can resume your usual care routine. Make sure the new plants don’t get any intense direct sunlight as this can damage both the mature leaves as well as any new growth.\nTop tip: If your new sections grew in water then you will need to keep the potting mix slightly more moist for a few weeks. This is just to ease your new Anthurium Clarinervium plant into growing in potting mix and avoiding too much shock.\nAnthurium Clarinervium Plant Propagation FAQs\nPropagating these plants is definitely easier than some other plants as the main method is simply division of the main plant but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t come with its own set of problems, questions and difficulties.\nIt’s really important that you understand the basics, such as time of year, equipment and fertiliser needs.\nWe always recommend starting in spring. Make sure that any wintery frosty, cold weather is gone so that your new plants are growing in the warmer brighter months. This will encourage healthier and stronger roots as well as actually speed up the whole process.\nPropagating your Anthurium Clarinervium in either autumn or winter will result in really slow growth (if any) and you risk an increased chance of root rot or leaf rot. This is because the plants will need a lot less water and if the leaves get wet the water won’t evaporate as quickly as it would in summer.\nRooting hormone helps your cuttings grow strong and healthy roots. However, this is optional and you can have plenty of healthy growth without it.\nWhen propagating Anthurium Clarinervium plants, rooting hormone isn’t as necessary as the various sections will probably have their own established root system. Rooting hormone is more commonly used on cuttings to help those initial roots come through.\nGrow lights are great to use when propagating all houseplants. They help to provide the ideal light condition which stimulates faster and stronger growth.\nLED lights are also beneficial for mature houseplants if your home doesn’t get much sunlight. They can help avoid problems such as slow and leggy growth so are a great investment for all plant parents.\nIt’s important to clean all of your tools before and after contact with any plant to stop cross-contamination between your houseplants. Scissors and shears can transfer pests and diseases across plants without you realising.\nAnother crucial reason to clean your tools after touching the plant is that quite a few houseplants are toxic, including the Anthurium Clarinervium. Cleaning the tools makes sure there is no trace of the plant which could be harmful to you and anyone else who uses them.\nUnfortunately, you can’t propagate an Anthurium Clarinervium from just a single leaf. This is because of the anatomy of the plant as roots grow from the central rhizomes. This means that division is the only good method to use.\nWhen using the division method you can start fertilising a lot sooner than with cuttings. This is because fertiliser can actually stop the growth of roots as you are giving them the nutrients directly.\nBut if your divisions have mature roots you can fertilise a month or so after. You want to give the new plant(s) a chance to recover from the initial shock.\nThe amount of new plants you can make from your mother plant depends on how big your plant is!\nWhen dividing, you need to make sure that each section has a good amount of the overall root system. This will help speed up the growth of healthy new leaves.\nProblems that may occur when propagating an Anthurium Clarinervium\nPropagating houseplants will never have a 100% success rate and you may encounter some problems along the way. But don’t worry, we have learnt these things the hard way so that we can bring you all the different problems that might arise, what this means and how to solve the problems!\nAfter dividing up your Anthurium Clarinervium into several new plants, it’s totally normal for them to show signs of shock. This includes a lack of (or slow) growth. Think of it as though this plant has just moved house – pretty stressful right. So don’t be too worried if growth doesn’t happen straight away; as long as the environment and care are right for your plant, then new roots and leaves should start to grow soon.\nCooler temperatures can also be a reason why your new plant isn’t growing new roots or leaves. Here we would recommend using an LED light or heat pad can help your plant thrive.\nAfter dividing your Anthurium Clarinervium it’s totally normal for the growth to start out slow, smaller and less developed.\nThis is because the root system is less mature than that of the larger plant. After time, the new leaves on your plant will get bigger and you can prune away the smaller leaves to encourage new healthy growth.\nSo there you have it; a complete guide to Anthurium Clarinervium propagation! Don’t expect it to be 100% successful all of the time, that’s just the reality with the houseplant world – you can never be sure what will happen and when. Sometimes new leaves will grow straight away, other times you might have to wait a few months for the new plant to show any signs of growth. But with the right methods, care and environment you shouldn’t have too many issues…\nCheck out our Anthurium Clarinervium care guide for more information on how to care for your new plants after you’ve propagated them. There you can find all the basic care needs, as well as ways to spot and solve common problems with your plant.","If you are a pattern lover and you like to grow the natural caring, beautiful jolly plant, then the Rattlesnake Plant is the perfect indoor houseplant for you.\nWhat is the Rattlesnake plant?\nThe scientific name of the Rattlesnake plant is Calathea lancifolia, which belongs to the prayer plant family Marantaceae. It is native to the rainforest of Brazil and is hardy in USDA plant zones ten or above. This plant is known for its exciting patterns and attractive foliage.\nThe plant grows up to a height of 30 inches. This houseplant is a decorative plant having spotted leaves and deep purple undersides. It has long, wavy green, lance-shaped leaves with a pattern of deep green brushstrokes on the top of the blade. The bottom of the leaves is purple, and they also fold up at night like prayer-plants. In suitable conditions, the plant produces bright blooms during late spring and early summer. This plant is non-toxic to pets.\nScientific classification of a Rattlesnake plant\nThings to know before growing\nWhen to grow a Rattlesnake plant?\nThe Rattlesnake plant grows from May to August. The best time to propagate this plant is during spring.\nWhere to grow a Rattlesnake plant?\nThe Rattlesnake plant is adequately grown in light, medium, and well-drained soils. A bright indirect light or a little part of shade is preferable. Do not propagate the plant in a dark location. Morning sunlight is suitable for the growth of the plant, but it is best to avoid afternoon sunlight. Use a container having a drainage hole to grow the plant, and to prevent soggy soil. Most of the people grow this plant indoors up to a height of 1 foot and a half. When this plant is grown outdoor then, it raises a foot longer than growing indoors.\nHow to grow a Rattlesnake plant?\nYou can grow this plant, both indoor and outdoor. These plants grow quickly, and you can propagate the plant in the container. While reproducing the rattlesnake plant, do not put it in the direct sunlight, because the plant may lose its beautiful green spots. You can grow Calathea lancifolia through division and cutting.\nHow to grow a Rattlesnake plant from the division method?\nThe division is the easiest method to propagate a Rattlesnake plant. Divide the parent plant during the repotting time. Choose the healthy plant for division method and also separate stems into segments.\nSteps to grow a Rattlesnake plant from division method are:\n- Fill 2/3 of the container with a well-drained potting mix.\n- Water the soil to settle it down.\n- Place the divisions spacing few inches apart and 1.5 inches deep in the soil. You can put only one division in an individual pot.\n- Sprinkle some soil above it and water it.\n- Cover it with the plastic bag.\n- Place the container in the location with bright indoor light.\n- After 2-3 weeks, you will see new growth in it.\nHow to grow a Rattlesnake plant from cuttings?\nAnother best way to propagate your rattlesnake plant is through cutting.\nSteps to grow a Rattlesnake plant from cuttings are:\n- Take a sharp and sterile knife to proceed with the cuttings.\n- Cut off the head cuttings with at least two leaves and cut off the shoots at the base.\n- Take a new pot and fill it with the potting mix.\n- Place the cuttings in the soil and water it.\n- Cover it with a plastic bag, but don’t forget to give some air every day for about 10-20 minutes.\n- Place it in the bright spot.\n- After several weeks, the new plant should be rooted, and you can replant it.\nCare of the Rattlesnake plant\nThe Rattlesnake plant is not that difficult to care for. You should care for the rattlesnake plant properly. Some of the tips for caring this plant are as follows:\nSun and temperature\nThe rattlesnake plant thrives well in warm room temperature. The temperature should be between 60 degrees Fahrenheit to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. If the plant is kept in cold condition with the heat of 50 degrees Fahrenheit or below then, the leaves start to turn brown or droop. Avoid sudden temperature changes too. A bright indirect light or a little part of shade is preferable. Do not propagate the plant in a dark location. Morning sunlight is suitable for the growth of the plant, but it is best to avoid afternoon sunlight.\nWater and humidity\nWater the Rattlesnake plant lightly just to keep the soil moist. Do not allow the leaves to wilt, and never water the plant to the point of sogginess. This plant loves humid areas, so you can put some pebbles in the pot to hold moisture. You can also use a humidifier for this purpose. Water the plant every 1-2 weeks, allowing the soil to dry out halfway down in between the waterings. The rattlesnake plant does better in higher humidity conditions.\nThe Rattlesnake plant grows well in the potting mix that drains well. If the soil is too heavy, then it may rot the fibrous root. Soggy soil leads to root rot. For better results, use a lightweight potting mix and a slow-release fertilizer. 2 part peat and 1 part perlite is suitable for the soil. Rattlesnake plant likes moist soil, but they do not grow well in overly wet soil. The soil should be loamy and sandy type having a pH value of 6.1 to 6.5. Add some amount of sand to enhance the drainage.\nYou can feed the rattlesnake plant during the growing season. You can use a diluted solution of water-soluble fertilizer. Make sure the soil is moist during fertilizing. Use balanced liquid fertilizer for the foliage to look healthy. Feed the plant once a month from April to August.\nIt does not take long for the maintenance of Calathea lancifolia. Pruning this plant is very easy. Remove spent blooms of the growing rattlesnake plant. Prune damaged leaves to keep the plant healthy. Do not use leaf shine products on the rattlesnake plant as it can harm the plant rather than care. The large leaves of the plant tend to be dust catchers. Wipe them off using a soft, moist towel.\nYou can propagate the rattlesnake plant both indoor and outdoor. The rattlesnake plants are quickly grown indoors, and you can reproduce the plant in container or pot. While planting the rattlesnake plant, do not put it in the direct sunlight, because the plant may lose its beautiful green spots. You can grow a rattlesnake plant through division and cutting. Both methods are easy to propagate this plant.\nTreatment of various diseases of the Rattlesnake plant.\nPest and treatment\nThe main pests the Rattlesnake plant experiences are:\n- Fungus gnats\n- Red Spider mites\nIf the Rattlesnake plant shows any sign of these insect pest infestations, do not hesitate to use insecticides. Apply Neem oil or Silicon Dioxide for seven days. You can also use homemade sprays, and test it in leaves before applying it to the whole plant. Soap spray is an excellent homemade spray to remove these pests. Mix two tablespoons of soap to a gallon of water and spray it to the plant properly.\nSpray oil or sprinkle some powder on your plant so that there is a light layer on the leaves and the soil. The bugs and insects will walk through it and die soon after it comes in contact with them. Using yellow sticky traps helps to cut down the population of Fungus gnat, or you can also try using dryer sheets to remove them. You can also use a cotton ball soaked in alcohol to wipe away these insect rogues.\nDiseases and treatment\nThe Rattlesnake plant suffers from a lot of issues. The problems mostly occur when they are grown in poorly-drained soil or low light. Excessive watering, fertilization, and poor circulation leading to issues such as:\nSymptoms: Wilting and abscission of the leaf.\nTreatment: Avoid over-fertilization and water the plant slowly.\nSymptoms: Wilting and discolored leaves, brown roots.\nTreatment: Remove brown roots with sterilized scissors, and replant affected plants in fresh soil and good drainage.\nSymptoms: Discoloration, spotting, and wilting of Rattlesnake flowers\nTreatment: Prune plants to improve air circulation and add the right amount of organic compost.\nSymptoms: The leaves of the plants are drooping, and it curls inwards and downwards.\nTreatment: water the plant, and keep the soil moist.\nBest use of a Rattlesnake plant\nSome of the uses of this plant are listed below:\n- It helps you to breathe as they release oxygen in both day and night.\n- The Rattlesnake plant removes toxins and purifies the air.\n- In the therapeutic area, the rattlesnake plant helps to prevent diseases such as sore throat, dry cough, headaches, fevers, cold, and many others.\n- Rattlesnake plant is also used as an ornamental plant, and it looks great when placed indoor.\n- It merely adds beautiful and natural color to the house and your working space.\nAmelia is a plant and nature lover!

{"question":"What strategies do seasonal businesses use to maintain customer engagement during high vs. low demand periods?","answer":"During high demand periods, seasonal businesses focus on maximizing their limited selling window through targeted marketing programs that identify their typical customer base and optimal timing for reaching customers. They also work on building customer email lists and encouraging customer connections. During low demand periods, they minimize marketing expenses but maintain customer engagement through low-cost methods like automated email marketing campaigns and scheduled social media activity. Some businesses diversify their offerings to offset seasonal decline - for example, ski resorts offering hiking and rafting packages in summer, or costume stores selling outdoor furniture in spring. They may also use promotional discounts during off-season periods to maintain business operations and customer loyalty throughout the year.","context":["Preparing Your Seasonal Business for Decreased Demand\nAny small business owner who operates a seasonal business knows about decreased demand. Seasonal demand forecasting is part of the job; anticipating and preparing for fluctuations in sales volumes and their subsequent effects on overhead expenses and cash flow.\nOther challenges of seasonal businesses include cultivating and maintaining customer loyalty throughout the year — and doing much the same with your hard-to-find (but all-important) seasonal workforce. Inventory management can be difficult as well.\nHow can seasonal businesses survive? Here's a look at some critical success factors.\nWhat is a seasonal business?\nMuch as the name implies, a seasonal business operates during a specific time of year (or primarily so), generally selling products or services in use during that season. Examples of such businesses include:\n- Snow removal services\n- Gardeners and lawn care businesses\n- Halloween retailers\n- Tour operators\n- Christmas suppliers\n- Outdoor excursion/adventure guides\nAlthough some seasonal companies remain open for business throughout the year (but focus their biggest efforts during \"high season\"), others remain open for business during just peak selling times.\nBenefits of running a seasonal business\nFor an entrepreneur with the right temperament, there are plenty of advantages to be found in running a seasonal business. These can include:\n- Greater flexibility with scheduling\n- Improved work/life balance\n- Extensive time in the off-season for breaks or other pursuits\n- Creative stimulation\n- Capability for advanced preparation\nHaving an off-season can free you from dealing with day-to-day business operations and allows you to focus instead on:\n- Strategic planning, including seasonal demand forecasting\n- Crafting the right marketing campaign\n- Catching up with paperwork\n- Exploring new avenues for staffing\n- Networking with peers, vendors, industry, and trade associations\nHaving an off-season also offers the chance to pursue professional development and become better at what you do. Conduct some competitive research, for example, so you're prepared for what competitors might do during the peak season.\nCommon challenges of operating seasonal businesses\nOf course, seasonal business owners face challenges as well, examples of which may include:\n- Managing cash flow. Seasonal businesses differ, but virtually all must contend with keeping a positive cash flow in place. Seasonal demand forecasting is key to the process, a means by which you track cash coming in and going out, so it's possible to predict what's available month by month for the following year.\n- Inventory management during low and high demand periods. Seasonal fluctuations can have a big impact on inventory. High demand periods generally see a flurry of sales, when it may be hard to keep products in stock. Then, as the season fades, customer demand can slowly dwindle off or vanish completely.\n- Hiring and training seasonal staff. Depending on the type of seasonal business, your hiring needs can vary (sometimes widely). The challenge for these businesses can be recruiting and hiring the right seasonal staff — individuals capable of assuming responsibility and, where appropriate, interacting in a favorable way with customers.\n- Maintaining customer loyalty. No business can rely with complete certainty on customers they have served in past years. During the off-season, think of ways to entice the former customers back while working hard to engineer strategies that attract new business.\nHow to prepare your seasonal business for decreased demand\nSo, how do seasonal businesses survive? Advanced planning is critical. It's important to prepare your business for decreased seasonal demand. Here are steps to take:\nAnalyze monthly sales cycles\nAs part of your seasonal demand forecasting, review data from past seasons to estimate how long your off-season will last and how factors beyond your control (e.g., bad weather, local events, and changing trends and regulations) can affect the business. In addition to evaluating how long you may need to sustain decreased sales volume, understanding your business's unique sales cycles can help you optimize the number of employees on payroll, relative to demand, and structure marketing promotions based on the inventory on hand as peak season nears its end.\nEstimate how much cash is needed to sustain low demand\nSome seasonal business expenses may decrease as you downsize inventory and operations in the off-season. Other overhead expenses, like rent for office or warehouse space, basic utility costs, and business insurance remain throughout the year. Project the total costs of these expenses during your down cycles and prepare to have cash on hand to cover them, in light of decreased sales volume.\nSecure access to funds\nIf you don't have an account to cover off-season expenses, form a plan to ensure that you have access to cash reserves:\n- Outsource assets. Does your business have dedicated parking, office space, or equipment that goes unused during the off-season? Consider renting them to another local business to generate additional income to pay for baseline operating expenses.\n- Research funding options. Many alternative-business funding providers specialize in helping small businesses leverage their assets (which may include equipment, accounts receivables, or daily sales) to obtain access to cash when they need it. Research various options for which you may qualify, based on your business's financial history and specific needs, to ensure you're financially prepared before your sales decrease.\nPrepare for seasonal inventory changes due to decreased demand\nOne of the biggest challenges faced by seasonal business owners is managing fluctuations in inventory. To be adequately prepared for such fluctuations, it's important to:\n- Analyze historical supply cycles. Look back at the history of your business's sales and purchase information. What was the typical monthly sales volume? Did particular holidays or special events generate a dramatic uptick in sales or a significant decrease in product demand? A good inventory management system should provide answers to these and related historical supply cycle questions, leading to improved inventory control.\n- Categorize products by their life cycle. Effective inventory management includes noting the difference between products that are exclusively seasonal (like Halloween costumes or Thanksgiving decorations) from those that see increased demand. Knowing which products have a more abbreviated shelf life can minimize the risk of being stuck with residual supplies that are expensive to store.\n- Diversify to offset seasonal decline. Look for ways to diversify your products or services and minimize the impact of a decline in seasonal sales. For example, if your business focuses on Easter eggs and other related items, there might be a way to translate this into specialized gift items for other times of the year (such as birthdays or anniversaries).\n- Remove slow-moving products. No seasonal business wants to get stuck with products that aren't selling. Fortunately, there are strategies to generate new interest among consumers. These include:\n- An everything-must-go sale.\n- A specific product sale (with advertising aimed at a niche target audience).\n- Moving slow-selling products to a different part of the store or come up with new keywords in your online product title and description.\n- Bundling several products together and set a sales price somewhat lower than what these products would go for individually.\nManage the impact of seasonality on employees\nYou have invested significant time, energy, and resources into hiring and training seasonal staff. Maximize the return on your investment by proactively building lasting relationships with the employees you hope to hire back every peak season. Here's how:\n- Provide advance notice of staffing changes. Notify seasonal employees of your expectations for staffing changes as soon as you have a sense that you need to reduce the size of your team. Employees will appreciate having time to adequately prepare for the changes this brings to their lives.\n- Cross-train seasonal employees. Train seasonal employees on other tasks, such as working the sales floor, supporting inventory, or contributing to marketing or service operations. This way, you increase the return on your human resources investment and give seasonal employees the opportunity to remain on your payroll well after the season winds down.\n- Allow flexibility. While seasonal workers may file for unemployment once the season ends, it's still important to be flexible with scheduling to suit their needs. They may need the time to interview and secure another job before your peak season ends.\nMinimize marketing expenses during the off-season\nCustomer loyalty and brand awareness require constant engagement. The more you proactively work to build your customer email list and encourage customers to connect with you during your peak season, the better equipped you can be to execute low-cost marketing efforts like automated email marketing campaigns and scheduled social media activity. With some groundwork, you can help your brand stay top of mind throughout the year.\nFacing the challenges of seasonal businesses requires patience, attention to detail, and advanced planning. Part of planning for decreased seasonal demand involves finding the right people to staff your business at the right time.

They’re all seasonal businesses that experience a surge in revenues during their busy seasons that tapers off in the slow season. Seasonal peaks and troughs present challenges that require creative planning and fiscal prudence.\nUnderstand the Cash Flow Cycle\nEvery business has some degree of ups and downs during the year. But cash flow fluctuations are much more intense for seasonal businesses. So, it’s important to understand a seasonal business’s operating cycle to anticipate and minimize shortfalls.\nTo illustrate, consider a manufacturer and distributor of lawn-and-garden products like topsoil, potting soil and ground cover. Its customers are lawn-and-garden retailers, hardware stores and mass merchants.\nThe company’s operating cycle starts when customers place orders in the fall — nine months ahead of its peak selling season. The company begins amassing product in the fall but curtails operations in the winter. In late February, when the thaw begins for most of the country, product accumulation continues, with most shipments going out in April.\nAt this point, a lot of cash has flowed out of the company to pay operating expenses, such as utilities, salaries, raw materials costs and shipping expenses. But cash doesn’t start flowing into the company’s checking account until customers pay their bills around June. Then, the company counts inventory, pays all remaining expenses and starts preparing for the next year. Its strategic selling window — which will determine whether the business succeeds or fails — lasts a mere eight weeks.\nMaximize the Selling Window\nSeasonal businesses put substantial pressure on their marketing and sales teams. They have a limited amount of time to attract customers and little opportunity to take corrective actions. Successful seasonal businesses use targeted, tailored marketing programs that address these questions:\n- Who’s the company’s typical customer?\n- What’s the best way to reach that customer base?\n- When are customers making their buying decisions?\nIn the example of the lawn-and-garden distributor, customers place orders in the fall. So, an end-of-summer “early bird” discount program, communicated via an email campaign in September and paper inserts with customer invoices in May, might entice customers to place orders early — and choose that company over its competitors.\nSeasonal businesses that market to consumers increasingly turn to social media to generate sales. Customers who follow a business on Facebook or LinkedIn provide a narrow target audience, and social media posts can be cheap and relatively simple to generate. For example, a summer camp sent personalized “Happy Birthday” messages to last year’s campers throughout the year. These posts were viewed by all of the campers’ Facebook friends, many of whom could be potential new campers next summer.\nRamp Up for Busy Season\nIdeally, a seasonal business should stockpile cash received at the end of its operating cycle, and then use those cash reserves to finance the next operating cycle. But cash reserves may not be enough, especially for a high-growth company.\nMany seasonal businesses apply for a line of credit to avert potential shortfalls. However, banks tend to be leery of such enterprises, particularly those with limited history. To increase the chances that a loan application will be approved, business owners should compile a comprehensive loan package, including historic financial statements and tax returns, as well as marketing materials and supplier affidavits (if available).\nMore important, the company’s owner should draft a formal business plan that includes financial projections for the next year. Some companies even project financial results for three to five years into the future. Seasonal business owners can’t rely on gut instinct. They need to develop budgets, systems, processes and procedures ahead of the peak season.\nWithout a line of credit, a business that has severe fluctuations might not have enough working capital to make it through the operating cycle. If there’s insufficient money to pay suppliers, they could stop delivering materials. If the employees aren’t paid, they’re unlikely to report for work. If the weather doesn’t cooperate, revenues might fall short of the business plan. The line of credit is a solid backup plan. If one lender turns down an application for a line of credit, a smart business owner will find out why, remedy any shortcomings and try again.\nPlan for the Off-Season\nSome companies, such as a local ice cream or golf pro shop, may decide to close during the off-season. Others, such as a hotel or accounting firm, are open year-round, offer promotional discounts or cut operating hours to weather the slow times.\nCreative seasonal businesses try to find ways to operate two (or more) seasonal businesses with opposite busy cycles using the same resources. Examples include a midwestern landscaping company that plows snow in the winter, a ski resort that offers hiking and rafting packages in the summer, and costume stores that sell outdoor furniture in the spring.\nAnother off-season survival strategy is hiring part-time seasonal workers. Salaries and employee benefits quickly drain savings. Using part-timers converts a fixed expense (full-time salaries) into a variable expense that ebbs and flows with the operating cycle. But recruiting reliable, skilled part-timers — who are available to work on demand — is often harder than it seems.\nSo it’s a good strategy for an employer to build a pool of part-time workers that it can draw on year after year, such as an ice cream shop or a day camp that hires teachers to work during the summer. Also, part-timers should be treated with the same respect as full-timers. A positive work environment will lower turnover, improve morale and increase the likelihood that people will come back to work for the business again. Employers may want to consider offering financial incentives to employees who refer friends and family members for part-time positions.\nRemember, most of the same labor laws regarding such issues as harassment, discrimination, child labor, minimum wages, and workplace health and safety apply to all workers, both seasonal and full-time. It’s still necessary to withhold taxes just as for regular employees and pay overtime for nonexempt employees.\nSeasonal workers also may affect a company’s headcount under the Affordable Care Act. And, if a seasonal worker exceeds an average of 30 hours per week, large businesses may be required to provide health insurance coverage for them and their children during the months they’re employed. Typically, full-time employment is measured month-to-month. But some large companies avoid providing health insurance benefits for part-timers by electing a measurement period longer than one month or adopting a 90-day waiting period for eligibility.\nMany seasonal businesses struggle during the operating cycle, and some owners can’t resist the urge to spend their windfall, rather than saving it for the next operating cycle. Financial advisors can help manage seasonal fluctuations and the unique challenges they present.\nConsider a Fiscal Year End\nMost businesses operate on a calendar year basis that begins on January 1 and ends on December 31. It’s straightforward, matches the owner’s personal record keeping, and may be required by the IRS under certain circumstances.\nBut seasonal businesses may have good reasons to elect to use a fiscal year. (A fiscal year is 12 consecutive months ending on the last day of any month except December.) For example, reporting income by calendar year could split up the peak season between two years and give a distorted view of income and expenses. This also happens when a seasonal business reports most of its expenses in one calendar year and income in another.\nA company that wants to adopt a fiscal year for a seasonal business will need to consistently maintain its books and records and report income and expenses using the time period adopted. But first and foremost, it’s important to consult a tax advisor to determine if the business is allowed to switch its year end under the tax rules and whether doing so is worth the extra effort.\n© Copyright 2016.

{"question":"How do the logo evolution strategies of Coca-Cola and Thomas Nast's Santa Claus designs compare in terms of maintaining consistency over time?","answer":"Both show interesting approaches to evolving iconic designs. Thomas Nast transformed Santa Claus from an elfish figure in brown to a larger, rounder, jolly man in a red coat, establishing a lasting image that became the standard. In contrast, Coca-Cola's logo has maintained remarkable consistency since its script design was created in 1887, with only minor modifications leading to today's simpler version. While Nast made a dramatic change that set a new standard, Coca-Cola opted for subtle refinements while preserving its core design identity.","context":["This week we’ll be looking at some artists with connections to Christmas.\nMONDAY - Currier and Ives\nCurrier and Ives was a successful American printmaking firm in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s.

Illustrator Haddon Sundblom took the job. Sundblom read descriptions of Santa from the poem \"A Visit from St. Nicholas\". He changed Thomas Nast's drawings of Santa to a warmer, jollier, and pleasantly plump Santa. Sundblom's Santa first appeared in The Saturday Evening Post.\nFrom 1931 to 1964, Sundblom created advertising illustrations for Coca-Cola featuring his Santa Claus paintings. These ads appeared in many magazines, such as National Geographic, Ladies Home Journal, and The New Yorker.

It shows the visit of the Magi, or Wise Men. The artist applied lots of gold in his painting to show the importance of those involved. Notice that the Magi came on horses, not camels, in this painting.\n1440/60 The Adoration of the Magi by Fra Angelico and Fra Filippo Lippi - National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\nThis Italian painting from about 1450 was painted by two monks who were popular painters. This painting also shows the visit of the Magi. The colorful costumes of the people probably resemble how people of that day in Florence looked when they held their traditional Epiphany festival.

Rembrandt also painted many other scenes from the Bible. This painting, like most of his others, draws the viewer's eyes to the most important people in the painting through the use of light and dark.\n1776 The Nativity by John Singleton Copley - Boston Museum of Fine Arts\nJohn Singleton Copley was an important American painter during colonial days. This 1776 nativity scene reflects the realistic painting tradition Copley used. The shepherds' clothing looks more historically accurate, but the man on the right appears in Colonial dress. The whiteness of Mary and the baby surrounded by darker color, draws attention to those figures.\n1857 Nativity stained glass window by Michael )'Connor in Chester Cathedral in England\nThe nativity is depicted through many other art mediums besides paintings.

It has been found that they have used logos on their coins. However, when one goes in search of the day the modern type of logos were designed for the first time, he will trace it back to the 13th century. It was the Goldsmiths, potters and those who made paper who have the honor of creating the first logo designs. From then onwards, logos improved with new designs and today they are better known than the companies and the products they represent.\nThere is hardly any logo that is being used with its original design. Most of the good logo designs have had very basic designs. If you go into details of how some of the best known logos today have been developed you will find that some of them have been added with improvements for a couple of generations. While the products improved in quality their logos also have improved with their appearance as well as their simplicity. Most of the logo designs of modern times are simple and eye catching.\nIn case you are going to design and manufacture a product it must be remembered that a good logo is a must for your products or the company that is going to produce it. People will not bother to read names printed on products but they will look at the logo and will come to know the brand of the product. It is also a good idea to find how some of the modern logo designs have been developed. The following are going to be some important details about them for you to read. These logos belong to well known brands of products and services offered by world renowned companies. With some of them the product and the company are identified with the same logo.\nWhen Apple inc. started its operations in 1976, its logo was designed by Ron Wayne, one of the founders of the company. But in 1977 the logo was changed to a simpler apple logo with rainbow colors. Later in 1997 it was converted to a monochrome logo. Today it has a still simpler white one.\nShell is a company that started its operations in early 1900s and its logo was a simple pectin in black and white. It was improved in 1904, 1909 and 1930 but its color was added only in 1948. The word “SHELL” also got incorporated. Even afterwards it was subjected to many changes before the present day version was established.\nPepsiCo is the company that manufactures and distributes this product. Its logo was designed at the same time the world famous drink was produced first in 1898 and it was a scribbled one. It was improved in 1905 and again modified in 1906. After undergoing changes in 1943, 1962, 1973 and 1991 the present logo design was created in 1998, then further modified recently few years back.\n4- Coca Cola\nThe first Coca Cola was served in 1886 but it didn’t have a script logo. However, in 1887 a script logo was designed. This was improved adding various new features up to date until we have started seeing the simple logo available today.\nIt was Carolyn Davidson who created the Nike logo in 1971. It changed 1978 and 1985 to bring in today’s logo design. Phil Knight didn’t like this logo but he kept it and it became a well known logo later.\nCanon logo was developed from a logo designed for the optical company established in 1933. It was first known as Kwanon, the name of a goddess but to make it acceptable to the entire world it was changed to Canon in 1935. The present logo evolved from that in 1956.\nIBM started as a company that produced tabulating machines. Its first logo was based on its name of Computing Recording Machine Corporation. Company changed its name in 1924 and the new logo carried the first letters of its name International Business Machines. Later it went through several changes and the present logo was adopted in 1972\nWal-Mart is one of the logo designs that have been subjected to least amount of changes. The logo was first used when the company was founded in 1962 and the present logo was designed in 2008.\nThough the company was established in 1865 it got the name of Nokia only in 1871. Logo developed in 1871 went through some drastic changes until the present logo was adopted in 1998. It has both the company’s name as well as their slogan.\nLogo of the playboy magazine has changed only once and that was also at the very beginning of the company in 1953. The present day logo of a rabbit was also developed in the same year.\nThe first Espresso café opened was named Il Gionarle and it had a logo of its own. Later Howard Shultz who owned it bought Starbucks and there was a logo for Starbucks as well. Shultz combined the two logos and created a new logo in 1987. It was modified in 1992 to bring up the present logo.\nDesigned at the company’s inception in 1998 Google’s logo has seen slight changes in1998 and 1999. The 1999 edition is the one you see today.\nThe first logo had the two words of “Federal Express” but later the company name was changed to FedEx and also the logo.\nAudi logo carried the four logos of car four brands in its first logo. That was in 1932. The present day logo is only four circles integrated together to form its logo.\nMicrosoft logo was created in 1975 and it has undergone a change in 1987. The present day logo has been developed in1994.\nLogo of the World Wildlife Fund has gone through only a little change after it was designed and used in 1961. Those changes have taken place in 1978 and in 1986.\nVolkswagen logo designs changed four times as that has been first developed in 1939 and it has been changed a bit before the Second World War. After the Second World War it has been changed again and the one you see today has been developed in the year 2000.\nAdobe logo designs did not bring many changes but it has only been changed once. The present day one is a bit simpler than the original one.\nFirefox logo designs passed through changes too. First was done in 2002 and it has changed in entirety in 2003.This is the logo in existence even today.\nBMW is also one of the logo designs that have changed only a bit for over 75 years. In 70s and 80s, it has had a more colorful logo but they have reverted to the simpler design in 2000 and that exists up to date.\n21- Mercedes Benz Logo Designs\nMercedes Benz logo has been designed in 1902. Then came the three prong star and those three prongs are still there. However, it is one of the logo designs that have undergone many changes during its stay but finally it has become one of the simplest and best known logos.\nWhen you look at these logo designs you understand that companies have given special care to keep their logos attractive and up to date. Often, they carry some details related to the company or the product. For instance, the three letters found in the logo of IBM means International Business Machines which is the company for which the logo stands.\nImportance of a good logo designs is that even if people forget the name of the company they will remember the logo as it has a visual impact. When they go to store to buy products customers will not bother to read the details of the manufacturers but when they see the logo they come to know what company produces the product. If they have placed some trust with the company for which the logo stands they will not think twice before purchasing the product.\nMost companies make logo designs but believe in simple logos. They are easy to identify from a distance. Therefore, customers are able to pick up the products of a company that has a logo well known to them. Even when it comes to colors most logos carry one or two colors to make them colorful without losing simplicity associated with their logo designs.\nEven the artists who develop logos prefer simple logo designs. This means they are also aware of the requirements of logos though they are not marketing people who know how customers react to product names and logos. All in all, it is interesting to know the history of logo designs and how they have improved over the years."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2c06bb0c-6316-4f7d-92b8-3dfaea9aab73>","<urn:uuid:923cebdb-14b9-47fb-a1ef-84fdc597c4d3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the delayed distribution of films to Dawson City in the early 1900s compare with the modern AI restoration process of historical footage in terms of time and accessibility?","answer":"In the early 1900s, films would take two to three years after their initial release to reach Dawson City, as it was at the end of the distribution line, making access to current content extremely delayed and limited. In contrast, modern AI restoration processes make historical footage more immediately accessible through a three-stage process of adding extra frames, colorization, and resolution upscaling. This modern approach uses various AI software tools like DAIN, DeOldify, and DeepRemaster to quickly process and enhance historical footage, allowing audiences to view high-definition versions of century-old content without the significant time delays that characterized early film distribution systems.","context":["How did the socialites of Shanghai dress a century ago? What did the Great Wall look like before a century’s worth of human and natural damage? What would one of the terracotta soldiers of Xi’an look like in real life?\nNew York-based artist Hu Wengu, better known by the online handle of DGSpitzer, has pondered long and hard on these questions. In his search for answers, he’s using AI and machine-learning software to restore archival footage of China, offering audiences a high-definition glimpse into the country’s past.\n旅居纽约的独立艺术家胡文谷（DGSpitzer）用 AI 技术，通过对百年前的视频资料进行人脸修复，让我们看到了属于中国的、跨越时代的高清过往。\nHu works full-time as a game developer, and his original impetus for learning AI was to learn how the technology can be incorporated into his game-design workflow. He quickly realized that it could be applied in nearly every area of game development, whether it be training in-game NPCs, generating vast maps, or even composing original music. “It actually has interesting applications in a wide range of fields, even social and human sciences,” Hu says. “So this year I made a series of videos introducing people to how AI can compose music, paint, generate faces, and more.”\nAs Hu’s understanding of AI deepened, he began exploring how the technology could carry over into other domains. This interest eventually led him to AI-enhanced video. Since then, he’s leveraged the power of AI to create a stunning collection of color-restored videos showcasing China’s past.\n作为游戏开发者的 DGSpitzer，最开始主动学习人工智能的动机很现实，是为了尝试一下这些技术“能否为自己的游戏开发节省时间和成本”。但随着对 AI 技术了解的逐渐深入，他发现，人工智能不仅能在训练游戏 NPC、制作游戏贴图、音乐作曲素材上有着各种便捷的使用方式，“在更广阔的领域，甚至社会人文科普上都有着很有意思的应用前景。” DGSpitzer 说，“于是最近这一年我也开始制作了一系列视频，来介绍 AI 作曲、绘画、面部生成的各种小工具的使用方法。”\n于是乎，尘封多年的黑白影像就得以有机会还原了本初的鲜艳面貌。而目前，在 DGSpitzer 的个人频道上，他正在制作人工智能相关的科普介绍视频，100 年黑白影片 AI 上色修复，也正是他的其中一个视频作品。\nThree of Hu’s AI-enhanced works include footage sourced from the University of South Carolina Moving Image Research Collections, which showcase a Beijing streetside barber, a Shanghai fashion show, and the construction of the Broadway Mansion Hotel. Hu discovered their footage archives by chance, and as he dug through the video library, he became more and more fascinated. “MIRC has recordings of China from the 1930s, which is extraordinary,” he says. “In the old Beijing barber video, there was a bald, charismatic guy who left a profound impression on me. So much so that, after I watched it, I got in touch with the university and asked if I could use their black-and-white videos in my AI project. They responded quickly and were happy to oblige. They even helped look into the exact dates of when the films were shot.”\n在 GDSpitzer 修复的老影像中，其中有三期是来自南卡罗莱纳大学影像研究馆藏（University of South Carolina Moving Image Research Collections，以下简称 MIRC），分别是老北京剃头、上海时装秀、百老汇大厦建造纪录。\n着手制作的契机来得很偶然，GDSpitzer 是不经意在网络上浏览到相关年代有声的影像，本着好奇的探索欲，他找到了他们的影像资料库网站，“MIRC 所藏的中国有声影像最早可以追溯到1930年代，非常的珍贵，尤其老北京剃头那期视频中光头精神小伙的逗乐劲儿，颇为打动我。”GDSpitzer 说道，“所以在官网找到他们的联系邮箱后，我果断就发去了电邮。邮件里介绍了我之前做过的项目，以及希望他们可以授权我来上色这几部黑白影像，并允许我发布在社交网络上。之后不久收到了回复，那边的工作人员欣然应允，还帮忙扫描了当时的影像卡片确认影片的拍摄日期等信息。”\nHu’s video restorations happen in three stages. The first involves adding in extra frames, then the footage is colorized, and finally, the resolution is upscaled. His arsenal of AI software, which includes DAIN, DeOldify, DeepRemaster, and PaddleGAN, all tackle these tasks independently. “For example, the AI that adds missing frames, it analyzes the first frame and last frame to logically work out what should fit between them to smooth out the framerate,” he explains. “As for the colorizing AI, it almost like a human toddler. It examines large amounts of black-and-white photos, eventually learning that when a plant-shaped object appears, it should be green; when the sky and clouds appear, they should be blue and white; and when a human face appears, it should be flesh colored. The resolution upscaling AI works in a similar way, and by combining the output of these AI software, the footage is restored.”\n人工智能上色主要分为三个阶段：补帧、上色、和分辨率提升。在这几个步骤里，每个 AI 都是单独分工的，DGSpitzer 动用了多个海外开源的 AI 项目来实现修复影片，比如 DAIN、DeOldify、DeepRemaster和 PaddleGAN 等。“例如补帧AI，就是 AI 通过联系前后帧画面形状和景深的逻辑关系，绘制出一个不存在的中间帧，实现提升画面流畅度的效果。” DGSpitzer 分享道，“而在上色 AI 当中，我个人觉得这个人工智能就像和人类从幼儿开始成长观察世界一样，通过慢慢用双眼收集数据，这个 AI 就是通过学习大量黑白彩色的对比图片，了解到有植物形状特征出现时，画面区域应该是绿色的；天空云朵出现时，应该是蓝天白云；有人脸特征出现时则是肉色……由此实现了黑白影片的上色。提升分辨率的人工智能也是同理。这几个人工智能各司其职，一起完成了影片的修复工作。”\nDespite the amount of work and time Hu has invested in the project, he confesses that he’s not exactly a history buff. Instead, he considers himself a sci-fi nerd. “When I watched black-and-white videos in the past, they felt like history lessons,” he shrugs. “I would fast forward it to get through it quicker. They just didn’t catch my interest.”\nHowever, to restore a piece of footage, sped-up viewing was no longer an option. Watching at regular speeds, he was able to discover a ton of details that he overlooked on the initial watch, such as a young man staring at the cameraman from behind a tree, a group of carefree kids playing in the street, or a curious worker studying the camera as he passes by.\nThese little moments of connection fascinate Hu. “It reminds me of the fact that even though we’re living centuries apart, we’re still under the same sky and walking the same earth,” he says. “It’s like watching a century-old vlog.”\n出乎意料的是，DGSpitzer 说自己并不是历史纪录片的死忠粉，日常的观影爱好更偏向于科幻系列。“以前看黑白影片的时候，更多仅仅是把它当作一种历史资料，尤其很多影片还是快放版本，一下就看完了，也没有留下特别深刻的印象。”DGSpitzer 说。但唯独在进行人工智能上色修复时，他必须把影片的时间流速减慢到正常速度，从前不曾注意到的细节一下就浮现出来了。比如，“悄悄躲在树干后面偷望摄像机的小哥”、“天真无邪的小孩”、“充满好奇心手头上依然忙活没有闲着的大人”……而这样的细枝末节，却恰恰是最能抓住人心的时刻，DGSpitzer 直言他的代入感大幅提升了，“让我感受到，这些人原来曾和我一同生活在同一片天空下，同一片土地上，有点像百年前的 Vlog。”\nHu has also begun looking into restoring historical footage from other countries. Recently, he’s working with a German artist to restore a documentary shot in Dresden in 1936, even taking it a step further with the implementation of AR technology that will allow viewers to overlay the AI-enhanced scenes atop locations in real-life to see how the area has changed over the years.\nAside from video-related endeavors, he’s also begun using AI to colorize and upscale old portrait photography from China. Through his use of neural networks, Hu hopes for viewers to experience the simplicity of the past and immerse themselves in the lives of these people long gone—if only for a few short minutes. “It can be a moment of respite when you allow people to look into the past,” he says. “Stepping into the shoes of these people on camera and looking at history through the lens of the present can perhaps help us gain a greater understanding of culture and what it means to be human.”\nHistory can often seem dull, appearing as unrelatable lines of text tucked inside of course books, but Hu believes it doesn’t have to be. Through his AI-enhanced videos, Hu hopes that people who may have previously dismissed how interesting history can be are able to find renewed excitement for the subject, and in turn, develop a healthy appetite for knowledge in all forms and shapes.\n现在，DGSpitzer 还在进一步寻找合适的影片来修复，比如最近会和德国的一位艺术家朋友一起合作，用 AI 上色复原一部德国德累斯顿 1936 年的老纪录片，使用 AR 技术把纪录片中的景点镜头和现实中的景点坐标对接。另一方面，最近他也在进行一些古代历史人物画像的写实修复。让 AI “脑补”出古代人像接近真实的相貌，比如秦朝兵马俑、明太祖朱元璋、宋徽宗赵佶等，下一步，他还会继续进行人物画像还原相关的内容，比如四大美女、竹林七贤等等。\n以强大的数据支持为依托，DGSpitzer 说，他想制作出这种“五分钟的彼岸”的意象传达，即让大家能有那么五分钟，通过这些 AI 处理过的复原影像，“可以从纷繁复杂的现代生活中脱离出来，感受一下前人的生活是怎样的，这些古人们的所思所想又是如何，已故鉴今，也许会有不一样的体会，可以说是一种人文关怀的感觉吧。”","When silent films speak of a lost past\nDawson City- Frozen Time 2\nThe discovery of a treasure trove of forgotten nitrate films from the early 1900s is the inspiration for a magical documentary.\nSometimes a film feels like an epiphany. Watching\nTechnically a documentary, Morrison's film is an exquisite assemblage of facts and footage so artfully and lovingly crafted that it feels like an epic. That epic quality comes from two historic elements – the Canadian gold rush, which originally brought Dawson City into being, and the invention of cinema, which created these thousands of feet worth of early film images, only to abandon them. What Morrison captures, without ever spelling it out explicitly, is the way the treasure trove -- known as the Dawson City Film Find -- offers up a conjoined history of these two lost worlds: A forgotten town and a forgotten technology.\nAnd yet both the town and the technology were, a century and a quarter ago, part of the crucible of modernity. Morrison begins with the fact that film originated in an explosive, nitrate cellulose. The Kodak company turned it into nitrate film by adding camphor to it and then coating it with plastic emulsion. But nitrate film, on which all early cinema was stored, remained highly inflammable, and the documentary shows, over and over again, that the history of early cinema is also a history of fire. From\nThe film is also a deep dive into Dawson: Now a small town with a tiny population of 1300-odd people (as of 2011), but once the site of a remarkable moment in world history. Gold was discovered near here on August 17, 1896, at the confluence of the Klondike and Yukon rivers, near the boundary with the US state of Alaska. Over the next three years, thousands of prospectors made the extremely difficult journey to this freezing-cold terrain, often crossing snow-covered passes on foot, hoping, literally, to strike gold. During the height of the Klondike Gold Rush in 1898, Dawson City’s population exceeded 30,000.\nNaturally, entrepreneurs of all sorts arrived, hoping to ‘mine the miners’, as Morrison puts it.\nBut as the more accessible mines began to be exhausted, and gold was discovered some distance away in Nome, Alaska, the city of Dawson emptied out, becoming a quarter of its size in a year. Films continued to come to Dawson, but they often took two or three years after their first release, to arrive. The town was at the end of a film distribution line, and the distributors didn't want to pay for their passage back. The films were already old news. So they ended up being stored in Dawson. As the years passed, and the town's buildings started running out of space, thousands of old silent film reels were burnt, or simply disposed of in the Yukon river. A small section remained -- and the rest is history: A history whose incredible details you should watch the film for.\nYet Morrison's film is no mere history book on screen. What he does is a marvel in terms of film form. He uses still images -- including photographs taken during the Gold Rush by a photographer called Eric Hegg, which have their own magical history of survival and recovery -- as well as newspaper articles, printed posters and archival letters. He uses newsreels from Pathe and Fox. And he combs all of this archival visual material for Dawson history, from an early instance of baseball match fixing to a real-life\n(Disclaimer: The views expressed here are the author's own)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7db44dff-a261-4bc0-9f28-d4fa06f89b38>","<urn:uuid:9fb0c4e4-fff9-4ec8-b678-e2419028762d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the Sateenkaari Winter Garden and fiber optics sensory equipment compare for nature-themed sensory experiences?","answer":"The Winter Garden and fiber optics offer different nature-themed sensory experiences. The Winter Garden provides a natural environment with green plants, bird songs, nature sounds, and tangible natural materials. In contrast, fiber optic equipment creates artificial nature-like experiences through light, offering soft glow effects in strands that can be draped across the body, providing both visual stimulation and deep touch pressure input for relaxation. The Winter Garden focuses on authentic natural elements, while fiber optics create a controlled sensory experience.","context":["According to Research Autism: “Multi-sensory Environments or MSE’s are designed to create a feeling of safety and to provide novel and intriguing sensations, which can promotes pleasure and/or feelings of well-being. They can also be utilized as part of the learning or treatment experience or for leisure and relaxation.”\nTypically, a MSE is a dedicated space or room that is designed to stimulate the senses through a controlled environment enhanced with individualized sensory equipment. Some of the goals and benefits of MSE’s include promoting relaxation and a feeling of well-being, focus and attention, understanding of cause/effect and social interaction skills and are often a perfect milieu for those on the autism spectrum. With their adjustable sensory components combining touch, vibration and movement with sight and sound, they offer something for all levels and sensory preferences.\nComponents in a sensory room can vary widely and usually involve selection based on the assessment of the special needs or general population that will be utilizing the space. A collaboration between educators, parents, equipment vendors and other related specialists are helpful when planning an MSE. Here are just a few of the options available that may work well for individuals with autism:\nThe clear plastic water column produces a steady stream of small bubbles which coordinate with changing light colors within the tube. With an interactive Bubble Tube, the user presses a switch or panel which allow the tube to change color and/or speed of vibration of the bubbles so can help promote cause/effect, turn taking and simple visual perception skills. In addition to the light, the hum and vibration of the tube are also often a source of attention and appeal.\nFor an update on a traditional bubble tube, consider the Calming Bubble Wall as a space saver and/or if there are behavior issues that would preclude using a standard tube.\nThese are light sources made of fiber optic strands in a variety of options including hanging curtains, wall or floor carpets, vertical sprays or draped strands over a sitting piece such as a bean bag cushion. In a semi-darkened room, Fiber Optics produce a soft glow that can promote visual focus and tracking. When used in strands (usually grouped in sets of 100 or more) and draped across the body in a seat or in a swing, the weight of the combined strands provides deep touch pressure input on the body which may help promote the relaxation/calming response.\nThese devices are a fun method to project colorful images onto walls, ceilings, floors or a soft space such as a draped parachute. Themed concepts such as shapes, planets, a deep sea environment or even customized pictures are displayed on a projector disc or wheel which gently rotates producing a clear slow moving image across the desired surface. In a semi- darkened room, these oversized rotating images are great for calming, attending and visual focus and tracking.\nThese lounging pieces such as a beanbag, recliner, wedge, pillow or mats have built in speakers which allow the user to “feel” the music through vibration. Classical, drumming and/or even some contemporary new age composers are often good music choices to use with this equipment.\nWhen considering a MSE keep in mind your space. Obstructions such as excess light from windows, wall barriers such as closet doors, cabinets/shelving and/or ventilation (side hvac units etc.) should be covered, moved or minimized as feasible. Additional electrical outlets may need to be installed and lighting should be changed to a rheostat control to allow gradual dimming. Floor and/or wall padding may be needed for comfort and acoustics. If space or budget is limited a Sensory Calming Cocoon or a Portable Sensory Corner may be good options.

{"question":"What is common between an aardwolf's foot structure and human foot anatomy - do they both have the same number of toes?","answer":"No, they have different numbers of toes. The aardwolf has 5 toes on the forefeet and 4 toes on the hind legs, with the fifth claw on the forefoot situated high above the paw. In contrast, human feet have 5 toes (phalanges) on each foot, which serve to provide a wider base for balance and propelling the body forward.","context":["Aardwolf (Proteles cristata)\nThe name aardwolf is an Afrikaans word literally meaning “Earth Wolf” based on its appearance and dietary preference for termites found in mounds and underground.\nStanding at a height of only 40 - 50 cm, the aardwolf resembles a small hyena. The aardwolf has a tail length of 20- 25 cm a total length of 65 - 80 cm from nose to tail. It weighs a slight 8 - 12 kg with a yellowish-brown coat covered in stripes along its back. Its bushy tail and long striped fur rise when the aardwolf feels threatened or scared.\nThe aardwolf is a carnivore but mainly feeds on two species of termites. When the one species goes dormant during the winter season, then the aardwolf will switch to feeding the other termite species. With the exception of its canines, the aardwolf’s teeth have become smaller due to its preference for eating insects.\nThe aardwolf can eat between 200 000 to 300 000 termites in one feeding. It uses its long, flexible, sticky tongue to eat the termites. Due to its specific diet, the aardwolf can only live where these termites are found in South Africa. The aardwolf has developed acute hearing to help them detect termites from the ground. Aardwolves also enjoy eating smaller prey such as bird, mice, carrion, and eggs.\nNot much is known about these secretive animals. Males and females are both solitary and only come together to breed. Breeding season occurs throughout the year and 2 - 4 cubs are produced at a time. The female carries the pups for a period of around 90 - 100 days and weaning cubs are fed regurgitated termites by both parents.\nThe aardwolf is solitary creature and is nocturnal. They are sometimes seen in small groups or pairs only for breeding purposes. The aardwolf is also a lone hunter, as they cannot take their food back to their pack to be shared. The aardwolf usually lives in used burrows from other animals such as the aardvark, porcupine or large springhares. If the aardwolf cannot find a suitable den, they are able to dig their own holes to make a home.\nWhere They Are Found\nThe aardwolf is native to South Africa and throughout Eastern and Southern Africa. The aardwolf enjoys wide, open, dry spaces among savanna and grassland. The aardwolf population is split into two populations. The one is located in South Africa and the other extends from Tanzania up to southern Egypt. In South Africa, the aardwolf can mainly be found in the Karoo and Northern Cape.\nFemale: 7,7 - 13,5 kg\nMale: 7,7- 13,5 kgLength\nFemale: 90 cm\nMale: 90 cmGestation Period\n2 monthsNo of Young\n2 - 4 cubsOrder\n2 - 4 young are born from September - April after a gestation period of ± 2 months.\nThe five toes on the forefeet of the aardwolf only leave a spoor trail of four toes, as the fifth claws is situated high above the paw. The hind legs has 4 toes. The aardwolf claws have a strong and broad base, but look narrow from above and have a curve of over 20mm.","Presentation on theme: \"Prevention and Treatment of Injuries\"— Presentation transcript:\n1 Prevention and Treatment of Injuries Westfield High SchoolHouston, TX\n2 The Foot – The anatomy The foot consists of 26 bones: 14 phalangeal 5 metatarsals7 tarsal\n3 ToesServe to give a wider base both for balance and for propelling the body forwardTwo sesamoid bones are located beneath the first metarsophalangeal joint – act to reduce pressure in weight bearing and to increase advantage of the flexor tendons of the Great Toe\n4 MetatarsalsFive bones that lie between and connect the tarsals and phalanges.The first metatarsal is the largest and functions as the main weight bearing support during walking and running.Little movement, but they do widen during weight bearing\n5 Tarsal BonesSeven tarsal bones, located between the bones of the lower leg and the metatarsals.They are important for support of the body and its locomotion.Calcaneus, talus, cuboid, navicular, and 3 cuniform bones.\n6 Bones of the FootCalcaneus: Largest tarsal bone, supports the talus and shapes the heel. Main functions are to convey the body weight to the ground and the serve as an attachment for both the Achilles tendon and several structures on the plantar surface of the foot.\n8 TalusIrregularly shaped bone that is most superior of the tarsal bones. Situated above the calcaneus. Consist of a body, neck and head. The uppermost part of the talus is the trochlea, which articulates with the medial and lateral malleoli to form the ankle joint. The talus is broader anteriorly to prevent forward slipping by the tibia during locomotion.\n10 Navicular / Cuboid / Cuneiforms Navicular: Positioned anterior of the talus on the medial aspect of the foot. Anteriorly articulate with three cuneiform bones.Cuboid: Lateral aspect of foot; articulates posteriorly with calcaneus and anteriorly with the fourth and fifth metatarsal.Cuneiforms: Three bones located between the navicular and the base of the three medial metatarsals\n11 Arches of the FootMedial Longitudinal Arch: from the medial border of the calcaneus and extends forward to the distal head of the first metatarsal.Lateral Longitudinal Arch: Is on the outer aspect of the foot, follows the same path of the Med. Long. Arch, formed by the calcaneus, cuboid and fifth metatarsal bones.\n12 Arches of the FootAnterior Metatarsal Arch: is shaped by the distal heads of the metatarsals.Transverse Arch:extends across the transverse tarsal bones, primarily the cuboid and the internal cuneiform, and form a half dome.\n13 Plantar FasciaA thick white band of fibrous tissue originating from the medial tuberosity of the calcaneus and ending at the proximal heads of the metatarsals. Supports the foot against downward forces.\n15 Subtalar JointThe articulations between the talus and the calcaneus. Inversion, eversion, pronation and supination are normal movements that occur at he subtalar joint.\n16 Prevention to Foot Injuries Selecting Proper FootwearThink of Sport SpecificsIs there any structural deformitiesSlip-last shoe – moccasin, sewn togetherBoard-last shoe – Fiberboard attached to upperCombination-lasted shoe is boarded in the back and slip lasted in the frontHeel counter in heel of shoe\n17 OrthoticUsing orthotics can prevent many injuries associated with biomechanical problems. Plastic, rubber or leather support that is placed in the shoe as a replacement for the existing insert. You can by ready made orthotics at a shoe or sporting goods store, and custom made orthotics by an athletic trainer or physical therapist.\n18 Shoe Wear PatternsOne can learn a lot of information by looking at the shoes and athlete wears either during the day or in training.The key to inspection of wear patterns on shoes is observation of the heel counter and the forefoot. The heel strike can give a little added insight.\n19 Foot Patterns Look at the bottom of the foot for callus patterns Where the foot has a callus is where the person is weight bearingYou can learn a person’s gait pattern and weight transfer by looking at callus patterns.\n20 Calcaneal Apophysitis Also known as Sever’s DiseaseComparable with Osgood-Schlatter’sPain over posterior heel below that attachment of the Achilles tendon insertion of the child or adolescent athleteBest treated with ice, rest, stretching, and anti-inflammatory medications.\n21 Heel ContusionCaused most likely by sudden start and stop sports or jumpingSevere pain in the heel, and unable to withstand the stress of weight bearingNon-weight bearing for 24 hours, RICE applied, NSAIDs, protection with heel cup or doughnut pad.\n22 Longitudinal Arch Strain Caused by subjecting the musculature of the foot to increased stress produces by repetitive contact with hard surfaces.As a rule, pain is experienced only during running and jumping.Immediate care, consisting of RICE, followed by appropriate therapy and reduction of weight bearing. Tape arch.\n23 Jones FracturesMay occur to any of the metatarsals and can be caused by inversion and plantar flexion of the foot; by direct force, such as being stepped on by another player, or by repetitive stress.By far the most common acute fracture is to the diaphysis at the base the fifth metatarsal.\n24 Jones FracturesCharacterized by immediate swelling and pain over the fifth metatarsal. Healing is slow and frustrating. Injury has a high nonunion rate, and the course of healing is unpredictable\n26 Jones FracturesControversial treatment, it appears that the use of crutches with no immobilization, gradually progressing to full weight bearing as pain subsides, may allow the athlete to return to activity in about 6 weeks. If nonunion occurs, the internal fixation will be needed.\n27 SesamoiditisCaused by repetitive hyperextension of the great toe that eventually results in inflammation. Most common in dancing and basketball.Complains of pain under the great toe, especially during push off…Tenderness is palpable under the first metatarsal.\n28 SesamoiditisTreat with a variety of orthotic devices, including metatarsal pads, arch supports, and most often, a metatarsal bar.A piece of felt can be cut out to relieve pressure from the sesamoid.\n29 Turf ToeA hyperextension injury resulting in a sprain of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the great toe.

{"question":"¿Cómo se puede distinguir entre la mora himalaya invasiva y otras especies de mora por la forma de sus hojas?","answer":"The Himalayan Blackberry can be distinguished by looking at the side leaflets - if they have lobes, it's likely NOT a Himalayan Blackberry. The only exception is when the Himalayan plant is young and has leaves with three leaflets instead of five. Other species like Salmon Berry will show lobes on their side leaflets.","context":["Blackberries have made large inroads into the wild west of the park since the 2006 windstorm, in the blowdown areas especially. Clearing them is just as 'possible' as clearing the English Ivy proved 'possible'. Most everyone knows and can recognize a blackberry plant by its thick vertical canes that dry up after a few years. You know the thorns and pick the berries for jam. Once the cane has reached the limit of its support it arches over. At this point secondary stems sprout. It is these that flower in June and set fruit on top of competing plants. Blackberries never branch in the form of normal bushes. In early spring you can spot blackberry plants far back from the trail by their distinctive form.\nWhen trying to positively identify the invasive Himalayan Blackberry, look for any lobes on the side leaflets. If they exist it is highly probable the plant is NOT a Himalayan. It will either be a Salmon Berry or one of the other blackberry species shown below. The only time Himalayan leaflets have side lobes is when the plant is young and the leaves are a compound of three, not five leaflets.\nMore and more frequently I am hearing the argument that blackberry plants should be left - because their thorny thickets provide birds with shelter and escape from predators. I find this argument questionable and self-serving.\n• I have seen no evidence of this in wild areas, except for the odd raccoon hiding from (ignoring) heckling crows.\n• Maybe the outfits organizing volunteer 'stewardship' work recognized that nobody will volunteer for this prickly work, or decided that clearing the plants is a lost cause , so they turned a negative into a positive?\n• Any acreage cleared in the wilds will not make no impact on the huge acreage of existing plants that will never, ever be cleared. Cannot those birds supposedly using a particular shelter not relocate?\n• Since the blackberries being cleared are foreign, the birds managed just fine before the invasion.\nInvasive Himalayan Blackberry (Rubus armeniacus)                                 Vertical canes eventually arch.\nIn addition to the well-known Himalayan Blackberry there are two other non-native invasive blackberry plants in the west. The Cut-Leaf Blackberry grows like the Himalayan but its leaves are very frilly. These are not common in Stanley Park but do crop up. Normal people will not be able to distinguish the second, Alleghany Blackberry (Rubus allegheniensis not shown), from the Himalyan. It is native to the North American east but not to the west.\nInvasive Cut-Leaf Blackberry (Rubus laciniatus)                           Native Trailing Blackberry (Rubus ursinus)\nIn Stanley Park there are two native species. The Trailing Blackberry is a small trailing plant without an upright cane. You can wrap its stem around your fist. Sometimes it grows vertically but only by using the support of other plants. Its leaves are more pointy than the Himalayan and are always compounds of 3 (never 5). The image above from UBC shows the lobes on the outside edge of the side leaflets, that I have found common in Stanley Park. Sometimes the center leaflet has lobes also. The leaves vary between plants and on the same plant. You won't think of it as a 'blackberry' so there will be no confusion of identification.\nNative Blackcap (Rubus leucodermis)         with distinctive blue stem\nThe second native, the Blackcap or Black Raspberry, has the same growth pattern as the invasive Himalayan, except you will immediately notice the stems are \"blue and smooth\". The leaflet's lobe showing in the image above is not always present. The underside of the leaves is clearly paler. Technically you should leave these \"blue and smooth\" plants in place. But they cross-pollinate with the invasive species. The fact that I have found so very few individual plants of this specie indicates to me that their gene pool is probably far from pure. If they are growing at the side of trails, where yearly weed-whacking will never allow them to mature, it seems reasonable to protect the downside risk by pulling them up along with the foreign species.\nClearing I Have Done\nThe map below identifies the trails I have cleared and the areas I have worked. Many of these are not finished. The circled areas refer to spots with many plants, from 20 to 100. The multitude of single plants were not worth mapping. At the start there were very few points without a blackberry growing within stone's throw. The immediate appearance of plants after any windfall opened up sunlight was most probably caused by this proximity ... not caused by decades old seed remaining viable in the soil.\nWhen to Work\n- It is much easier to pull up the blackberry's trailing root when the soil is wet and soft. In Vancouver this means before late spring. But, any plants found in swampy areas (many) are more easily pulled later in the summer after the soil has firmed up enough to walk on.\n- It is more easy to spot the arching canes of plants far back through a sea of Salmon Berry in the early spring before any leaves come out, or the Salmon Berry bloom in April.\n- It is easier to drag the pulled up plants out to the trail in early spring before the leaves come out, because the thorns will catch on the leaves.\n- Blackberries flower in June, after, but slightly overlapping the Thimble Berry's similar white flower (in May). The showy white flowers (white/pinkish to a greater or lesser degree) can be eaily seen through the woods, and over the top of a sea of Salmon Berries. This allows you to spot plants you could not see in spring. The problem with waiting for flowers is that your physical access may now be near impossible.\n- Plants may be growing at the edges of grass lawns. It is much easier to pull the Blackberry's roots through sod in early spring while the grass is dormant.\n- After Parks staff use a weed-whacker along the sides of trails, spotting plants is difficult and not worth the time/effort. Best to wait until plants have been allowed to grow back.\n- Dress appropriately. Don't go out without safety glasses. Good ankle boots are necessary for rough terrain. Cardboard stuck into the top of your socks will protect your shins from scratches. A hat will prevent the thorns catching your hair. Wear two layers on top. An outer layer, tightly woven, will still allow the thorns to penetrate, but the second layer will protect your skin. The top layer will get torn and shredded.\n- Gardening gloves are necessary. Leather is great. Cheap rubber palms are not sufficient. Look for heavy-duty models. Or spread a thin layer of \"Freesole\" urethane glue over the rubber. It will not impair the flexibility of your fingers, and thorns will not penetrate it. It is a wonderful product for all kinds of other uses as well.\n- Take along a hand cultivator and keyhole saw. These are your 'two hands' so you don't have to grasp the thorny stems.\nHow to Work\nVolunteers working in Stanley Park's wild woods will not be grazing sheep, or applying chemical herbicides, or using roto-tillers. These methods may (or may not) work in other areas, but not in the Stanley Park wild areas where individual Blackberry plants are dispersed among native plants in inaccessible areas. Volunteers must use hand tools and muscle power. The method that is guaranteed to NOT work is to tug the cane tops off the root-node. This ensures the plant grows back and causes the root-node to send out additional roots, making the job of pulling up the root (if ever done) harder and harder.\n- Blackberries will often grow toward the sun, so approach the stand from its backside.\n- There are always many old, dry canes restricting your access and causing problems for other plants. Before starting to dig the roots knock down these old canes and break them up with your feet on the ground. It would be better if they could be removed completely, but you will find that is next to impossible.\n- Some videos show using a spade to cut around the Blackberry and lift the root node. This method will not work in the wilds. Most often the Blackberry's root is inter-twined with other plants' tough roots. Your spade would need to be very sharp indeed to cut through that mass. You also need to be standing up to use a spade. In the wild you don't have that room.\n- I recommend using two tools - a hand cultivator (two or three pronged) and a keyhole saw. Be careful walking through the woods while carrying these. Keep them pointed away from your body so if (when) you stumble they don't stab you. Better to attach them somehow to your belt. Use one tool in each hand to manipulate the canes.\n- Some people say to cut off the vertical cane before trying to dig up the roots. I disagree. (a) Plants with their roots attached wilt within a week and are more easy to dispose of. In contrast cut canes dry out stiff and don't decompose - a much harder disposal problem. (b) Leaving the canes attached allows you to drag the pulled plant out of your way by the root ball. (c) If you cut the cane and pull it out to the trail before digging the root -- will you be able to find that root when you return?\n- Use the cultivator to scratch the soil away from the root node. This exposes one thick trailing root and other smaller roots. Hook a finger under each individual small root and pry it out. When all that remains is the trailing root, use both hands to pull from underneath the node. Pull out as much as you can.\n- Sometimes you can only pull up a foot or two of the trailing root. Other times you cannot budge the node. Then use the keyhole saw to cut through the thick roots. This leaves cut roots in place. A small proportion of these will start new plants in a year or two. But the proportion is small and not a reason to conclude the work is pointless.\n- Before removing the plant, check that none of its canes have curved down the the ground and re-rooted. Just pulling from the parent's base will cause the cane to break, leaving the rooted tip in place.\n- Grasp the plant by its root end to pull it out of the woods to a collection site. Try to minimize snagging other plants too badly.\n- It is important to remove the pulled plants. (i) Any canes left behind will confuse volunteers doing upkeep work in later years. (ii)The canes need to be removed to allow you access deeper into the stand. Room is tight enough even when the pulled plants are cleared. Sometimes you have no choice but to leave them in place. Try to fold the canes like an accordian down onto the ground under your feet. You will see that this only works for one or two plants at most.\nDigging up the roots is hard work but a permanent fix. Sure, upkeep will be necessary but they don't 'just grow back'. The critical factor for re-growth is sunlight. Most of the wild west of the park is in heavy shade. Re-growth is minimal. Sunny sites tend to be directly adjacent to paths and lawns, so repeat visits are easy. Growth from dormant seeds is rare. The re-growth comes from the cut roots left behind. On repeat visits, you have to dig deeper to catch that old root, but now you will find it less strongly anchored and easier to pull out. It is necessary to re-visit twice a year for a few years - in late June and October.\nWhere To Work\nThe same logic for prioritizing English Ivy work applies to Blackberries as well. Target the few plants what will clear large areas. Completely clear areas with a defensible border. Work to expand cleared areas instead of starting new isolated patches. Prioritize wild areas with an 'ecology' to save.\nBut there are complications. The decision 'where to work' involves a trade-off between factors.\n- Very often it is not possible to see how much work will be required when you first start work on a site. The full extent of the problem only appears as your work goes on ... and on.\n- While most areas of the west park will continue little changed over the next decade, the blow-down areas from the 2006 wind storm are rapidly changing - both from nature's attempt to regenerate, and from Parks staff weed-whacking large swaths . Maybe an ounce of prevention now will prevent a much larger problem later.\n- Access into windstorm blown-down areas was often only possible in the short periods after weed-whacking. As at 2016 many of the blow-down areas have new growth that makes access to clear (or even see) blackberries impossible. These areas must be left on the back-burner until the new growth has matured and the understory clears.\nWindstorm 2006 Damage Inaccessible\nThis aerial photograph taken 2008 soon after the December 2006 windstorm, shows clearly which areas were heavily damaged and are now inaccessible for clearing. Regenerated understory plants now restrict physical access. They are tall enough to restrict line of vision as well. Clearing these areas must wait a decade for the trees to mature and the understory to thin. Completing other work takes priority."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:72248e8d-1747-4d01-a0e9-8701c687859e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What evidence do archaeologists have about ancient European brewing practices, and how do modern reconstructions validate these findings?","answer":"Archaeological evidence of ancient European brewing includes pottery shards with chemical remnants from Denmark and Sweden dating back to 1500 B.C., as well as pollen content analysis from drinking vessels. In graves, strainer cups and jars containing beverage remains were found alongside warriors and priestesses. Modern reconstruction efforts have validated these findings - for example, the Trossingen grave in Germany contained a maple bottle with approximately 3,500 pollen grains from various sources including cereals, grape, bee activities, and hops. These findings have enabled modern brewers to recreate ancient recipes, demonstrating that the complex combinations of ingredients could indeed produce palatable beverages.","context":["Ancient Scandinavians quaffed an alcoholic mixture of barley, honey, cranberries, herbs and even grape wine imported from Greece and Rome, new research finds.\nThis Nordic “grog” predates the Vikings. It was found buried in tombs alongside warriors and priestesses, and is now available at liquor stores across the United States, thanks to a reconstruction effort by Patrick McGovern, a biomolecular archaeologist at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and Delaware-based Dogfish Head Craft Brewery.\n“You’d think, with all these different ingredients, it sort of makes your stomach churn,” McGovern, the study’s lead author, told LiveScience. “But actually, if you put it in the right amounts and balance out the ingredients, it really does taste very good.”\nDrink of the ancients\nMcGovern began the journey toward uncovering the ingredients of ancient Nordic alcohol decades ago, when he began combing through museums in Denmark and Sweden, looking for pottery shards that held traces of old beverages. But in the mid-1990s, the technology to analyze these chemical remnants just wasn’t available, he said.\nMore recently, McGovern and his co-authors re-examined the remnants with modern tools. They analyzed samples from four sites, two of which were grave sites in Sweden and Denmark. The oldest of these sites dated back to 1500 B.C. — more than 3,500 years ago. The oldest sample came from a large jar buried with a male warrior in Denmark. The other three came from strainer cups, used to serve wine, found in Denmark and Sweden. One of the strainer cups came from a tomb where four women were buried. One of the women, who died at around age 30, clutched the strainer in her hand.\nBeer brewing goes back at least 10,000 years, and ancient humans were endlessly creative in their recipes for intoxicants. Studies of pollen content in northern European drinking vessels suggested the ancient residents drank honey-based mead and other alcoholic brews. But the exact ingredients were not well understood. Ancient texts written by Greeks and Romans proved that southern Europeans were among the first wine snobs — these authors dismissed Northern beverages as “barley rotted in water.”\nIn fact, Nordic grog was a complex brew, McGovern and his colleagues found. The ingredients included honey, cranberries and lingonberries (acidic red berries that grow in Scandinavia). Wheat, rye and barley — and, occasionally, imported grape wine from southern Europe — formed a base for the drink. Herbs and spices — such as bog myrtle, yarrow, juniper and birch resin — added flavor and perhaps medicinal qualities.\nThe oldest sample, which was buried with a male warrior, was an anomaly. The jug found in that grave contained only traces of honey, suggesting that the occupant went to his grave with a jar of unadulterated mead. Because the warrior had well-crafted weapons in his tomb, he was likely of high status. Pure mead was probably a drink for the elite, because honey was expensive and scarce, the researchers reported online Dec. 23 in the Danish Journal of Archaeology. …\nI don’t drink but I’m curious to try this.","6th Century CE Hopped Mead\nBrewer: Magnús hvalmagi\nRecipe Name: A 6th Century CE Hopped Mead Based on the Trossingen 58 Grave Find\nCategory: Division 2\nTime/Place Paneled: EK Brew U, April 2014\nPanel Score: 96\nBackground and Basis\nIn 2001/2002, a grave find at Trossingen, Germany was unearthed. The grave contained a human corpse with a number of well-preserved wooden artifacts, among them a bottle made of maple. Dendrochronological analysis puts the date of the grave at 580 CE. A booklet detailing aspects of the find was published in 2010, and recently became available outside of the museum where the find is housed.\nThe maple bottle contained numerous (~3500) pollen grains from various plant sources, including cereals, grape, bee activities, and hops.\nI analyzed the pollen grains and, using a variety of research and assumptions, attempted to map the pollen content to mass of ingredients and from that reconstruct a plausible recipe for the product that may have been contained in the bottle.\nIngredients and Process (~2 liter batch size)\n65 grams hopped leaven biscuit (~2/3 cup)\n1 lb wildflower honey (~1 1/3 cup)\nLalvin EC-1118 yeast\nA leaven biscuit was prepared by mixing 63 g ground malted grain (ground in a rotary hand quern constructed of concrete) with old wine (made from commercial grape juice and Lalvin EC-1118) in sufficient quantity (approx. 100 mL) to make a dough. 2 grams of ground Hallertau hop pellets were mixed in with the biscuit, and the mass was baked at 200F until it was completely dry. Additional Lalvin EC-1118 was mixed into the dried biscut, as I was uncertain as to the health and vitality of the yeast in the wine.\n65 g of biscuit mix was placed in a sanitized growler, and 1 cup of warm water was poured onto it. Biscuit was allowed to sit overnight to begin fermentation. 1 1/3 cup of honey was added along with 5 1/3 cup water (a 1:4 honey:water ratio by volume). It was discovered during processing that 65 g of biscuit occupied a volume of 2/3 of a cup, and that 1 lb of the honey occupied roughly twice that volume – so a proportionate ingredient system is evidenced (1 part grain, 2 parts honey, 8 parts water). The mixture was allowed to ferment for 4 days before being transferred to an appropriate container for presentation.\nI used honey that I had on hand. I do not recall if it was local raw honey or commercially-purchased honey, as it was in an unmarked container. I had previously prepared the malt for a different event where I would be demonstrating the rotary grain quern I had constructed; this malt was prepared by steeping barley in water, turning for several days, and drying in my oven. The malt was ground in the quern and not bolted (sifted) afterwards; this lead to an extremely crumbly “biscuit” that did not hold together well. Hallertau was selected as the hop because it’s a noble German variety, and I felt it would probably be the closest commercially-available option I could obtain.\nThe attached document (which is quite lengthy) details the model of interpretation I used when interpreting the evidence. Several assumptions have been made in order to do this.\nThe biscuit processing method comes from descriptions of leavening in Pliny’s Naturalis Historia and my own research into pre-1000 CE brewing methodology. Pliny’s method calls for grape must from the time of vintage (which would contain live yeast); as grapes do not really grow where I live, nor are they readily available, I substituted a still-fermenting wine that I happened to have on hand. Additional yeast was added to the biscuit to ensure fermentation, as the wine was somewhat old. While I was unable to determine the plausible mass of grape must that would account for the pollen representation in the bottle, we do know that self-pollinating plants (like the grape) produce far less pollen than wind or insect-pollinated plants. It seems reasonable that it would take 10x as much grape mass as hop mass to produce the same amount of pollen.\n- Theune-Großkopf, Barbara. Mit Leier und Schwert.

Liars and braggarts hang around the Shrine of Cloacina: rich, married ne’er-do-wells by the Basilica. Packs of prostitutes there too—but rather clapped-out ones. In the Fish-Market members of dining-clubs. In the Lower Forum respectable, well-to-do citizens out for a stroll; in the Middle Forum, flashier types, along the canal. By the Lacus Curtius, you’ll find bold fellows with a tongue in their head and a bad intent in their mind—great slanderers of others and very vulnerable to it themselves. By the Old Shops, the money-lenders—they’ll make or take a loan. Behind the Temple of Castor, there are men to whom you wouldn’t entrust yourself. In the Vicus Tuscus are men who sell themselves. In the Velabrum you’ll find a baker or a butcher or a fortune-teller—or men who will do a turn for you or get you to do a turn for them.”\nFORO ROMANO DESCRIPTION\nYour trip to Rome must include a visit to the Roman Forum. Once the center of the Roman world, the Foro Romano became an abandoned cow pasture and quarry. Lucky for us, this abandonment enabled the preservation of the urban design of the Forum as the foundation of buildings and the roads were covered and protected for hundreds of years. Plan for a long visit, there is much to see and to explore. Walking along the Via Sacra on which so many Roman parades took place and contemplating the exact spot on which Julius Caesar was cremated is an unequaled living history experience.\nARCH OF SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS\n“The Arch of Septimius Severus, erected in 203 CE, stands in Rome and commemorates the Roman victories over the Parthians in the final decade of the 2nd century CE. The triple triumphal arch was one of the most richly decorated of its type and even today, although badly damaged, it stands in the Forum Romanum as a lasting and imposing monument to Roman vanity.”\nARCH OF TITUS\n“Located at the highest point of the Via Sacra which leads to the Roman Forum, this triumphal arch, with only one passageway, commemorates Titus’ conquest of Judea which ended the Jewish Wars (66-70). Engaged fluted columns frame the passageway, the spandrels depict Victories in relief, the attic contains an inscription (see below) and the internal faces of the passageway depict in relief triumphal processions (see below). The arch was erected posthumously, after Titus had already become a “god.”\nMay Ann Sullivan\n“Named after Julius Caesar, who dedicated it in 46 BC from the spoils of the Gallic War, the Basilica Julia was completed by Augustus but burned shortly afterward and was not rededicated for another twenty years, in AD 12. It again was rebuilt by Diocletian after the fire of AD 283 and later restored by Gabinus Vettius Probianus, urban prefect in AD 416…The Basilica housed the civil law courts and tabernae provided space for government offices and banking.”\nBASILICA OF MAXENTIUS AND CONSTANTINE\n“The Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine, the greatest of the Roman basilicas, covered about 7,000 square yards (5,600 square m) and included a central nave that was 265 feet (80 m) long and 83 feet (25 m) wide.1 Only about a third of the original structure still stands. The vaulted roofs and concrete materials caused the Basilica to more closely resemble a traditional Roman bath than a basilica.”\nCOLUMN OF PHOCAS\n“The Column of Phocas is located on the main square of the Forum Romanum, in front of the Rostra. It is a honorary column dedicated to the byzantine emperor Phocas, erected in 608 BCE by the exarch, the byzantine governor, making it the last addition to the Forum in Antiquity.”\nCURIA (SENATE HOUSE)\n“And certainly, the senate house in particular should be built above all so as to enhance the dignity of the town or city. And if this senate house is going to be square, then whatever its length, its height should be half again as much. If, on the other hand, it is to be oblong, then the length and width should be added together, and half this measure should be given over to the height of the senate house up to the level of the ceiling coffers.”\nDe Architectura (V.2.1)\nHOUSE OF THE VESTAL VIRGINS\n“Let us recall to life the silent ruins; let us vivify these halls, these porticoes, with the presence of maidens clad in snow-white garments, which reflected, as it were, the purity of their minds and souls; in the very prime of beauty, youth, and strength; daughters of the noblest families; depositaries of state secrets, confidants of the imperial household, and faithful keepers of the sacred tokens of the Roman Commonwealth.”\nAncient Rome in the Light of Recent Discoveries.

The capitals and work of the columns evidently belong to the commencement of the III century the time of Septimius Severus…An inscription over the portico indicates that these rooms contained statues of the «Dii Consenti» which were replaced by Pretestatus, the Prefect of Rome in the year 368 of the Christian era. The « Dii Consentii were the twelve great Gods placed by Euuios in the following order.

(Hist. Aug. Pius 6). After the death of Antoninus himself in 161, the temple was dedicated to both together (Hist. Aug. Pius 13)…In the seventh or eighth century this temple, apparently in good condition, was converted into the church of S. Lorenzo in Miranda , the floor of which is about 12 metres above the ancient level. Excavations in front of the temple were undertaken in 1546, and in 1899 and following years, when the whole eastern side was exposed to view.”\nSamuel Ball Platner\nPlatner, Samuel Ball. … The topography and monuments of ancient Rome. Boston, Allyn and Bacon, 1911.\nTEMPLE OF DIVUS JULIUS\n“The Temple of Caesar (Aedes Divus Iulius or Templum Divi Iuli) was built by Augustus after the senate deified Julius Caesar after his death. The temple was dedicated August 18th, 29 BCE. It stands on the E. side of the main square of the Forum Romanum, between the Regia, Temple of Castor and Pollux and the the Basilica Aemilia. After Julius Caesar was murdered, his body was carried to the forum, near the Regia, which was his official residence as pontifex maximus. A funeral pyre was built and his body cremated. Initially a commemorative column was erected on the spot with a dedication to the “father of the fatherland”, but soon after Augustus started the construction of a temple for his adoptive father who the senate had declared a god. The temple was finished and consecrated in 29 BCE.”\nTEMPLE OF DIVUS ROMULUS\n“The Temple of the Divus Romulus was the name given to a circular plan building of uncertain purpose erected by Emperor Maxentius on the Via Sacra and traditionally identified, due to an erroneous interpretation of depictions on coins, with the temple built by the emperor in honour of his son Romulus, who died at a young age and was deified. The construction, also identified as the Tempio dei Penati or as the audience hall of the prefecture, was more probably the monumental vestibule of the Templum Pacis at the rear. It has retained the original bronze portal framed by columns of porphyry and a richly decorated architrave. The rotunda is flanked by two rectangular apses connected to the central core. In the VI century, it became the entrance vestibule of the Basilica dei Santi Cosma e Damiano, built on the site of the biblioteca of the Templum Pacis during the papacy of Pope Felice IV (526-530).”\nTEMPLE OF SATURN\n“The Temple of Saturn occupies a very old site in the Roman Forum, where the cult of Saturn had been practiced for millennia.1 Repaired, reconstructed, and rebuilt many times, scholars estimate the original Temple of Saturn was dedicated approximatey in 497 BCE, at the beginning of the Roman Republic. The Temple’s inscription refers to its restoration in approximately 460-480 CE, nearly a thousand years later.”\nTEMPLE OF VESTA\n“The Temple of Vesta, with the House of the Vestal Virgins, formed a single religious complex (Atrium Vestae) connected to the Regia. In the building, which represented the hearth of the nearby house of the king, was a symbol of all the hearths of the State, where the sacred flame was preserved which was never to be allowed to go out since it was a symbol of the protection of the city by Vesta. In a recess of the temple, forbidden to anyone except the Vestal Virgins, sacred objects were preserved (including the Palladium, the archaic image of Pallas Athena that Aeneas brought from Tory) on which the fortune of Rome depended. Bearing witness to the antiquity of the cult, the temple was in a circular form like the huts of the original settlement.”","Arch of Septimius Severus\nThe ancient Romans liked to celebrate their victories in battle by building monuments to the victors.\nThe Arch of Septimius Severus is one of these monuments constructed in ancient Rome.\nThe triumphal arch was dedicated to the Roman victories led by Emperor Septimius Severus over the Parthians in 197 C.E.\nThe arch was constructed in 203 C.E. and located in the Forum.\nVictory over the Parthia Empire\nSeptimius Severus was the Roman Emperor from 190 C.E. until his death in York during 211 C.E.\nHe rose to power first as a senator appointed by Marcus Aurelius and then became a consul in 190 C.E. Severus became emperor after the murder of Pertinax by Roman soldiers in 193 C.E.\nHe was appointed emperor by his army and returned to Rome to seize power. Other people claimed to be emperor too but by 197 C.E. Severus had eliminated all them taking full control of the Roman Empire.\nSeptimius Severus was raised to be a soldier. He pursued glory on the battle field. He was instrumental in waging war against the Parthian Empire which was located in present-day Iran and Iraq.\nSeverus began his campaign against Parthian in 194 C.E. and completed his conquest in 197 C.E. with his two sons named Greta and Caracalla.\nHis victories against the Parthian Empire and the sacking of the Parthian capital Ctesiphon allowed the Roman Empire to regain the upper half of the Mesopotamia.\nAfter conquering the Parthians he sold all surviving people and soldiers into slavery.\nThe Arch of Septimius Severus\nThe Arch of Septimius Severus was constructed on the Via Sacra in the Forum of ancient Rome. The arch is composed of three archways.\nThe center arch is the largest and there are two smaller arches on the sides. The arch stands 69 feet tall (23 meters) and 75 feet wide (25 meters). The foundation and inner pieces of the arch is built from travertine marble with Procennesian marble composing the faces of the arch.\nThe arch has eight Corinthian style columns with four columns on each side.\nThe Arch of Septimius Severus is adorned with numerous detailed designs. The designs include battle scenes in Parthia, people being taken into slavery, nature scenes, other military victories, and numerous deities important to Romans.\nThe overall style of the sculptures is very similar to that of the Column of Marcus Aurelius. Other sculptures that adorn the Arch of Septimius Severus are Mars, the Roman god of war, Bacchus, Hercules, and various other Roman gods.\nOn the very top of the arch was a gilded bronze six-horse chariot guided by Emperor Septimius Severus and his two sons riding horses along his sides.\nThe arch contains an inscription that proclaimed Emperor Severus and his two sons had restored the Republic of Rome and enlarged the territory of the empire by creating the new Roman province known as Mesopotamia.\nFacts about the Arch of Septimius Severus\n- Septimius Severus was Emperor of Rome from 193 C.E. until his death in York during 211 C.E.\n- The Arch of Septimius Severus was constructed to celebrate the victory of Emperor Severus over the Parthia Empire in 197 C.E.\n- The victory regained lands in the region of present-day Iran and Iraq.

{"question":"Is the use of mammoth ivory more restricted in trade compared to Imari porcelain production?","answer":"No, mammoth ivory actually has fewer trade restrictions than many other ivory types. Commerce in mammoth ivory, which is 10,000-40,000 years old, is completely unrestricted. Meanwhile, Imari porcelain, though not restricted in trade, was historically controlled in terms of production and export, being manufactured specifically in the town of Arita and shipped through the port of Imari during specific periods in history, with varying quality levels from crude to finely painted wares.","context":["Sperm Whale Ivory\nWhale Ivory is derived from the teeth found in the lower jaw of the sperm whale. These teeth range from three to ten inches in height. It was with this type of ivory that American Whale men created the first pieces of Scrimshaw. Whale ivory is usually mellow yellow in color and has a distinctive inner ring to its grain.\nAncient Mammoth Ivory\nThe Wooly Mammoth was a large Prehistoric creature which roamed the earth over 10,000 years ago. Resembling our modern elephant they had long shaggy coats and large curved tusks often exceeding ten feet in length. Now extinct, their remains are occasionally unearthed in the northern hemisphere with their long ivory tusks intact. Over the centuries, the ivory has taken on a variety of colors including tans and greys which gives each piece a unique quality.\nAfrican Elephant Ivory\nElephant ivory is derived from the tusk of the African Elephant. From 1976-1989 ivory was obtained from the elephants in National Parks which died of natural causes or were culled from the herds. Due to corruption in a small percentage of these parks, the U.S. put a ban on the importation of Elephant ivory in 1989. Currently we are able to work with ivory that was legally imported into the U.S. prior to the ban.\nAntique Walrus Ivory\nAntique Walrus ivory is derived from the tusks and teeth of the walrus which lived years ago on the frozen tundra of Alaska. The ivory lay buried in a variety of mineral deposits which slowly changed its color to a myriad of mochas, tans, browns, and blacks. Today it is unearthed by\nAntique Piano Key Ivory\nPrior to modern synthetics, piano keys were covered with elephant ivory cut to 1mm in thickness.

Imari is in fact a European name for export porcelain produced in the town of Arita in the Hizen province of Japan. It was shipped through the nearby port of Imari from the second half of the 17th century and the first half of the 18th century. Pre-export period Imari is called Shoki-Imari.\nThere are two distinct styles of Arita or Imari porcelain.\nFirstly there is the rare and highly sought after Kakiemon porcelain. It is sparsely decorated predominantly in coral red on a very fine white glaze. Highlight colours include yellow, green and aubergine Kakiemon wares are of a consistently high standard and command very high prices\nIn contrast, the more commonly found Imari in the west is called brocaded Imari or Kinrande Imari, and is usually richly decorated with flowers, foliage and figures. These pieces have an overall floral decoration reminiscent of a rich silk textile, and typical colours are underglaze cobalt blue and iron red, which is highlighted with colours such as gold, green, aubergine and yellow. There is a great variation in quality, ranging from quite crude though decorative wares to very finely painted wares.\nItems exported to the West included garnitures of vases, plates, chargers, figures as well as utilitarian wares. Due to its popularity and success, Imari was widely imitated both in China and the West. English factories who produced Imari or \"Japan\" patterns as they were sometimes known included, Bow, Derby, Minton, Spode, Worcester and Mason's. European factories included Meissen, Chantilly and Delft.\nA technique where pigment is applied to a ceramic surface so that it stands out from the glazed surface in slight relief.\nImperial yellow, also called \"Chinese Yellow\" and \"Royal Yellow\" is an auspicious colour in Chinese culture.\nIt was the colour of Imperial China and the symbolic colour of of the five legendary emperors of ancient China.

Inlay may consist of a panel of well figured timber inset into a cabinet door front, geometric patterns, or complex and stylized designs of flowers, swags of foliage, fruits and other motifs. As a general rule, in pieces where the carcase is constructed in the solid, the inlay is relatively simple such as stringing, cross banding and herringbone banding. Where more elaborate and decorative work was required veneer was used. Inlay has been fashionable from at least the latter half of the 17th century, when a variety of elaborate forms were developed\nA term used to define a method of decoration most common in glassmaking and jewellery which involves engraving, carving or moulding an image into the background, leaving an impression, and leaving the top surface of the item flat, the opposite to relief carving, and also know as counter-relief.\nWhen used in relation to wooden items, intarsia is the Italian term for inlaying, where the background timber is cut away and and a selection of timbers of different colours and grains are inserted to form a picture or pattern.\nCredit for the invention of ironstone china is generally accorded to Charles Mason in 1813. Charles Mason was one of the two sons of Miles Mason who founded the Mason works in 1802, and ran the business with his brother George Mason.\nIronstone was a heavy hard earthenware which was slightly translucent, its strength supposedly coming from a very small quantity of iron slag added to the mixture. The additional strength enabled the company to make larger objects that were not susceptible to breakage.\nThe company manufactured dinner wares, toilet sets, tureens, jugs and so on, and the most popular patterns were blue and white, floral and Oriental Imari style colours.\nThe trade name \"Patent Ironstone China\" was registered by the company in 1813, but the patent was only valid for 14 years and was not renewed, enabling other potteries to use the word \"ironstone\" in describing their wares.\nMason wares are generally well marked with \"Mason's Patent Ironstone China\" .\nMost commonly used to describe the finish in glass and ceramics, an iridescent finish is one that subtly changes colour when moved and the light strikes it at a different angle. In glass, objects by Louis Comfort Tiffany in the United States, and Loetz in Bohemia often have irridescencent finish.

{"question":"How do the historical contexts of Baroque art and women Surrealists in the early 20th century reflect different responses to religious and societal pressures?","answer":"The Baroque and women Surrealist movements emerged as responses to very different societal pressures. Baroque art flourished between 1600-1750 as a direct result of the Counter-Reformation, strongly supported by the Catholic Church and reflecting European colonial wealth through its emphasis on luxury and grandeur. Religious themes dominated Baroque art, with artists focusing on dramatic, stage-like compositions. In contrast, women Surrealists like Kay Sage worked in a male-dominated art world, often invisible despite their formidable skills. They responded to different pressures, including war trauma, social inequalities, and gender discrimination. While Baroque artists emphasized religious themes and opulence, Surrealist women explored unconscious desires and psychological landscapes, with Sage specifically creating works reflecting anxiety and vulnerability through mysterious architectural forms and post-apocalyptic imagery.","context":["Women surrealists represent a lost chapter of the history of art. Besides Salvador Dali, Rene Magritte, and other famous men surrealists, plenty of formidable women artists practiced Surrealism invisibly but with equal skills. Kay Sage was a surrealist painter and poet, perhaps one of the best-known, yet not famous. She had a remarkable life, helped numerous European artists during World War II escape to the USA and had a spectacular collection of artworks that she later offered to several art institutions.\nKay Sage, Her Royal Highness\nKay Sage’s life story carries something glorious, dramatic, and mythical. She was born in 1898 in a prestigious family in New York, a daughter of the businessman and state senator Henry Manning Sage. Her mother, Anne Wheeler Sage, was an eccentric cosmopolitan woman who left the States after her divorce with Kay, still a child, to travel around Europe. Little Kay traveled a lot during her childhood and thus cultivated a broad artistic flair and a non-negotiable sense of freedom. From a very young age, she spoke many languages.\nShe adopted her mother’s bohemian taste from an early age, which impacted her artistic temperament. Kay Sage had an unquiet mind, seeking shelter in artistic creation. She started drawing and writing poetry when in school. Her decisive artistic pathway, though, began in Rome. She studied painting in the Scuola Libera Delle Belle Arti and joined the Venticinque Della Campagna Romana, a frivolous bohemian group of landscape artists who made excursions outside the city for painting. In this carefree state of mind, she met, fell in love with, and later married the Italian Prince Ranieri di San Faustino.\nAlthough happy initially, the marriage eventually obliged her to neglect her actual life preferences and creativity to follow the royal ways. She was too bohemian and independent to compromise with the prince’s pretentious circle and responsibilities. Her incidental meetings and friendship with the American poet Ezra Pound and the German sculptor Heinz Henghes were catalytic for her life decisions. In 1935, she left the prince, moved to Paris, and devoted herself exclusively to her art.\nKay Sage – Man or Woman?\nAre you enjoying this article?Sign up to our Free Weekly Newsletter\nWhen Andre Breton and Yves Tanguy attended the Paris’ Salon des Independants in 1938, Kay Sage’s paintings attracted their attention and admiration. They hadn’t heard this name before. They didn’t even know if she was a man or a woman. And this ignorance was a favourable occasion as her gender would later be a somewhat restrictive element regarding her work’s evaluation by the male-dominated art criticism of the time.\nHer eventual meeting with the surrealist painters was the beginning of a beautiful friendship –or not always such a beautiful one. She was in her 40s, attractive, wealthy and independent, probably frightful for them. Andre Breton’s slight contempt towards women artists, plus his socialistic idealism, wouldn’t let him accept Kay Sage’s artistic ambition and royal past. The fact that she painted like a man didn’t matter anymore. He never acknowledged her as a surrealist. Yves Tanguy, on the other hand, fell for her – absolutely and irreversibly. They would stay connected forever.\nHer interactions with the Surrealists during the end of the 30s transformed Sage’s creative idiom, leading her to a new artistic identity. She even forgot her previous art education declaring later that she was self-taught. Despite Breton’s disapproval, Kay Sage would always consider herself a surrealist painter.\nWhen World War II started, she helped most Surrealist painters of her circle escape from Europe to New York. Using her connections and acquaintances, she founded The Society for the Preservation of European Culture, an organization through which she brought European artists to the USA, organized exhibitions, and promoted surrealist painters. At the same time, she helped many artists and their families financially, including Andre Breton, survive in the States.\nSurrealist Painters – His and Hers Surrealism\nSigmund Freud’s interpretation of dreams had a tremendous impact on the arts of the first half of the 20th century. The idea of the repressed unconscious drives that move under our perception of reality, leaving undetectable but crucial traces on its surface, was one of the most critical dynamics that shaped the western artistic practice of the time. Freudian theories laid the foundation for several movements and amongst them was Surrealism.\nSurrealist painters and poets, through obscure and dreadful dreamscapes, investigated the mind’s mysterious wastelands and negotiated repressed instincts and unconscious desires. And the times were really hard. Before and after World War II, European artists had to deal with irreparable traumas and anxieties concerning the war, social inequalities, poverty, and threatening technology, as well as the expatriation of many of them.\nYves Tanguy had been already considered a distinguished surrealist member before following Sage to the States, where they finally got married and settled in Connecticut. Kay Sage bought an old colonial manor and transformed the area around it into a landscape reminiscent of Tanguy’s paintings.\nTanguy’s art brought the weight of anxiety and an uncanny feeling of not belonging, his vast deserts and peculiar unidentifiable creatures representing his estrangement sentiment and his rejection of reality.\nKay Sage surged Tanguy’s mysterious and troubled mind and art, the enigmatic sceneries of his thought, with admiration and willingness to stand beside him. Her most productive years were the ones around their encounter and their life together. Tanguy was her strange attractor: a force fatal and creative at the same time.\nThere is an interesting change of subject in her paintings after meeting the surrealists and Tanguy. There is undoubtedly an influence of the vast Tanguy’s landscapes. But there is also a kind of despair that wasn’t there before. Of course, there was a great war around that time, too much destruction and fear that couldn’t leave her intact.\nHer paintings are poetic and blue. Like sceneries for Samuel Beckett plays or dystopian science fiction – sad cartographies of a strange world. She was deeply inspired by Giorgio de Chirico’s shadowy sceneries and enigmatic arrangements. The first painting she had ever bought was de Chirico’s, and his artworks would remain a lifelong reference for her.\nEverything seems still and lethargic in Kay’s imagery, like a walk through a post-apocalyptic landscape or a bad premonition. There are mysterious scaffoldings and peculiar buildings, an allure toward architectural paradoxes. Placid anxiety and a feeling like pacing towards a nightmare, but not reaching it. There are peaceful seas and ghostly shipwrecks, lunar sceneries, and obscure humanoid shapes, all in plain light.\nThe doom is not apparent. Looking at them is like having a disturbing dream; it’s deeper than pure melancholy or gloomy apathy, rather an indiscernible sense of vulnerability and risk.\nTomorrow is Never\nKay Sage had a restless personality. She had an anxious mind and she was always on the move. However, her paintings showed a stillness or should we call it – insufferable inertia. Her perpetual life motion when looking at her artworks seems to hide a pursuit of immobility. As if she wanted to rest, but couldn’t find her harbor. Her life had been a wandering, endless search that stopped before Yves Tanguy.\nYves Tanguy was devoted but unbearable. Their meeting in Paris had produced a moderate scandal considering his ex-wife and the affair he had with the collector Peggy Guggenheim before meeting Sage. Despite the artistic dinners and parties that Kay Sage had continuously organized, Yves’ settlement in the rural Woodlands of Connecticut was somewhat lonely and intolerable for him. He reduced his painting time and increased his drinking, ending up regularly drunk and aggressive. He insulted and humiliated Kay Sage in front of their friends. There are testimonies about his violence towards her, his outrageous behavior, and her silent bearing.\nUnfortunately Sage, a woman so independent and unstoppable regarding her passions and dispositions, did not escape these internalized patriarchal impositions. She had divorced the prince —because her creativity was damned during their marriage— but could not leave Tanguy despite the fact that he treated her like that. She considered him the love of her life and her primary inspiration. We could assume that all this intensity he was creating between them was twistedly inspirational and addictive for both of them.\nHe died an alcoholic in 1955, falling out of bed and hitting his head. He was only 55 years old.\nAfter his death, there was no tomorrow for Kay Sage. The first time she tried to kill herself with a pill overdose, she failed. So, she devoted herself to painting and keeping Yves Tanguy’s legacy. She wrote and published his catalog raisonné, and she kept painting until she almost lost her vision. She then mainly focused on her poetry that was alike but also different from her painting. Sad, absurd, and quiet.\nHer Ivory Egg\nKay Sage had been writing since her youth. If her paintings have titles that sound like poetry, her poetry could describe images she never had made. There are empty rooms with more than one colored door, blackbirds, ivory towers, and blood-stained aprons. There is pure surrealist imagery in there, sometimes harsher or “noisier” than her paintings. There is also color in her poems, more intense or expressive than in her pictures. And sometimes, surprisingly, there is humor.\nSome of her poems are mysterious, dark, and enigmatic; others are playful, light and humoresque, adopting the surrealist literature’s mischievous experimental mood.\nIn her autobiography, she talks about writing as a form of exhibitionism more brutal than painting. However, there is no sight of apparent brutality in her writing. In reality, her poetry keeps the elegance and the mystique of her painting while expressing her incurable loneliness and boredom. The brutality she experiences in writing is rather an inert process of investigating her constant feeling of impotence (possibly because of her gender) or even a slight —or strong— guiltiness towards Tanguy’s end; something we could guess through her self-identification with the blackbird as a symbol of death.\nThe most frequent motif in her work is the egg. Its symbolic meanings are apparent considering her problems with solitude, estrangement, and captivity in a world that she did not understand. Her egg-self exists with the precious but fragile shell, showing a prison of life and creativity that can hatch or be disparaged by predators. Feeling constantly like a stranger in her environment, which was odd for such a cosmopolitan woman, Kay Sage named her autobiography China Egg.\nThe Tragic End of Key Sage’s Life\nDuring the last years of her life, she almost lost her vision entirely and couldn’t paint anymore. She decided to commit suicide, and this was her second attempt. This time, she wouldn’t permit herself to fail. On January 8, 1963, she shot herself in the heart.\nIn her suicide note, she wrote: “The first painting by Yves that I saw before I knew him, was called ‘I’m Waiting for You.’ I’ve come. Now he’s waiting for me again – I’m on my way.”","Baroque is an art style that flourished in Europe between 1600 and 1750. It originated in Italy during the Counter-Reformation period and developed in most parts of Europe that believe in Catholicism. Later, with the spread of Catholicism, its influence went far to Latin American and Asian countries. As an artistic style with far-reaching influence in time and space, the rise of Baroque was closely related to the religion of that time. Not only in painting, Baroque is represented in the whole field of art, including music, architecture, and decorative arts, and its connotations are also very complex. The most fundamental characteristic of Baroque is to break the seriousness, subtlety, and balance of the Renaissance period, advocating luxury and grandeur and focusing on expressing strong emotions. Baroque artworks are warm and tense, with a piercing and exciting artistic effect.\nOrigin and Influence\nIn the seventeenth century, Europe expanded, plundered overseas colonies to accumulate wealth, and advocated luxurious enjoyment in life. Hence, architecture, music, and art also required luxury and vividness, rich in a passionate mood. The word \"baroque\" is derived from the Spanish and Portuguese word for \"deformed pearl\" (Barroso). As an adjective, it means \"vulgar and messy.\" Europeans used the word to refer to \"works lacking the balanced character of classicism.\" It was initially a derogatory term for people who advocated classical art in the 18th century and was different from the Renaissance style in the 17th century. Today, the word has lost its derogatory implication. Baroque emerged in Italy in the second half of the 16th century, reached its heyday in the 17th century, and gradually declined in the 18th century. Baroque positively influenced Rococo in the 18th century and Romanticism in the 19th century. The Baroque style was strongly supported by the Church and was mainly popular in Italy, Flanders, Spain, and other countries where Catholicism was prevalent. The works of Italian master Bernini and Flemish painter Rubens reflect the most brilliant achievements of Baroque art in the 17th century.\nCharacteristics of Baroque\n1. Luxury and Opulence\nBaroque architecture combines art and color boldly and uses various precious materials. Baroque buildings are glorious, luxurious, and beautiful, have a strong artistic atmosphere, and are breathtaking.\nBaroque architecture is gorgeous in appearance and ingenious and unique in design. Designers used a lot of curved surfaces, breaking the dignified and rigorous approach of conventional buildings.\n3. Rich Imagination\nBaroque broke the rational tranquil harmony. It had a strong romantic color and emphasized the artist's rich imagination.\n4. Close to Nature\nIn the late Baroque era, more architects tended to incorporate natural elements. They built a lot of villas, gardens, and many city squares. The buildings became more spacious, and the use of natural elements increased. The buildings were more inclined to pursue the harmony between man and nature.\n5. Space and Perspective\nBaroque paid much attention to the sense of space and three-dimensionality of works.\nReligious themes occupy a dominant position in Baroque art.\n7. Away from Life and Times\nMost Baroque artists tended to stay away from life and times. For example, in some zenith paintings, the figures are insignificant, like some patterns.\nBaroque paintings are magnificent, full of movement, and have great perspective variation (such as foreshortening), dramatic composition, and contrast of ideal light. Dramatic and stage-like are characteristics of Baroque paintings.\nCaravaggio (1573-1610), a pioneer of Baroque painting, is characterized by his use of light to obtain a dramatic effect on the painting, as well as the use of chiaroscuro to set off a real sense of space, and abandoned the depiction of details. His approach to nature was intuitive, using brutish or unsophisticated people as models for his portraits. He took a different approach to still life painting. His masterpieces include The Supper at Emmaus, The Entombment of Christ, Basket of Fruit, and Bacchus. Wild, irascible, irritable, and short-lived, Caravaggio wanted to break away from stereotypes and rethink art and was stylistically known as a \"naturalist.\"\nCarracci (1560-1609), an Italian painter of the Baroque style, diligently practiced classical beauty. His masterpiece includes the altarpiece, The Dead Christ Mourned, in which the light shines on the Christ, and the overall technique of arousing the viewer's emotion, which is of Baroque style. The composition is simple and harmonious, somewhat sentimental, but avoids reminding people of the horrors of death and the pain of suffering."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:71db30bb-c67c-4a92-b776-6b58e0702cf0>","<urn:uuid:f5198023-ae62-4faa-b0ac-904f30736f87>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are restrictions for using deadly force to protect property under self-defense laws in Florida and Texas?","answer":"In Florida, deadly force can only be used if a person reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent imminent death, serious bodily harm, or a forcible felony. In Texas, the law is more specific about property protection - deadly force can be legally used to protect property if: it's necessary to prevent trespass or interference with property; it's reasonably necessary to prevent specific crimes like arson, burglary, robbery, or theft at night; and the person reasonably believes the property cannot be protected by other means or that using non-deadly force would expose them to substantial risk of death or serious injury. However, both states emphasize that legal justification for using deadly force doesn't guarantee immunity from arrest or prosecution.","context":["What are “Stand Your Ground” Laws?\nThe shooting of Trayvon Martin has focused attention on so-called “Stand Your Ground” laws, which strengthen the right to self defense. Get Legal Lad’s expert take on the significance of such laws, and how they might be used by George Zimmerman, the defendant in the Martin case.\nToday’s topic: “Stand Your Ground” Laws\nAnd now, your daily dose of legalese: This article does not create an attorney-client relationship with any reader. In other words, although I am a lawyer, I’m not your lawyer. In fact, we barely know each other. If you need personalized legal advice, contact an attorney in your community.!\nThe Trayvon Martin Case\nOn February 26, 2012, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was fatally shot in Sanford, Florida by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch coordinator for his community. Zimmerman has been charged with second-degree murder. Much of the reporting about the incident has focused on Florida’s so-called “Stand Your Ground” law, which reinforces the right to self-defense, leading some to the conclusion that this law is a license for vigilante justice.\nQuick and Dirty Tip: In reality, “Stand Your Ground” is merely one aspect of the right to self-defense, and does not permit unprovoked attacks.\nDisputed Facts About the Martin Case\nThe key facts about the Trayvon Martin case are disputed. Mr. Zimmerman claims that Martin attacked him, and that he (Zimmerman) acted in self-defense. According to reports, police records show that Zimmerman was injured, including a broken nose, when police arrived at the scene. If that’s true, it suggests that there was a fight, but it doesn’t tell us who the initial aggressor was. That could be key to the issue of self-defense.\nWhat is the Law of Self-Defense?\nSelf-defense is a doctrine that allows a person to avoid conviction for a violent crime, if he can establish that he acted to defend himself or another person. In Florida, as in most other states, the doctrine can be used to justify the use of deadly force by a person who (1) reasonably believes that such lethal force is necessary (2) to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm to himself or another person, or to prevent a “forcible felony” (such as rape or kidnapping).\nWhat is the Duty to Retreat?\nThe right to use deadly force is pretty much universally available when people are defending themselves in the home. This is an old common law right, popularly known as the “castle doctrine” after the old saying that “a man’s home is his castle.” And a woman’s home, too, of course. But outside the home, the common law had a different rule known as the “duty to retreat.” Under this rule, a person being attacked is under a duty, essentially, to run for his life if he can do so in safety. In such situations, a person could assert the right to self-defense only if he could show that he could not escape.\n“Stand Your Ground” Laws\nFlorida and other older American states generally adopted the duty to retreat from English common law. But the rule lost popularity during the 19th century. Western states generally followed the “true man” doctrine, so called because “true men” don’t flee in the face of danger. This rule was the forerunner of the “Stand Your Ground” laws, which remove any duty to retreat as a pre-condition to using deadly force. According to some commentators, such laws have had limited effect, because the “duty to retreat” does not often come into play. In order to be under a duty to retreat, you have to be able to retreat in complete safety – and if your assailant has a gun, how can you know whether you can escape?\nThe key point, however, is that “Stand Your Ground” laws do not change the other requirements for self-defense. To go back to the Trayvon Martin case, George Zimmerman won’t have to justify his failure to retreat, but he will still have to show that he reasonably believed that Trayvon Martin was about to kill him or cause serious injury and that deadly force was necessary to stop him. Self-defense will almost certainly not work if Mr. Zimmerman was the initial aggressor – a question that has been raised by reports that a 911 dispatcher advised Zimmerman not to pursue Martin. If that’s true, then jurors will have to examine whether Zimmerman voluntarily chose to ignore the dispatcher’s advice and pursued Martin.\nThe Controversy over Zimmerman’s Murder Charge\nInitially, Florida prosecutors did not charge Zimmerman with any crime. However, a special prosecutor appointed by Florida’s governor has now charged Zimmerman with second-degree murder. Many commentators, including Harvard Law School’s Alan Dershowitz, have criticized this as disproportionate. Under Florida law, second degree murder requires that the killer acted with a “depraved mind” motivated by “ill will, spite, malice or hatred.” Even if Zimmerman fails to establish self-defense, the prosecution might have a difficult time proving beyond a reasonable doubt that he acted with a “depraved mind.”\nWhat do you think?\nThank you for reading Legal Lad’s Quick and Dirty Tips for a More Lawful Life.\nYou can send questions and comments to email@example.com.

A mere criminal trespass may, however, evolve into one of the above crimes where you may be justified in using deadly force to protect your property. For example, suppose that someone decides to sit on your lawn, and you yell at them to get them off your property. If the trespasser refuses to leave, you are almost certainly not justified in using deadly force to remove him. But if that same person sitting on your lawn gets up and charges towards your bedroom window with a firearm and a crow bar, you will very likely be legally justified in using deadly force to protect yourself and your home. His actions of charging you with a weapon make him more than just a trespasser under Texas law.\nCriminal Prosecution Even If You Were Justified.\nJust because Texas law affords you a legal justification for using deadly force when someone attacks you, or enters or removes you from your occupied habitation, vehicle, or workplace, this does not mean you are immune from being arrested or criminally prosecuted, even if you are completely in-the-right as far as the law is concerned. Your right to assert legal justifications is just that: a legal justification. It is not a “Get Out of Jail Free” card. In fact, always remember that there is a high possibility that you will have to go to jail and post bond long before the issue of justification is considered by the prosecutor. We see cases like this unfolding in Texas and other states on a regular basis. You may ultimately have to go to court and assert your justification defense before a judge or jury. This process may take months or even years to get resolved!\nDoes Texas Have a Stand Your Ground Law?\nThe phrase \"Stand Your Ground,” despite its common use in the media, is not found in Texas statutory law. Under certain circumstances, Texas law tells us that there is no duty to retreat if you are faced with a situation where you have to use force or deadly force to protect yourself or another. Even if by retreating you could avoid the entire confrontation, you do not legally have to. Texas Penal Code §9.31(e) and §9.32(c) state that in defending yourself or another person, you have no duty to retreat if: (1) you have a legal right to be at the location where force or deadly force is used, (2) you do not provoke the person against whom force or deadly force was used, (3) and you are not engaged in criminal activity at the time force or deadly force was used. These statutes are better considered \"No Duty to Retreat\" laws. Under these very limited circumstances, a prosecutor or law enforcement officer cannot argue that you had a reasonable \"escape route,\" or that you should have had to \"fall back\" before justifiably using force or deadly force. If you are facing a criminal charge, qualifying under this statute could mean the difference between a conviction or not!\nIn order to receive the \"No Duty to Retreat\" protection under the statutes, first, you must be justified under the Texas Penal Code in using force or deadly force. As we discussed above, Texas Penal Code §9.31 and §9.32 state that you will be presumed to be legally justified in using force or deadly force if someone is entering, attempting to enter, removing you or attempting to remove you from your occupied habitation, vehicle, or workplace. You will also be presumed to be justified in using force or deadly force if someone commits or attempts to commit: aggravated kidnapping, murder, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated robbery. Force or deadly force can be used to stop any of these crimes, as well as when it may be immediately necessary to protect yourself or another person from the attacker's use of deadly force. If you are at a place you have a legal right to be, only then does the use of force or deadly force with no duty to retreat apply under the statute. To paraphrase a very effective jury argument, the statutes are designed to protect you when \"trouble finds you, but not when you go looking for trouble.\"\nDisqualifications for No Retreat Protection\nThere are multiple situations where your conduct may potentially disqualify you from the Texas \"No Duty to Retreat\" provision. In order to receive Texas Penal Code §9.31(e) and §9.32(c) \"No Duty to Retreat\" protection, you must first be justified in using force under Texas Penal Code §9.31. Second, the No Retreat statute themselves have three more qualifications that must be met before you gain the statutes’ protection.\nDisqualifying Under Texas Penal Code §9.31\nIf you want to protect yourself or another person, there are multiple situations under Texas Penal Code §9.31 where you will not be justified in using force or deadly force. If you fall under one of the following situations, you will not be given the \"No Duty to Retreat\" protection:\nThe use of force is not justified in response to verbal provocation alone. (If someone is only yelling at you, you are not justified in using force against them).\nYou will not be justified in using force to resist an arrest or search being made by a police officer (unless the officer uses greater than reasonable force), even if the arrest or search is ultimately proven to be unlawful.\nThe use of force against another is not justified if you consent to the force. (No dueling or consenting to gun fights).\nYou provoked the use of force, unless you have clearly abandoned the encounter.\nIf you seek a discussion with another person regarding your differences while unlawfully carrying a weapon, you will not be given the “No Duty to Retreat” protection. Unlawful carry of a weapon includes:\na non-CHL holder carrying in places other than their premises, place of business, vehicle or watercraft;\nhaving a handgun in plain view;\nengaging in criminal activity while carrying a weapon,\ncarrying a weapon by a person who is a member of a criminal street gang; or,\nCarrying a prohibited weapon.\nQualifying Under the No Duty to Retreat Statute\nAs we discussed earlier, the first thing that must be satisfied to receive the “No Duty to Retreat” Protection is that the person must have had a legal right to be in the location where deadly force was used. What does the law mean when it says that you must “be in a location where you have a legal right to be?” The best way to clarify this is to discuss places where you do not have a legal right to be. Any location where you would be considered a trespasser is, by definition, a place where you do not have a legal right to be. Under Texas Penal Code §30.05, a person becomes a criminal trespasser if they enter or remain on property without effective consent, or the person had notice that entry was forbidden or received notice to depart but failed to do so. Notice of trespassing includes: oral or written communication, fencing, signs posted on the property indicating that entry is forbidden, purple paint marks on trees or posts on the property, or crops for human consumption growing on the property. As long as you are in a place where you are not considered a trespasser by the law, you most likely have a legal right to be there under the “No Duty to Retreat” statutes.\nIn addition to the location test, you cannot have provoked the other's use or attempted use of force. You cannot start a fight and then claim justification for your use of force or deadly force. There is, however, an exception to this rule. If you abandon the encounter or clearly communicate your intent to abandon, and you cannot do so safely, and the other continues to use unlawful force against you, you do not have a duty to retreat.\nA very similar scenario played out in a district court in Harris County. An individual was convicted of murdering his neighbor during a conflict that started as a result of a noise complaint. The accused individual videotaped the entire confrontation. The last few minutes of the video seem to show that the man was justified in discharging his firearm after three men charged him. However, prior to the last few minutes, approximately twenty minutes of the video showed the accused leaving his property with his handgun, trespassing on his neighbor's property, and taunting the neighbors by flashing his pistol. As a result of these actions the man did not qualify under the \"No Duty to Retreat\" statutes. In fact, the prosecutor in the case told the jury that \"self-defense was never meant to protect the one that started the fight.\" The jury only deliberated for 90 minutes before returning a verdict of guilty on a murder charge and ultimately sentenced him to 40 years in prison.\nFinally, you cannot be engaged in any criminal activity, other than a Class C misdemeanor traffic offense at the time deadly force was used and claim self-defense.\nAs you can see, the Texas versions of the Castle Doctrine and Stand Your Ground laws are extremely complex and cannot be summarized with a simple catch phrase. These topics consume thousands of pages of legal treatises, so this article is only a brief overview of the intricacies that are involved with these topics."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b723446f-ae02-4a98-b703-f408d6ebcbbf>","<urn:uuid:d2fb2fdc-28e7-4d15-8202-7edbd4b650f5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Looking to understand technological evolution: What similarities exist between how Casambi implements over-the-air firmware updates in lighting systems and how Kulkarni's cache management handles memory updates in computing systems?","answer":"Both systems implement dynamic update mechanisms but with different approaches. Casambi's Evolution firmware package allows updates to be deployed over the air to existing devices, similar to how mobile phones are updated, enabling continuous improvement of their Bluetooth-based lighting control system. Kulkarni's cache management system similarly enables dynamic updates but at the memory level, using EPT and ECT counters to make real-time decisions about when to update cache contents through pre-fetch and write-back operations. Both systems aim to improve performance through efficient resource management - Casambi by updating device firmware remotely, and Kulkarni by optimizing cache memory updates based on counter thresholds and usage patterns.","context":["Casambi has announced its Evolution firmware package — an upgrade to its Bluetooth-based software stack designed for smart solid-state lighting (SSL)applications and deployable as an update over the air to many existing Casambi devices. Smart-city-focused startup Juganu has announced a $23 million venture funding round led by Viola Growth intended to accelerate R&D and expand its marketing efforts. Zumtobel has announced an LED-lighting project at the Elisabeth Herzberge Hospital (Evangelisches Krankenhaus Königin Elisabeth Herzberge or, for short, KEH) in Berlin, Germany with networked controls applied throughout a new section of the facility.\nUpgradeable Bluetooth stack\nThe Casambi announcement of Evolution was mostly about a moderately evolved feature set in the wireless specialist’s firmware offering for Casambi Ready devices based on Nordic Semiconductor nRF52 ICs that integrate a microcontroller, Bluetooth Low Energy functionality, and more. The new firmware adds pulsewidth modulation (PWM) channels, an enhanced security model, support for 250 devices on a network up from 127, and more. But the bigger news will be the rollout of the update over the air in a manner similar to how our mobile phones are updated — an operational feature long touted by Bluetooth proponents.\nThe Casambi implementation is a mesh network, although the company doesn’t describe it as Bluetooth Mesh. It is based on the Bluetooth Low Energy radio specification that underlies Bluetooth Mesh. But as a Casambi spokesperson explained to us at LightFair International, the heritage of the technology preceded Bluetooth Mesh. Casambi will likely evolve (pun intended) the firmware toward the Bluetooth Mesh standard over time. Still, the company hasn’t used the Bluetooth Mesh moniker. Meanwhile, other companies selling products that are partially compatible with the standard regularly claim compatibility even as portions of their stack remain partially proprietary.\nAround the same time that Evolution debuted, Casambi and partner Tridonic announced an extension to their partnership in which Tridonic makes it simple for a luminaire manufacturer to develop Casambi-based smart SSL products. Tridonic offers LED drivers with integrated Casambi support under the basicDIM brand and also offers dedicated basicDIM modules that can be combined with other drivers.\n“In the last couple of years, Casambi’s wireless lighting control technology based on Bluetooth Low Energy has become established as a leading platform for innovative controls,” said Bert Tuyt, senior director global systems at Tridonic. “Pairing Casambi’s technology with our long-standing expertise in the development of lighting components has resulted in a flexible and versatile new system that benefits every player in the lighting industry. Close cooperation in the development and testing phases between our companies has proven extremely fertile and we are proud to now market the new system.”\nTridonic, of course, has multiple options for smart SSL and Internet of Things (IoT) support. The basicDIM brand name would imply that the company considers that scheme a more entry-level approach to networked controls. Meanwhile, the company had internally developed the net4more technology and IoT platform that it introduced some two years back. That network scheme works over wired and wireless links and is based on IP (Internet Protocol) to the end node.\nMoving to the venture funding news, Juganu has pursued a platform that it calls Digital World that can enable smart city applications and can also be utilized in large commercial facilities. In addition to Viola Growth, a Mexican investment firm called OurCrowd invested in the latest round. Juganu was founded in 2011 and holds more than 40 patents in the connected lighting space.\nJuganu has gained some notoriety based on a partnership with wireless giant Qualcomm. Juganu has utilized a number of Qualcomm ICs to enable applications such as facial recognition, license plate recognition, parking management, and tracking of hazardous environmental conditions. The company may even deploy small-cell 5G networks, a technology that Signify is dabbling in with Ericsson.\n“Juganu is a combination of brilliant entrepreneurs, breakthrough technology, and vision, reinventing lighting and communications infrastructures and those for applications, affecting any organization, from tech corporations and retail chains to local authorities,” said Viola Growth general partner Ayal Shiran. “The company has a unique technology with the potential to expand into other industries. The latest financing round will allow it to speed up its R&D while also expanding marketing and sales operations in Israel and overseas.\"\nZumtobel hospital project\nOn to a connected lighting project, Zumtobel is supporting a variety of smart SSL scenarios in the KEH Hospital project. For example, corridor lighting can be easily turned full on for cleaning. At other times, light levels can be set by personnel or based programmatically on occupancy. In exam rooms, doctors can simply engage the proper setting or scene that allows optimal visibility.\nThe project uses a variety of Zumtobel SSL products including Slotlight and medical-centric Light Fields luminaires (shown in the photo above). The system relies on Litecom controls. In public areas, decorative Sequence and Ondaria luminaires add style to the functional lighting.","Patent application title: Apparatus and Method for Dynamic Cache Management\nMilind Manohar Kulkarni (Sunnyvale, CA, US)\nNarendranath Udupa (Karnata Ka, IN)\nIPC8 Class: AG06F1200FI\nClass name: Hierarchical memories caching instruction data cache\nPublication date: 2008-11-06\nPatent application number: 20080276045\nPatent application title: Apparatus and Method for Dynamic Cache Management\nMilind Manohar Kulkarni\nNXP, B.V.;NXP INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEPARTMENT\nOrigin: SAN JOSE, CA US\nIPC8 Class: AG06F1200FI\nThe apparatus of the present invention improves performance of computing\nsystems by enabling a multi-core or multi-processor system to\ndeterministically identify cache memory (100) blocks that are ripe for\nvictimization and also prevent victimization of memory blocks that will\nbe needed in the immediate future.

A system for processing streams of data, comprising: a means for processing data including multiple processors, the processors have a schedule of tasks; at least one level of cache memory in shared communication with the processors for receiving instructions from the processor and for communicating lines of data to the processor in response to the instructions; an estimated production time (EPT) counter in communication with the cache memory for estimating production times for particular lines of data; an estimated consumption time (ECT) counter in communication with the cache memory for estimating consumption times for particular lines of data; and the EPT counter and the ECT counter has a maximum threshold value so that when the maximum threshold value is reached then the counter enables victimization of the particular cache memory lines, the maximum threshold value being statically based on the schedule of tasks for the processors.\nThis invention relates to data processing systems, and particularly\nto multiprocessor systems having optimized cache management.\nAdvances in computer hardware and software technologies have resulted in multi-processor computer systems capable of performing highly complex parallel processing by logically partitioning the system resources to different tasks. The processors may reside on one or more processor modules typically having at least two levels of caches.\nCaches are typically accessed much faster than main memory. Typically caches are located on the processor module, or within the processors. Caches act as buffers to retain recently used instructions and data to reduce the latencies involved with retrieving the instructions and data from main memory every time the instructions and data are needed.\nSome caches retain the most frequently used memory lines from main memory. A memory line is the minimum readable unit of data from the main memory such as eight bytes and a cache line is the corresponding unit in cache. Cache lines store memory lines so the memory lines do not have to be retrieved from the relatively slow main memory each time the memory lines are used.\nTypically only the memory lines that are most often used will be stored in the cache because the relatively fast and expensive cache is generally smaller than main memory. Accordingly, cache memory does not normally store all the data required for a processing transactions. This is generally accomplished by tracking the least recently used entries, or cache lines, and replacing the least recently used cache lines with memory lines associated with recent cache requests that cannot be satisfied by the current contents of the cache. Cache requests that can't be satisfied because the cache lines have been shifted to main memory are often called cache misses because the processor sent the request to the cache and missed an opportunity to retrieve the contents of the memory lines from the cache.\nProcessors typically include a level one (L1) cache to retain copies of oft-used memory lines such as instructions that would otherwise be frequently accessed from a relatively slower main memory. The L1 cache can reduce latencies of potentially thousands of cycles for accessing main memory to a few cycles incurred while accessing the cache. However, L1 cache is generally small because area used within the processor is limited in capacity.\nA level two (L2) cache often resides on the processor module, physically close to the processor, offering significantly reduced latencies with respect to access of main memory. L2 cache may be larger than the L1 cache since it is less costly to manufacturer and may be configured to maintain, e.g., a larger number of the recently used memory lines.\nThe L2 cache may be implemented as a large, shared cache for more than one of the processors in the processor module or as separate, private caches, for each of the processors in the module. A large, shared L2 cache is beneficial for workload demands on processors that involve accesses to a large number of memory lines. For example, when a processor is accessing a large database, a large number of memory lines may be repeatedly accessed. However, if the L2 cache is not sufficiently large to hold that large number of repeatedly accessed memory lines or blocks, the memory lines accessed first may be overwritten (i.e. victimized) and the processor may have to request those blocks from main memory again.\nThe streaming application models such as YAPI and TSSA consist of tasks communicating through FIFOs. Typically, to reduce the latency of access to the data, the FIFOs are cached. However, sometimes if the average FIFO cache requirements are larger than a single cache can handle resulting in a cache mismatch. This mismatch between the actual cache size and desired cache size leads to victimization of other memory blocks residing in cache in favor of using those memory blocks for a particular FIFO.\nFor example, in some instances it is possible that a memory block, which will be needed immediately, will be erroneously selected for victimizing resulting in additional, unnecessary data transmission. Another possibility is that a block, which will definitely be not used in the near future and thus is a suitable candidate for victimization, will not be victimized. Therefore, a deterministic method is desired, for indicating which memory block is going to be used for either writing or reading in the immediate near future.\nSome systems have been devised that include FIFO registers having an input counting unit and an output counting unit that communicate with a task scheduler. One particular FIFO register type has counters that count expected production time (EPT) for data to be communicated in the FIFO register and expected consumption times (ECT) for data to be communicated in the FIFO register. Such counters can be utilized to minimize inefficient victimization of memory blocks.\nThe apparatus of the present invention improves performance of computing systems by enabling a multi-core or multi-processor system to deterministically identify cache memory blocks that are ripe for victimization and also prevent victimization of memory blocks that will be needed in the immediate future. To achieve these goals, the system makes use of a FIFO having schedule information available in the form of EPT and ECT counters.\nThe above summary of the present invention is not intended to represent each disclosed embodiment, or every aspect, of the present invention. Other aspects, details and example embodiments are provided in the drawing and the detailed description that follows.\nThe invention may be more completely understood in consideration of the following detailed description of various embodiments of the invention in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which:\nFIG. 1 shows a FIFO buffer and expected production time (EPT) and expected consumption time (ECT) counters.\nWhile the invention is amenable to various modifications and alternative forms, specifics thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the intention is not to limit the invention to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.\nFIG. 1 shows a cache 100 including and EPT counter 102 and ECT counter 104. The cache 100 includes five FIFOs occupying a portion of the cache 100. Each FIFO handles data. The cache 100 can be a single level of memory in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. According to another embodiment the cache 100 has multiple levels. A further aspect of the invention includes cache 100, which is shared with multiple processors, or a single processor with multiple processor cores.\nThe data typically will take the form of work requests from a processor or controller. The work requests are normally organized in a queue or stack. Each queue or stack of work requests are fed to a FIFO and stored (usually temporarily) in a first-in, first-out sequence for further processing. It can be appreciated that although the invention is described in terms of utilizing EPT and ECT counters in a FIFO, the invention can also utilize these counters in conjunction with an LIFO, which handles work requests from a queue or stack in reverse order. Accordingly, The EPT and ECT counters indicate the time (or cycles) left for the possible production or consumption of data in the respective FIFOs.\nThe EPT counter 102 and ECT 104 counter are associated with any particular FIFO. The EPT counter 102 and ECT counter 104 can be either enabled or disabled.\nThere are three possibilities that are described as follows: The first possibility is where both EPT 102 and ECT 104 counters of a particular FIFO are disabled, which means that they will not influence any cache related operation of the FIFO they are representing. The second is where either the EPT 102 or ECT 104 counter can be disabled and the other enabled. The third possibility is where both are enabled. There are consequences of each of these three possibilities.\nWhile there are three operational possibilities for these counters at any given time, it can be appreciated that the status (enablement or disablement) of either the EPT or ECT counter can change over time too. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the status of the EPT or ECT counter be pre-determined. Particularly, either can be enabled or disabled. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the status of either the EPT or ECT counter, or both, can be responsive to the occurrence or non-occurrence of a particularly defined event. In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, the status of either the EPT or ECT counter, or both, can be selective, depending on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a particularly defined event, and the current system load. In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, the status of either the EPT or ECT counter, or both, can be selective, depending on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a particularly defined event, and anticipated system load. Anticipated system load can predicted using predictive analytics, or estimated.\nWhen the EPT and ECT counters are enabled, they each make decisions about pre-fetching the data and writing back data from the cache to the lower memory levels based on pre-determined decision-making criteria. The pre-fetch decisions made by the EPT are independent of the decisions made by the ECT. Accordingly, while same data may be employed in this decision making process, the outcome of the EPT decision will not influence the ECT counter decision-making in accordance with one aspect of the invention.\nA particular FIFO can have EPT and ECT with minimum values, wherein data corresponding to that FIFO has a miminal chance of being modified before the data is utilized. Alternatively, the FIFO can have EPT and ECT counter with maximum values, wherein data corresponding to that FIFO would have a significant probability of changing before the date is utilized. It can be appreciated that usefulness of the counters varies, decreasing as the counter values increase until the situation occurs that the counters have maximum values that would be virtually meaningless. Accordingly, the EPT and ECT counters would be disabled in accordance with the present invention when the counter values reach a maximum threshold.\nThe maximum counter threshold is an indication of how much space can be reserved for processing. According to one aspect of the invention, the counter threshold is pre-determined. According to another aspect of the invention, the counter threshold varies depending on the nature of a particular processor transactions and is statically based on a schedule of tasks for various processors. According to yet another aspect of the invention, the counter threshold is dynamic, varying with a pre-determined throughput optimization scheme.\nWhere the EPT and ECT data is near the maximum threshold value corresponding to that FIFO, there is a strong probability that the data is not going to be altered in the near future and hence the cache lines occupied by this FIFO can be removed. Therefore, write-back operation for writing back any modified data corresponding to this FIFO is initiated. Simply stated, the data stored in a particular FIFO is queued for victimization when the EPT and ECT counters reach the maximum threshold value.\nIf the EPT counter has maximum value and is disabled and ECT counter has a small value, it indicates that probably the producer has produced enough data and is scheduled out. The consumer of the data is scheduled on one of the processors and starts consuming the data. If the data for the FIFO is not already cached, then based on the sampled values of ECT counter, appropriate pre-fetch operations are initiated automatically and data corresponding to this FIFO is brought in the cache. The rate of the pre-fetch of the data depends on the processing step and the highest meaningful value of the ECT counter. Accordingly, cache resources are optimized.\nIf the EPT counter has a smaller value and ECT has maximum value and is disabled. In this case, only the producer is scheduled and consumer is not yet scheduled to run. Therefore, the consumer will not use the data being produced by the producer in the near future. In this case, cache can be operated as a write-back buffer. Appropriate write-back instructions are used to write-back the data being produced by the producer. The rate of the write-back instructions is based on the threshold EPT counter value.\nIf both EPT and ECT has smaller values and are enabled, then this is the scenario wherein the FIFO's average filling can be small as the data being produced is consumed by the consumer. However, again appropriate pre-fetch and write-back instructions can be used to limit the data in the FIFO if there is huge difference between the processing steps of producer and consumers again based on the meaningful threshold values of EPT and ECT counters.\nWhile the present invention has been described with reference to several particular example embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that many changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, which is set forth in the following claims.\nPatent applications by Milind Manohar Kulkarni, Sunnyvale, CA US\nPatent applications by NXP B.V.\nPatent applications in class Instruction data cache\nPatent applications in all subclasses Instruction data cache"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:aa5bfde7-bf9b-4494-9d0d-b9f558af6186>","<urn:uuid:7319f892-6601-482c-b6db-9c74c66a3551>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the main differences between community-supported and conventional agriculture in terms of consumer involvement and sustainability practices? Please list the key distinctions.","answer":"In community-supported agriculture, consumers actively participate by purchasing seasonal shares upfront, working on farms, helping with deliveries, and sharing both risks and benefits with farmers. They attend farm events and commit to supporting local agriculture. The system emphasizes direct farmer-consumer relationships and local food distribution. Regarding sustainability, CSA farms typically use organic methods, avoiding artificial pesticides and fertilizers. In contrast, conventional agriculture operates as a standard goods-for-pay system with minimal consumer involvement. It relies heavily on artificial fertilizers and pesticides, which can remain in the environment for up to 1,000 days and harm beneficial insects like bees. Conventional farming often ignores long-term soil health, leading to degradation on up to 20% of global cropland, while CSA farms typically emphasize soil preservation through natural methods like crop rotation and composting.","context":["Umbra on community-supported agriculture\nPlease illuminate CSAs for us, how they work, and how your readers can join one. Thanks! (And by the way, that photo of a peach in your recent column is an apricot.)\nSanta Fe, N.M.\nAlas for stone-fruit misidentification. Hopefully corrected by the time this question hits the screen, but still. A fruit ignorance that community-supported agriculture might solve, if one lived where apricots and peaches grew.\nCourtesy of MACSAC\nCSA is a way to get the freshest food, grown right near where you live or work, and to support small-scale farmers. In its traditional forms, CSA is a seasonal marriage in which eaters join with growers in the risks and benefits of farming.\nThere are a variety of ways to structure a CSA farm. The basics are: a farmer advertises for consumers to purchase a share of the season’s harvest and become members. Members pay a lump sum at the start of the season for weekly boxes of mixed produce, which they pick up on the farm or at a drop spot. The farmer benefits by having operating capital to start the season, the members benefit from getting the freshest possible produce, usually picked the same day. The box is roughly the same size per week, often enough for a family of four, or two vegetarian adults, and a season might cost $300 to $700. There are both summer and winter CSAs.\nOften members participate in non-financial ways as well, perhaps by working on the farm for part of their membership (this is how one might learn to identify an apricot in situ), or harvesting their own strawberries, or picking up all the shares at the farm and delivering them to an in-town drop spot. Members share in bumper crops and in crop failure (sickness and health), visit the farm for parties, and puzzle over unusual vegetables. Permutations include CSA for meat, eggs, flowers, and other crops; winter memberships; eaters who band together and seek out a farmer instead of vice versa; and sliding-scale memberships. Read an excellent longer, detailed description of the history and social implications at the National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service site.\nSometimes CSA is conflated with produce delivery services, but its cooperative aspects distinguish it from a simple goods-for-pay system. The point is to make a commitment to a local farm and a difference within the larger economic and social trends. It is community-supported agriculture, and there are many amazing stories about what a community will do to support a farmer, such as create a nonprofit organization and buy the farmland to save it from development so “their” farmer can keep on farming. Oh, it brings tears to my eyes.\nI think CSA works for folks who cook at home, like vegetables, aren’t picky eaters, and get jazzed about involvement in keeping small farms afloat. If you think that is you, dearest reader, by all means look into it. You can look now, especially if fall and winter vegetables exist in your area, or next spring — we’ll remind you.\nIf you regularly go to a farmers’ market, ask there which farms also do a CSA, and pick up their brochures.

Try them all and marvel at the hidden world around you.\nAsk a Question.\nReaders can upvote a question; Umbra answers it!","Organic food is a big growth area for consumer demand. Once thought to be the preserve of the wealthy or eco-eccentrics, organic food is going mainstream with many people from across the spectrum wishing to purchase organic food.\nOrganic farming avoids the use of artificial fertilisers and pesticides but relies on more traditional methods of fertilisation and pest control, such as crop rotation, barrier nets and natural pest control.\nDespite the demand for organic food growing strongly, In the US only 0.7% of farms are organic (2012 census). It means that for organic food, the US (and UK) are reliant on food imports.\nThis increase in demand greater than supply is helping organic food to be more profitable.\nAdvantages of organic farming\nMinimises the external cost of farming. The use of artificial pesticides and fertilisers can have side effects to the local environment. For example, there are concerns about a decline in the bee population, due to the increased use of toxic pesticides.\n“America’s agricultural landscape is now 48 times more toxic to honeybees, and likely other insects, than it was 25 years ago, almost entirely due to widespread use of so-called neonicotinoid pesticides”(6 Aug, 2019, Nat. Geographic)\nBees are vital to the well-being of the planet’s ecosystem. Organic farming helps bees and insects by not using pesticides and providing more pollen from land which isn’t kept as monoculture. The neotoxins currently used can stay in the environment for 1,000 days and are proving very damaging to insect population.\nEfficient use of resources. A principle of organic farming is to recycle resources. Rather than importing chemical fertilisers from abroad, organic farming seek to improve the soil through crop rotation, the use of animal manure, compost and natural byproducts.\nSoil and the environment is a public good. There is concern that conventional farming methods are steadily eroding the quality of soil. The soil is never rotated or given a chance to re-incorporate organic matter. As a result, farmers become more reliant on fertilisers and ever-heavier mechanical rotation to provide nutrition. A lack of organic matter also makes the soil more prone to drought. Conventional farming ignores the long-term impact on soil quality and is storing problems for future generations. Organic farming provides a long-term solution to soil management. It is estimated a third of the world’s global soil is now degraded.\nThe JRC noted that decreasing productivity can be observed on 20% of the world’s cropland, 16% of forest land, 19% of grassland, and 27% of rangeland.\n“Industrial agriculture is good at feeding populations but it is not sustainable. It’s like an extractive industry, said Louise Baker, external relations head of the UN body.Guardian Sep 2017\nHealthier food. Organic food grown in richer more organic soils has higher levels of micronutrients.\nHigher levels of total protein and higher levels of 8 out of 13 essential minerals analyzed—including magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, and potassium—than conventional oats\nA study claimed the yield was up to 40% more in times of droughtRodaleinstitute, 2018\nAlso, there is a link between some chemicals and increased cancer risk for humans. Long-term exposure to chemicals, such as ‘Roundup weedkiller’ show a link to increased cancer risk. Organic veg reduces the long-term risk of repeated exposure to these chemicals. (WHO – glyphosate probably cancerous to humans)\nHealthier animals. In conventional farming, animals are often kept in close proximity and fed antibiotics as a matter of course. This mass-use of antibiotics is contributing to increased resistance. In organic farming, antibiotics are only allowed if animals are sick.\nPotential profits. Currently, the demand for organic food is growing faster than supply. Countries like the UK and US have to import organic food from abroad. (often developing economies) Some organic methods are more costly (labour-intensive weeding) but also some costs are saved (cost of chemicals)\n“Overall, organic farms tend to have better soil quality and reduce soil erosion compared to their conventional counterparts. Organic agriculture generally creates less soil and water pollution and lower greenhouse gas emissions, and is more energy efficient. Organic agriculture is also associated with greater biodiversity of plants, animals, insects and microbes, as well as genetic diversity.”Professor Reganold\nCons of organic farming\nTime involved. Converting to organic farming takes three years and requires expensive scrutiny and regulation to prove the farm is meeting organic standards. The drawback is that during this period, the farmer cannot sell goods as organic, so they have the higher costs, but not the higher prices.\nMore labour intensive. Aspects of organic farming are more labour-intensive, weeding by hand. Less dense methods of animal farming. As a result farmers have greater costs.\nPotential loss of crops. Could lose crops to pest/disease that cannot be dealt with by organic methods.\nOrganic pesticides. Organic still involves some ‘organic’ pesticides. In the US, organic farmers are allowed to spray ‘organic’ pesticides – including copper and sulfur. On organic farms, the quantity of pesticide is not monitored.\nAccording to the National Center for Food and Agricultural Policy, The two organic fungicides, copper and sulfur, were used at a rate of 4 and 34 pounds per acre in 1971.American Scientific (2011)\nThese organic pesticides are not trouble-free and can damage both the environment and health.\nSupermarkets profit more than farmers. The price mark-up on organic farming is mostly gained by the supermarket. Profit margins for supermarkets on organic fruit and veg is 96% higher than conventional products. Whilst organic food is more expensive, the price difference does not lead to higher revenue for farmers. A French study found: “Only half of the price difference between organic and non-organic food finds its way back to farmers.” (Euractiv, Sep 2017.)\nDecline in crop yields. Crop yields can be up to 20% less than none organic farms. There is a concern that if all farmland was converted to organic it would reduce food supply and increase prices."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f955d533-516e-4188-b1a4-53ba4a29881a>","<urn:uuid:7104acf2-54f9-4759-8541-73f522ecff23>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the hunting techniques for snowshoe hares in Utah compare to those used for Norwegian hares with Dunker dogs?","answer":"The hunting techniques differ significantly. In Utah, hunters maneuver slowly through hare habitat looking for brief movements in the understory or black ear tips, often finding hares loafing in brush piles and at the base of fir and pine trees. Hunters then flush hares into the open to shoot them with shotguns, .22 caliber rifles, or archery equipment. In contrast, Norwegian hare hunting uses Dunker dogs that work solo to track hare scent and pursue them. The dogs follow foot scent to find resting hares, then chase them while barking to signal their proximity to the quarry. Norwegian hunters typically position themselves on paths crossed with hare trails or near where the dog first found the hare, as hares tend to circle back to these spots.","context":["In this rugged country made of sea, fjords, high mountains, and dark forests, there is a well-kept secret of the Norwegian Hound.\nThe Norwegian Hound, also known as the Dunker, is one of the seven Norwegian native dog breed varieties—a scent hound with outstanding hunting qualities. The mottled color and glassy eyes make it quite distinguished and different from other hare hounds.\nHistory and Overview of the Dunker\nThe breed’s history traces back to 1820, when General Jakob Krefting procured a dog named Hvide Musikk from a group of homeless travelers. Some believed the dog had Scottish or English ancestry, while others believed that it was descended from Swiss or German dogs, owing to the similarly spotted coat of the German Holstein Hound.\nCaptain Wilhelm Conrad Dunker, after whom the breed would eventually be named, bred a bitch with a marbled coat to Hvide Musikk. When the pups were born, five of them had a blue merle coat and most had the blue “glass” eyes for which the breed is now known.\nDuring the latter half of the 1800s, others followed in Captain Dunker’s footsteps and, by line breeding among the descendants of his dogs, established the breed which was recognized by the Norwegian Harehundklub in 1902.\nToday, the Dunker is highly regarded as a hunting dog in Norway, but is more or less unknown outside of Scandinavia. They are very cooperative in the woods and give strong voice while pursuing game. They have a good reputation for being “honest,” which is to say that they will track and bay only hares and not other game animals such as deer. It also means that their vocalization during the pursuit alerts the hunter to the location of the quarry and the dog’s relative position.\nTo top it all off, the breed has particularly strong paws, able to withstand the wear and tear of ice and slush so that a Dunker can continue hunting when other breeds cannot.\nJohan Skei, a late member of our breed club, described them as follows. “They have paws of steel and an enormous amount of hunting desire, searching for game in a wide area and working independently.”\nThe modern Dunker comes in two color variations: black-and-tan and blue merle. They are considered a national treasure of Norway that hunters have lovingly bred for over 200 years. They have been used by generations of hunters to pursue mainly Eurasian mountain hare (Lepus timidus), but can also be used to hunt fox and lynx. They are well-built dogs, capable of chasing and baying for hours on bare ground or on the snow- and ice-covered ground in the winter.\nDunker Harehounds in the Field\nIn Scandinavia, we use harehounds differently than hunters in other countries. Instead of running them in packs—which is illegal here—we run our dogs solo.\nLike hound handlers everywhere, we know that the weather has a huge influence on the scenting conditions. The best weather is when the ground is warm and slightly moist and the air is cold.\nThe hunter and his hound head out early in the morning to find a suitable place to chase hare. Once there, the unleashed dog searches far and wide to find what we call “harefoot,” the tiny particles of hare scent left on the ground in the area where the hare spent the night grazing. Once the dog finds that area, it follows the foot scent that the hare left behind as it moved to a resting or sleeping spot.\nSince the hare had spent most of the night in the area, eating and moving around, it leaves an incredible jumble of scent behind. The Dunker dogs are bred to unravel the mystery and figure out which way the hare went. Once they do, they follow the foot scent to find where the hare is resting or sleeping. When they eventually come upon the hare, you will usually hear a long bark that sounds almost like the dog is screaming. This will last for a few seconds until the dog switches to a more pronounced barking voice, which we hunters call “the music of the forest.”\nNow the hare is in motion with the dog in pursuit. The Dunker should be honest in the chase and let the hunter know how close or far away it is from the hare. The closer the dog is to the hare, the more intense the barking; the further behind the dog is, the longer the pause between barks. This technique allows the hunters to “read the hunt” and know when to be prepared for a shot.\nMountain hares are wily and, during the chase, will do their best to lose the dog by making many twists and turns. For example, a hare may hop down to a gravel road for 100 yards, turn 180 degrees, hold his breath, and follow its old tracks back 50 yards. Then it will make a large jump at 90 degrees to the track to put more distance between it and the dog. This can lead to what we call a “loss.” The dog will follow the original 100 yards of scent along the gravel road, but then loses the “thread of the scent” and has to figure out where the hare went. Ideally, the dog should work in circles around the point where he lost scent to figure out exactly where the hare slipped away. If the dog finds the spot where the hare jumped, he will resume the chase; if he doesn’t, it will result in what we call a “dead loss.”\nA dead loss can also occur for other reasons, such as when the hare slips between large rocks or jumps up onto a high boulder to make the thread of scent become more difficult to follow.\nAs for the hunter, finding a good place to post is not easy. The best spots are usually on paths that are criss-crossed with hare trails because these are the routes that hare use most often when pursued. Spots like that give the hunter several shooting lanes to choose from when the hare arrives. Another good spot to stand and wait is at the place where the dog first found the hare, since hares tend to circle back to this spot at some point during the chase. But the dogs cover a huge area in their search—they sometimes find hares up to 400 yards away and can chase them another 1000 yards further if luck is not on your side.\nHare hunting is an old sport and has many traditions that date back to Germanic hunting cultures of the 1800s. But beyond the tradition, I find that the real pleasure of hare hunting comes from the social aspect.\nTwo or three of my friends and I will often share a campfire and enjoy some food along with the good company. As we do, the dog will come by from time to time to check in on us before going back out in search of hare, and that is the way we like it. There is no hurry to shoot a hare when hunting and it is often said that “the worst shooter gets the best dog” because by missing a lot, the hunter gives the dog more opportunities to pursue game and learn how to figure out the hare’s tricks.\nUnfortunately, there are very few hare hunters left that use long-legged harehounds like the Dunker. Like many places, the population of hunters in Scandinavia is aging and there is now a move towards using dogs in field trial competitions more than in actual hunting. But there are still people like me who are passionate about hare hunting. It is a beautiful form of hunting with a magnificent dog, which you can enjoy with the whole family, or friends young and old.\nA Memorable Hunt\nAll hunters have a favorite story of a memorable hunt. Mine took place in Blefjeell, a mountainous area about two hours east of Oslo.\nOne day my friends Fredrik, Håkon, and I took my first Dunker, a young and inexperienced blue merle named Ivo, out for his first hare hunt. As we drove east in the early morning light, we could see our destination in the distance and I got butterflies in my stomach.\nThe foot of the mountain is covered by pine and spruce. Higher up, birch begins to cover the landscape of glistening mountains and marshes. The area is well-known for skiing and hiking and, as a result, there are a lot of cabins there. But there are also a lot of hares, sometimes even too many. We parked my old, gray truck as high as we could get in the rough terrain. As we exited the vehicle and caught our first breaths of fresh mountain air, we could see hare droppings everywhere.\nI took Ivo up a long path and picked a spot to set up our portable chairs. As my friends and I sat down and I unleashed Ivo, we were filled with excitement. Would this be the day we get to shoot his first hare?\nThe morning sun peeked just above the mountain top and steam began to rise from the ground into the cold mountain air. My dog had run down between a valley between two birch-covered hills, about 100 yards away from us. He hadn’t given us any signs yet, but we watched him closely from our vantage point while enjoying a cup of coffee as the smoke from our campfire hung low in the air like fog.\nSoon Ivo was out of sight, but we could follow his movements with the GPS collar. Approximately 40 minutes later, we heard a howling bay out in front of us, at about 400 yards. We saw neither hound nor hare. Our heart rates all jumped as we each found a place to post. I found a good spot at the top of the path, Fredrik took the far end of a field, and Håkon stood near where we had parked the truck, at the bottom of an overgrown tractor trail. Over the next 20 minutes, the dog and hare passed between us several times, giving us three or four chances to see the hare itself. The dog was so loud and the hare chose to run between cabins, so the baying woke up everyone inside. But my focus was on the incredible mountain-opera going on around us and I knew I had to get this hare for my dog who had been doing such a fantastic job.\nThen, suddenly, all went quiet. Had the hare found shelter under a porch? I watched and listened. Håkon used his radio to let me know that the hare was still running but had turned off the road and Ivo was trying to figure out which way it went. Almost immediately, he found the trail again and was back in pursuit. I thought I heard in his baying voice that the hare’s tricks had annoyed him, but maybe it was just my human emotions getting the better of me.\nThere’s the hare! I saw it snaking slowly through the tall grass near the old dairy farm on my right. I could only see the grass moving and a pair of easily recognizable ears. The hare stopped and listened for the hound a couple of times, then jumped down onto the old tractor road. It crossed the trail about 60 yards away from me and then disappeared behind some trees.\nA couple of minutes later, it hopped back onto the road and moved in my direction. The road was so steep and rocky that I couldn’t follow it with my eyes, so I just hoped it would come closer.\nI calmly raised my old Spanish side-by-side shotgun and took the safety off. The gun was loaded with number 3s and the hammers were cocked. Peeking down the road, I could see the hare hopping towards me. I fired. My cheer of happiness could be heard across the entire valley—my first hound and his first hare were now a reality.\nI stood near the dead hare and waited for Ivo who was still working the trail, unaware that I had shot the quarry. He trotted right past me, then threw his head back in surprise. He found the hare, sniffed it intensely, nibbled on the fur, and then picked it up and brought it to me, his tail twirling like a propeller.\nThe moment brought a small tear to my eye. I’d spent several hundred hours in the woods, day and night, patiently training that dog. I was so proud of the work he did.\nLater on, my friends and I gathered around the fire with Ivo safely leashed. We opened the hare and emptied its stomach. According to our old hunting tradition, the hound should receive the entrails as a reward. Not all dogs will take the entrails right away, but Ivo did.\nAfter the hare was cleaned, we put fresh juniper in the stomach to keep the meat fresh and fragrant and to make the hare look nicer while it hung on the cabin wall to tenderize.\nWith a hare in the bag, we lifted our glasses of traditional jäger schnaps and toasted the day: “Skål!”\nHåvard Mørch is a carpenter who hunts with a single Norwegian hound (Dunker). He primarily pursues Eurasian fox and Eurasian mountain hare in the deep forests and mountains of eastern Norway, but occasionally he likes to switch it up by hunting capercallie and black grouse,","Snowshoe hares: a unique challenge for Utah’s upland game hunters\nDon't clean and stow your shotgun yet.\nA BLANKET OF SNOW covers Utah mountains and valleys and frigid temperatures are icing lakes and reservoirs. It’s the time of year when several of our hunts are over or winding to a close. Guess I should clean my shotgun and put it away until turkey season opens next spring.\nOr should I?\nWhen snow and cold temperatures grip Utah, many upland game hunters turn to indoor activities. However, if you choose the warm fireplace route, you’ll miss some of the exciting upland game seasons that remain open well into the new calendar year.\nChukar and Hungarian partridge seasons are open until mid-February, cottontail rabbit season is open until the end of February and snowshoe hare season continues until mid-March.\nHare for the taking\nRabbit and hare populations in Utah are cyclic. That is, every 7–10 years, these populations reach fairly predictable highs and lows. Snowshoe hare populations peaked in 2005, declined through 2008, and are now increasing.\nThe snowshoe hare is one of three mammals classed as upland game in Utah, but it is hunted by only two percent of upland game hunters. In 2011, there were 634 hunters who pursued snowshoe hares in Utah. They harvested 1,682 hares. Despite somewhat low hunter interest, snowshoe hare hunting offers the adventurous upland game sportsman a very unique opportunity.\nTerritory and diet\nYou’ll find snowshoe hares in Utah’s pine and spruce forests, especially in areas with interspersed thickets of aspen, alder and willow. These forest-dwelling hares prefer mountainous areas above 7,000 feet.\nBecause of where snowshoe hares live, you might literally have an entire mountain to yourself!\nSnowshoe hares eat a variety of green, succulent plants in the spring and summer. In the fall and winter, their diet turns to bark; twigs of alder, aspen and willow; and other trees and shrubs. They also prefer shoots of young evergreens.\nSnowshoe hares average 2.5 to 3.5 pounds as adults. They are slightly larger than cottontail rabbits but smaller than jackrabbits.\nFrom late spring through early fall, the snowshoe’s fur is gray-brown. In late fall and early winter, this fur changes to pure white, except the ear tips and eyes which remain black.\nBesides its changing coat, you can identify this hare by the enormous hind feet from which it gets its name. The hind feet are vastly out of proportion compared to the front feet and are nature’s way of helping the hare survive.\nThe large hind feet ride upon loose snow much like snowshoes. They allow the hare to outrun potential predators such as bobcats and coyotes that sink in deep snow.\nA good hare day\nIf you head to the mountains for snowshoe hare, be sure to take a pair of snowshoes or cross-country skis; it’ll make getting around in the snow much easier.\nMost of the time, snowshoe hares rely on their camouflage color for protection. They blend in with snow very well and are hard to see if not moving.\nA cautious hunter maneuvering slowly through hare habitat should look for brief movement in the understory. The black ear tips and eyes of the snowshoe often give them away. Hunters should look for snowshoes loafing in brush piles and at the base of fir and pine trees during the day.\nYou can flush hares into the open and then take them with a shotgun, .22 caliber rifle or archery equipment as they dash for cover.\nIf a snowshoe thinks you have not spotted him, he will sit in the protective cover at the base of an evergreen tree for hours and let you walk past!\nFinding hare hotspots\nCurrent hare hotspots in Utah include:\n- Any of the canyons along the Wasatch Front and the I-15 corridor from the Utah-Idaho border south to Cedar City;\n- The Uinta mountain range;\n- The Wasatch Plateau of the Manti-La Sal and Fishlake national forests.\nSnowshoe hare hunting can provide a quality day afield for the upland game hunter. It’s also a great way to teach a beginning hunter safe firearm-handling in an uncrowded, low-pressure environment. Snowshoes make great table fare as well. Prepare them just as you would cottontail rabbit or chicken!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7f41eead-8c3b-4414-861b-38dcff62baa2>","<urn:uuid:8e4ec64b-7b73-46db-af7f-f64813e0fc2b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How can I treat a first-degree burn on my hand at home safely?","answer":"For a first-degree burn on your hand, first run it under cool water for 15-20 minutes. Then wash it carefully with mild soap and water. Never use ice or ice water as it can damage the tissue. While over-the-counter creams and ointments are available, always check with a doctor before applying anything. Natural remedies like aloe vera, medicinal-grade honey, or calendula tincture can be used. Keep watching the burn for 24-48 hours - if it starts blistering, it's a second-degree burn requiring medical attention.","context":["Before we discuss home remedies for burns on the hand, we need to determine which are safe to treat at home. You should never attempt to treat a second-, third-, or fourth-degree burn at home, especially one on the hand. Second-, third-, and fourth-degree burns require medical attention to prevent complications, significant impairment, and disability.\nYou should also seek medical attention for chemical and electrical burns and any burns from a flame.\nIf you have a first-degree burn, chances are good that you can treat it by at home; however, we always recommend burn victims seek medical care for any burns on the hand, regardless of presumed severity. There are various complications that can arise from a burn on the hand.\nWhat home remedies can I use to relieve pain?\nGood Old H2O\nThe first thing you should do to relieve the heat in your burn is to run it under cool water for 15-20 minutes. However, you can also do this to relieve pain naturally when your burn is healing.\nNever use ice or ice water on a burn as it can damage the tissue surrounding the burn.\nOnce you have rinsed your burn, wash it carefully with a mild soap and water.\nNote: Keep an eye on your burn for 24-48 hours. If your burn begins blistering, you have a second-degree burn and you need to head to the doctor.\nOver-the-Counter Pain Killers\nOintments and Creams\nBefore you apply anything to a burn, always check with a doctor. You might cause an allergic reaction or worsen the burn.\nYou can find a wide variety of over the counter creams and ointments for burns at the drugstore. These products do one or more of the following: relieve surface pain, provide moisture, prevent infection, and prevent or minimize scars. Check with your doctor, then use as directed, with or without dressing. (Ask your doctor whether you should use a dressing, and, if so, which would be best.)\nSome of these are commercially-prepared, such as burn creams and ointments you can buy in the drugstore, and others are purely natural, like aloe vera.\nOther natural home remedies you can use on burns on the hand are medicinal-grade honey or tincture of calendula.\nDo not apply any of the following to a burn on the hand:\n- Butter, oil, and any other greasy substances\n- Egg white\n- Lemon juice\nNote: Do not apply creams or ointments to a second-degree burn. It can cause an allergic reaction or infection.\nHow can I protect my burn while it is healing?\nWearing a dressing will protect your burn from contaminants and keep it moisturized. You can find sterile dressings at the drug store that are suitable for use on small, minor burns to the hands. You can use either plain sterile gauze or preformed nonstick gauze pads. Plain gauze has the tendency to stick to wounds, but a cream or ointment can help with this.\nDo not use non-sterile dressings such as washcloths, napkins, paper towels, strips of fabric, or rags on your burn wound. These are not sterile, which means they could cause your burn wound to become infected. Infected burn wounds are highly susceptible to developing sepsis, which is an infection in the blood stream. Sepsis can cause organ failure or even death. Only use sterile dressings on your burn wound.\nIf you need a dressing but have none at home, you can use plastic wrap in the meantime; just be sure to tear off the first layer of the plastic wrap roll.\nKeep Blisters Intact\nYou might have heard that popping a blister can help your burn heal or that it will prevent scarring. This simply is not true. Never pop a blister for the following reasons:\n- Your skin needs the fluid contained in the blister\n- Popping a blister can lead to infection and other complications\nKeep your burn covered to prevent popping it.\nKeep Your Skin Covered\nFor more information about treating burns on any part of your body, check out our blog."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:290ab235-f69e-44f1-b674-6a50c641b026>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm studying sodium balance disorders. What's the difference between volume status assessment in hyponatremia and sodium monitoring in Florinef therapy?","answer":"In hyponatremia, volume status assessment involves categorizing patients into hypovolemic (decreased total body sodium/water), euvolemic (normal sodium/increased water), or hypervolemic (increased sodium/greatly increased water) states, with urine sodium helping differentiate renal from extrarenal causes. For Florinef therapy, sodium monitoring focuses on preventing excessive sodium retention, requiring periodic BP monitoring and assessment for fluid retention through daily weighing and checking for edema/lung sounds, as Florinef causes sodium reabsorption in the distal renal tubule.","context":["Physiology of water balance • Almost all dysnatremias are a result of water balance • TBW = 60% total body weight • 2/3 ECF compartment with water that is freely diffusable b/w ICF and ECF to maintain identical osmolality • So, serum osmolality measures all compartments, i.e. -- when total body water is elevated, osmolality falls • ADH – governs the excretion of water by the kidney, which prevents dilution of urine when present\nOsmolality v. Tonicity • Osmolality: total number of particles in an aqueous solution (mosmol/kg H2O) • Normal Posm = 275-290 mosmol/kg • Effective osmolality (tonicity): particles that can exert osmotic force across membranes, via movement of water into or out of cells • Na+, glucose and BUN are major determinants of plasma osmolality • Posm = 2 x plasma [Na+] + [Glucose]/18 + [BUN]/2.8 • Effective osmoles (Na+ , glucose) exert water shifts unlike urea, ethanol\nWhat factors regulate the ECF? • There are multiple sensors (afferent limb that monitors EABV – amount of arterial blood that fills the arterial circulation) • Baroreceptors • Low pressure baroreceptors in venous beds that monitor for volume overload – atria, pulmonary vascular bed • High pressure barocreceptors (carotids) • JG apparatus (located at the thick ascending limb of the Loop of Henle to regulate afferent arteriole) – renin release • Efferent limb – primarily renal • Regulates rate of sodium excretion, which is most significant in the tubules • RAAS system – Ang II • ADH – released by posterior pituitary with 1% change in blood osm • Catecholamine release – directly stimulates sodium reabsorption at PT and LOH\nADH • ADH is created in supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei • Released as granules travels to posterior pituitary gland where it is released as osmolality increases • Site of action is collecting tubule • Regulated by plasma osmolality (released at 280-290), volume, stress, nausea, pregnancy\nApproach to hyponatremia • History and physical often gives clue to etiology of hyponatremia -- so take a good history 1.

{"question":"In what year did both Bellos' math book 'The Grapes of Math' and Blondel's L'Action dissertation come out?","answer":"The books were published in different years - Bellos' 'The Grapes of Math' was published in June 2014, while Blondel defended his dissertation L'Action at the Sorbonne on June 7, 1893, over 120 years apart.","context":["Bellos, Alex. The Grapes of Math: How Life Reflects Numbers and Numbers Reflect Life. S. & S. Jun. 2014. 336p. illus. ISBN 9781451640090. $25.99; ebk. ISBN 9781451640120. MATH\nMuch to the detriment of most students, school mathematics courses are mainly devoted to drilling the necessary arithmetic and algebraic skills needed in later coursework and in scientific and economic applications. As a result, many compelling and occasionally astonishing mathematical results are simply not seen and nonmathematicians cannot understand the fascination of the subject. In this well-written and entertaining book, Guardian math blogger Bellos tries to fill that void by exposing the reader to a selection of such topics. A solid example is seen in the sections on the properties of geometric figures. About 60 years ago, analytic geometry was subsumed into standard calculus courses and much of the material in chapters three, four, five, and eight largely disappeared from the standard curriculum. As later chapters get into trigonometry, exponentials, and the polar representation of complex numbers, some of the material can be tough sledding. On the other hand, the final section on the “game of life” and related topics requires no mathematical tools other than a willingness to think. VERDICT An excellent book on what could be called “mathematics appreciation.” Particularly recommended to curious adults and to any student starting out in secondary school mathematics.\nBlaser, Martin J. Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics Is Fueling Our Modern Plagues. Holt. 2014. 288p. notes. ISBN 9780805098105. $28; ebk. ISBN 9780805098112. MED\nConsidering our current obsession with antibacterial hand sanitizers and other cleanliness rituals, most people probably do not realize—or, frankly, want to know—that 90 percent of a human’s cells are actually bacteria. That fact poses questions that challenge basic assumptions: Does that mean we are coexisting with these microbes? But aren’t bacteria the enemy? Infectious disease specialist Blaser, who directs the Human Microbiome Program at New York University and founded the Bellevue Literary Review, has spent a lifetime studying bacteria and antibiotics and drawn some mind-bending conclusions—namely, that antibiotics may be increasing chronic health problems such as obesity, asthma, autism, and cancer. He takes the reader through the discovery of antibiotics, which have indeed saved millions of lives, and describes the unforeseen consequences of their overuse. He also describes a parallel line of scientific research delving into “good” bacteria and the complicated relationship between these life-forms and human health. VERDICT Blaser explains even the most complicated scientific and medical concepts with straightforward clarity. Most important, he makes a case for why readers, whatever their background, absolutely need to care about society’s overuse and misuse of antibiotics.

COOKING\nMittal (Pure & Simple: Homemade Indian Vegetarian Cuisine) successfully follows up her first cookbook with this title. Most recipes feature a flavor profile from her home state of Uttar Pradesh, but Mittal gives a nod to other regional cuisines by including Punjabi, Gujarati, and South Indian dishes as well. She takes a healthy approach by utilizing whole and fresh ingredients including vegetables, such as broccoli, that are not widely used in Indian cooking. Main dishes are built around koftas (dumplings), paneer (fresh curd cheese), dal (lentils), potatoes, or hearty produce such as cauliflower and jackfruit. While many of the dishes are more complex than what most cooks would want to attempt on a weeknight, some will be simple to prepare, and inspiration abounds. The book includes a helpful glossary and visual guide for spices, vegetables, and legumes. VERDICT The minimalist aesthetic and photographs will appeal to a wide audience, and readers familiar with Indian cuisine will appreciate the diversity of dishes represented. Mittal’s helpful visual instructions, chapter devoted to cooking techniques, and tips will have home cooks making paneer and spice blends with confidence.\nShugart, H.H.

SCI\nIn the biblical Book of Job, God confronts Job from a whirlwind with a host of questions about the nature of creation and its incomprehensible mysteries. God’s purpose is to put Job in his place: Who is Job to question God? But in this engaging and illuminating primer on environmental science, world ecosystems scholar Shugart (environmental sciences, Univ. of Virginia; How the Earthquake Bird Got Its Name and Other Tales of an Unbalanced Nature) demonstrates that science knows quite a lot about the questions God asked Job—questions pertaining to the birth of the universe, the taming of wild beasts, the course of the stars and heavenly bodies, the bounds of the seas, the powers of the winds, the dynamics of seasons and weather, and more. Using Job 38 as a framing device, Shugart brings readers face-to-face with the environmental consequences of human interference in nature and lightly touches on prospects for mitigating the damage we have caused. VERDICT Drawing from astronomy, botany, zoology, meteorology, and ecology, the author deftly introduces general readers to the present state of knowledge while making a case for informed scientific and ethical engagement with a changing climate.\nDays of Detox\nCook, Michelle Schoffro.

HEALTH\nCook, who has written a number of other health and wellness titles, here presents six detoxification programs, each aimed at a particular organ (e.g., kidneys, liver, colon), to rid the body of toxins from unhealthy food and drink. As with so many other contemporary plans, this one emphasizes fresh, unprocessed foods, and also whole grains and excludes anything that has been genetically modified. Each plan contains particular foods, supplements, exercises, and acupressure techniques to facilitate the cleansing process. With the exception of the colon cleanse, none of them seem likely to be uncomfortable, or to keep the user at home for the duration. Overall, the advice is sound, though some of the author’s documentation is shaky. In addition to sources such as the National Library of Medicine, she cites articles in popular women’s magazines, which may or may not be reliable. The programs are fairly complicated and will not appeal to the average reader of weight-loss titles. VERDICT Worthwhile, but only for a relatively small group of readers. This will appeal to the really dedicated self-help crowd.\nCostello, Melissa. The Clean in 14 Detox: The 2-Week Plan To Melt Fat, Kick Cravings, and Increase Your Natural Energy.

HEALTH\nCostello (Karma Chow Ultimate Cookbook) outlines a diet program designed to “break years of bad habits” and teach the reader to eat for health. The first half of the book consists of a two-week food plan combined with reflective exercises and journaling. The best feature of the book is the recipe section, which comprises the second half; most are easily prepared, and each is accompanied by a mouth-watering photo of the finished product. The focus of the book is food; there is very little discussion of physical exercise other than a recommendation in the second chapter to do it. The diet itself is vegan and could be difficult to follow for those in areas where fresh fruits and vegetables are not readily available. The reader is expected to give up coffee, alcohol, soda, artificial sweeteners, white sugar, and processed foods within the week prior to beginning the diet. Costello acts as a cheerleader throughout (“You’re so cool!” “Put yourself in the game 110 percent!”) and uses pop psychology as motivation. VERDICT Of interest to those who need a structured jump-start for healthy eating habits and those who are looking for simple vegan recipes.\nMottl, Pooja.

HEALTH\nNatural foods chef and Huffington Post blogger Mottl addresses the challenge of making significant changes to your dietary regime by providing targeted chapters for reeducating your body regarding ten key foods and meals: sugar, salt, wheat, chocolate, yogurt, chicken, beverages, breakfast, salad, and takeout. Mottl uses the three-day reset technique as a concentrated time for the reader to become educated about the extent of ingredients such as sugar, salt, and wheat used and the many processed forms they may take in common foods. Recipes are included with each chapter to help the reader use the three days of reset to rediscover or be introduced to new, delicious natural foods that are high in nutrition. Shopping lists also ease the transformation of the “reset” kitchen. VERDICT While only one of a number of books that aims to inform the public about the unhealthy aspects of processed food (consider also Dana Meachen Rau’s Going Organic or Robb Wolf’s The Paleo Solution), this title may appeal to those who are looking for an introduction to clean eating.\nErlbaum, Jean.

HEALTH\nSometimes sitting for a protracted time or even short periods on the floor in the lotus position while meditating can cause some serious pain. This title is a focused resource of yoga poses and stretches that specifically address the areas where sitting pain occurs, such as the upper body, back, legs, and knees. Useful explanations for why you hurt are followed by exercise descriptions and simple but easy-to-interpret drawings of the poses. Additionally, author and senior dharma teacher Erlbaum interprets the mat poses for those who would like to or need to do the stretches from a chair. The book ends with some targeted sequences for specific body pain zones for both mat and chair practice. The only criticism of this thoughtful book is that the drawings are all in black and white, making it less than exciting visually. VERDICT Meditators and yoga enthusiasts are the target audience, but now that sitting is the new smoking, anyone who sits for the better part of their day would find this a helpful read.\nGrabau, Melissa. The Yoga of Food: Wellness from the Inside Out. Llewellyn. Jun. 2014. 264p. notes. bibliog. ISBN 9780738740157. pap. $16.99. HEALTH\nPsychologist Grabau has been a yoga practitioner for over ten years. This book is a labor of love, as the author hopes to help women by using her professional education, the knowledge from employing mind-body techniques with her own personal experience of an eating disorder, and clear explanations of pertinent yoga philosophy and principles. Grabau explains that the “yoga of food means uniting the purpose of eating, nourishing the body and soul, with the practice of eating” and that yoga principles will help “to facilitate changes in your patterns of eating and self-care.” The volume also details how mindfulness practice will help the individual cultivate a healthy commitment to nutritional balance and learn to make conscious choices rather than living within years-old habit. There is no expectation of previous yoga knowledge as all sections, including “Clear Seeing,” “Your Physical Body,” “Your Energetic Body,” “Workings of Your Mind,” and “Your Wisdom Body,” are explained in clear language. This is an extremely detailed book, with practical suggestions (e.g., keeping a food journal). VERDICT A welcome addition to any self-help collection, especially one that focuses on mind-body medicine, including mindfulness, yoga, and meditation. In addition, there is a recommended resources section and glossary.\nTo log in to your account, click here.

SCI","“Blondel sought to ‘open up a position in philosophy through which the light of Christian revelation could pour in.’”\nThe second of November, 2011 will mark the 150th anniversary of Maurice Blondel’s birth. He was born at Dijon into an old, landed Burgundian Catholic family. His father and his uncle were both lawyers. He studied philosophy at the École Normale Supérieure from 1881 to 1884 and defended his controversial dissertation, L’Action, at the Sorbonne on 7 June 1893. A year and a half later, on 12 December 1894, Maurice Blondel and Rose Royer were married. They had three children. Rose Royer Blondel died on 7 March 1919 in the twenty-fifth year of their marriage. After a year at the University of Lille, Blondel taught philosophy at the University of Aix en Provence from 1896 to 1927, when blindness forced him into retirement. From 1931 onward, thanks to the help of his secretary and former student, Nathalie Panis, he continued to write at an extraordinary pace until his death in 1949 at the age of eighty-eight. After his death, Panis retained the care of his archives at Aix en Provence.2\nA professional philosopher, Blondel (1861–1949) had a decisive impact on twentieth-century Catholic theology. Often noted, his impact is as often left unexamined. After the briefest sketch of Blondel’s philosophy of action, this essay addresses a more historical question: how did this philosopher, important in his own right, come to have such a deep and abiding impact on twentiethcentury Catholic theology?3\n1. Blondel’s impact on twentieth-century Catholic theology\nFive years after the Second Vatican Council ended in 1965, Canadian theologian Gregory Baum published a book-length attempt to re-vision Catholic theology. He entitled the opening chapter “The Blondelian Shift.”4 Almost two decades later, Hans Urs von Balthasar called Blondel “the greatest Catholic philosopher of modern times.” He credited L’Action (1893) with giving to Catholic thought “a decisive new beginning.”5 Anglican theologian John Milbank called Blondel’s philosophy, “reunderstood as theology, . . . perhaps, the boldest exercise in Christian thought of modern times.”6\n1. This essay is based on the second annual Michael J. Kerlin Lecture given at La Salle University on 22 March 2010 and dedicated to the memory of my friend Michael Kerlin (1936–2007).\n2.

{"question":"How do both physical archeological sites and virtual reality contribute to preserving world heritage? I'm studying cultural preservation methods.","answer":"Physical archaeological sites like the Necropolis of Cerveteri preserve heritage through actual structures and artifacts, containing thousands of chamber-tombs dating from the 7th to 1st century BC that showcase Etruscan civilization through their architecture and burial outfits. Meanwhile, virtual reality preservation, as demonstrated by the Google-CyArk Open Heritage project, uses advanced 3D scanning technology to create detailed digital models of historical sites. This virtual preservation allows public access to endangered monuments through computers, mobile devices, or VR headsets, and provides precise documentation that can be used for restoration efforts. The scanned data is made available for download through Google's Cloud Platform, ensuring these historical sites are accessible to future generations.","context":["Etruscan necropolis of Cerveteri, known locally as Necropoli della Banditaccia, is the main burials’ area of the ancient Etruscan city of Caere and one of the most impressive and magnificent necropolis of all Etruria and Mediterranean basin.\nIt belonged to the ancient city of Caere (Cerveteri) a wealthy Etruscan city up on a tuff hill situated about 40 km from the city of Rome and not too far from the Tyrrhenian coast. The importance of Cerveteri in the history of Etruscan civilization is testified by its magnificence and a large number of findings from the burial outfits and excavations both in the areas of sanctuary and residential district.\nNecropolis of Cerveteri covers an area of about two kilometers. It’s a vast burial site (around 20.000 chamber-tombs in this one necropolis according to experts) with unique features which had been worth the inclusion in UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 2004.\nStretched on a tuff plane next to the urban area, Necropolis of Cerveteri returned a large number of buildings of various kinds dating from the VII to the I century BC. In fact, we have different sectors within the graves corresponding to the quarters by which the necropolis must have been structured.\nThe open-access area includes the Old and New Enclosure where can be admired the circular mounds with hemispherical caps made of soil, the graves known as “a dado” (like dice) prepared in ordered sequences on straight roads and large hypogeums belonged to aristocratic families in the zone called \"Del Comune\" dating from IV to III century.\nAnother sector is locally known as “Autostrada” corresponding to the paved road that runs to Cerveteri. To its left there's the impressive Grave of the Five Chairs (third quarter of the VII century BC) so called because of the number of seats carved in tuff inside one of its rooms, which today is included in a wider monumental complex due to current excavations. To the right, in front of the Enclosure's entrance, there's another burial area with chamber-tombs and mounds of Eastern period (so called area of the \"Great mounds\").\nThe importance of the Necropolis of Cerveteri comes also by providing details about ancient Etruscans living and housing. In fact, graves are built imitating the houses where they spent their lives, with many rooms and shaped doors and windows, columns and pillars, furnishings, potteries made by precious metal and goods from the Near East and from Greece.\nYou really have to take this tour of the \"city of the dead\" and we also recommend you to visit the Cerite National Museum where a large number of Etruscan relics are collected including the famous \"Sarcophagus of the Spouses\".\nOpen from 8.30 am until sunset.\nClosing Monday, 25 December and 1 January.\nNational Museum of Cerite: from 8.30 am to 7.30 pm.

CyArk, a 3D laser scanning nonprofit is responsible for scanning the historical monuments, preserving them as 3D models, while Google hosts the public’s access to CyArk’s digital library.\nStarting April 16, 2017, the public can now virtually tour the world’s endangered wonders in Google’s Open Heritage site with the use of computers, mobile devices or VR headsets.\nSites Available for Touring\nOpen Heritage has numerous 3D models and expedition overviews available for viewing. To date, visitors can explore stories from more than 25 iconic sites, across 18 countries.\nJust some of the sites viewers can virtually explore are Eim Ya Kyaung, a Buddhist monument in Bagan, Myanmar now closed to the public because of a 2016 earthquake and the Chichen Itza, the ancient Mayan metropolis in Mexico.\nNumerous historical sites in Open Heritage have 3D models that allow virtual visitors to inspect the monuments from every angle using Google’s Poly 3D viewer. With the help of Google’s Cloud Platform, everyone can apply to download the data. They can also download Open Heritage’s free app for iOS or Android.\nHeritage Preservation through Digital Recreation\nThe story of Open Heritage began way before Google conceptualized it. It started with CyArk’s founder Ben Kacyra.\nBen Kacyra founded CyArk after watching footage of Talibans destroying 1,500-year-old Buddhist statues in Afghanistan. As one of the creators of the world’s first 3D scanner, Kacyra realized that he can use his technology to digitally preserve monuments under threat from natural disasters, human conflict and other factors.\nUnder CyArk, he then started creating the world’s largest and most detailed 3D archive of the world’s endangered wonders.\nWith the improvement of the 3D scanning technologies, CyArk captures monuments in fuller detail, including color and texture of surfaces. The organization’s laser scanners have millimeter precision, allowing the detailed scans to be used for identifying damaged areas and restoration efforts.\nTech Used in Digital Preservation\nThere are numerous tools used in digital preservation. Just some of the tools CyArk uses are\n3D laser scanning, photogrammetry, and stereoscopic 360 imagery.\nThree-dimensional laser scans digitally capture the surface and dimensions of objects in a non-destructive way. CyArk utilizes scanners for creating “point clouds” to document the exact shape and size of a monument. Scans are registered to one another to create a complete 3D point cloud.\nPhotogrammetry uses images to survey, map and measure the size and distance of objects. CyArk takes overlapping images which are then brought together to create a 3D photo-textured model.\nStereoscopic 360 imagery uses panoramic photography to allow for immersive 360-degree views of a monument. Multiple images are taken from a single site coming from different angles and are then stitched together to create a single 360 image.\nThere are more technologies used in the digital preservation of the world’s heritage sites. With CyArk’s mission to make historical sites available to future generations and Google Arts and Culture’s aim to make art more accessible, the outlook for these technologies and the digital preservation of sites looks bright.\nFascinated with the women of ENIAC, Apriya started taking an interest in technology at 11 years old.

{"question":"What similarities and differences exist between Benito Juarez's Liberal government and Mexico's current federal system in terms of capital punishment policies?","answer":"During Juarez's Liberal government in the 1860s, despite the 1857 Constitution forbidding capital punishment, Juarez selectively applied the 'law of January 25, 1862' to execute political opponents, as demonstrated by Maximilian's execution. In contrast, modern Mexico's federal system, operating under the 1917 Constitution, grants states autonomy to create their own civil and penal codes, but within a framework that respects human rights. The current system emphasizes the protection of individual rights and indigenous peoples' self-determination, representing a significant departure from the selective application of capital punishment during Juarez's era.","context":["A review of Maximilian and Carlota: Europe’s Last Empire in Mexico by Mary Margaret McAllen (Trinity University Press, 2014).\nLeaving forever the land of your fathers is painful, yet many Southerners turned further south, contemplating that choice on the eve of their destruction by the North. With most of their wealth bound to the land, what resource could they find to re-establish themselves elsewhere? And where was that sanctuary, when country after country was hostile to them in language, culture, government, and climate? Many Southerners emigrated to Mexico.\nThe prospect of life in Mexico at that moment was truly a daunting proposition. Not only was Mexico embroiled in a civil war, but it was entering one of its most dramatically chaotic periods, one that would permanently shape its national character. Oddly, most American historians have ignored this chapter in Mexican history, in spite of its relevant context for both nations, leaving the accretion of its enormous bibliography to the Europeans.\nMaximilian and Carlota fills this missing context, thanks to M.M. McAllen’s scholarship that navigates the several languages required to understand it. Furthermore, she does so in highly readable fashion, approachable by the casual reader. The book’s focus is on that larger historical context. However, readers of Confederate history can sample the wealth of detail on their subject by typing “Confederate” into the Google text search for the book, here.\nThe Mexican civil war pitted the ostensibly liberal democratic forces of Benito Juárez (designated Liberals or Juaristas by McAllen) against the conservatives – the hacendados (big estate owners) and the clergy. This War of Reform (La Reforma) that had already been raging for a decade at the time of Appomattox, had seen the land of the conservatives threatened with expropriation by the Constitution of 1857. Seeing that there was no native leader powerful enough to restore their privileges, the conservatives decided to restore the Mexican monarchy through a foreigner, the archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria, with the sponsorship of the French monarch, Napoléon III – nephew of the well-known Napoléon Bonaparte. These supporters of Maximilian (designated Imperialistas by McAllen) had in fact triumphed: In May, 1865, their 60,000 men under the French commander François Achille Bazaine ruled three-quarters of the country, and Juárez controlled not a single state capital or a single seaport [p183-184]. Juárez was little better than a bandit leader, hiding in northern Mexico and slipping into the United States when the French came too close.\nThen the United States government stepped in.\nGeneral Philip Sheridan, the great innovator of war on civilians in the Shenandoah and future genius of Indian genocide on the Great Plains, began supplying arms to the Juaristas, with the full knowledge and encouragement of General Grant [p187]. Former Yankee officers set up a recruiting station at Fort Brown on the Rio Grande, paying mercenaries $50 a month to join the Liberals. In New York Yankee General Lew Wallace of Shiloh infamy, helped Juaristas float a $30 million bond offering for the purchase of weapons from army surplus and from former Union arms dealers. When few investors bought in, the arms dealers bought it themselves [p205]. Wallace and another former Union General, R.C. Crawford, would actually invade Mexico in January, 1866, and lead Juaristas in the sack of the port of Bagdad, near the Rio Grande [p229]. In November of that year, William T. Sherman and Lewis D. Campbell, the American minister to Mexico, brazenly showed up in Veracruz with the offer of military and naval assistance to the Juaristas [p313].\nBeaten and broke in the summer of 1865, these noble Juarista patriots of Mexico joined hands with the vultures of the North. Juárez himself wanted to sell mining concessions in Sonora, rail and telegraph easements, and even the entire Baja peninsula to the Nortes in exchange for their support [p44]. Juarista General Plácido Vega sold Mexican mining leases to them for $600,000, with which he bought arms and ammunition; Californians Mason and Alfred Green persuaded San Francisco bankers to offer $10 million in bonds, the proceeds of which bought Henry repeating rifles, cannon, and other munitions for Juarista armies [p249]. Secretary of State William Seward countenanced all this, as well as the establishment of seven recruitment centers in New York City and one in Washington, DC [p237], all the while keeping up a front of neutrality.\nThese interventions were acts of war, and demonstrations of the Union government’s greed and its hypocrisy toward its claim to being defenders of democratic self-determination.\nIndeed, Maximilian did not immediately accept the offer of the throne from the Mexican delegation of conservatives that arrived at Miramar, his estate near Trieste on the Adriatic, on October 2, 1863 [p98]. He waited for six months until he received the result of a plebiscite that convinced him that a majority of Mexicans wanted him as emperor. Considering that acceptance of the crown meant giving up all future claims to the crown in Austria, and considering the danger and uncertainty of Mexico, his idealism, and that of his Belgian wife Carlota, was truly remarkable.\nMaximilian was six feet tall, slender, with expressive blue eyes and pale skin, blonde hair, and a short beard parted in the middle. Though McAllen does not say so, he had inherited the Habsburg prognathous lower jaw, whose drooping lower lip gave him something of a hound dog look – or would have, without the beard. Nevertheless, his geniality and natural bearing never failed to impress those in his presence. He spoke at least ten languages, including Spanish, and could converse in German, French, Flemish, Italian, Latin, English, Hungarian, Czech, Polish, and Croatian [p140]. He and Carlota conversed in German, but Carlota was also fluent in Spanish, French, English, and Italian. Maximilian was a good horseman and something of a botanist, collecting samples wherever he went. His training was in the Austrian navy, so on military matters he deferred to others, particularly Bazaine, the commander of all the French forces that had conquered Mexico for him.\nThese forces were quite a motley. In addition to Mexican soldiers, there were contingents from Austria, Belgium, and all over the French empire from Turkey to Algeria, representing twenty-two nations in all [p110]. From all of this was supposed to emerge an army capable of holding together the recreated Mexican monarchy once the French protectorate had left. Under pressure from the United States, as well as from Prussia, especially after it crushed the Austrians at Sadowa (Königgrätz) in the summer of 1866, the French left early, leaving behind no reliable defense for Maximilian and Carlota.\nWithout this protection, the new royal couple, who were sincerely dedicated to the welfare and prosperity of Mexico and its people, had a space of only three years to accomplish something. It is impressive what they did accomplish. Most of all, Maximilian wanted peace. To the dismay of the conservatives, he left in place the land reforms of the Constitution of 1857, which should have stolen the Liberal thunder and thus led Juárez to accept Maximilian’s surprising offer to make him prime minister [p116]. Maximilian converted the currency to decimal based, created new highways and railroads despite their constant sabotage by Liberal guerrillas, imported thousands of books, encouraged the arts and sciences through the establishment of imperial awards for the young in those fields, restored some of the Mexican artifacts stolen by European powers, kept the foreigners out of the Sonoran silver mines [p193], regularly met with indigenous tribes to address their grievances and bring them into the social order, and lavished money on hospitals and other charities [p166]. Carlota worked to end peonage [p194], which bound poor Mexican farmers to the haciendas in perpetual debt – in fact, slavery in all but the name – but failed. And, to the consternation of his officers in the field, Maximilian was generous to a fault with pardons and amnesties for captured Liberals, mistakenly thinking it would turn their hearts to him.\nSupport from such a benign government might have turned the tide in favor of the South. As it was, over 320,000 bales of cotton passed through Matamoros during the course of the War Between the States [p159], sustaining the Confederacy through the Union blockade, and enriching Mexico, which relied almost exclusively on customs duties to sustain government. Although both Maximilian and Carlota wanted Confederates to come to Mexico both as colonists and as defenders of the realm, they publicly discouraged their immigration, foolishly believing that the United States might one day recognize their government.\nNevertheless, by late spring of 1865, some 8,000 to 10,000 Confederates had relocated to Mexico [p185]. These included John B. Magruder, James E. Slaughter (defender of Mobile, and later, Galveston with Magruder), Edmund Kirby Smith, and the governors of Louisiana and Texas (Henry Watkins Allen and Pendleton Murrah, respectively, though not named by McAllen).\nThe most prominent Confederate immigrant of all was Matthew Fontaine Maury, something of a genius in creating navigational charts for open sea sailing, and a man unafraid of putting the most daring ideas into action. At the start of the War Between the States he had gone to Europe to encourage governments to either intervene to end the war, or to recognize the Confederacy. After the war he thought of a scheme to have Brazil buy Southern slaves and thus provide compensation for ridding the South of slavery. When that plan failed, he approached Maximilian in June, 1865, with a detailed scheme to colonize Mexico with 100,000 Southerners and their slaves. Because slavery (but not peonage) had been abolished in 1829, their slaves would enter Mexico under an indenture of seven years and then be set free. He must have been persuasive, for he was naturalized as a Mexican citizen and given the title “Imperial Commissioner of Immigration” [p192].\nMaury’s plan concentrated Confederate colonists along Maximilian’s new Mexico City railroad. At one site, diplomatically named Carlota, the former governor of Tennessee Isham Harris and General Joseph O. Shelby with 50 members of his Iron Brigade settled. The prospect of its success even had American businessmen petitioning Congress for recognizing Maximilian’s government. Colonization at Carlota credited 640 acres per family, or 320 acres for single men, for purchase at a dollar an acre. The colony quickly jumped to 500 members, with most of the colonists not bringing slaves with them. By autumn of 1865, an additional 2,000 Confederates had entered the country [p193].\nIn spite of this initial success, attacks by Juaristas on the colonists and threats from the United States discouraged further settlement. Exasperated by Maximilian’s dithering support of Confederate colonization, Maury left for England, never to return to Mexico, and the emperor disbanded his office of immigration in April 1866 [p241].\nWith the departure of the French on March 16, 1867, and with Juaristas enjoying the full support of the United States –economic, military, naval, and even the support of American leadership on the battlefield – Maximilian’s days were numbered. He had wanted to abdicate, but only with guarantees of safety for those left behind. This Juárez refused. Although the Constitution of 1857 forbade capital punishment, he insisted on his own selectively applied “law of January 25, 1862,” which called for death to any armed opponent of the Liberal republic. Primarily on the advice of his wife and mother, Maximilian took a stand at Querétaro, where he was betrayed and captured without a final battle.\nStanding before a firing squad at seven in the morning of June 19, 1867, alongside faithful Generals Miguel Miramón and Tomás Mejía, Maximilian said in Spanish:\nMexicans: Men of my class and origins are appointed by God to be the happiness of people or their martyrs. Called by some of you, I came for the good of the country; I did not come for ambition, but animated by the best wishes for the future of my adoptive country, for the brave who died before in the glorious sacrifice. Mexican people, I hope that my blood will be the last to be spilled and I pray that it regenerates this unhappy country. ¡Viva México! ¡Viva la Independencia! [p387]\nJuárez withheld the return of Maximilian’s body for five months, hoping to extort Austria into recognizing his government. Although Carlota had earlier been sent away to Europe to plead for support of her husband, she suffered a paranoiac breakdown a short time before her husband’s execution. She lived until 1927.\nMcAllen’s account abounds with colorful and outrageous characters: Zouaves and Algerians in native costume; Colonel Du Pin, the brutal Imperialista counterguerrilla commander of the tierra caliente, or northern interior, wearing “a vast Mexican sombrero and a long white beard, […] white pants with large folds, yellow riding boots with large Mexican spurs” and leading a band of rag-tag desperados from a dozen nations; Father Augustin Fischer, a German adventurer and California gold seeker, returned to the cloth while yet consorting with Mexican girls, making a living flattering the two royals; the honorable Juarista intellectual Vicente Riva Palacio, whose father defended Maximilian before the rigged “trial” before his execution; the jug-eared Juarista Mariano Escobedo, whose gentlemanly patience was constantly exasperated by Princess Agnes, wife of Félix Salm-Salm, the daring Prussian who put aside his royal titles to become a soldier of fortune. Agnes was a red-haired American girl from Vermont who had once worked in a circus – beautiful and every bit the match of her husband in fearlessness and brass, following him into war in a half dozen countries. In Mexico her repeated approaches to Benito Juárez in person after traveling alone over dangerous country moved him to spare her husband’s life, and likely many officers of the Imperialistas as well. When caught by Escobedo trying to arrange the escape of her husband, one officer tried to grab her arm to escort her away. As she relates it:\nAs quick as lightning, I drew from under my dress my little revolver, and pointing at the breast of the terrified captain, I cried, ‘Captain, touch me with one finger and you are a dead man.’ [p376]\nSeveral lessons abide from the book. One is its demonstration of how people can act in ways diametrically opposite to their rationally stated goals. For example: The entire Mexican clergy, led by one Antonio de Labastida, was willing to turn their congregations against their own chosen defender, Maximilian, when he would not return to them all of their vast original lands, even though that would have meant putting decades of established land titles in chaos. French commander Bazaine, who needed all the military help he could get, repeatedly thwarted the creation of a viable Mexican army, and even spiked cannon and put down horses before his final return to France [p312]. Most glaring of all was Juárez, who was willing to risk his own destruction rather than become second to the man who had given up his homeland to guarantee the Liberal ideals that supposedly meant everything to Juárez himself. Another lesson is the legacy of this period for present-day Mexico. One sees its perpetuation in the violence, in the racism toward its indigenous peoples, in the imperial pretenses, in the neglect of its citizens by its leaders, all cynically mouthing the ideals of La Revolución while enriching themselves and their corrupt friends, and in the touchy inferiority complex that longs for the comeuppance of the Europeans.\nThe book could have profited from a few good maps, and there was some disappointment in finding nothing about the Knights of the Golden Circle, Southerners who wanted to conspire or collaborate with Maximilian much in the way that Matthew Fontaine Maury did. Also, while there is some mention of the brutality of the Liberals – for example the mutilation and rape of railroad passengers near Veracruz that led to the infamous Black Decree of October 3, 1865 – the reader doesn’t come away with a real experience of their routine savagery. Just one description of the cases of wholesale slaughter of indigenous Indians who supported Maximilian might have brought this home. On a more mundane level, an editor might have struck the word “passel” [p64] and changed “absolution” to “pardon” [p206], “except” to “accept” [p233], and “courtesans” to “courtiers” [p291] – but these are peccadillos.\nMcAllen’s book is probably the best read you will find on this period of Mexican history, and it can’t be too highly recommended for Southern history readers looking for the “big picture” south of the border.","Administrative divisions of Mexico\nEstados Mexicanos (Spanish)\n|Location||United Mexican States|\n|Number||32 Federal Entities (31 States and Mexico City)|\n|Populations||(States only) 637,026 (Baja California Sur) – 12,851,821 (México)|\n|Areas||(States only) 3,990 km2 (1,541 sq mi) (Tlaxcala) – 247,460 km2 (95,543 sq mi) (Chihuahua)|\n|This article is part of a series on the|\npolitics and government of\nThe United Mexican States (Spanish: Estados Unidos Mexicanos) is a federal republic composed of 32 Federal Entities: 31 states and Mexico City, an autonomous entity. According to the Constitution of 1917, the states of the federation are free and sovereign in all matters concerning their internal affairs. Each state has its own congress and constitution.\nFederal entities of Mexico\nThis section needs additional citations for verification. (October 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nRoles and powers of the states\nThe states of the Mexican Federation are free, sovereign, autonomous and independent of each other. They are free to govern themselves according to their own laws; each state has a constitution that cannot contradict the federal constitution, which covers issues of national competence. The states cannot make alliances with other states or any independent nation without the consent of the whole federation, except those related to defense and security arrangements necessary to keep the border states secure in the event of an invasion. The political organization of each state is based on a separation of powers in a congressional system: legislative power is vested in a unicameral congress (the federal congress has two chambers), executive power is independent of the legislature and vested in a governor elected by universal suffrage, and judicial power is vested in a Superior Court of Justice. Since the states have legal autonomy, each has its own civil and penal codes and judicial body.\nIn the Congress of the Union, the federative entities (the states) are each represented by three senators. Two are elected by universal suffrage on the principle of relative majority and one is assigned to the party that obtains the largest minority. In addition, the federation makes up a constituency in which 32 senators are elected by the method of proportional representation. Federal Deputies, however, do not represent the states, but rather the citizens themselves. The Chamber of Deputies and the Senate together comprise the Congress of the Union.\nInternal organization of states\nThe states are internally divided into municipalities. Each municipality is autonomous in its ability to elect its own council. A council is headed by a mayor who is elected every three years. Each municipality has a council composed of councilors in terms of population size. In most cases, the council is responsible for providing all utilities required for its population. This concept, which arises from the Mexican Revolution, is known as a \"free municipality\".\nAs of January 2021, there are 2,454 municipalities in Mexico. The state with the highest number of municipalities is Oaxaca, with 570, and the state with the lowest number is Baja California Sur, with only five.\nMexico City is the capital of the United Mexican States. It had special status as a federal district until January 2016 and was originally called Distrito Federal.\nMexico City was separated from the State of Mexico, of which it was the capital, on November 18, 1824, to become the capital of the federation. As such, it belonged not to any state in particular but to all of them and to the federation. Therefore, the president of Mexico, who represented the federation, designated its head of government, previously referred to as the regent (regente) or head of department (jefe del departamento). However, the Federal District received more autonomy in 1997, and its citizens were then able to elect their chief of government for the first time.\nIn 2016, the Mexican Congress approved a constitutional reform eliminating the federal district and establishing Mexico City as a fully autonomous entity on par with the states. However, unlike the other states of the Union, it would receive funds for education and health. When full autonomy was granted, Mexico City adopted its own constitution (it previously had only an organic law, the Statute of Autonomy) and its boroughs expanded their local government powers.\nInternal divisions of Mexico City\nMexico City is divided in 16 boroughs, officially designated as demarcaciones territoriales or colloquially known as alcaldías in Spanish. Headed by a mayor, these boroughs kept the same territory and name as the former delegaciones.\nSelf-determination of indigenous peoples\nThis section does not cite any sources. (October 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nThe second article of the constitution recognizes the multicultural composition of the nation, which is founded upon the indigenous peoples. The government grants them the right of self-determination and autonomy. According to this article, the indigenous peoples are granted\n- The right to decide their internal forms of social, economic, political and cultural organization;\n- The right to apply their own normative systems of regulation as long as human rights and rights of women (gender equality) are granted;\n- The right to preserve and enrich their languages and culture; and\n- The right to elect representatives to the municipal council in which their territories are located; amongst other rights.\nThe nation commits to and demands the constituent states and municipalities to promote the economic and social development of the indigenous communities, as well as an intercultural and bilingual education. According to the General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples, the nation recognizes 68 indigenous languages as \"national languages\", with the same validity as Spanish in the territories in which they are spoken. The indigenous peoples are entitled to request public services in their languages.\nPostal abbreviations and ISO 3166-2 codes\n|Name of federative entity||Conventional\n|2-letter code*||3-letter code|\n|Aguascalientes||Ags.||MX - AG||MX-AGU|\n|Baja California||B.C.||MX - BC||MX-BCN|\n|Baja California Sur||B.C.S.||MX - BS||MX-BCS|\n|Campeche||Camp.||MX - CM||MX-CAM|\n|Chiapas||Chis.||MX - CS||MX-CHP|\n|Chihuahua||Chih.||MX - CH||MX-CHH|\n|Coahuila||Coah.||MX - CO||MX-COA|\n|Colima||Col.||MX - CL||MX-COL|\n|Mexico City||CDMX||MX - DF||MX-CMX|\n|Durango||Dgo.||MX - DG||MX-DUR|\n|Guanajuato||Gto.||MX - GT||MX-GUA|\n|Guerrero||Gro.||MX - GR||MX-GRO|\n|Hidalgo||Hgo.||MX - HG||MX-HID|\n|Jalisco||Jal.||MX - JA||MX-JAL|\n|México||Edomex. or Méx.||MX - EM||MX-MEX|\n|Michoacán||Mich.||MX - MI||MX-MIC|\n|Morelos||Mor.||MX - MO||MX-MOR|\n|Nayarit||Nay.||MX - NA||MX-NAY|\n|Nuevo León||N.L.||MX - NL||MX-NLE|\n|Oaxaca||Oax.||MX - OA||MX-OAX|\n|Puebla||Pue.||MX - PU||MX-PUE|\n|Querétaro||Qro.||MX - QT||MX-QUE|\n|Quintana Roo||Q.

The Treaty of Córdoba recognized part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain as an Independent Empire – \"monarchist, constitutional and moderate\". The new country named itself the Mexican Empire. The morning after the Army of the Three Guarantees entered Mexico City on September 28, 1821, Agustín de Iturbide ordered the Supreme Provisional Governmental Junta (September 1821 – February 1822) to meet to elect a president of the Imperial Regency and to issue a declaration of independence for the new nation. Iturbide was elected president of the Regency, and that afternoon the members of the Regency and the Supreme Junta signed the Declaration.\nA minority of the Constituent Congress, looking for stability, elected Agustín de Iturbide as emperor. On July 21, 1822, Iturbide was crowned Emperor of Mexico. However, the Constitutional Empire quickly demonstrated the incompatibility of its two main parts: the Emperor and the Constituent Congress. The deputies were imprisoned just for expressing their opinions, and eventually Iturbide decided to dissolve the Congress and instead establish a National Board.\nThe lack of a legitimate legislature, the illegitimacy of the Emperor, and the absence of real solutions to the nation's problems increased revolutionary activity. Antonio López de Santa Anna proclaimed the Plan of Casa Mata, to which later joined Vicente Guerrero and Nicolás Bravo. Iturbide was forced to reestablish the Congress and, in a vain attempt to save the order and keep the situation favorable to his supporters, he abdicated the crown of the empire on March 19, 1823.\nCongress nullified the designation of Iturbide and therefore the recognition of the abdication. It deemed the coronation of Iturbide to have been a logical mistake in consummation of Independence. The dissolution of the Empire was the first political realignment of independent Mexico.\nAfter the fall of the Empire, a triumvirate called the Supreme Executive Power was created. The provisional government created the Federal Republic, and it was in effect from April 1, 1823, to October 10, 1824.\nUnrest in the provinces was widespread. On May 21, 1823, The Founding Plan of the Federal Republic was enacted. Its sixth article stated, \"The component parts of the Republic are free, sovereign and independent States in that which touches internal administration and government\". Most of the Free States, which were invited to form the Federal Republic, joined the Union, except for the former Captaincy General of Guatemala, which formed their own Federal Republic.\nOn January 31, 1824, the decree to create a Constitutive Act of the Mexican Federation was issued, which incorporated the basic structure of the Federal Republic. It was determined that the criteria for inviting states to the federation should be that they \"...not be so few that through expansion and wealth in a few years they be able to aspire to constitute themselves as independent nations, breaking the federal bond, nor so many that through lack of manpower and resources the system should come to be unworkable.\"\nBetween 1823 and 1824, some of the Free States created their own constitutions, and others had already installed a Constituent Congress. Special cases were those of Yucatán, which on December 23, 1823, decided to join the federation but as a Federated Republic, and Chiapas, which decided by referendum to join the federation on September 14, 1824.\nOn October 4, 1824, the Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1824 was enacted. The constitution officially created the United Mexican States. The country was composed of 19 states and 4 federal territories. After the publication of the constitution, on November 18, the Federal District was created. On November 24, Tlaxcala, which had retained a special status since the colonial era, was incorporated as a territory.\nThe constituent states of the Republic lost their freedom, autonomy, independence, and sovereignty by being totally subordinated to the central government. However, the territorial division itself was the same, as the text of Article 8 of the Law determined: The national territory is divided into departments, on the basis of population, location and other leading circumstances: its number, extension and subdivisions, would be detailed by constitutional law.\nThe Seven Constitutional Laws (Spanish: Siete Leyes Constitucionales) were promulgated on December 30, 1836. The 1st article confirmed the decree of the law October 3, 1835; the Republic would be divided into departments, these in districts and the districts in parties. The 2nd article posited that the division of the Republic into departments would be under a special law with constitutional character. On December 30, 1835, a transitory decree was added to the Seven Laws. The decree stated that the territory of Tlaxcala and the Federal District would become a part of the Department of Mexico. The territories of Alta and Baja California would form the department of the Californias. Coahuila y Tejas would be divided into two departments. Colima would form part of Michoacán, and Aguascalientes would be declared a department.\nThis period of political instability caused several conflicts between the central government and the entities of the country, and there were rebellions in several states:\n- Yucatán, due to being a Federated Republic, declared itself independent in 1840 (officially in 1841). The República de Yucatán (English: Republic of Yucatán) rejoined Mexico in 1848.\n- Texas declared its independence and declared war against the central government of Mexico. The Republic of Texas was created. Texas remained independent until 1845, when it joined the United States of America. From 1861 to 1865, Texas was part of the Confederate States of America. After the defeat of the Confederacy in the American Civil War (1861–65) and Reconstruction, Texas rejoined the United States of America in 1870.\n- In 1840, the states of Nuevo León, Tamaulipas and Coahuila declared themselves independent from Mexico for just under 250 days; the República del Río Grande never consolidated because independent forces were defeated by the centralist forces.\n- Tabasco declared its separation from Mexico in February 1841, in protest against centralism and the imposed sanctions by centralist president Anastasio Bustamante. It rejoined in December 1842.\nRestoration of the Republic and Second Empire\nThe Federal Republic was restored by the interim president José Mariano Salas on August 22, 1846. The state of Guerrero was provisionally erected in 1849, on the condition that it be approved by the legislatures of the states of México, Puebla and Michoacán, whose territories would be affected.\nOn February 5, 1857, the Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1857 was enacted. In 1864, however, after the French intervention, the conservative Mexicans restored the constitutional monarchy, known as the Second Mexican Empire, led by the emperor Maximilian of Habsburg and supported by the French army of Napoleon III. The Empire was deposed in 1867 by the republican forces of Benito Juárez and the Federal Republic was restored again under the Constitution of 1857.\nThe Political Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1917 was the result of the Mexican Revolution. The third Constitution of Mexico confirmed the federal system of government that is currently in effect.\n- Administrative division\n- List of Latin American countries by Human Development Index\n- Territorial evolution of Mexico\n- ^a Some of these flags are used in states like Civil or Historic Flags (Yucatán, Hidalgo, Baja California, Michoacán) and are even more recognized by people as the official state flags assigned by President Ernesto Zedillo in 1999 and can be found waving in homes of the people. The others are proposed by citizen or groups to state legislatures, but have not yet been approved. Only two states in Mexico have changed the flags and have formalized their own, Jalisco and Tlaxcala.\n- INEGI (January 1, 2016). \"México en Cifras\". en.www.inegi.org.mx (in Spanish).

For more on these terms, be sure to read the page Ear Training, Aural Skills and Musicianship. Through aural skills development, musicians are able to fully comprehend the music theory of the sounds that they hear. A well trained ear is able to write down music that is played, and can ‘hear’ written music without having to play it out loud.\nThe lessons found under the lessons tab above offer a comprehensive curriculum for learning music fundamentals and theory, including the ear training necessary to grasp these concepts in the sound itself, not just in written form. Singers who study these lessons will be able to not only sight read (sight sing) music accurately, but will also understand the full texture of the music and their contribution to it. While the targeted audience is choral singers and music theory students, these lessons can serve anyone hoping to develop their musicianship. Embedded in the lessons are the following ear training exercises and aural skills exercises. You can also work on them outside of the lessons, and control the settings to match your needs and ability. To do this, click on the exercises tab above, or click on the title of any of the exercises below.\nScale Degree Ear Training develops a musician’s ability to know each note’s place relative to other notes in the scale employed. The tendency tones of a scale are the primary anchors for feeling scale degree function. These tendency tones have ‘pull’, especially when accompanied by specific underlying harmony (usually dominant resolving to tonic harmony). In such a context, the strongest pulling tendency tones of the major scale are at the half steps, with the 4th scale degree tends to resolve down by half-step to the 3rd scale degree, and the 7th tends to resolve up by half step to the tonic.\nScale Degree Ear Training is the cornerstone exercise of SonicFit. Read more about our pedagogy on our pedagogy page.\nMusicians often use a mnemonic system to remember scale degrees of a scale. At SonicFit, we encourage using movable DO solfege. In this system, the first note of the scale is always DO, the second note RE, etc. Please see the lessons for full information on this.\nWhen doing this exercise, you should be singing everything! Start by singing the scale on solfege. Next, sing prominent tendency tone resolutions, such as FA-MI, or TI-DO. Then sing the example played on a neutral syllable- like TA. Hold the first note and sing up the scale to find the first note. You might also try to hold the first note, then sing down the scale until you feel you've arrived at DO. Repeat this same action for the last note. Before you put in the answer, sing your choice on solfege and see if it feels right. After it is graded, sing the correct answer on solfege.\nIf you are taking a lot of time to answer the questions, you need to change the settings. Click on the settings button at the top, and select fewer notes. If these are easy for you, select more notes, add chromaticism and change keys. See the lessons for information on chromaticism.\nSettings allow the user to adjust the material to match their skill level and pedagogical preferences. Settings include:\n• select individual notes in the scale\n• define the range and tessitura\n• set mnemonic system- solfege (fixed or movable), numbers, letters\n• set mode (major or minor, with la or do based minor both available\n• set the instrument sounds played\nrecognizing and identifying intervals, triads, seventh chords and extended tertian harmonies used in jazz.\nInterval and chord ear training is a set of exercises to develop the ability to identify the quantity and quality of intervals or the quality and inversion of chords. The settings of these exercises allow a user to isolate specific parameters of the exercise to assist in the development of this skill. For a curriculum to guide and pace your development of these skills, see the interval and chord lessons in the SonicFit lessons.\nThe ability to identify intervals and chords by ear is considered a fundamental skill of most ear training and aural skills pedagogies. SonicFit agrees that this is an essential skill of the trained musician, however, we depart from other pedagogies regarding when and how to develop this skills. Recognizing intervals by ear and properly identifying them by both quantity and quality requires a significant understanding of music theory. While a student may memorize the names of intervals by how they sound, they won't really understand what the quantity and quality terms really mean until after they reach that part of the theory curriculum.\nIn contrast, students need no background in theory whatsoever to begin scale degree ear training exercises. For that reason, SonicFit considers scale degree recognition to be a rudimentary skill, and interval and chord recognition to be an extended skill build upon the former combined with an understanding of theory.\nAfter developing fundamental skills of scale degree recognition and the theory behind intervals and chords, a student may then embark on the aural study of intervals and chords. A full curriculum for this study is found in the SonicFit lessons, which will fully explain the appropriate settings to use for each step of this study. Those settings include:\n• set melodic, harmonic, or harmonic followed by melodic presentation of pitches\n• isolate ascending or descending melodic presentation of pitches\n• set the lowest or highest note to the same pitch every time\n• in interval drill, set pitches to those in major or minor scale\n- or pick the specific intervals drilled\n• in triad drill, select which quality and inversions are presented\n• enforce theoretical understanding by requiring note input\n• set the instrument sounds played\nmelodic ear training of fragments that are 3 to 5 notes\npitch content categories include both tonal and atonal material\nThe melodic fragments ear training exercise works towards better aural comprehension of melodic material that is not in a previously established diatonic framework. This is an advanced exercise that integrates previous ear training and theory including scale degree ear training, interval ear training,and a theoretical understanding of the intervalic construction of scales. For some melodic fragments, the pitches presented could fit in a diatonic framework, albeit one that has not been established by previous material. For these fragments, students trained in scale degree ear training should try to hear the solfege that fits the notes, then determine what pitches would correspond to those scale degrees given the first pitch. An aural understanding of intervals from interval ear training might be used as a check to verify accuracy of the pitches selected. These fragments are in the categories called \"diatonic 3\" and \"diatonic 5\". Notes in these fragments will be adjecent notes from a major scale, though not necessarily played in order.\nOther melodic fragments cannot possibly fit into a major scale. For these, students will draw on skills identifying intervals as well as extablishing a close chromatic framework. Exercises vital to success with these sets are interval ear training and close chromatic framework. The content setting for these fragments include \"close chromatic\", \"nested 3rds\", and \"nested 6ths\".\nFinally, the remaining sets include larger intervals, relying heavily on students who have significant aural proficiency with larger intervals and chords. Students should practice interval and chord ear training and consult the curriculum to develop these skills in the lessons prior to taking on these levels of melodic fragments.\nJust as Scale Degree Ear Training develops aural comprehension of the diatonic framework, this exercise trains musicians in a chromatic framework. Interval recognition is an important part of this framework, however it is more than just identifying individual intervals. The framework is formed by the network of intervals known simultaneously and in cross-reference to each other. You know what A to C is because we also know A to C# and A to B, and you know what each pitch's place is relative to the others.\nWhile interval recognition is in important reference and verification, to goal is to begin hearing the framework- each note having its place and knowing its place because you also know the place of every other note in consideration. To obtain this skill, pitch memory is perhaps a more fundamental tool than interval recognition. Imagine that each note is being played by a hand bell, and then recall which hand bell made each sound as you identify each tone presented. To develop this skill, it is essential that you being with a small set of pitches- here we begin with all the chromatic notes contained within a perfect fourth.\nYou might find it easiest to being by imposing the melodic minor scale, degrees 5-8 on these notes. The lowest note could be thought of as the 5th scale degree, and the top note the 8th. The middle notes on the right in blue are the raised 6th and 7th scale degrees, and the notes on the left in red are the lowered 6th and 7th scale degrees. Practice singing the top of the melodic scale up and then back down: \"MI FI SI LA, SOL FA MI\" (for LA based Minor*) between every example drilled to help keep you locked into the framework. Recognizing and singing the patterns for the top of the harmonic minor scale, natural minor scale and dorian scale can also help you lock into the framework. Eventually, however, you should train to just hear the framework of the notes presented, and not think of them as part of a scale.\nAfter mastering the set of notes contained within a perfect fourth, expand your set of pitches by adding a chromatic pitch both above and below. You can use minor scales as a crutch to gain proficiency with the larger set of pitches. In adding pitches beyond this, SonicFit recommends the following: return to a set of pitches a perfect fourth apart, and as the same set of pitches displaced up the octave above the first. Learn to quickly shift octaves while maintaining the chromatic framework of these 6 notes. Only after improving proficiency with a displaced octave should you attempt chromatic frameworks larger than a perfect fifth. Settings for all of these options will be forthcoming.\n* if using DO based minor, these would be SOL LA TI DO, TE LE SOL\nThis exercise plays a scale and the user identifies the scale played. The settings allow the user to limit which scales may be played, as well as select instrument sound to be played and save scores. Before attempting this exercise, students should of course have learned the intervalic content of scales presented in the theory sequence, as well as gained proficiency in hearing steps (melodic fragments, with setting of diatonic 3) and hearing triads (interval and chord ear training with settings to triads isolating root position melodic ascending). Scales included are:\nMajor and Minor\n• harmonic minor\n• melodic minor\n• natural minor\n• Ionian (Maj)\n• Aeolian (min)\n• whole tone\n• octatonic (h.w)\n• diminished (w.h)\n• Dorian with #4\n• Mixolydian with #4\nThis exercise plays two beats of rhythmic patterns presented melodically, that is, with pitch content to make it more memorable and resemble melodic fragments. The rhythmic patterns use quarter, eighth, and sixteenth division of the beat.\nThe user writes their answers on a piece of paper, (which is easier than entering buttons!) For levels 1-3, the user should write \"1 e & a 2 e & a 1\" representing the sixteenth note division of each beat. While listening to the fragment, the user should put a slash through each division in which a new note begins. From these slashes, the user should determine how best to beam these beats. There are certain conventions for beaming discussed in the SonicFit theory lessons, but it may be just as helpful to see the correct answers and learn how each patter is beamed. Hit the \"show answer\" button to see where slashes were accurately placed and the corresponding notation.\nThis exercise can be done long before learning about beaming. Developing the skill of slashing on the division can and should begin well before learning the proper way to notate the result. This will develop skills that will be very beneficial when taking the next steps.\nLevels 4-6 are in compound duple meter in which the user should write \"1 e a 2 e a 1\", representing the eight division on 68 time signature. For levels 5 and 6, the user may mark between the eighths to represent sixteenth divisions.\nThis exercise plays a short harmonic progression with the bass line slightly louder than the upper voices. On staff paper, users should write out the solfege of the bass line under a staff first, then write the corresponding notes on the staff. You might add the solfege for the top voice above the staff next. Finally, determine the possible choices for chords given the two notes that you already have and your understanding of chord progression what would be most expected, and write the best choice. After clicking \"show answer\" listen again to hear the correct answer.\nThis exercise should be done very quickly. If you have trouble doing it in one or two listenings, then you should go to scale degree ear training, and set the instrument to cello or piano bass and practice listening to low instruments and immediately recognizing the scale degrees played. You will also need a strong understanding of the theory of chord progressions found in the lessons.\nThis exercise plays a short melodic passage so that the user can practice singing it back. This exercise is often used in choir auditions to test how well singers remember pitches. Such auditions also test the singer's familiarity with different types of melodic material, particularly those found in levels 3-6 described below. Practicing this material can increase your familiarty with it; however, to truly master this materal, you should also develop the skills found in melodic fragments, interval and chord ear training and close chromatic framework. The content in level 1 and 2 is primarily conjunct motion using diatonic notes. Level 3 introduces more leaps, and particularly consecutive leaps outlining triadic material. Level 4 includes leaps that do not outline a triad, focusing largely on quartal and quintal material, and level 5 and 6 include highly chromatic and atonal material, in which the notes could not possibly exist in a key without adding accidentals.\nHonor Choir auditions typically test levels 2-5.\nThis is a ear training exercise common in most aural skills pedagogies. The computer plays a melody and the user writes it down. However, SonicFit encourages the following steps for melodic dictation.\n1. Write the counts for every measure before hearing it the first time.\n2. Draw a slash on any count (or between counts) corresponding to the start of a new note while listening for the first time or two.\n3. Next, write the solfege above any slash. To move quickly, you can just write the first letter unless it is chromatically altered.\n4. When done, transcribe the shorthand of slashes and solfege into standard musical notation.\nForms for these dictations can be printed under \"forms\" button, and will show the number of measures and an appropriate width for the measure. Levels 4, 5 and 8 contain excerpts from literature."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:780f0f83-644b-44a2-90f7-8c0af1eef02c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do modern anti-reflective technologies improve vision clarity, and what maintenance procedures ensure their effectiveness for both eyeglasses and vehicle headlights?","answer":"Modern anti-reflective coatings use vacuum deposition technology to apply microscopic layers of metallic oxides that virtually eliminate light reflection, allowing 99.5% of light to pass through eyeglass lenses. These coatings often include hydrophobic and oleophobic layers to repel water and oils. For maintaining clarity, AR-coated lenses require specific cleaning products recommended by opticians, while headlights need regular cleaning using methods like toothpaste, soap with sandpaper, or commercial solutions, followed by protective sealants to prevent UV damage.","context":["Anti-reflective coating (also called AR coating or anti-glare coating) improves both your vision through your lenses and the appearance of your eyeglasses.\nBoth benefits are due to AR coating's ability to eliminate reflections of light from the front and back surface of eyeglass lenses.\nAR coating is especially beneficial when used on high-index lenses, which reflect more light than regular plastic lenses. Generally, the higher the index of refraction of the lens material, the more light that will be reflected from the surface of the lenses.\nFor example, regular plastic lenses reflect roughly 8 percent of light hitting the lenses, so only 92 percent of available light enters the eye for vision. High index plastic lenses can reflect up to 50 percent more light than regular plastic lenses (approximately 12 percent of available light), so even less light is available to the eye for vision. This can be particularly troublesome in low-light conditions, such as when driving at night.\nToday's modern anti-reflective coatings can virtually eliminate the reflection of light from eyeglass lenses, allowing 99.5 percent of available light to pass through the lenses and enter the eye for good vision.\nAnti-reflective coating reduces the glare that you see, as well as the glare that others can see on your lenses.\nBy eliminating reflections, AR coating also makes your eyeglass lenses look nearly invisible so people can see your eyes and facial expressions more clearly. Anti-reflective glasses also are more attractive, so you can look your best in all lighting conditions.\nThe visual benefits of lenses with anti-reflective coating include sharper vision with less glare when driving at night and greater comfort during prolonged computer use (compared with wearing eyeglass lenses without AR coating).\nAnti-reflective coating also is a good idea for sunglasses, because it eliminates glare from sunlight reflecting into your eyes from the back surface of tinted lenses when the sun is behind you. (Generally, AR coating is applied only to the back surface of sunglass lenses because there are no cosmetic or visual benefits to eliminating reflections from the front surface of dark-tinted lenses.)\n- Questions about dry eye? Click to ask our dry eye expert right now\n- Afraid of Lasik? This new interactive quiz separates fact from fiction\n- The LASIK experience: learn what happens before, during and after laser eye surgery surgery\nMost premium anti-reflective coatings include a \"hydrophobic\" surface layer that prevents water spots from forming and makes the lenses easier to clean. Some AR coatings also include an \"oleophobic\" surface layer that repels skin oils and makes it easier to remove smudges from the lenses.\nSome eyeglass lenses have factory-applied AR coating on both lens surfaces. Other lenses, particularly progressive lenses and other multifocal lenses (i.e., bifocals and trifocals), have the coating applied after the lenses have been customized to your eyeglass prescription by an optical lab.\nHow Anti-Reflective Coating Is Applied\nApplying anti-reflective coating to eyeglass lenses is a highly technical process involving vacuum deposition technology.\nThe first step in the AR coating process is to meticulously clean the lenses and inspect them for visible and microscopic surface defects. Even a tiny smudge, piece of lint or hairline scratch on a lens during the coating process can cause a defective AR coating.\nTypically, a production line includes multiple washing and rinsing baths, including ultrasonic cleaning to remove any traces of surface contaminants. This is followed by air drying and heating of the lenses in special ovens to further remove unwanted moisture and gases from the lens surface.\nThe lenses are then loaded into special metal racks with spring-loaded openings so the lenses are held securely but with virtually all lens surfaces exposed for the coating application. The racks are then loaded into the coating chamber. The door of the chamber is sealed, and the air is pumped out of the chamber to create a vacuum.\nWhile the lens racks are rotating in the coating chamber, a power source within the machine focuses a beam of electrons onto a small crucible that contains a series of metal oxides in separate compartments.\nModern vacuum coating machine for applying AR coating to eyeglass lenses. (Image: SatisLoh)\nWhen bombarded by the beam of this electron \"gun\" in succession, the metal oxides are transformed into vapors that fill the coating chamber and adhere to the lenses in a specific order to form a precise multilayer AR coating.\nEach AR coating manufacturer has its own proprietary formula, but generally all anti-reflective coatings consist of multiple microscopic layers of metallic oxides of alternating high and low index of refraction.\nDepending on the AR coating formula, most lenses with anti-reflective coating have a very faint residual color, usually green or blue, that is characteristic of that particular brand of coating.\nAnti-reflective coatings are incredibly thin. The entire multilayer AR coating stack generally is only about 0.2 to 0.3 microns thick, or about 0.02 percent (two one-hundredths of 1 percent) of the thickness of a standard eyeglass lens.\nCaring for Glasses With Anti-Reflective Lenses\nWhen cleaning AR-coated lenses, use only products that your optician recommends. Lens cleaners with harsh chemicals may damage the anti-reflective coating.\nAlso, don't attempt to clean AR-coated lenses without wetting them first. Using a dry cloth on a dry lens can cause lens scratches. And because anti-reflective coating eliminates light reflections that can mask lens surface defects, fine scratches often are more visible on AR-coated lenses than on uncoated lenses.\nAbout the Author: Gary Heiting, OD, is senior editor of AllAboutVision.com.

even if the dimness isn’t severe, the fact that you’re experiencing dimness at all is a clear warning sign that your headlights are in need of a good cleaning.\nyour headlights will accumulate dirt and grime as you operate your vehicle on a daily basis. the change is usually very gradual, but over time your headlights will begin to dim, and before you know it you’ll begin to notice a physical difference in headlight intensity.\ndim lighting typically occurs for two reasons:\n- the dust and grime you pick up from regular wear and tear.\n- the chemical reaction that occurs from the plastic on your headlight cover reacting to uv rays.\nwhy cleaning your headlights is so important\nimagine driving at night. the road is dark, and it’s difficult to see. you throw on your hi-beams to illuminate the road and realize that the light is so dim and foggy that you can barely see a few feet in front of you. it would be frightening if something were to jump out at you in those conditions. it would be even more frightening to hit another car because you couldn’t see where you were going.\nthis is why cleaning your headlights is important. the better you can see, the less likely you’ll get into an accident. with that being said, let’s jump into how to clean your car’s headlight covers properly. we’ll talk about how to properly prep, what products you’ll need, and the actual process of cleaning your headlights.\nbefore you really get in there to give your headlight cover a truly thorough detailing, you should begin with a good prewash. spray down your headlights (and likely the front of the car while you’re at it) and wash away the excess muck and other debris covering your headlights.\nduring this phase, you should clean both the surrounding panels as well as the headlights themselves. after you’ve washed the appropriate\nzones, dry the vehicle until you’ve eliminated every droplet of water.\nonce you’ve cleaned and dried the front of your car, proceed to tape the perimeter of the headlights. painter’s tape will do just fine. essentially you’re looking for something that isn’t too sticky (like duct tape). trace the perimeter of the headlight, avoiding any\nzones you intend to polish.\nkeep in mind that cleaning your turn signals are optional. your turn signals are typically yellow and don’t haze nearly as quickly as your clear headlights. protect any\nzones that you don’t wish to be damaged as you proceed to the polishing phase.\ndifferent ways of cleaning your headlight covers\nit might come as a surprise that one of the easiest and cheapest ways to go about cleaning your headlight covers is to use toothpaste. toothpaste is a light abrasive. thus it’s great at cleaning up any debris that may be sitting on the surface area that you’ll be cleaning.\nfirst, spread the toothpaste over the entire length of the headlight cover using a washcloth. then rinse it off and dry thoroughly. that’ll definitely get the job done, and it’ll save you a ton of money. toothpaste can be found at your local 99 cents store for less than a dollar.\navoid toothpaste with any sort of abrasive material within, such as crystals and cooling beads as this could lead to potential scratching.\nsoap, sandpaper, and polish\nthis step is a bit more expensive than using toothpaste, but it certainly gets the job done. first, use some elbow grease and get rid of as much buildup as possible using soap and water. you’ll basically be cleaning up anything you’ve missed with the initial prewash.\ndry very thoroughly and then use sandpaper to get the gunk that’s really stuck in there. the best sandpaper to use is 400 or 800 grit. after initially sanding down your headlight cover, go back over the same surface with finer sandpaper. afterward, polish until it’s clear as possible. you can either use toothpaste again, or you can go for a commercial polish that you can buy at your local automotive store.\nif you’re willing to spend the money, you could always stock up on commercial cleaning solutions. this is the most expensive method, though it typically brings the peace of mind that your headlights will shine sparkling clear when you’re finished with your detailing job.\nthere are numerous cleaning commercial products out there that all pretty much do the same thing. most headlight commercial cleaning solutions are fairly affordable. despite being the more expensive option, commercial products work just as good as tooth paste or soap and water.\nkeeping your headlights clean with preventative care\nat this point, your headlights should be clean and looking as good as new. hooray! but how do you stop your headlights from getting dirty all over again? preventative care is just as important as the act of cleaning.\nthere are three products you can use to keep your headlights clean for the long term:\nthese products will form a shield that protects your headlights from the harmful effects of uv rays.\nonce you see that your headlight covers are getting dirty again, don’t wait until the situation gets critical. clean them quickly. with constant upkeep and preventative products in place, your headlights will look like new every day.\nfeatured image credit: mikesphotos / pixabay\nin post image credit: sasint / pixabay"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:68d80260-ee03-4cd0-b980-42936c7b0ea4>","<urn:uuid:a3288f10-8b0d-40bf-9583-c481b646c79d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do miners get rewarded in a blockchain system?","answer":"Miners are rewarded with new cryptocurrency (coins) when they successfully create a block. This happens when they bundle transactions into a block and find a valid proof of work before anyone else does. This is the only way new coins are introduced into the blockchain network - there is no central authority minting new coins.","context":["Banking without Banks: Blockchain Simply Explained\nBitcoin and Blockchain\nBitcoin is a digital decentralized currency that has transformed finance. Because it’s decentralized there’s no government that issues bitcoins, and there’re no banks that manage accounts.\nBitcoin is often used for investing, but it’s life changing for migrant workers.\nThere are over 250 million international migrants who transfer money to their family back in their home country. This is known as remittance. The problem with remittance is that fees can be as high as 10%, and it takes weeks for the money to reach its destination. Bitcoin allows migrant workers to send money to their families with almost no fees, with transfers taking less than an hour.\nRemittance is just one possible application of a Blockchain (the tech underlying Bitcoin). To understand what else is possible with Blockchain this article will explain how it works by showing you how you’d design your own decentralized currency.\nLedgers: Keeping Track of Who Owes Who\nWhy is making a decentralized currency so hard?\nLet’s take a look at a basic example of currency without banks or governments, and some of the problems with it.\nIf you and your friends exchanged money frequently, like covering the dinner bill for each other, it would be inconvenient to exchange cash all the time. So you might keep track of who owes who on a ledger (a list of financial transactions).\nThe ledger could be on a website that anybody can see and add to.\nIf Bezos paid $14 for Elon’s free-trade coffee, then either of them could add “Elon pays Bezos $14” to the ledger.\nAt the end of the month, you’d all pay cash to the people you owe.\nOur ledger rules so far:\n- Anybody can add a transaction\n- Anybody can view the ledger\n- Settle up with cash at the end of the month\nDigital Signatures: Controlling Your Own Money\nThere’s a big problem with our ledger protocol.\n“Anybody can add a line” means that Elon could add “Bezos pays Elon $420” even if Bezos never agreed to.\nTo fix this we can say that whoever is sending money has to add their digital signature to the transaction.\nAt first glance it might seem like digital signatures wouldn’t work. Couldn’t people just copy your signature?\nThis is where the first bit of cryptography comes in. Everybody would generate a public / private key pair. Like the name suggests, everybody knows your public key, but only you know your private key.\nHandwritten signatures look the same no matter what document you’re signing. Digital signatures are a lot stronger. They’re a long string of 0s and 1s, and changing the message slightly will completely change the signature.\nWithout diving into the math, signing and verifying transactions is pretty simple. All you need to know is what functions are.\nA function is an operation that takes in an input (a sad cat) does something to it (pets it) and then has an output (a happy cat).\nTo sign a message you give a “sign function” your message and your secret key, and it’ll output a digital signature. Since the signature depends on your secret key, only you can create that signature. And because the signature also depends on the message, nobody can copy your signature and forge it on another message.\nTo verify a message you give a “verify function” a message, the signature on the message, and the public key of the person who signed it. This function will then indicate whether or not the signature is valid.\nAn important point to note is that although the public key is used to verify if a signature came from its associated private key, there’s no way to deduce the private key from its public key.\nOur new ledger protocol:\n- Anybody can add a line with a transaction\n- Anybody can view the ledger\n- Settle up with cash at the end of the month\n- Only signed transactions are valid\nTimestamps: Preventing Duplicate Transactions\nThere’s a small problem with how our ledger and signature system currently works. Since digital signatures only depend on the message and secret key, signature message pairs can be duplicated.\nIf Bill put on the ledger “Bill owes Elon $420” and signed it, Elon could copy the entire transaction, the message AND the signature, to get more money.\nThe fix to this is pretty simple. Each transaction has an identifier that increases by one each transaction. The 42nd transaction would then have the identifier “42” attached to the beginning of the message.\nNow, if somebody tries to copy a transaction to get more money, the signature will be invalid, because you can’t repeat the identifier “42”, and changing it to “43” will completely change the signature.\nCryptocurrencies: No Overspending!\n“Settle up with cash at the end of the month”\nWhat about if somebody doesn’t settle up at the end of the month, and disappears forever?\nTo prevent somebody from taking advantage of this, we can make a rule that people can buy “Ledger Coin” (our own cryptocurrency) with cash, that all transactions are made in Ledger Coin, and that overspending isn’t allowed.\nNow, “settling up” is done automatically, since all transactions are made in Ledger Coin.\nAt any point in time, you can turn your Ledger Coin into cash, but you can only make transactions with Ledger Coin that you have.\nWait! How can ledger coin have any actual value?\nLedger coin and any other currency has value because people think they do. If people are willing to give cash or services in exchange for your ledger coin then it’s valuable.\nRight now the ledger is on a website. If the website goes down or gets hacked, nobody will be able to trade currency. If the website owner changes the rules, then everybody could suffer.\nCentralized systems only need one point of failure to be compromised. Decentralizing the ledger solves this problem, by giving everyone a copy of the ledger. Everybody has a copy of the ledger, and is in charge of keeping their own copy up to date.\nNow, when Elon wants to pay Bezos $10 for his window, he’ll broadcast the message “Elon pays Bezos $10” to everyone.\nThere’s a really big problem with this approach. When you see the message “Elon pays You $5” how can you be sure that everybody else got this message, and that you’ll be able to use these Ledger Coins with others? Maybe Elon only sent that message to you, and nobody else.\nWe need a protocol that tells how to accept or reject transactions and in what order, to ensure that your copy of the ledger will be the same as everybody else’s in the world.\nThe solution? Trust the ledger with the most computational work put into it.\nTo do this, all we need to use is something called a cryptographic hash function and some clever tricks.\nA cryptographic hash function takes in a message, does some crazy math to it, and outputs a hash (a string of 0s and 1s) with a fixed length.\nThe most commonly used hash function, SHA256, will turn any message into a string of bits 256 characters long. The output is called a “hash” and it looks random, but it’s not. Every time you give the message “Blockchain” to SHA256 it will output the same hash.\nChanging the message going into SHA256 will change the hash in a completely unpredictable way. Importantly, when given a hash there’s no way to figure out what message generated it. If you wanted to create a hash that started with five 0s, you’d have to randomly guess and check messages.\nProof of Work\nThe reason why SHA256 is useful is because it can be used to prove that a large amount of computational work went into a specific list of transactions.\nImagine someone shows you a list of transactions and says “I found a special number, that when you put it at the end of this transaction, and apply SHA256 to the whole thing, the hash starts with 30 zeros.”\nFor a random message, the odds that the hash will start with 30 zeros is 1/2³⁰, which is about one in a billion.\nBecause the hash of a message after applying SHA256 is essentially random, the only way to find a special number that gives a hash with 30 zeros is by guessing and checking. That means the person had to go through about a billion different numbers to find a special one.\nTo verify that the number is special, you just have to run SHA256 on the list of transactions with the special number at the end, and check that the hash starts with 30 zeroes.\nSHA256 allows us to verify that somebody put in a lot of computational work for a specific message, without having to the same work again.\nThis is called “Proof of Work”.\nBlock + Chain\nLet’s go back to our decentralized ledger.\nThere might be a lot of potential ledgers being broadcasted. Some might be from honest people, and others fraudulent.\nAs a rule, we’re only going to trust the ledger with the most computational work put into it. To do this we’ll organize a ledger into blocks. Each block has a list of transactions and a proof of work that makes the hash of the entire block start with a large amount of zeroes.\nJust like how a transaction needs a signature to be valid, a block needs a proof of work to be valid.\nTo form a chain of blocks, the header of each block will contain the hash of the previous block. Now if a criminal tried to change any transaction in a past block, its hash would change, which will make its proof of work invalid and will also change the header of the next block and its hash. This would make all the following blocks have invalid proof of works.\nProof of work makes it computationally infeasible to modify past blocks, making them effectively unalterable. This is known as immutability and is why blockchains are secure for transacting money and are censorship-resistant.\nSince each of the blocks are linked tightly to each other, we call this type of ledger a blockchain.\nIn practice, there’s only a subset of users who compute proof of works. These people are known as miners.\nMiners listen for transactions, bundle them into a block, and then start computing a proof of work for their block. If they find a valid proof of work before anyone else they’ll broadcast their block to the entire world. If somebody else creates a valid block before they do, they’ll update their ledger and get started on the next block in the chain.\nComputing proof of works for blocks takes a lot of computing power and energy. To incentivise miners, there are block rewards. The creator of any block is rewarded with some Ledger Coin for their work.\nThis is the only way that new ledger coins are introduced into the blockchain network. There’s no central government that mints new coins. New coins come into being from miners who create blocks.\nWe now have a full outline for how a decentralized currency system works!\n- Anyone can submit a transaction to be put in a block\n- Transactions are signed so users can only spend their own money\n- Users can only spend money that they actually have\n- Proof of work shows that computational work has been put into a block\n- Blocks are chained together so that past transactions cannot be modified\n- Miners are users who bundle transactions into blocks and find valid proof of works. They’re rewarded with cryptocurrency when they “mine” a block\n- Honest users will always trust the longest chain of blocks\nIf you’d like to play around with Blockchain concepts like hashing or mining, this website has great interactive demos.\nBlockchain and Beyond\nBlockchains aren’t only limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum is another technology that uses blockchain to allow users to do almost any computation in a decentralized and immutable manner. It allows for decentralized computing, file storage, investing and more."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:62d1f13f-c79e-40dc-b434-4f250fd0b100>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm interested in downtown Glendale's development - what are the key features of its urban transformation and commercial district?","answer":"Downtown Glendale is centered on Brand Boulevard, which serves as the city's main commercial street. The area features a small but notable skyscraper district, consisting of five buildings over 20 stories and six more between 15-19 stories, mostly built during the late 1980s boom. The downtown area has been experiencing a residential and mixed-use mini-boom, with the Americana at Brand being a prominent development. There are numerous ongoing and recently completed projects in the area. Despite some people describing Glendale as boring, the Brand Boulevard area is actively vibrant with retail establishments.","context":["Having bid a fond “see ya around” to Palms, we turn our eyes to observing Glendale and getting to know this part of the LA region better. An outcome of LA’s legendary traffic and underpowered transit is that it can be punishing to try to experience parts of the region far from where you live. The Valley isn’t that far from the Westside, but the 405 makes it seem far. That problem certainly applies to travel between Palms (the Westside) and the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena area, which stands out even among the many difficult trips in the region.\nFor readers outside Los Angeles and not familiar with its confusing municipal boundaries, we should perhaps first explain where Glendale is located. Glendale is a separate incorporated city, not part of the City of Los Angeles. Downtown Glendale is about 8-9 miles due north of downtown Los Angeles, though the city’s northern reaches extend over 15 miles from downtown LA. Glendale borders the cities of Burbank, Pasadena, and La Canada-Flintridge, along with an unincorporated neighborhood of LA County known as La Crescenta-Montrose. Glendale also shares two borders with the City of LA – Sunland-Tujunga to the northwest, and Atwater Village, Glassell Park, and Eagle Rock to the south. Lastly, Glendale’s northern limits extend up to the Angeles National Forest in the San Gabriel Mountains. The Verdugo Mountains separate downtown and the southern part of the city from the northern part, located in the Crescenta Valley, a narrow valley between the Verdugos and the San Gabriels.\nAn unconventional way to define Glendale might be as the valley of the Verdugo Wash. This is a short tributary of the LA River that joins the river near where it takes a sharp right turn from running west to east through the SF Valley and heads south to downtown LA. Like the LA River, it is fully contained in a concrete flood control channel. The Verdugo Wash runs east to the north of downtown Glendale, then gradually turns northeast, north, and northwest as it wraps around the mountains of the same name into the Crescenta Valley. Everything south of the 134 – all of downtown Glendale and many residential areas – actually drains away from the Verdugo Wash, but topography makes one suspect that this area is sort of an alluvial fan deposited by the stream. There might be potential for improvements to the Verdugo Wash like those proposed for the LA River.\nThe primary freeways serving Glendale are the 5, the 2, and the 134, which roughly form an upside down triangle around downtown Glendale. Despite serving Glendale, these portions of the 5 and the 2 are almost entirely in Los Angeles. North of the 134, the 2 continues north through the more mountainous portions of the city, ending at the 210, which serves the Crescenta Valley.\nTraffic on the 5 is perhaps not quite as bad as the 10 and the 405 on the Westside, but it’s bad enough. Since the 5 runs the full length of the Golden State, it seems to have a larger volume of background traffic, and a notably higher amount of truck traffic – even if your carpool, like mine, leaves at 5 am. Truck traffic is probably increased by the gap in the 710, which eliminates a potential route around downtown LA between the ports and destinations to the north.\nThe 134, together with the 101 in the Valley and the 210 east of Pasadena, forms a long, continuous east-west freeway stretching from Ventura to San Bernardino, another heavily used corridor in a region with no shortage of well-used freeways. While the 101 and the 134 in the Valley and the 210 east of Pasadena get heavily congested during peak periods, the 134 between Glendale and Pasadena seems to escape the worst traffic. Astute eyes will note that the short Colorado Street freeway, connecting the 5 to San Fernando Rd and Colorado St in Glendale, looks like an abandoned attempt at routing the 134 through the heart of downtown Glendale. In fact, Caltrans’ small white bridge identifying signs still mark these structures as being located on the 134, so there’s potentially a companion post to Walk Eagle Rock’s post on the 134 being rerouted to avoid downtown Eagle Rock. The selected route for the 134 is not only better for downtown Glendale, but much better for a freeway network than the puzzling location of the Colorado St freeway’s end at Griffith Park.\nThe 2 is perhaps best known for the portion of the freeway that wasn’t built – the portion from the existing end in Echo Park to the west, through Hollywood, Beverly Hills, and Century City to the Westside. This leaves the extant part in Northeast LA and Glendale as one of the more lightly used parts of LA’s network, though congestion on connecting freeways like the 5 can turn parts of it into a giant queue. It’s also the reason it’s hard to get to the Westside from Glendale in the absence of good transit options.\nOk, enough about freeways, let’s get on to the things that will really interest readers here: transit. At first glance, your LA Metro map makes things look pretty good.\nHowever, what we have here is a classic case of wide coverage with relatively poor frequency. Here’s a look at some important routes serving Glendale.\nRoutes 90 & 91 serve Glendale Ave, which runs to the east side of downtown and the Crescenta Valley. Route 92 serves Brand Blvd, which is Glendale’s main commercial street. Route 94 & Rapid 794 form a very long route from downtown LA to the independent City of San Fernando, near the northern end of the eponymous Valley. This serves only the western edges of Glendale, but it’s the closest route to me. Finally, Routes 180 & 181, & Rapid 780, serve east-west travel between Pasadena, Glendale, & Hollywood.\nEvening and late night headways fall off pretty quickly, making it tough to depend on these routes if you want to do anything other than work your 8 to 5. The two Rapid routes, 780 & 794, don’t run at all late nights or on weekends. Rapid 780 runs with good peak frequencies, and because it’s through-routed as the Rapid for both Routes 180/181 and Route 217 (Fairfax), it sort of functions as the transit route doing what the 2 freeway was supposed to do. (Don’t bother with Route 201, which only runs hourly.) Therefore, when Rapid 780 isn’t running, riders face an additional transfer between Routes 180/191 and Route 217. On top of that; there are the usual reliability issues; on a recent weekday morning my Next Trip app promised 794 service in 42 minutes and 57 minutes. You can sort of see why the BRU complains about this when rail riders get 10-12 minute headways all day, every day.\nOn the rail side, Metrolink offers a Glendale station at the very southern edge of the city, adjacent to Atwater Village. Frequencies during peak periods are pretty good – there are 30 trains per day – but service ends early, going to hourly or worse at about 6:30pm and ending altogether at 9:30pm. The worst feature of Metrolink is the absurd pricing; a one way ticket from Glendale to Downtown LA is $5.50 to travel a distance of 6 miles, a distance you can double or triple on Metro rail lines for $1.75.\nThe upside of all of this is that there’s a lot of low-hanging fruit for transit improvements in the area – things that don’t involve, say, building an expensive underperforming light rail line to bridge the gap in the 710 freeway.\nAs a first take, transit improvements should include improving frequency and spans of service. Options to improve reliability, such as bus lanes and signal priority, should also be explored. On the rail side, Measure R2 plans should explore upgrading these Metrolink Lines to rapid transit frequencies, though that should probably be contingent on upzoning some of the land near the rail corridors.\nSpeaking of development, let’s talk a little bit about the built environment in Glendale. As mentioned before, Brand Blvd serves as the heart of downtown, with Glendale’s small skyscraper district (five buildings of 20+ stories, six more of 15-19 stories, almost all outcomes of the late 80s boom) centered on Brand and the 134 freeway. Downtown Glendale has been undergoing a residential and mixed-use mini-boom, with Americana at Brand being the best known development. Since there are many projects in progress or recently completed, it’s probably worth doing two separate posts, one on the commercial projects built in the 1980s and early 1990s, one on the ongoing residential projects. Some people deride Glendale as boring, but having spent a couple evenings on Brand Blvd, I’m willing to say they either don’t know what they’re talking about or are using “boring” as code for “full of retail establishments but not the kind that I like”.\nOutside of downtown, there are residential neighborhoods that are actually somewhat similar to, well, to Palms. The residential density of the Census tract I moved to is only a little bit lower than that of the tract I moved from. The biggest difference is that the percentage of single-family residences (SFRs) in my new neighborhood is higher than in Palms, where you might miss the remaining SFRs if you didn’t know where to look. The apartment building stock in Glendale also appears to be newer, with few dingbats and more apartments dating to the 1980s boom, something supported by a casual look at Property Shark. Nevertheless, I’ve done the math, and my apartment building’s 9 units on a 50’x150’ lot are exactly classic R3 dingbat density. When I walk around, though, none of the remaining SFRs are being replaced by apartments, and at first glance the zoning appears to make even existing apartments non-conforming. I’m sure there’s a fascinating story behind that, one we’ll no doubt have to explore in more detail in a future post. . ."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cf5e9a28-e60f-4243-a65f-cc6acb8b56ce>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between feature selection in machine learning and PCA's component selection for reducing data dimensions?","answer":"Feature selection in machine learning and PCA's component selection differ in their fundamental approaches. Feature selection methods focus on choosing subsets of original features based on their predictive power, using techniques like ranking features by importance, correlation with response, or wrapper selection methods. In contrast, PCA creates entirely new components that are linear combinations of original features, selecting them based on the amount of variance they explain in the data. The first principal component accounts for the maximum variance, followed by subsequent components that are uncorrelated with previous ones. While feature selection maintains the original features' interpretability, PCA transforms the data into new uncorrelated dimensions.","context":["Use domain knowledge and transformations to extract and optimize features from raw data\nFeature engineering is the process of turning raw data into features to be used by machine learning. Feature engineering is difficult because extracting features from signals and images requires deep domain knowledge and finding the best features fundamentally remains an iterative process, even if you apply automated methods.\nFeature engineering encompasses one or more of the following steps:\n- Feature extraction to generate candidate features\n- Feature transformation, which maps features to make them more suitable for downstream modeling\n- Feature selection identifies subsets that provide the better predictive power in modeling the data while reducing model size and simplifying prediction.\nFor example, sports statistics include numeric data like games played, average time per game, and points scored, all broken down by player. Feature extraction in this context includes compressing these statistics into derived numbers, like points per game or average time to score. Then feature selection becomes a question of whether you build a model using just these ratios, or whether the original statistics still help the model make more accurate predictions.\nManual feature extraction for signal and image data requires signal and image processing knowledge, though automated techniques such as wavelet transforms have proven very effective. These techniques are useful even if you apply deep learning to signal data since deep neural nets have trouble uncovering structure in raw signal data. The traditional approach for extracting features from text data is modeling text as bag of words. Modern approaches apply deep learning to encode the context of words, such as the popular word embedding technique word2vec.\nFeature transformation includes popular data preparation techniques, such as normalization to address large differences in the scale of features, but also aggregation to summarize data, filtering to remove noise, and dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and factor analysis.\nMany methods for feature selection are supported by MATLAB®. Some are based on ranking features by importance, which could be as basic as correlation with the response. Some machine learning models estimate feature importance during the learning algorithm (“embedded” feature selection), while so-called filter-based methods infer a separate model of feature importance. Wrapper selection methods iteratively add and remove candidate features using a selection criterion. The figure below provides an overview of the various aspects of feature engineering to guide practitioners in finding performant features for their machine learning models.\nDeep learning has become known for taking raw image and signal data as input, thus eliminating the feature engineering step. While that works well for large image and video data sets, feature engineering is still critical for good performance when applying deep learning to smaller data sets and signal-based problems.\n- Feature engineering is essential for applying machine learning, and also relevant for applications of deep learning to signals.\n- Wavelet scattering delivers good features from signal and image data without manual feature extraction\n- Additional steps such as feature transformation and selection can yield more accurate yet smaller sets of features suitable for deployment to hardware constrained environments.\nRanking features by applying the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) algorithm implemented in the\nfscmrmr function in MATLAB yields good features for classification without long runtimes, as demonstrated in this example. Large drops in importance scores imply that you can confidently determine the threshold on which features to use for your model, while small drops indicate that you may have to include lots of additional features to avoid a significant loss in accuracy for the resulting model.","PCA with Python | Principal Component Analysis Machine Learning | KGP Talkie\nPrincipal Component Analysis(PCA)\nAccording to Wikipedia, PCA is a statistical procedure that uses an\northogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly\ncorrelated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called\nThese are the new axes that descibe the\nvariation in the data.\n- Principal component 1: The axis which spans the\nmost variationof the data.\n- Principal component 2: The axis which spans the\nsecond most variationof the data.\n- Principal component 3: The axis which spans the\nthird most variationof the data and so on.\nWhen to use PCA\nWe can use PCA in the following cases:\n- Data Visualization.\n- It is used to find\ninter-relationbetween variables in the data.\nSpeedingMachine Learning (ML) Algorithm.\n- It’s often used to visualize\n- As number of variables are\ndecreasingit makes further analysis simpler.\nObjectives of PCA\nThe main objectives of the PCA are:\n- It is basically a\nnon-dependentprocedure in which it reduces attribute space from a large number of variables to a smaller number of factors.\nPCAis basically a\ndimension reductionprocess but there is no guarantee that the\n- Main task in this\nPCAis to select a subset of variables from a larger set, based on which original variables have the highest\ncorrelationwith the principal amount.\nHow to do PCA\nAs there are as many\nprincipal components as there are variables in the data, principal components are constructed in such a manner that the first principal component accounts for the largest possible\nvariance in the data set .\nThe second principal component is calculated in the same way, with the condition that it is\nuncorrelated with (i.e., perpendicular to) the first principal component and that it accounts for the next\nOnce fit, the\neigenvalues and principal components can be accessed on the PCA class via the\nPrincipal Axis Method\nPCA will search a\nlinear combination of variables so that we can extract\nmaximum variance from the variables.
