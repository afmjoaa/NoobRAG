{"question":"Hello! I am interested to understand space heater safety at home. What are the potential fire hazards from furniture near heaters, and what should we know about protecting pets from these devices?","answer":"Space heaters can ignite furniture if not placed at a safe distance, particularly with older furniture that may not meet current safety regulations. Very flammable materials in furniture can catch fire and emit dangerous gases. The risk extends to curtains, especially since heaters are often placed near windows where cold spots occur. Paper products and clothing are also highly susceptible to catching fire. Regarding pet safety, particularly for cats, several precautions are necessary. The heater should have safety features like tip-over and overheat protection, be placed away from pets' reach, and all cords should be inaccessible. Cats can accidentally knock over heaters or burn themselves on heating elements. Pet owners should also monitor their cats for signs of overheating and maintain appropriate room temperatures. Never leave the heater unattended when pets are present.","context":["Although electrical power is the most secure and most handy fuel in numerous heating situations, it is of study course not without the need of its inherent challenges.

In the case of electric heaters, this contains the use of synthetic polymers in wiring, which are comparable to rubber in their ability to insulate. Also, modern day circuit breakers are able to disable a circuit in the case of a limited circuit, or overloaded process.\nSadly electric powered room heaters are nonetheless responsible for quite a few accidents and deaths, in spite of these fashionable improvements. Fire, fairly than electrocution, remains the most significant hazard. These fires, normally brought on by malfunctioning components or careless use of the heater, are liable not only for injuries and deaths each and every calendar year, they also bring about tens of millions of lbs . of damage to properties and property.\nThe aspects of a lot of electric place heaters are not only dangerous if they malfunction, the inherent heat can in alone be a hazard. If the heater is not put a risk-free distance away from neighboring furnishings, really flammable elements can be established alight, often emitting risky gases into the atmosphere. Though regulations relating satisfactory resources in furnishings have been tightened considering in new years, quite a few previous merchandise continue being in circulation.\nAs properly as objects of household furniture, curtains are a significant problem. This is due heaters are likely to be placed at the edge of a area, making it possible for the heat to reach all sections of it. Also, as the location in the vicinity of home windows have a tendency to be the coldest section of a place, the heater is frequently placed in this area, earning the threat of overheating curtains a incredibly serious possibility.\nPaper goods are also incredibly considerably at possibility, as effectively as products of clothes, which are frequently deliberately positioned close to to heaters to get rid of cold or moist. Of class it goes without the need of expressing that all forms of flammable liquid have to be kept properly away from fires and heaters. Still, in spite of this becoming obvious, 1000’s of accidents arise every year mainly because this very simple advice is entirely overlooked.\nDrinking water is specially harmful when working with an electric heater. Even even though there are never any electrical electrical power points in a fashionable bathroom, which in alone is testimony to the risk of electric power blended with drinking water, modern-day homes are generally fitted with a stand-alone electric heater on the wall. In this situation it is in particular crucial to make confident that all needed security checks are carried out on a standard foundation.

{"question":"What is the connection between HTML and Typography's Digital Revolution?","answer":"HTML is used to specify text layout and formatting for webpages, while the digital revolution in typography in the 1980s brought new forms of typography for PCs and revolutionized print with laser printers. Both developments were part of the broader digitalization of text presentation, with HTML becoming a standard for web content layout and digital typography enabling new forms of computer-based design.","context":["Case study: The World Wide Web\nThe World Wide Web [www.w3.org I, Berners-Lee 1991] is an evolving system for publishing and accessing resources and services across the Internet. Through commonly available web browsers, users retrieve and view documents of many types, listen to audio streams and view video streams, and interact with an unlimited set of services. The Web began life at the European requirement to organize their knowledge. This means that documents contain links (or hyperlinks) – references to other documents and resources that are also stored in the Web. It is fundamental to the user’s experience of the Web that when they encounter a given image or piece of text within a document, this will frequently be accompanied by links to related documents and other resources. The structure of links can be arbitrarily complex and the set of resources that can be added is unlimited – the ‘web’ of links is indeed world-wide.\nBush  conceived of hypertextual structures over 50 years ago; it was with the development of the Internet that this idea could be manifested on a world-wide scale.\nThe Web is an open system: it can be extended and implemented in new ways without disturbing its existing functionality. First, its operation is based on communication standards and document or content standards that are freely\npublished and widely implemented. For example, there are many types of browser, each in many cases implemented on several platforms; and there are many implementations of web servers. Any conformant browser can retrieve resources from any conformant server. So users have access to browsers on the majority of the devices that they use, from mobile phones to desktop computers.\nSecond, the Web is open with respect to the types of resource that can be published and shared on it. At its simplest, a resource on the Web is a web page or some other type of content that can be presented to the user, such as media files and documents in\nPortable Document Format. If somebody invents, say, a new image-storage format, then images in this format can immediately be published on the Web. Users require a means of viewing images in this new format, but browsers are designed to accommodate new\ncontent-presentation functionality in the form of ‘helper’ applications and ‘plug-ins’. The Web has moved beyond these simple data resources to encompass services, such as electronic purchasing of goods. It has evolved without changing its basic\narchitecture. The Web is based on three main standard technological components:\n• the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), a language for specifying the contents and layout of pages as they are displayed by web browsers;\n• Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), also known as Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), which identify documents and other resources stored as part of the Web;\n• a client-server system architecture, with standard rules for interaction (the HyperText Transfer Protocol – HTTP) by which browsers and other clients fetch documents and other resources from web servers.

Throughout his long career he has created types for hot metal composition, phototyping and ultimately the digital revolution. Among his famous types are Melior and Optima. A true giant of typography.\n- One of the most popular forms of typography in the 1950s, the International Style (also referred to as ‘Swiss School’) assimilated the typographical principles of Bauhaus, De Stilj and Jan Tschichold’s New Typography, negating decoration and emphasizing the social potency of typography.\n- Paul Rand (1914-1996, USA) was an incredibly influential member of the ‘New York School’, greatly raising the profile of art directors. Fond of simplicity and easily recognized designs, one of his most famous creations is the IBM logo. When art went pop in the 1960s, it radically affected aesthetics, reflecting the disposal of consumer culture. Pop art created an allusive form of typography, referencing consumer products. Campbell soup anybody?\nWhat would Jimi Hendrix and Frank Zappa albums look like without the flowing art nouveau influenced typography of the Psychedelia movement? Hallucinogens greatly inspired the wild textual and pictorial distortions.\n- In the 1970s the earliest computer typesetting was created by fusing photocomposition with new digital techniques. Ultimately, this revolutionized the capabilities of design professionals to design on their computer screens.\n- Based in Madison Avenue, New York, the International Typeface Corporation (ITC) promoted the rights of designers and stimulated the creation of new designs and type revivals. Ed Benguiat (1927-, USA) and Tony Stan (1917-1988, USA) were two of their most famous designers.\nThe digital revolution in the 1980s saw new forms of typography created for PCs, music videos and computer games. Films like Tron helped disseminate the new digital aesthetic. Print was revolutionised with the development of laser printers and a great spirit of experimentation swept through professional design.\n- Neville Brody (1957-, UK) revolutionist magazine graphic design working for The Face and Arena throughout the 80s. Top types included Insignia (1989), Arcadia (1990) and FF Harlem (1993).\n- Founded in 1981 by Matthew Carter and Mike Parker, Bitstream was the first digital type foundry and continues to operate today. Developing fonts for businesses, Carter created fonts like Charter (1993) and Verdana (1994).\n- Adobe started in 1982, creating the PostScript graphics programmed, which continues to be the standard graphic design language. Sumner Stone (1945-, USA) was extremely influential as Adobe Director of Typography (1984-1991), creating the Stone series of fonts (1987), Print (1991) and EndsMeansMends (1991).\n- When the Macintosh was launched in 1984, its initially low resolution demanded new screen fonts. Set up in 1984 by Zuzana Licko (1961, Czechoslovakia) and Rudy Vanderlans (1955, Holland), Emigre magazine addressed the issue of Mac font limitations, creating fonts like Modula (1985), Matrix (1986), Senator (1988) and Dogma (1994).\n- In 1990, the famous functional type Arial was designed for Microsoft by Monotype, quickly becoming known around the globe due to it being the primary Windows font. Also in 1990, Barry Deck (1952-, USA) designed Template Gothic, which became one of the most successful fonts of the 1990s.\n- Postmodern typography became all the rage in the 90s, as graphic designers like David Carson (1956-, USA) and Carlos Segura (1956-, Cuba) broke all the established rules, altering body text, flipping letters and creating fonts so decorative they became more akin to visuals.

{"question":"How does a BB gun's loading mechanism work when preparing to shoot?","answer":"A BB gun's loading mechanism works through gravity feed. When the muzzle is elevated during cocking, BBs fall down a sloped surface with a funnel-like channel at its lowest end. The BBs organize into a single column in this channel and drop toward a BB seat where a small magnet holds them in place. The 'magazine' is actually a hollow cavity formed between the inner shot tube (true barrel) and the outer sheet metal barrel. The magnetic seat ensures the BB stays in place even if you shoot straight down.","context":["by Tom Gaylord\nCopyright PyramydAir.com ©2009. All Rights Reserved.\nThis article originally appeared in Airgun Illustrated magazine, but I thought it was interesting enough to bring it to you here.\nShow an airgun of almost any type to someone who doesn't know airguns, and they'll call it a BB gun. Many will call it a Red Ryder. Veteran airgunners are used to this reaction from the public, but when they get with other enthusiasts the conversation becomes deeper and more precise. But not always! I discovered a few years ago that very few real airgunners are aware of just how a BB gun powerplant really works, so I thought I'd take the time to illustrate it.\nDaisy helped me with this project by sending the shot tube and spring mechanism for one of their modern lever-action airguns. We'll call it a Red Ryder, and it may well be, but the mechanism is common to more than just a single model. Because I have a modern mechanism to examine, I will report on just that; but if you take the time to look at the older models, you'll see a lot of their design has been carried forward.\nThe BB gun powerplant is a hybrid of both the spring-piston and the catapult designs. The one we will examine uses gravity to feed the BBs, though other types, such as a spring-powered forced-feed magazine found in a Daisy model No. 25 pump BB gun, will work just as well with this powerplant. For the rest of this discussion, please refer to the illustrations as you read.\n1. Prepare to fire\nThe gun is cocked and ready to fire, with the hollow air tube retracted just behind the next BB. The BB is held in place by a small magnet. So, even if you shoot straight down, a BB should come out. The \"magazine\" is nothing more than the hollow cavity formed between the inner shot tube (the true barrel) and the outer sheetmetal \"barrel\" of the gun. When the muzzle is elevated to cock the lever, gravity pulls the BBs down against a sloped surface that has a funnel-like channel at its lowest end. The BBs organize into a single column in this channel, and they drop down toward the BB seat where the magnet is located. All of this action depends on the muzzle being elevated, and nothing but gravity holds those BBs in place; so, they realign this way every time the gun is cocked.\n2. Gun is fired\nThe sear has released the piston so the mainspring drives it forward. At the same time, the air tube that projects from the center of the piston has pushed the BB off its magnetic seat and started it down the barrel. A low initial velocity is imparted by this mechanical catapulting action. This is the catapult part of the powerplant.\n3. The compressed-air blast\nThe piston has slammed to a stop against the back of the shot tube, squeezing all the air from the compression chamber and through the hole at the back of the air tube. The air is now highly compressed and travels up the air tube, where it exits behind the BB that is already in motion. It imparts a boost of velocity to the BB, accelerating it to its terminal velocity. This is the spring-piston part of the powerplant.\n4. Gun is cocked\nCocking withdraws the piston and air tube assembly, making room for a BB to roll down and be captured by the magnetic seat. The gun is now ready to fire again.\nThat's the cycle of the BB gun powerplant. As you now can see, it relies on both a catapult action and a spring piston to do its job. The combination of these two forces works like the booster rockets in a space vehicle; only in this instance, the boost means that the mainspring can be made light enough for younger folks to cock, yet still supply adequate power to launch a BB.\nSpring & piston assembly: The mainspring is held captive by the piston assembly. A spring anchor in the gun holds the back of the spring steady when the cocking lever withdraws the piston and compresses the spring. Notice the long air tube that projects from the front of the black piston seal on the right. It fits inside the shot tube assembly, where it aligns with the barrel.\nPiston detail: The genius of the design is the small hole at the base of the air tube. When the piston slams against the rear of the shot tube, all the air in between is driven through this hole and up the air tube to exit behind the BB. By that time, the air tube has already accelerated the BB to a low velocity in the barrel, and the compressed air acts as a booster.\nShot tube: The shot tube consistes of the real barrel (the outside sheetmetal \"barrel\" is for looks as well as forming the outside wall of the BB magazine) and the part of the magazine that organizes BBs and sends them back to the magnetic seat one at a time to be shot from the gun. The slope of the back part of the shot tube makes BBs fall toward the alignment channel every time the gun is cocked.\nShot tube detail: This shows how the gravity-feed mechanism works. The oval cross-section at the rear of the shot tube forms a perfectly round floor inside the BB magazine. The floor slants down to an organizing channel, where BBs are sorted into a single stack. At the bottom of the channel, a hole in the shot tube lets one BB fall onto a magnetic seat when the air tube is withdrawn during cocking. This organization of BBs occurs every time the muzzle is elevated during cocking. The white synthetic seal at the back of the shot tube mates with the piston seal to cushion it when it comes forward. Though this is a modern version of the mechanism, it has worked essentially the same way for about a century.\nThere are other types of BB gun powerplants, of course. Some are common, like the CO2 guns that simply blast the BB out the barrel, but others are very subtle. In future issues we may look into some of these powerplants as well, but the one we looked at here is by far the most common and most important type of BB gun powerplant there is."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3f6767fd-05e8-439c-acaa-4e29c8536d9c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm comparing American military victories and defeats. How did the outcomes of the Battle of Plattsburgh and the initial Capture of Fort Erie differ in terms of force ratios and strategic impact?","answer":"The battles had dramatically different force ratios and strategic impacts. At Plattsburgh, American forces under Macomb were heavily outnumbered, with just 1,500 regulars and less than 2,000 militia successfully repelling 14,000 British troops. This victory, along with successes at Lake Champlain and Baltimore, led Britain to accept peace terms that kept the US intact and returned Michigan to American control. In contrast, at Fort Erie, American forces under Jacob Brown easily outnumbered the British garrison of 137 soldiers, leading to a quick capture with less than 10 American casualties. While this capture provided the Americans a base for further operations, its strategic impact was limited as the fort was eventually abandoned and blown up in November 1814.","context":["Remembering Our County’s Namesake General\nBy Dan Heaton\nResolved, That the thanks of Congress be, and they are hereby presented to Major General Macomb, and, through him, to the officers and men of the regular army under his command, and to the militia and volunteers of New York and Vermont, for their gallantry and good conduct, in defeating the enemy at Plattsburg on the eleventh of September; repelling, with one thousand five hundred men, aided by a body of militia and volunteers from New York and Vermont, a British veteran army, greatly superior in number, and that the President of the United States be requested to cause a gold medal to be struck, emblematic of this triumph, and presented to Major General Macomb. – Resolution of Congress November 3, 1814 (Note that in the resolution, “Plattsburg” is spelled incorrectly – the “ h” is left off the end of the town’s name.)\nWhen the Swiss Baroness Edith d’Hauteville died around Christmas time 2014, it set into motion a major event in the centuries-long history of the Macomb family. D’Hauteville was the great-greatgreat- great-great granddaughter of Gen. Alexander Macomb, the Detroit native and War of 1812 hero for whom Macomb County is named. With her death, her surviving heirs decided to sell off the family’s 30-room estate in the Swiss Alps as well as a number of her other possessions – including the gold medal that had been awarded to Gen. Macomb after he and a small troop of American soldiers essentially saved the American republic in a now-mostly forgotten battle.\nSome 35 years after the Revolutionary War provided American independence from England, conflict in Europe caused tensions to flare again between the fledgling United States and its former mother country. The War of 1812 started poorly for the Americans. Most notably to those in Macomb County, perhaps, the United States lost control of Michigan territory, after suffering major defeats at the hands of British forces – along with their Native American allies – in Detroit, Monroe and on Mackinac Island. English troops then famously entered Washington, D.C. in August of 1814, setting a torch to the White House. With U.S. defeats mounting, English generals launched what looked to be a sure-fire path to total victory – an invasion of some 14,000 British troops from Canada into New York, supported by an impressive British fleet in the lower Great Lakes.\nBorn in Detroit in 1782, Alexander Macomb joined the American Army in 1800. In 1802, while serving with an engineer squadron, he helped build the United States Military Academy at West Point, taking some instruction there along the way – making him one of the very first officers to stand in West Point’s Long Gray Line of officers who have served their nation. By the War of 1812, Macomb was a brigadier general, in charge of about 1,500 regulars and less than 2,000 militia men in New York state, and tasked with defending the U.S. from invasion from the north. Miraculously, Macomb’s motley assembly was able to do just that – repulsing an invasion force at Plattsburgh, NY, despite being outnumbered more than four to one. Coupled with an American naval victory in a major battle in Lake Champlain and a successful American defense the next day against an invasion force in Baltimore, Md., the British decided to accept American peace terms that kept the U.S. as an intact nation – and kept the British out. And, the treaty returned Michigan back to the United States!\nBack in Washington, D.C., Congress was so delighted with the victories, that it voted the “Thanks of Congress” to Macomb’s soldiers and ordered that four special gold medals be struck and awarded to Macomb and commanders from the naval battle and Baltimore victory. Macomb, the “Hero of Plattsburgh” was also promoted to major general (two stars) – the highest rank in the Army at the time.\nMacomb was also named the commanding general of the U.S. Army, a position he would hold until his death. Among Macomb’s actions as the nation’s first professional commanding general, was an effort to increase pay for his enlisted soldiers, seeking to create more professionalism – and less desertion – in the ranks, something that has now become a hallmark of the U.S. military. Macomb also implemented relief payments for widows and orphans of military officers who died in the line of duty.\nPopular among both with his men and nationally, Macomb died of a heart condition in 1841 at the age of 59. Sometime before his death, Macomb gave his Congressional Gold Medal to his son, also named Alexander, who in turn gave it to his daughter, Susan W. Macomb, who later married into an aristocratic family in Switzerland. The Gold Medal remained in the ownership of the Swiss branch of the family until it was finally sold at auction in February 2017. While the sale price was not disclosed, the medal was appraised at $160,000 before the sale.\nToday, a number of legacies honor Macomb. He personally wrote the original court-martial manual for the Army and also authored a play about Chief Pontiac’s siege of Detroit in 1763. In addition to Macomb County, several other communities around the nation are named for the former general, as is a mountain, not far from the scene of the Battle of Plattsburgh. Statues of Macomb exist in downtown Mount Clemens and in Detroit.\nMacomb’s 1841 funeral was attended by President John Tyler and former President John Quincy Adams. In 2008, he was exhumed from the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., as part of a project to repair the commemorative memorial marker at his grave. He was re-buried at the same site, again with military honors, shortly thereafter.\nThe identity of the new owner of the Macomb Medal was not disclosed by the German auction house that brokered the sale.\nMacomb had six children and 23 grandchildren and a number of his direct descendants still bear the last name Macomb. A few members of his family have been in contact with the Macomb County Bicentennial Committee about attending events held during the county’s celebration.\nOur guest writer Dan Heaton is a veteran of both the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy. He writes often on military history with a Michigan connection.\nAll of the photos are from the U.S. Army History Center, with the exception of the images of the medal, which are from the U.S. Mint.","|Capture of Fort Erie|\n|Part of the War of 1812|\n|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland||United States|\n|Commanders and leaders|\n|Thomas Buck||Jacob Brown|\n|Casualties and losses|\n|All surrendered||Less than 10|\nThe Capture of Fort Erie by American forces in 1814 was an incident in the War of 1812 between the United Kingdom and the United States. The British garrison was outnumbered but surrendered prematurely, in the view of British commanders.\nThe United States shared a long border with British North America (present-day Canada) in 1814. During the war, the Americans launched several invasions into Upper Canada (present-day Ontario). One section of the border where this was easiest (because of communications and locally available supplies) was along the Niagara River. Fort Erie was the British post at the head of the river, near its source in Lake Erie.\nIn 1812, two American attempts to capture Fort Erie were bungled by Brigadier General Alexander Smyth. Bad weather or poor administration foiled the American efforts to cross the river.\nIn 1813, the Americans won the Battle of Fort George at the northern end of the Niagara River. The British abandoned the Niagara frontier and allowed Fort Erie to fall into American hands without a fight. The Americans failed to follow up their victory, and later in the year they withdrew most of their soldiers from the Niagara to furnish an ill-fated attack on Montreal. This allowed the British to recover their positions and to mount raids which led to the Capture of Fort Niagara and the devastation of large parts of the American side of the Niagara River.\nFor 1814, a new invasion of Upper Canada was planned under the command of Major General Jacob Brown. Originally aimed at Kingston on Lake Ontario, it was switched to the Niagara because British ships controlled Lake Ontario for the first six months of 1814.\nBecause American troops were already concentrated at Buffalo and Black Rock, the attack was to be launched across the southern part of the Niagara frontier. Fort Erie was the first objective that stood in the way, which required its capture. Lieutenant General Gordon Drummond, the British commander in Upper Canada, hoped that the garrison at Fort Erie could at least buy him enough time against the American invasion to concentrate his forces. Major Thomas Buck was given command of the fort with a garrison of 137 British soldiers.\nBrown's force crossed into Canada on July 3. Brigadier General Winfield Scott landed a mile and a half (3 km) north of the fort with a brigade of regulars while it was still dark. Another brigade under Eleazar Wheelock Ripley crossed the head of the river to the south of the fort, although they were delayed by fog. Meanwhile, New York militia demonstrated opposite Chippawa to distract the British troops in the area.\nAs Scott's and Ripley's forces approached Fort Erie, Buck fired only a few shots at the Americans from the fort's cannon and then surrendered. The Americans had captured an important fort at little cost. The fort's garrison had bought the British little time and Buck was later court martialled for his hasty surrender.\nFrom their new base at Fort Erie, Brown next marched up the Niagara River and met the British at the Battle of Chippawa. The British commander at Chippawa, Major General Phineas Riall, believed that the garrison of Fort Erie was still holding out, which contributed to his decision to launch a hasty and ill-fated attack.\nFollowing the Battle of Lundy's Lane in July, British forces under the command of Gordon Drummond advanced and unsuccessfully besieged the fort. However, American commanders decided to abandon the fort, which was evacuated and blown up in November 1814.\nJohn R.

{"question":"How do promotional restrictions differ between for-profit businesses and nonprofit organizations on noncommercial radio stations, compared to how public radio has evolved since its early days in 1910?","answer":"Noncommercial radio stations face different promotional restrictions based on the type of organization. For-profit businesses have strict limitations - stations cannot make qualitative claims, provide price information, or include calls to action about commercial sponsors. However, these restrictions don't apply to nonprofits - stations can freely promote nonprofit events, include ticket prices, and make qualitative claims about their activities. This regulatory framework emerged about 35 years ago when Congress amended the Communications Act. This represents a significant evolution from public radio's early beginnings in 1910, when Enrico Caruso first performed opera over the airwaves. The medium developed through the Great Depression, FDR's Fireside Chats, and ultimately the 1967 Public Broadcasting Act, which established the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and led to NPR's creation in 1969.","context":["Last week, the FCC reached a consent decree with a noncommercial broadcaster, where the broadcaster paid an $8000 penalty for, among other things, running underwriting spots that were too promotional. While the consent decree and its implementing order provide no details on the underwriting violations by the broadcaster, we can assume that the broadcaster ran spots that somehow crossed the line – giving price information about a sponsor’s products, or including a call to action suggesting that listeners somehow patronize the sponsor, or making qualitative claims about the sponsor or its products or services. We have written about similar violations many times (see, for instance, our articles here, here, here, here and here) and I have conducted seminars for numerous noncommercial broadcasting organizations talking about specifics as to what is permitted in underwriting acknowledgements and what will get a noncommercial station into trouble (see for instance, the presentations mentioned here and here). Obviously, it is important that noncommercial stations pay attention to these restrictions. But, last week, I received a question that indicated that not all noncommercial stations realize that, while their ability to promote a commercial enterprise is limited, these same restrictions do not apply to on-air spots for other nonprofit organizations.\nAbout 35 years ago, Congress changed the provisions of the Communications Act to redefine what a noncommercial station can and cannot do. Noncommercial stations obviously cannot run commercials. But the language of the statute makes clear that commercials are promotional announcements for profit businesses. In looking at that statutory change, after much discussion, the FCC concluded that the restrictions on underwriting announcements that apply to these noncommercial businesses do not apply to promotional announcements for nonprofit entities.\nSo, noncommercial stations do not violate the FCC’s underwriting rules if they run a promotional announcement for a local school’s drama department’s production of some Broadway show, and the stations can even provide the ticket prices and urge listeners to attend. The underwriting broadcast on a noncommercial station can say that the local church sells the best cherry pie (making a qualitative claim that they cannot make for a for-profit underwriter) when suggesting that listeners visit the church’s bake sale. Or they can tell people to contribute to the American Cancer Institute or the Red Cross, even if these nonprofit entities have paid for the announcements being run on the station.\nAs recently made clear, this treatment applies only to spot announcements for these organizations. Paying for programming time where the payment exceeds the noncommercial station’s costs of operating are probably against the FCC’s rules (see our article here). And on-air fundraisers that interrupt the station’s normal programming to raise funds for nonprofit groups other than the station itself are restricted in amount and require disclosures, even under the FCC’s new liberalized policy on such activities (see our articles here and here).\nBut these spot promotional announcements for nonprofit organizations as part of a noncommercial station’s regular programming are permitted. Obviously, as with any legal issue, talk to your legal counsel for details of these rules, as specific spots may give rise to specific concerns. Particularly problematic, for instance, are spots for events that have both commercial and noncommercial aspects or sponsors – where this relaxed regulatory treatment probably does not apply.\nBut with students coming back to school, and noncommercial stations across the country gearing up for the busy Fall season, this opportunity to raise underwriting funds to support station operations, while also affirmatively promoting other nonprofits in your community, should not be overlooked.","Today we celbrate public radio broadcasting!

The act was a predecessor of the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program.\nPublic radio started on January 13th, 1910. From Smithsonian Magazine:\nOn January 13, 1910, tenor Enrico Caruso prepared to perform an entirely new activity: sing opera over the airwaves, broadcasting his voice from the Metropolitan Opera House to locations throughout New York City. Inventor Lee deForest had suspended microphones above the Opera House stage and in the wings and set up a transmitter and antenna. A flip of a switch magically sent forth sound.\nThe evening would usher out an old era—one of dot-dash telegraphs, of evening newspapers, of silent films, and of soap box corner announcements. In its place, radio communications would provide instant, long-distance wireless communication. In 2009, America celebrated the 40th anniversary of the creation of National Public Radio; thanks to deForest, 2010 marks the centennial of the true birth of the era of public broadcasting.\nThe Great Depression forced a lull in radio development, but still, by 1931, radio’s “Golden Age” had begun. Half of America’s homes had radios. Mothers listened in the morning, children after school, and fathers with their families during prime time broadcasts. Isolated rural citizens could listen to sermons and gospel music from their farmhouse kitchens. In 1932, the nation awaited updates about the kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh’s baby. From their kitchen tables, starting on March 12, 1933, families could hear Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Sunday evening “Fireside Chats.”\n[In the 60s] interest grew in the idea of publicly funded broadcasting. President Lyndon Johnson had supported the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television, which researched this question. When the committee recommended federal funding for television alone, several radio professionals agitated for the inclusion of “and radio” in the forthcoming bill. Indeed, Johnson’s 1967 Public Broadcasting Act established the federally funded Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which, in turn, created National Public Radio in 1969.\nOver the next 40 years, NPR accumulated member stations nationwide. Commercial broadcasting also continued to flourish. Talk radio began to dominate the AM broadcast band, with music shifting to the clear FM band. In 1987, the Federal Communications Commission repealed the Fairness Doctrine, a 1949 policy that required broadcasters to show both sides of controversial issues; the repeal continues to buoy AM talk radio today. Eventually, the AM and FM bands were joined by XM and other satellite radio services, extending the medium’s reach in the 21st century.\nAnd here are some facts from the Pew Institute:\nHundreds of local and regional radio and television stations comprise the U.S. public media system. On the audio side, organizations such as NPR, American Public Media (APM) and Public Radio International (PRI) produce and distribute programming, reaching audiences through local stations as well as digital channels. Individual stations, such as New York’s WNYC and Chicago’s WBEZ, produce nationally syndicated original journalism as well. On the television side, PBS NewsHour produces an evening newscast that airs on local PBS stations around the country. The organization has a digital operation as well. On the whole, the news offerings of U.S. public broadcasters have been marked by relative financial stability and, in the past year, audience growth. Explore the patterns and longitudinal data about public broadcasting below.\nThe top 20 NPR-affiliated public radio stations (by listenership) had on average a total weekly listenership of about 10 million in 2016, up from about 9 million in 2015.\nNPR’s digital platforms continue to be an important part of its reach. Both the NPR News app, which offers livestreams from individual stations and digital content, and the newer NPR One app, which offers a stream of individual shows and podcasts, have shown steady growth across devices in the average number of total completed sessions each month."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ce0462af-0f15-4cf9-8333-2599d7e6d169>","<urn:uuid:cb47078a-0695-4894-a055-9288f05c5dba>"],"error":null}

The full incorporation of women’s capacities into labor forces would add percentage points to most national growth rates – double digits in many cases. Further, investing in women’s empowerment produces the double dividend of benefiting women and children, and is pivotal to the health and social development of families, communities and nations.\nEmpowering women and girls and achieving gender equality requires the concerted efforts of all stakeholders, including business. All companies have baseline responsibilities to respect human rights, including the rights of women and girls. Beyond these baseline responsibilities, companies also have the opportunity to support the empowerment of women and girls through core business, social investment, public policy engagement and partnerships. As the engine for 90 percent of jobs in developing countries, technological innovation, capital creation and investment, responsible business is critical to the advancement of women’s and girls’ empowerment around the world. With a growing business case, private sector leaders are increasingly developing and adapting policies and practices, and implementing cutting edge initiatives, to advance women’s empowerment within their workplaces, marketplaces and communities. The launch of the SDGs in September provides a tremendous opportunity for companies to further align their strategies and operations with global priorities by mainstreaming gender equality into all areas of corporate sustainability and systematically and strategically scaling up actions which support the development and livelihoods of women and girls.\n- Equal remuneration for women and men\n- Diversity and equal opportunity\n- Access to sexual and reproductive health-care services\n- Workplace violence and harassment\n- Women in leadership\n- Childcare services and benefits\nThe below examples are non-exhaustive and some may be more relevant to certain industries than to others.\n- Assure sufficient participation of women – 30% or greater – in decision-making and governance at all levels and across all business areas.\n- Pay equal remuneration, including benefits, for work of equal value and strive to pay a living wage to all women and men.\n- Support access to child and dependent care by providing services, resources and information to both women and men.\n- Establish a zero-tolerance policy towards all forms of violence at work, including verbal/ and/ or physical abuse and prevent sexual harassment.\n- Expand business relationships with women-owned enterprises, including small businesses and women entrepreneurs.\n- The Women’s Empowerment Principles- Reporting on Progress: What is the business’ policy on maternity, paternity and family leave length and entitlements and to what extent does this go above the statutory provisions in the regulatory regime where the business is operating?

{"question":"Why does underwater burning generate hydrogen gas and what risks does it pose?","answer":"During underwater burning, hydrogen gas can build up in pockets which are potentially explosive. This was demonstrated in testing where gas bubbles from a single rod displaced a gallon of water from a two-gallon container at minus 10 ft depth. This accumulated gas was found to be explosive when exposed to flame, making it a significant safety hazard.","context":["UNDERWATER OXY-ARC BURNING\nDiver and surface air/gas saturation supervisor John Roat of Legacy Offshore uses the exothermic cutting process during offshore repairs and construction. He identifies the risks involved in underwater burning and reviews the proper training and equipment that are essential to the safety of divers.\nAs a working diver and a surface air/gas saturation supervisor for the Legacy Offshore, LLC (Broussard, Louisiana) diving and construction company, John Roat spends a lot of time underwater serving the domestic and international oil and gas industries. He estimates that about 90 percent of underwater burning is done in these industries.\nWhen conducting offshore repairs and construction, Roat often uses the exothermic cutting process which releases energy in the form of heat, and uses oxygen as an exciter and the steel rods become the fuel. As long as the oxygen flow is maintained through the torch and rod, the rod will continue to burn and consume at a temperature between 8,000 deg F to 10,000 deg F, and burn ferrous and non-ferrous materials such as concrete, rock, barnacles and other sea growth.\nA knife switch is located on the tender platform so power can be turned on and off through commands given by the diver. By closing a knife switch, the tender completes the circuits and allows the torch to run ?hot?, or by throwing open the switch, the cutting or burning can be stopped and run ?cold.?\nThere are numerous potential risks involved in underwater burning such as electric shock and the build-up of pockets of hydrogen gas which are potentially explosive. Proper training and quality equipment are essential to the safety of the divers.\nAN OXY-ARC BURNING TEST\nThe purpose of this example test is to compare three exothermic type burning rods with each other in three areas:\n(1) Inches per rod in ¾ in, 1 in and 2−1÷8 in.\n(2) Consistence of rod burn.\n(3) Cleanness of cut.\nThe exothermic rods being tested are the Broco 3/8, Arc-Air Sea Jet 3/8 and the Oxylance Aqua EXO 3/8 (see Figure 1). The Swordfish 5.0 x 450 mm, no oxygen rod is tested as well on ¼ in, 3/8 in, ½ in and ¾ in plate. All rods are compared to the standard set by Arc-Air Tuff Coat Tubular Steel Rod. The equipment used in this test is a 600 amp DC welder, burning, hot and ground leads constructed of 4/0 welding cable, 600 knife switch, Oxylance 5–500 O/2 Regulator high flow, Arcair Sea Torch cutting head. Terry Tatum and John Roat are the burners.\nAll three exothermic rods (AQUA EXO, Broco and Arcair Sea Jet) are comparable in inches per rod while burning thin steel up to 5/8 in burning cold. The Broco rod tends to go out, burn a little more erratic and leave more hangers than either the AQUA EXO or the Arcair Sea Jet. Figures 2–6 compare the three exothermic rods in ¾ in, 1 in and 2−1÷8 in steel. Figures 2 and 3 are of 1 in and 2−1÷8 in steel cut with Tuff Coat Tubular Steel Rods as a comparison.\nIn Figures 4–6, we experimented with each rod to give it its maximum travel. The Broco and Sea Jet where run at 300 amps, the AQUA EXO was run at 80 amps. All three rods had 100 psi at the torch head. The AQUA EXO and the Sea Jet both struck up easily and ran smoothly. The Broco was harder to strike up and when out more frequently and in general ran rougher and had less inches per rod.\nAN ADDITIONAL EXOTHERMIC BURNING RODS TEST\nIn another test, the exothermic rods tested were the Broco 3/8, Arc-Air Sea Jet 3/8 and the Oxylance Aqua EXO 3/8. Three divers ? Matt Hoyt, Jennifer Wieben, and Justin Krahan, all having completed Burner 3 and been broken out in the last year ? were selected to test the rods. The equipment used included a 600 amp DC welder, burning, hot and ground leads constructed of 4/0 welding cable , 600 knife switch, Oxylance 5–500 O/2 Regulator high flow, Arcair Sea Torch cutting head.\nThe Broco and Sea Jet were run at 300 amps, the AQUA EXO was run at 80 amps. All three rods had 100 psi at the torch head. Comparisons:\n(1) Inches per rod in ¾ in, 1 in and 2−1÷8 in.\n(2) Consistence of rod burn.\n(3) Cleanness of cut.\nDiver: Justin Krahn\n(1) Inches per rod ¾ in steel: Aqua EXO 13 in; Broco 16 in; Sea Jet 20 in\n(2) Inches per rod 1 in steel: Aqua EXO 12 in; Broco 13 in; Sea Jet 17 in\n(3) Inches per rod 2−1÷8 in steel: Aqua EXO 5 in; Broco 3 in; Sea Jet 9 in\n(4) Consistence of rod burn: J. Krahn found the Sea Jet to be the most consistent rod followed closely by the Aqua EXO. The Broco rod became more inconsistent on the thicker steel.\n(5) Cleanness of cut: J. Krahn found that the Sea Jet made the cleanest cut followed closely by the Aqua EXO with Broco having the most hangers/slag.\nDiver: Jenifer Wieben\n(1) Inches per rod ¾ in steel: Aqua EXO 8 in; Broco 9 in; Sea Jet 11 in\n(2) Inches per rod 1 in steel: Aqua EXO 6 in; Broco 6 in; Sea Jet 10 in\n(3) Inches per rod 2−1÷8 in steel: Aqua EXO 3 in; Broco 3 in (with hangers); Sea Jet 5 in\n(4) Consistence of rod burn: J. Wieben found the Sea Jet to be the most consistent rod followed closely by the Aqua EXO. The Broco rod became more inconsistent on the thicker steel.\n(5) Cleanness of cut: J. Wieben found that the Sea Jet made the cleanest cut followed closely by the Aqua EXO with Broco having the most hangers/slag.\nDiver: Matt Hoyt\n(1) Inches per rod ¾ in steel: Aqua EXO 6½ in; Broco 8 in; Sea Jet 9 in\n(2) Inches per rod 1 in steel: Aqua EXO 5 in; Broco 8 in (with hangers); Sea Jet 8 in\n(3) Inches per rod 2−1÷8 in steel: Aqua EXO 3 in; Broco 3 in (with hangers); Sea Jet 6 in\n(4) Consistence of rod burn: M. Hoyt found the Sea Jet to be the most consistent rod followed closely by the Aqua EXO. The Broco rod became more inconsistent on the thicker steel.\n(5) Cleanness of cut: M. Hoyt found that the Sea Jet made the cleanest cut followed closely by the Aqua EXO with Broco having the most hangers/slag.\nAll five divers testing the rods got more total inches from the Sea Jet rod. All agreed that the cleanest cutting rod was the Arcair Sea Jet, closely followed by the Aqua EXO. The Broco came in last in all categories. To conclude on the exothermic rods, Figure 7 shows the Arcair Sea Jet on the left, Broco in the center and the Oxylance AQUA EXO after being exposed to one week of weather. Note the heavy rust appearing on the Broco. There is none on the Sea Jet or EXO.\nANOTHER TEST: THE SWORDFISH NO O/2 ROD\nThe Swordfish is not a traditional burning rod. It would be better called a melting rod. Figures 8–10 show how it seems to work best when the melted steel can fall out of the cut. It requires much practice and visibility to use. ?I do not believe this rod could be used in black water (no visibility),? states Roat.\n?We believe it could be used for light burning with visibility on thin steel items such as clamps, bolts, pipe with wall thickness of ½ in or less,? he explains. One problem encountered was melted steel filling in the cut on vertical cuts. The rod does create hydrogen in large enough quantity to be a vent problem. The gas bubbles from one rod where trapped and displaced a gallon of water from a two gallon container. The depth was minus 10 ft. This gas was of an explosive nature when presented with a flame.\nRoat says that torches should be insulated electrically for safety and prohibit any oxygen leakage. Along with the torches, cutting rods play a critical role of in underwater burning, and have significant financial implications regardless the size of the project. Burners want rods that produce longer cuts, cleaner cuts, and have greater resistance to rust underwater. A veteran trainer, Roat recommends Arcair exothermic torches and burning rods. ?My favorite exothermic rod is the 3/8 Sea Jet. My favorite tubular steel is the Tuffcoat.?\nCurt Wilsoncroft, the national specialist for Arcair, says the SeaTorch Combination Torch and ArcWater II Torch are popular torches because of their reputation for safety and performance. The rods are especially important, he explains, because no rust translates to fewer rods being wasted, increasing economic efficiency. There is very little acceptance for rust on a rod that is designed to be used underwater.\n?Longer cuts will result in the need for fewer rods to complete each project as well as the conservation of valuable time starting and stopping and changing rods,? adds Wilsoncroft. ?Research has shown that one minute of time on dry land can be equal to that of seven minutes underwater, thus fewer rod changes, even though the changes are quick, can result in reduced labor costs and less money being spent on divers? equipment, specifically oxygen, leaving the client much more satisfied. Cleanliness of the cut can also save on labor and supplies by not requiring as much touch-up on jobs where it may traditionally be needed.?\nFinally, Wilsoncroft notes that cut and burn consistency can help save as well providing a quicker cut and less time spent re-striking rods that won?t stay lit. He understands the dangers involved in all aspects of exothermic burning, especially when diving. ?Underwater burning requires training, practice and knowledge of what you?re burning,? he says. ?But with the proper manpower and equipment, we get unbelievably impressive results.?\n- — - — - — - — - — - — - — - — - — - — - — - — - — - — - — - — - — - — - — - — -\nJohn Roat was a member of Underwater Demolition Teams 21, UDT 11 and SEAL Team 1.

{"question":"How do the discovery dates of the Diamond Sutra and Dead Sea Scrolls compare, and what do these ancient texts reveal about early religious writings?","answer":"The Diamond Sutra was discovered in 1900 in Dunhuang, China, while the Dead Sea Scrolls were first discovered in 1947 near Qumran. Both are significant religious texts but from different traditions. The Diamond Sutra is a Buddhist text printed in 868 CE containing a conversation between Buddha and his disciple about human impermanence and reality's nature. The Dead Sea Scrolls, dating from the late third century BC to the first century AD, consist of approximately 930 manuscripts including some of the oldest known versions of the Hebrew Bible. The Dead Sea Scrolls shed light on Judaism around the time Christianity was born, while the Diamond Sutra remains one of the most important sacred texts in Mahayana Buddhism.","context":["When it comes to ancient texts, most are familiar with the big names: The Book of Kells, the Gutenberg Bible, and the Dead Sea Scrolls. But one that most people don’t know about is the Diamond Sutra — the world’s earliest dated and printed book.\nThe messages of this ancient text are just as powerful today as they were a thousand years ago. Here’s how to access the wisdom and transforming the power of this sacred sutra.\nWhat Is The Diamond Sutra?\nThe Diamond Sutra is an ancient Buddhist text discovered in Dunhuang, China in 1900 by a Daoist monk. It was found in a remote oasis on the edge of the Gobi Desert along an old outpost of the Silk Road.\nThe Diamond Sutra, along with thousands of other sacred scrolls and artifacts, was hidden in a shrine called The Cave of a Thousand Buddhas.\nThe Cave of a Thousand Buddhas, or Mogao Grottoes, is over 1,000 years old and is one of the most important Buddhist spiritual sites in China.\nThe site is a complex of (you guessed it!) one thousand caves dug into a sandstone cliff face. The entire labyrinth is half a mile in length and spans a height of 10 stories. Today, almost half of the caves have collapsed in on themselves or are filled with sand, but many are still accessible to the public.\nThis mysterious place is the home of some of the most powerful paintings, sculptures, and scriptures in Mahayana Buddhism.\nWhen Was The Diamond Sutra Printed?\nAlthough the Diamond Sutra wasn’t officially discovered until the 1900s, we do know how long ago it was created.\nThe Diamond Sutra was printed in 868 CE, during the 4th moon of the 9th year of Xiantong.\nWhere Was The Diamond Sutra Printed?\nEven though sutras are ancient teachings of the Buddha, who lived and preached in ancient Nepal, the Diamond Sutra was printed in China.\nIt’s believed that Buddhism found its way to China through the trade routes of the Silk Road.\nWhere Is The Diamond Sutra Located?\nSo, where is this famous sacred text today? The Diamond Sutra currently lives in the British Library and you can even interactively peek through its pages online.\nThe British Library is a part of the International Dunhuang Project. This international collaboration seeks to make 100,000 manuscripts, paintings and artifacts from Silk Road sites available to the world via the Internet.\nWhat Is The Diamond Sutra All About?\nThe Diamond Sutra is one of the most important sacred texts in Mahayana Buddhism. It’s 6,000 words long and tells the story of a conversation the Buddha had with one of his disciples, Subhuti.\nIn Sanskrit, the Diamond Sutra is called the Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra, which means, “The Perfect Wisdom that Cuts Like a Thunderbolt.”\nWe often refer to this sutra in English as the Diamond Sutra, because like a diamond or thunderbolt, the sutra’s wisdom is designed to slice through the materialism of the world to reveal powerful truths. Truths we can access and put to use in our everyday lives.\nSo, what did the Buddha and Subhuti discuss?\nWell, at the time, the Buddha was staying in Anathapindika’s grove with over 1,000 other monks. He and Subhuti proceeded to have a long conversation about a number of topics, including human impermanence and the nature of reality itself.\nPretty deep stuff, huh? Perhaps that’s why the Diamond Sutra is so famous. It’s quite possibly one of the most enigmatic lessons the Buddha taught.\nTrained scholars still argue over the true meaning of the Diamond Sutra.\nSome say it’s simply the Buddha’s lecture on the transient nature of the world. Nothing is permanent. Nothing is stable or fixed.\nBut other scholars argue that the true purpose of this sutra is to encourage us not to be bound by any idea at all—even the ones in the Diamond Sutra.\nHow Can I Use The Wisdom Of The Diamond Sutra In My Own Life?\nSo, what does a 1,000-year-old ancient scripture like the Diamond Sutra have to offer us today?\nThe lessons from this Buddhist sutra are timeless. Sutras are short passages that communicate powerful spiritual teaching. They’re as relevant and transformative today as they were a thousand years ago.\nDeborah King, Author of Mindvalley’s Be A Modern Master Program, explains that sutras are powerful devices for raising your inner consciousness to a higher level.\nThey are designed to be read and re-read, contemplated and meditated upon. They can be also used in yoga, spoken, or chanted out loud.\nAt first glance, they might look like poetry. But after a second or third reading, the truth of the message begins to surface.\nAn Illuminating Quote From The Diamond Sutra For Meditation\nThe best way to tap into the ancient power of this sutra is by exploring its passages. Even though this ancient text was originally written in Sanskrit, we have access to English translations to help us tap into its life-transforming messages.\nHere is one of the most powerful passages from the Diamond Sutra.

The scrolls were found hidden inside three leather phylacteries, pouches traditionally carried by observant Jewish men.\nAccording to reports, the leather pouches were first pulled out of the Qumran caves in the 1950s, but were never examined or analysed until Yonatan Adler, an archaeologist from Ariel University, was working on materials from the old archaeological excavations and found the phylacteries. Using latest technology, including multispectral imaging carried out by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), it is now possible to view the text on the ancient scrolls.\n“I am very proud that in our laboratory, using the most advanced technologies, we can reconstruct the history of two thousand years ago,” said Pnina Shor, Head of the laboratory for conservation of the IAA.\nQumran was a town inhabited by an Essene community on the western shore of the Dead Sea, in the West Bank, near the ruins of Jericho. The site was built between 150 BC and 130 BC and saw various phases of occupation. The town became famous in 1947 when a Bedouin shepherd unearthed the first of nearly 900 texts, which became known as the Dead Sea Scrolls.\nTwo Dead Sea scrolls in situ in the Qumran Caves.

The scrolls have been dated from the late third century BC to the first century AD and were discovered in a series of 11 caves near Qumran in the years 1947-1956.\nThe ancient and priceless texts have been dubbed \"the academic scandal of the 20th century\" because of the long delay in publication, which many have claimed is due to the controversial nature of its contents. The manuscripts shed unprecedented light on Judaism around the turn of the era, at the time when Christianity was born, and some of the contents conflict with the accounts contained in the New Testament. Only 20% of the texts were published upon their discovery; the other 80% remained locked away in a secret vault at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem for about 35 years, causing fury among archaeologists.\nThe nine ‘newly found’ documents are from caves 4 and 5 and were excavated in 1952 by the archaeologist Roland de Vaux. Considering the academic scandal concerning the Dead Sea Scrolls, one has to wonder if they really have just been rediscovered or whether they too have been protected and hidden away. The content of the text has not yet been released.\nFeatured image: The Qumran Caves.
