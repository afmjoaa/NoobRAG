{"question":"As an animal nutritionist, I'm curious - what's the difference between competition horses' and opossums' dietary needs?","answer":"Competition horses require carefully balanced nutrition with moderate protein (around 12%), higher fat (9-12%), and fiber (around 18%), combined with good-quality hay and pasture. They need multiple small meals throughout the day as they evolved to eat 20 out of 24 hours. In contrast, opossums are omnivorous and less selective - they will eat almost anything but show a preference for meat.","context":["Advice from a US Equestrian Team veterinarian\nReprinted from the June 2016 Issue of USDF Connection\nBy Jennifer O. Bryant\nWe dressage enthusiasts like to call our sport “classical,” as if it were a relic of an ancient time. In fact the sport, and its equine athletes, have evolved tremendously. Along with changes in sport-horse breeding have come advances in veterinary care and research breakthroughs, which have had profound effects on the way we care for our horses. US Equestrian Team veterinarian Richard D. Mitchell, DVM, MRCVS, Diplomate ACVSMR, has seen many changes in his 25 years of traveling with Olympic and World Equestrian Games teams. (Learn more about him in “Heads Up: Behind the Scenes,” May).\nAt the 2015 Adequan/USDF Annual Convention in Las Vegas, Mitchell brought audiences up to speed on the latest thinking with his session on “Maintenance Care of the Competitive Sport Horse.” Here are highlights of his presentation.\n“Horses evolved to eat for 20 out of 24 hours a day,” Mitchell said. Many modern horses don’t get that opportunity; and restricted access to forage, diets high in concentrates, and the stresses of travel and competition contribute to the proliferation of equine gastric-ulcer syndrome, or EGUS, he said.\nIf possible, give multiple small meals throughout the day instead of feeding just twice a day, Mitchell advised. When a horse eats he produces saliva, which contains bicarbonate, an acid reducer. Bicarbonate—the same active ingredient as in Alka-Seltzer—helps to counteract the acids that the horse’s stomach constantly produces, regardless of whether food is present. Th e ulcer-prone horse may also benefit from more alkaline feedstuff s, such as alfalfa or other legume hays, which help to control acid levels, he said.\nAny horse in heavy work needs a lot of fuel, but diff rent breeds have different needs, Mitchell said. “Warmbloods and Quarter Horses have different requirements as compared to young Thoroughbreds. Th ere is often the need for adequate calories without excessive carbohydrates” because the heavier breeds may be predisposed to muscular disorders such as polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM) and to metabolic disorders, he said. The modern sport horse tends to do well on a feed that’s moderate in protein (around 12 percent) and with higher amounts of fat (9-12 percent) and fiber (around 18 percent), combined with good-quality hay and pasture.\nVaccines and Maintenance Care\nIf you compete in dressage, you probably are aware that the US Equestrian Federation (USEF) has instituted a new vaccination requirement for horses at USEF-licensed shows. Per USEF GR 845, horses must be vaccinated for equine influenza and equine herpes virus, aka rhinopneumonitis (“fl u/rhino”) within six months of the competition. Mitchell’s own recommendation for the competition horse is to administer fl u/rhino booster vaccines every four months. And “all horses need a tetanus shot,” he said.\nMany dressage riders worry about the state of their horses’ joints. According to Mitchell, “Slow, progressive conditioning is the best way to prevent joint disease” and is especially important in the younger horse. Vary training sessions’ intensity and focus. Getting a horse out for exercise more than once a day—an additional session could consist of walking in hand or under saddle, or putting the horse on a treadmill or on an automatic walker—is beneficial to soundness, he has found.\nFor those horses that require more help in keeping their joints feeling oiled, owners often turn to one of several well-known injectable products. Many veterinarians, Mitchell included, like Adequan. Unfortunately for the horse owner, Adequan is not inexpensive. To try to “stretch” the product, many owners give one dose of Adequan per month. According to Mitchell, this method is ineffective.\n“Once a month is silly,” he said. He recommends starting a horse on Adequan using the manufacturer’s recommended loading dose of seven doses, giving one dose every four days; and giving a weekly dose thereafter for maintenance. If that’s out of your budget, then you’re better off giving the full seven-dose series periodically rather than resorting to the once-a-month schedule, he said.\nMitchell will supplement a competition dressage horse’s joint-maintenance regimen with Legend (intravenous hyaluronic acid), he said.\nThere is less evidence that oral joint-health nutraceuticals are effective, although one additive, avocado-soy unsaponifiables, has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect, Mitchell said.\nNutrition, as Mitchell pointed out, is the first line of defense against equine ulcers. But the stresses of training and competition may mean that the dressage horse needs more help. Prophylactic levels of omeprazole products such as GastroGard and UlcerGard, given daily during stressful times of training and travel, may be useful, he said.\nDon’t forget your horse’s teeth; have them checked twice a year, Mitchell recommended. “Some performance issues may be related to dental problems, which can mimic back issues.”\nFinally, good foot care is critical. “Foot lameness is probably the number-one problem we see.”\nAdvances in Diagnostics and Treatment\nAs diagnostic methods become more sophisticated and accurate, veterinarians are better able to pinpoint the cause of lameness. The down side to this, if you will, is that veterinarians are becoming able to identify lamenesses that in the past we were blissfully unaware of.\nThankfully, treatment methods also have advanced. Today’s sport horses can benefit from shock-wave therapy, stem-cell therapy, administration of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IRAP), and other cutting-edge methods. Mitchell said he’s been using “more and more” of a newer PRP/IRAP product, Pro- Stride, that’s unique in that it’s “horse-side” (the equipment is portable, so the horse does not have to travel to a clinic) and ready for use in 30 minutes, unlike traditional PRP and IRAP therapies, which either aren’t portable or require a more lengthy incubation time.\nPRP and other regenerative techniques, Mitchell said, “reduce convalescent time only slightly, but they can improve the quality of healing.”\nAnother newer product Mitchell mentioned is BetaVet (betamethasone), a corticosteroid injected intra-articularly (into the joint) for the treatment of equine osteoarthritis. Other arthritis treatments called bisphosphonates (brand names: Osphos and Tildren) are used to help retard bone loss. Mitchell said he has had some success using bisphosphonates along with shock-wave therapy in cases of degenerative arthritis that no longer respond to injectable therapies. Lyme-disease testing remains part of Mitchell’s maintenance regimen for the horses under his care. He recommended twice-yearly testing.\nTreatments for equine ulcers also continue to develop. Veterinarians now know that “a horse can have hindgut ulcers and not stomach ulcers. Horses with hindgut ulcers typically—but not always—also have chronic diarrhea.”\nFor treating ulcers, misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin, “in smaller doses stimulates the enzymes that make gut mucous,” which protects against acids. A product called Arthrotec is a combination of misoprostol and diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory drug (NSAID), and currently it’s used in human medicine to treat arthritis pain in patients prone to NSAID-induced ulcers. The digestive-health product Succeed “has some benefit.” Probiotics may play a role, as may “changing the horse’s diet to something really basic: hay and crimped oats.”\nAlthough Mitchell is a veterinarian who has spent much of his career treating top competition horses, he said his philosophy doesn’t revolve around the winning of ribbons and medals.\n“I don’t believe in just trying to get the horse to the ring,” he said. “I believe in trying to help the welfare of the horse.”\nJennifer Bryant is the editor of USDF Connection.","Orlando Wildlife Trappers Information\nRACCOON: Procyon lotor\nSIZE - Average 12-20 lbs. in Florida\nLIFE EXPECTANCY - Up to 12 years in the wild\nBREEDING - Mating in December, 3-5 young born in April\nDIET - Omnivorous - meat, berries, grains, vegetation\nHABITAT - Mixed forests and especially urban areas\nFACTS - 40 teeth, nimble hands, black mask, very strong\nEASTERN GRAY SQUIRREL: Sciurus carolinensis\nSIZE - About 1 lb for adults\nLIFE EXPECTANCY - Up to 10 years, but usually shorter\nBREEDING - Two litters per year - Mating in December and June, 44 day gestation, 3-4 young born, weaned in 10 weeks\nDIET - mostly nuts and seeds\nHABITAT - Forests and suburban areas\nFACTS - 22 teeth, bushy tail, very agile\nOPOSSUM: Didelphis virginiana\nSIZE - Adults 10-14 lbs.\nLIFE EXPECTANCY - no more than 2-3 years\nBREEDING - Marsupial - mates in January, young are born very tiny after only 12 days, then they stay in the pouch and grow\nDIET - Omnivorous.

Knowledge\nof wildlife diet not only helps me use the best baits to catch them, but also may tell me what nearby food sources are attracting the animals to the area. The life expectancy of an animal gives me an idea of its conservation\nstatus.

{"question":"At what age do children develop turn-taking abilities in social interactions, and what physical skills typically emerge during the same period?","answer":"Children begin developing turn-taking abilities between ages 3-4, when they start to play cooperatively with peers. By age 4-5, they can share toys and take turns, showing understanding of others' feelings and needs. During this same period, their physical abilities significantly develop - they can walk easily up and down steps, throw and catch balls, climb ladders and trees, stand on tiptoe, run quite fast, jump over small objects, ride tricycles well, and may try bicycles with trainer wheels. They can also stand on one foot for a few seconds, hop, thread beads, swing themselves, and manage their own toilet needs during the day.","context":["Child development: 4-5 years\nchild; development; four; 4; five; 5; social; emotional; physical; understanding; speech; language; kindergarten; skills; motor; play; lies; bike. ;\nThis topic is about your four year old. You can always get a view from a hill, and being four is like the first developmental hill from which your child can get a view of a bigger world.\nRelationships, sex, different people of different race; all these big social issues become visible to your four year old. They are questions they explore through their play, dressing up and through asking lots of questions.\nTo glimpse a big world is exciting, but from such a small hill it is impossible to see where you might fit. So getting it wrong, being either too big and bold, or too small and frightened, are not uncommon extremes for your four year old.\nThe information in this topic is a guide only. Children develop at different rates and in different ways. If you are worried about your child's development or if your child's development is very different from other children of the same age, have a talk with a health professional. If there is a problem, getting in early will help. If there isn't a problem the reassurance will save you some worry.\nFour year olds are moving out into the world and can usually play happily with other children and enjoy lots of physical games as well as stories.\n- They are learning to understand about the feelings and needs of others, and their behaviour shows that they can feel sympathy for others and can share their toys and take turns, at least some of the time.\n- They may sometimes feel jealous of their parents' relationship.\n- Parents can help by letting them know that their relationship is important to them, and that each child will also have the opportunity to find their own special partner when they grow up.\n- They often develop favourite games like \"mummies and daddies\" and \"superman\". These games allow them to try out various adult roles for a while.\n- Sometimes the roles they take may conflict with your values as a parent, but if you allow them to play without making them feel that it is wrong, they usually let go of that role once they have worked through what it means.\n- The world can seem like a scary place to four year olds. They need their parents to provide a pattern of daily living that gives them a safe basis from which to explore.\n- For example, children need to know what happens at breakfast, what they will be doing during the day and what special things happen at bedtime.\n- They also need to know that their parents will set safe limits to their behaviour.\n- Even though they may seem confident, it is very scary for young children to feel that their parents cannot manage them.\n- Four year olds begin to organise games and make friends.\n- Four year olds can be quite bossy with other children and may still have a few tantrums when they don't get what they want.\n- They can usually separate from parents/carers without distress. This may not happen if there have been upsetting separations in the past.\n- Their sense of humour is developing and they are likely to laugh at funny situations.\n- Some of their behaviour is \"over the top\" - noisy, boasting, exuberant.\n- They play quite complicated make believe and pretend games, eg fathers and mothers.\n- Some have imaginary playmates. This is more likely if they don't have other children to play with. This is not a sign of developmental problems.\n- They have not yet worked out what is real and what is fantasy and may tell stories (lies) in order to please parents. See the topic Lies and fibs\n- 4-5 year olds can go to the toilet by themselves, use toilet paper properly and flush the toilet.\nFour year olds often ask lots of questions about the world and why it is the way it is. Sometimes their questions can be embarrassing or difficult to answer, for example, questions about death or sex. They are interested in where babies come from and may experiment by looking at other children's bodies.\nTry to answer their questions as simply and honestly as you can without telling them too much more than they ask.\nWhile telling them simply of the beliefs your family holds, help them to understand that life has different stages. People live differently and have different values, and this is all normal and part of life's richness.\nFour year olds can usually:\n- understand two or three simple things to do at once, eg \"Get a cup of water, take it to Daddy and then put the cup back on the table\"\n- understand what \"three\" means, eg \"There are three motor bikes\"\n- sort objects by size, and by what sort of thing they are, eg animals, or by colour or shape\n- compare two weights to work out which is heavier\n- understand taller, smaller and shorter but will not be able to arrange a group of things in order of smallest to biggest\n- probably copy their names\n- draw a person with a head, body, legs and arms\n- tell the difference between morning and afternoon\n- say numbers up to 20 and are beginning to count a few objects by touching them\n- hold a pencil well\n- cut on a line\n- name and match four colours\n- recognise some words they see a lot, eg STOP on stop signs\n- by the time they are five, tell you their name, age and address if asked (provided they have been taught these)\n- copy a square, a cross and a triangle by the time they are five.\nFour year olds are developing confidence in their physical ability but, as in their emotional life, they can be too bold or too timid and need to be supervised in physical play.\nFour year olds can:\n- walk easily up and down steps, one foot to a step\n- throw and catch, bounce and kick a ball and use a bat\n- climb ladders and trees\n- stand on tiptoe, and walk and run on tip toe\n- run quite fast\n- jump over small objects\n- walk along a line for a short distance\n- ride their tricycles very well and may try bicycles with trainer wheels\n- stand on one foot for a few seconds and most can hop\n- thread beads to make necklaces\n- swing themselves on a swing\n- dress themselves providing the fastenings are not too difficult\n- manage their own toilet needs during the day, but still may not be dry at night.\nFour year olds are often great conversationalists and love to talk about the details of all sorts of scientific and important subjects. Your child needs to find out about all aspects of life and talking about things is a very important way of understanding how the world works.\nFour year olds:\n- speak clearly on the whole, but they may still not use some sounds correctly, eg say \"th\" for \"s\" or \"w\" for \"r\"\n- ask \"why\", \"when\", \"how\" questions and ask what words mean\n- tell long stories which may be partly true and partly made up\n- are interested in questions and can argue and give their own ideas about things\n- talk about what might happen or what they would like to have happen\n- know a few nursery rhymes which they can say, repeat or sing.\nYour children have their own unique personalities and things they enjoy and it is important to support them in their own interests. The following are some things that many four year olds enjoy.\n- Jokes (especially toilet jokes). They will laugh at and say nonsense or silly words.\n- Books and stories with interesting rhymes and words. They may make up rhymes.\n- Playing with other children.\n- Physical activities.\n- Simple computer games.\nIgnoring toilet jokes or giving them an alternative word if they are using words that you don't like is often the best way to help them through this stage. Eg if the child says to everyone he meets \"You're a poo\" you could try saying something like, \"I know another good word. You could say 'You're a banana!'\" If you suggest another interesting word your child is quite likely to enjoy that just as much.\nThe main thing children need from play with parents is to have fun with them. It is important not to turn play into \"lessons\". The best way to play with children is to provide an interesting environment, have time to play and follow your child's lead.\n- Talk to your children about what they do and where they have been. Ask them what they did and what they saw. Listen with interest when they talk to you and join in conversations.\n- Read books to your children. Talk about what's happening in the pictures, let them act out the story.\n- Tell stories about when you were a child.\n- Four to five year olds are learning to sort things into groups, so you can play games for sorting objects, eg sort your spare buttons into shapes and colours, play animal lotto.\n- Give opportunities to learn to ride a three wheeled bike, or two wheeled bike with trainer wheels.\n- Make opportunities for out-door physical activity such as walks in the park, ball games, visiting playgrounds.\n- Provide materials for painting and drawing.\n- Praise and encourage your children when they consider others and play well with others and help them to think about how others feel.\nYour child may well be starting kindergarten in this year. It may just be like an extension of childcare for both of you or it may be the first time you have been separated. Different personalities respond very differently to separation and it also depends on what separations you have had in the past and how well they have gone. If you have a new baby at home your four year old may feel that he is 'missing out' by going to kindy and he needs to know that he can still have some 'special time' with you.\nIt will help him if you:\n- celebrate his entry into the formal education system in some small way\n- go with him to the kindergarten on at least two occasions before he starts (if it is not where he has been going for child care)\n- stay for a while if you have the time\n- buy him a new bag or lunch box even if he doesn't need one\n- listen to his stories about the experience.\nYou should have your children checked by a health professional when:\n- your children's understanding and skills go backward for more than a brief time\n- your four year old:\n- does not speak clearly enough to be understood by other people\n- cannot hear a whisper or constantly asks for things to be repeated (says \"What?\")\n- does not take an interest in other children and what is happening around her\n- is very much behind other children of the same age in some areas\n- screws up her eyes to see some things or has trouble seeing some things, or the pupils in her eyes do not always seem to be looking the same way\n- you have any worries or concerns about your children's development.\nSocial and Emotional Development\nYour four year old:\n- learns lots about the world and how it works, and about people and relationships\n- makes friends (often short term) and plays group games\n- needs structure and a routine to feel safe\n- when his behaviour is \"over the top,\" he needs you to set limits and bring him back to earth without making him feel bad.\nYour four year old:\n- asks lots of questions, some difficult and embarrassing\n- learns about differences between people\n- can remember more than a single thought at one time\n- still cannot always tell the difference between what happened in his head and what happened in reality\n- likes to make up his mind very slowly sometimes.\nYour four year old:\n- loves to throw and catch a ball\n- loves to ride his trike\n- is developing confidence in his physical ability\n- easily misjudges his physical capacities.\nYour four year old:\n- can make conversation about lots of different topics\n- loves silly jokes and \"rude\" words.\nBowler, Peter and Linke, Pam \"Your Child from One to Ten\" 2nd Ed.

When we think of communication,we often associate it with verbal behaviours, which include “talking,” and “using words.”\nHowever, communication goes beyond just verbal output, it also involves nonverbal behaviours such as eye contact, facial expressions, gestures and appropriate distance between people.\nFurthermore,communicating socially requires additional skills, which include using language for different purposes, changing language according to the needs of the listener or situation, and following rules for conversation.\nIn order to provide the right support, we need to first begin by understanding the social communication developmental milestones in young children.\nChildren between ages 2-3 begin to control behaviour verbally rather than just physically\n- They start to request permission for items or activities.\n- They are able to participate in simple group activities and usually watch other children briefly before joining in their play.\nChildren at age 3-4 begin to relate personal experiences through verbalization.\n- They start to express ideas and feelings and show frustration if not understood.\n- They begin to be able to take turns and play cooperatively with peers.\nAt age 4-5, children show greater language use for social interactions.\n- They use words to invite others to play, use language to resolve disputes with peers, and use direct requests with justification (e.g. “Stop that. You are hurting me.”)\nAt age 5-6, children’s social language becomes increasingly sophisticated.\n- They begin to use word plays, ask questions for information, ask for meanings of words, and use threats and promises.\n- In terms of peer interactions, they start making group decisions, assigning roles,and playing fairly.Some children are able to learn these skills quickly by watching and interacting with adults and other children.\n- However, for others, they would require some support in order to gain the skills needed for successful social communication.With your help, your child can acquire the skills and improve on them.\nFun Activities to support your child’s social communication\nHere are some fun activities you can do with your child.\n- Play a “guess the face” game.Teach your child basic emotions such as sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and happiness and help them understand facial expressions and the emotions they convey.\n- Discuss and associate different situations to various emotions. As they become more observant of the emotional signals of others, they are better able to detect how others are feeling and react appropriately early in the interaction. Correct recognition of emotional expressions is foundational to successful social interaction.\n- Play games with your child to teach turn-taking skills and playing games fairly. Board games such as Snakes and Ladders and bingo help children learn the turn-taking aspect of playing and communication. You can incorporate social language while playing such as “Who goes first?” “Adam goes first.” “Whose turn is it?” “It’s your turn.”\n- Plan a cooking activity and share and eat the food afterward.\n- Snack time is a great time to teach your child offering and requesting food appropriately.\n- You can show your child how to gain a person’s attention appropriately by tapping on the shoulder or calling the person’s name. You can incorporate social language when modeling request “May I have some please?” and offering snacks such as “Would you like some?”\n- Setting up or organising play dates with one or more peers can help your child practice his learnt social communication skills in a natural setting. It can also be a good opportunity to assess which areas he /she require more support.\n- Modeling and using pictures or other visuals such as written words with your child can help to give your him/her the words to use in social interactions and can help develop social communication skills in peer interactions.\nIt is not unusual for children to have social communication difficulty in a few situations.\nHowever, if the problems in social language use occur more often and seem inappropriate for the child’s age, your child may need intervention to address the learning of specific verbal and nonverbal behaviours for peer interaction.\nA team approach involving speech language therapists, teachers, parents and peers are important in promoting generalizations of skills and in supporting success in social communication.\nThis article is brought to you by the team of speech-language therapists and occupational therapists from THK Therapy Services (Previously known as The Children’s Therapy Centre).

{"question":"How did globalization impact regional growth in EU-27 countries between 2001-2006?","answer":"Most regions significantly benefited from globalization, as measured by increasing trade openness and FDI (Foreign Direct Investment). The growth elasticities for globalization and technology transfers decreased with increasing GDP per capita. Additionally, the estimated elasticity for FDI decreased when accounting for higher human capital premium in CEE countries.","context":["The Does Globalization Affect Regional Growth? Evidence for NUTS-2 Regions in EU-27\nWe analyze the influence of newly constructed globalization measures on regional growth for the EU-27 countries between 2001 and 2006. The spatial Chow-Lin procedure, a method constructed by the authors, was used to construct, on a NUTS-2 level, complete regional data for exports, imports and FDI inward stocks, which serve as indicators for the influence of globalization, integration and technology transfers on European regions. The results suggest that most regions have significantly benefited from globalization measured by increasing trade openness and FDI. In a non-linear growth convergence model, the growth elasticities for globalization and technology transfers decrease with increasing GDP per capita. Furthermore, the estimated elasticity for FDI decreases when the model includes a higher human capital premium for CEE countries and a small significant growth enhancing effect accrues from the structural funds expenditures in the EU.\nReferences listed on IDEAS\nPlease report citation or reference errors to , or , if you are the registered author of the cited work, log in to your RePEc Author Service profile, click on \"citations\" and make appropriate adjustments.:\n- Joseph Berechman & Dilruba Ozmen & Kaan Ozbay, 2006. \"Empirical analysis of transportation investment and economic development at state, county and municipality levels,\" Transportation, Springer, vol. 33(6), pages 537-551, November.\n- Narula, Rajneesh & Wakelin, Katharine, 1998.\n\"Technological competitiveness, trade and foreign direct investment,\"\nStructural Change and Economic Dynamics,\nElsevier, vol. 9(3), pages 373-387, September.\n- Narula Rajneesh & Wakelin Katharine, 1995. \"Technological competitiveness, trade and foreign direct investment,\" Research Memorandum 013, Maastricht University, Maastricht Economic Research Institute on Innovation and Technology (MERIT).\n- Ricardo, David, 1821. \"On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation,\" History of Economic Thought Books, McMaster University Archive for the History of Economic Thought, edition 3, number ricardo1821.\n- Bronzini, Raffaello & Piselli, Paolo, 2009. \"Determinants of long-run regional productivity with geographical spillovers: The role of R&D, human capital and public infrastructure,\" Regional Science and Urban Economics, Elsevier, vol. 39(2), pages 187-199, March.\n- Rivera-Batiz, Luis A & Romer, Paul M, 1991.\n\"Economic Integration and Endogenous Growth,\"\nThe Quarterly Journal of Economics,\nMIT Press, vol. 106(2), pages 531-55, May.\n- Rivera-Batiz, Luis A. & Xie, Danyang, 1993. \"Integration among unequals,\" Regional Science and Urban Economics, Elsevier, vol. 23(3), pages 337-354, July.\n- Petrakos, George & Dimitris, Kallioras & Ageliki, Anagnostou, 2007. \"A Generalized Model of Regional Economic Growth in the European Union,\" Papers DYNREG12, Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).\n- Mari Carmen Puigcerver-Penalver, 2007. \"The Impact of Structural Funds Policy on European Regions' Growth : A Theoretical and Empirical Approach,\" European Journal of Comparative Economics, Cattaneo University (LIUC), vol. 4(2), pages 179-208, September.\n- Sascha O.

{"question":"How does the safety railing design compare between the Netherlands observation tower and standard residential staircases?","answer":"In the observation tower, the safety railing consists of a steel mesh parapet that creates a balustrade for the staircase and platforms, designed to combine maximum transparency with necessary safety. For residential staircases, the safety requirements specify that balusters should not exceed 5cm in thickness and must be installed at 15cm increments, with additional wall handrails required for wider staircases. The minimum height for residential staircase railings must be at least 90cm.","context":["Dutch architects UNStudio have designed a concrete observation tower to cantilever into the sky above a nature reserve in the Netherlands.\nThe 25 metre-high tower will be primarily constructed from a high-performance concrete that the studio has been researching alongside engineers ABT, developer BAM Utiliteitsbouw and concrete manufacturer Haitsma Beton.\nThis dense concrete strengthened by steel fibres will enable the impressive cantilever, while embedded steel members will provide additional stability.\nVisitors will climb 134 steps to reach the highest of the tower’s three viewing platforms, which will be positioned five metres above the surrounding forest canopy.\nClick above for larger image\nA steel mesh parapet will create a balustrade for the staircase and platforms.\nHere's a project description from UNStudio:\nUNStudio’s design for an Observation Tower for ‘De Onlanden’ presented to Natuurmonumenten\nOn September 22nd the design for an observation tower for the nature reserve ‘De Onlanden’, situated to the South-West of the City of Groningen, was presented to Natuurmonumenten (the Dutch Society for the Preservation of Natural Heritage) during the mini-symposium ‘Experience Nature with innovative concrete’ in Peize. The observation tower is the result of a study into the optimal application of Ultra High Performance Concrete by a case study team comprising of UNStudio, ABT, BAM Utiliteitsbouw en Haitsma Beton. Natuurmonumenten received the design as a gift from the case study team.\nCase Study Observation Tower Ultra High performance Concrete\nThe design for the observation tower is the result of a case study which aimed to apply the characteristics of Ultra High Performance Concrete in a functional, operative design. The case study team consisted of designers, engineers and builders who together sought a solution through which architecture and construction could reinforce one another. According to Ben van Berkel, “The observation tower afforded our Inventive Materials Research Platform the opportunity to investigate the properties of Ultra High Performance Concrete and to truly test out the full potential of this new material in a real structure.” Ultra High performance Concrete differs from normal concrete as it has a very high density, contains steel fibres and has an extremely fine grain structure. These properties facilitate the application of large compressive stresses in structures of narrow dimensions. UNStudio’s Inventive Materials Platform is one of four in-house research platforms and aims to investigate custom-made material applications and to facilitate inspired and imaginative collaborations with other experts and with manufacturers in the construction industry.\nThe Observation Tower\nThe 25 metre high observation tower will be realised on the forested boundary of ‘De Onlanden’ nature reserve on the outskirts of Groningen. Once built, the tower will extend 5 metres above the trees and will offer views over the 3,000 hectares of natural landscape which form the largest water storage area in the Netherlands.\nThe design for the observation tower guides visitors in a fluid ascent up the 134 steps to the highest viewing point. Visitors are lead via the first set of steps to the lower viewing platform which stands at a height of 10 metres. Following this, the second set of steps provides a turn in direction, allowing for an alternative view of the surrounding forested pastures. These steps lead visitors through the tree tops to the second viewing platform which stands at a height of 20 metres and offers views over the nature reserve around the city of Groningen. The highest viewing platform, at a height of 24 metres, is reached via the final set of steps and offers visitors a wide open vista of ‘De Onlanden’ nature reserve.\nBy means of changes in direction in the structure of the observation tower, visitors can experience views of the surrounding natural landscape from different perspectives, whereby the height of each viewing platform offers a different experience of the vistas over the surrounding landscape. From the highest viewing platform views are afforded of the Groningen skyline, which includes the Education Executive Agency & Tax office building which was also designed by UNStudio.\nBen van Berkel: “The Netherlands enjoys a rich and textured natural landscape, but unfortunately the Dutch topography is not very varied; we don’t have mountain ranges, or many hilly areas from which to enjoy a panoramic overview of our natural surroundings. The viewing tower for ‘De Onlanden’ was designed to provide the opportunity to create a new awareness and different perspectives of the landscape we move through, but may otherwise never experience in all its scope.”\nThe fine lines and the form of the tower bring to mind the silhouette of a deer. UNStudio’s design has therefore been given the (provisional) name ‘Het Hoge Hert’ (The Tall Stag).\nThe observation Tower is a hybrid construction, consisting of a combination of steel and Ultra High Performance Concrete. Steel is employed where the tensile stresses are foremost, whereas Ultra High Performance Concrete manifests excellent performance properties where the compressive stresses are highest. The parapet around the stairs and platforms is constructed from stainless steel mesh, enabling the combination of both maximum transparency and necessary safety levels.\nBen van Berkel: “The strength of Ultra High Performance Concrete is conceptually expressed in the cantilever of the structure, which combines UHPC with steel to enable a substantial protraction in the form of the viewing tower.”\nLocation: Outskirts of Drenthe (near City of Groningen, Eelde and Peize)\nHeight: 25 m\nNo. of steps: 134\nProgramme: Observation Tower\nUNStudio: Ben van Berkel with Arjan Dingsté and Marianthi Tatari, Marc Hoppermann, Kristoph Nowak, Tomas Mokry, Dorus Faber\nCase Study partners: UNStudio, ABT, Haitsma Beton, BAM Utiliteitsbouw","Thinking about building their own home, developers are increasingly giving preference to two-story cottages, since this is the most optimal way to expand living space in a relatively small area. The construction of multi-storey private buildings is associated with the need to equip a reliable staircase that ensures safe movement on floors. According to experts and experienced developers, interfloor staircases are not only functional, but also a decorative detail of the interior, which makes it possible to transform a room beyond recognition. In this regard, if you are the owners of a country cottage with an attic, in which there are no stairs yet, it’s time to think about its correct planning and construction, the procedure for which will be considered in this material, prepared by our experienced specialists.\nUnhindered rise to the floor can be achieved by purchasing and installing a ready-made structure, which is characterized by a number of disadvantages:\n- High price characteristics;\n- The need to spend additional time on adjusting the parameters of the structure, since it often does not correspond to the parameters of the house;\n- And, of course, there is always a risk that you will buy a poor quality product..\nIn order not to once again face serious production shortcomings, we advise you to use our advice and start making an interfloor staircase with your own hands..\nSpiral staircases are ornate compositions, the design of which resembles a spiral twisted along the axis. The main purpose of spiral staircases is installation in small rooms, where there is an urgent need to save every square meter. It is important to familiarize yourself with the basic design parameters of spiral staircases: in accordance with building codes, the diameter of the spiral staircase is 1.3 m, while the central width of the step is 20 to 25 cm;\nMarching staircase – one of the most common structures erected in the construction of multi-storey cottages. It is a supporting stepped structure located at an angle of 45 degrees. Spans of mid-flight stairs are also stepped, while the number of steps in one span is up to 15 pieces;\nSwivel stairs are characterized by a similar design, marching stairs, which differs from the previous one by the presence of a turn of up to 180 degrees. Despite the fact that the design of such stairs is quite traditional, its manufacture is associated with certain difficulties, and therefore, it is better to entrust it to specialists;\nBolt stairs – another version of marching stairs, the design of which involves their fastening not to a support, but directly to the wall, in connection with which it acquires some originality and, at the same time, airiness.\nSpiral staircases have become a recent innovation, which have earned their popularity due to their elegant design and certain functional advantages. What do we mean by virtue? In this case, we are talking about the possibility of stretching the spiral staircase to any height you need, while spending the established minimum area under the stairs. An important advantage of assembling a spiral staircase is the ability to assemble it by a person without professional skills..\nDespite this, it is characterized by a number of serious shortcomings:\n- The size of the tread, that is, the main, running part of the steps, is optimal and safe only in the middle, where they almost never step;\n- The angle of inclination of the stairs changes two to three or more times;\n- Differences in designs intended for left-handers and right-handers: they should be made in a mirror image – for left-handers, twisted counterclockwise, for right-handers – vice versa;\n- It is forbidden to lift furniture and other heavy objects along the spiral staircase..\nBefore answering the question: \"How to make an interfloor staircase?\", consider the basic requirements for the safety of staircase structures.\n- The main concept that must be followed in the manufacture of interfloor stairs is the safety of movement, which depends on the degree of observance of the optimal dimensions and technical characteristics of the entire staircase. Since the main element of the staircase, which determines its safety, is the steps, it is necessary to correctly observe its basic parameters: the tread is a horizontally oriented surface, the riser is vertical. These dimensions are determined based on the angle of rise of the stairs;\n- To prevent falls and injuries, it is believed that the optimal angle of inclination of the ladder is 45 degrees, while the width of the step should be at least 45th foot. In this case, the height of the vertical part of the step should not exceed 20 cm;\n- Handrails, balusters and poles are an integral part of the stairs, especially those installed in those houses where there are children. If the thickness of the balusters does not exceed 5 cm, they should be installed in 15 cm increments.But if you plan to install a wide staircase, equip it with an additional railing with a wall handrail.\nThus, the basic requirements for the safety of an interfloor staircase in a private house are as follows:\n- Convenience and reliability of the design;\n- The presence of a convenient approach to the stairs;\n- Safe and convenient location of the railings;\n- Correspondence of the length and height of the steps to the length of the step;\n- Adequate lighting above the stairs.\nInterfloor wooden stairs are the most affordable way of installing stairs for an inexperienced craftsman. However, a significant drawback of ladder structures made of straight-grained coniferous wood is their relatively quick failure, due to the fact that the ladders begin to creak and dry out. But given the fact that a significantly lower load-bearing load lies on a wooden staircase, it can be easily repaired, or, in the event of a major overhaul, install a new one..\nAs for the stairs made of fine-grained high-density hardwood, their service life is much longer, however, their cost is several times higher than the cost of the previous ones..\nImportant! Although hardwood is more durable, it is susceptible to the harmful effects of insects and fungus. In this regard, an integral and one of the first operations in the manufacture of wooden stairs from hardwood is their impregnation with complex protective compounds against pests..\nHowever, in certain cases, the installation of an interfloor staircase made of coniferous wood is quite acceptable. Consider these cases.\nIf you plan to install an attic, especially a folding or retractable ladder, which will last no less than a ladder made of fine-grained rocks, due to the special microclimate of the attic;\n- If your house has a seasonally inhabited attic or an unheated one and a half floor, the transition to them can also be arranged using a staircase made of coniferous species;\n- In a one and a half or two-story cottage, inhabited only in the warm season, you can also equip the same staircase;\n- The sleeping attic can also be equipped with such a ladder, however, they must first be protected from drying out by treating with a special water-polymer emulsion, varnish and paint.\nIn private housing construction, metal stairs are usually used in combination with other materials:\n- The frame is often welded metal;\n- The steps are made of wood or concrete;\n- While decorative finishing is carried out using any materials you wish.\nDespite the fact that the manufacture of a staircase with a metal frame is a much more laborious and costly business, however, its operational life is practically unlimited, due to the peculiarities of the material, while it is possible to change or repair the staircase without drastically changing the design of the staircase.\nThe construction of reinforced concrete stairs is associated with mass standard construction. But private construction is not complete without the construction of such structures. They are of two types: monolithic and combined with metal. In the first case, the technology of their installation involves the manufacture of steps by pouring concrete into a frame, similar to a metal-wooden staircase, reinforced with reinforcement. In this case, horizontally oriented surfaces, which are less susceptible to wear, are made in any other way..\nInterfloor stairs photo\nOften, the main mistake of developers is that they think about erecting an interfloor staircase at the end of the construction of the house. Ideally, the design of the staircase should be started at the stage of foundation construction, so that you can correctly calculate the load on the staircase, as well as correctly calculate the interfloor staircase and its location.\nWhen calculating the parameters of an interfloor staircase, pay attention to the following characteristics, having withstood which, you will mount a safe staircase:\n- The angle of inclination of the stairs is at least 45 degrees;\n- Tread width – 30-35 cm;\n- Lift height – from 14 to 18 cm.\nBefore proceeding with the manufacture of an interfloor staircase, it is necessary to develop its project and make calculations of the parameters of the future structure;\nDecide on the location of your future structure and measure the parameters of the room;\nGiven the width of your future staircase, calculate the height of the steps as follows:\nFor example, if the height of the stairs is 250 cm, and the height of the steps is 18 cm, the first indicator must be divided by the second. As a result, having received the quotient and rounded it to an integer, we come to the conclusion that the required number of steps is 14. To determine the height of the steps, the height of the entire structure (250 cm) is divided by the number of steps (14 pieces) and we get the number 17.86 – exactly this should be the height of the steps.\nNext, you need to decide on the shape and height of the railing. It is important to remember that this is the main safety parameter of the entire staircase. The height of the railing must be at least 90 cm, while you can choose their design at your discretion.\nNext, decide on the material from which you plan to make the staircase structure. For this, you can choose metal, stone or traditional wood. In addition, you can use additional materials such as glass or ceramics..\nNext, evaluate the strength of the floor and other floors in the place where the future structure will be installed. This is necessary so that in the event of exceeding the possible loads, the destruction of the floors does not occur..\nImportant! The destruction of load-bearing structures can occur if the permissible weight of the ladder is exceeded, in the case of the use of low-quality materials, an insufficient number of support points, as well as insufficient strength of the fasteners. In this regard, it is necessary to carry out preliminary fastenings according to the approximate location of the support points, the strengthening of insufficiently reliable floors, as well as the choice of structures, the weight of which corresponds to the reliability of the supporting elements.\nStrengthening the site is another integral stage of the preparatory work, since it is the basis of the staircase structure.\nAfter you have decided on the location of the future structure and its configuration, carried out the calculations and chose the suitable material for the stairs – in general, we have completely carried out the preparatory measures, purchase a basis for future parts, and then adjust all the details yourself. You can also ask for help from specialists who will completely fit all the elements, as well as assemble the structure..\nPrepare the beam structures, as well as mark the steps. This is necessary for the subsequent preparation for the installation of steps.\nDo not forget that the calculations of the parameters of the staircase are made taking into account the staircase configuration. In this regard, before calculating the spiral staircase, it is necessary to make a rounded opening, while when installing a flight staircase, the opening is rectangular or square.\nFastening of the steps of the stairs is carried out using special stringers or bowstrings. There is another way of attaching the steps, which involves cutting the steps in the form of the side parts of the bowstring..\nIf you preferred the first method of fastening, install the support post, and mark the location of the steps on the supporting beams. Using a disc tire, make grooves on the steps. Using self-tapping screws, attach the stringers to the wall in accordance with any technique you know. It is important to remember that the interfloor staircase is always located in the immediate vicinity of the wall..\nIf you chose a spiral staircase, first of all, install the rack, which will act as a supporting beam for the entire structure. In this case, it is better to give preference to a metal rather than a wooden stand. Next, put a wooden sleeve, a metal washer on the rack and start installing the steps.\nAt the final stage of the staircase installation, fix the railings, balusters and racks, as well as other decorative elements available to you, which are secondary parts of the staircase and are installed in order to give the structure a certain zest. Finally, cover the stairs with varnish..\nWhen choosing a material for the manufacture of a staircase and giving preference to planed wood, follow these recommendations.\n- The surface of the material should be characterized by the absolute absence of dark spots;\n- Defects, cracks and chips on the surface of the material, as well as any roughness, are unacceptable;\n- If you plan to make only steps and risers from the material you have chosen, the presence of small knots and defects is allowed. We must not forget about the moisture content of the material, and therefore, refuse to purchase material that is characterized by a large mass.\nRegardless of the stair design you choose, there are many options for mounting and assembling each of them. By watching the video presented in the article, you can acquire additional practical skills for making an interfloor staircase from various materials."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:08bb185d-9169-4314-8967-be8eff6f9769>","<urn:uuid:a05d2d03-a697-4d4e-8b62-32e3d0e4a088>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I work in network architecture. What are the key advantages of multi-CDN delivery for live streaming performance, and how does it compare to traditional load balancing approaches for optimizing network traffic?","answer":"Multi-CDN delivery for live streaming offers several performance benefits: it enables adaptation to changing network conditions through multiple delivery paths, provides optimized geo-coverage and eyeball network coverage to route around congestion, and allows leveraging peak traffic capacity from multiple providers simultaneously. In comparison, traditional load balancing distributes workloads across computing resources to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload of single resources. While both approaches aim to improve performance, multi-CDN specifically addresses streaming needs through real-time performance insights and quality of experience optimization, whereas load balancing focuses on general workload distribution across servers and network resources.","context":["Multi-CDN delivery has been growing in popularity for a variety of reasons, ranging from security to performance to simply updating legacy architecture.\nFor companies that deliver content via live streaming though, there are unique reasons to consider multi-CDN. Real-time performance insights, automation, on-the-fly control and flexibility, and — most of all, quality of experience — are crucial to success. Let’s explore why you should evaluate multi-CDN and what key factors to consider in doing so for your quality of experience (QoE) goals.\nQoE benefits of multi-CDN delivery\nBeyond high availability and network redundancy, multi-CDN delivery also enables providers to adapt to changing network conditions with multiple delivery paths to the viewer:\nGeo-coverage and optimizations: Delivery networks differ in characteristics and coverage geographically. Understanding these differences and where one network might be more performant provides a key lever in QoE.\nEyeball network optimization and coverage: Closely tied to geo-coverage, edge delivery networks may not reach eyeball networks the same way. These differences can allow a broadcaster to route around network congestion to avoid jitter, latency, or other adverse QoE conditions.\nPeak traffic capacity, on-demand: Multi-CDN delivery allows a broadcaster to leverage all the peak capacity available to each edge provider simultaneously. Some providers will also provide reserved capacity for peak events.\nA clear vision of your fan experience goals should drive how you leverage these benefits. For example, the best delivery path is not necessarily measured just by latency. A 4K stream requires significantly more throughput than a 1080p stream. A low-latency stream experience is much less tolerant of network jitter, which can cause rebuffering. Multi-CDN delivery allows you to select the optimal path for the performance profile based on your specific QoE goals.\nKey considerations for multi-CDN delivery\nThe QoE goals you focus on should also dictate your multi-CDN vendors — including understanding what vendor-specific features you might have to give up or normalize across all of them. Here are a couple QoE considerations to keep in mind when choosing CDN vendors:\nTraffic management: The fundamentals of multi-CDN delivery require a traffic management layer. Your QoE goals will influence what criterion drives a CDN switch and whether you select DNS, the player, or server-side manifest manipulation to route traffic to each edge provider.\nBut it is equally important to consider how each CDN and the aggregate of all of the providers in your architecture will impact your origin infrastructure. Consider that AWS Elemental MediaStore, a high-performance cloud storage system designed for low latency live stream, can handle 1,000 requests per second. Some CDN providers have thousands of mid-tier servers that provide caching hierarchies to reduce the impact of massive requests for new objects. In live video delivery, every segment is a new object. And the manifest itself is a newly refreshed object that must be accessed by the player constantly. In a multi-CDN delivery deployment, this could mean 10s of thousands of requests going back to your MediaStore every second--several times more than what it can handle.\nProtecting your origin from this load is critical to maintaining availability to the stream. Products like Fastly’s Media Shield provide this critical origin offload, further collapsing the requests of many mid-tier CDN servers to just a few per second going back to origin infrastructure.\nObservability: In order to determine success, you need to be able to see what’s going on. This is not just having monitoring or analytics. It is having a complete picture of what’s going right and wrong, where that’s happening and why. Commonly referred to as observability, this methodology in DevOps practices translates to streaming with significant benefits.\nOf critical importance, real-time stream switching requires observability on every downstream delivery component, from each CDN to the player to the ad ecosystem (if that’s a factor). Note that some CDNs do not provide real-time logging critical to this workflow. Fastly’s Media Shield provides real-time logging in multi-CDN deployments for downstream CDNs.\nWhere to go from here?\nThe most important thing to remember as you’re architecting multi-CDN delivery is to understand your primary motivation for choosing this in the first place and ensuring that your application, infrastructure, and engineering teams are in a position to make your implementation successful.\nReady for more info?

(December 2010)|\nIn computing, load balancing distributes workloads across multiple computing resources, such as computers, a computer cluster, network links, central processing units or disk drives. Load balancing aims to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload of any single resource. Using multiple components with load balancing instead of a single component may increase reliability and availability through redundancy. Load balancing usually involves dedicated software or hardware, such as a multilayer switch or a Domain Name System server process.\nLoad balancing differs from channel bonding in that load balancing divides traffic between network interfaces on a network socket (OSI model layer 4) basis, while channel bonding implies a division of traffic between physical interfaces at a lower level, either per packet (OSI model Layer 3) or on a data link (OSI model Layer 2) basis with a protocol like shortest path bridging.\nOne of the most commonly used applications of load balancing is to provide a single Internet service from multiple servers, sometimes known as a server farm. Commonly load-balanced systems include popular web sites, large Internet Relay Chat networks, high-bandwidth File Transfer Protocol sites, Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) servers, Domain Name System (DNS) servers, and databases.\nFor Internet services, the load balancer is usually a software program that is listening on the port where external clients connect to access services. The load balancer forwards requests to one of the \"backend\" servers, which usually replies to the load balancer. This allows the load balancer to reply to the client without the client ever knowing about the internal separation of functions. It also prevents clients from contacting back-end servers directly, which may have security benefits by hiding the structure of the internal network and preventing attacks on the kernel's network stack or unrelated services running on other ports.\nSome load balancers provide a mechanism for doing something special in the event that all backend servers are unavailable. This might include forwarding to a backup load balancer, or displaying a message regarding the outage.\nIt is also important that the load balancer itself does not become a single point of failure. Usually load balancers are implemented in high-availability pairs which may also replicate session persistence data if required by the specific application.\nAn alternate method of load balancing, which does not necessarily require a dedicated software or hardware node, is called round robin DNS. In this technique, multiple IP addresses are associated with a single domain name; clients are expected to choose which server to connect to. Unlike the use of a dedicated load balancer, this technique exposes to clients the existence of multiple backend servers. The technique has other advantages and disadvantages, depending on the degree of control over the DNS server and the granularity of load balancing desired.\nAnother more effective technique for load-balancing using DNS is to delegate www.example.org as a sub-domain whose zone is served by each of the same servers that are serving the web site. This technique works particularly well where individual servers are spread geographically on the Internet. For example,\none.example.org A 192.0.2.1 two.example.org A 203.0.113.2 www.example.org NS one.example.org www.example.org NS two.example.org\nHowever, the zone file for www.example.org on each server is different such that each server resolves its own IP Address as the A-record. On server one the zone file for www.example.org reports:\n@ in a 192.0.2.1\nOn server two the same zone file contains:\n@ in a 203.0.113.2\nThis way, when a server is down, its DNS will not respond and the web service does not receive any traffic. If the line to one server is congested, the unreliability of DNS ensures less HTTP traffic reaches that server. Furthermore, the quickest DNS response to the resolver is nearly always the one from the network's closest server, ensuring geo-sensitive load-balancing. A short TTL on the A-record helps to ensure traffic is quickly diverted when a server goes down. Consideration must be given the possibility that this technique may cause individual clients to switch between individual servers in mid-session.\nNumerous scheduling algorithms are used by load balancers to determine which back-end server to send a request to. Simple algorithms include random choice or round robin. More sophisticated load balancers may take additional factors into account, such as a server's reported load, least response times, up/down status (determined by a monitoring poll of some kind), number of active connections, geographic location, capabilities, or how much traffic it has recently been assigned.\nAn important issue when operating a load-balanced service is how to handle information that must be kept across the multiple requests in a user's session. If this information is stored locally on one backend server, then subsequent requests going to different backend servers would not be able to find it. This might be cached information that can be recomputed, in which case load-balancing a request to a different backend server just introduces a performance issue.\nIdeally the cluster of servers behind the load balancer should be session-aware, so that if a client connects to any backend server at any time the user experience is unaffected. This is usually achieved with a shared database or an in-memory session database, for example Memcached.\nOne basic solution to the session data issue is to send all requests in a user session consistently to the same backend server. This is known as persistence or stickiness. A significant downside to this technique is its lack of automatic failover: if a backend server goes down, its per-session information becomes inaccessible, and any sessions depending on it are lost. The same problem is usually relevant to central database servers; even if web servers are \"stateless\" and not \"sticky\", the central database is (see below).\nAssignment to a particular server might be based on a username, client IP address, or be random. Because of changes of the client's perceived address resulting from DHCP, network address translation, and web proxies this method may be unreliable. Random assignments must be remembered by the load balancer, which creates a burden on storage. If the load balancer is replaced or fails, this information may be lost, and assignments may need to be deleted after a timeout period or during periods of high load to avoid exceeding the space available for the assignment table. The random assignment method also requires that clients maintain some state, which can be a problem, for example when a web browser has disabled storage of cookies. Sophisticated load balancers use multiple persistence techniques to avoid some of the shortcomings of any one method.\nAnother solution is to keep the per-session data in a database. Generally this is bad for performance because it increases the load on the database: the database is best used to store information less transient than per-session data. To prevent a database from becoming a single point of failure, and to improve scalability, the database is often replicated across multiple machines, and load balancing is used to spread the query load across those replicas. Microsoft's ASP.net State Server technology is an example of a session database. All servers in a web farm store their session data on State Server and any server in the farm can retrieve the data.\nIn the very common case where the client is a web browser, a simple but efficient approach is to store the per-session data in the browser itself. One way to achieve this is to use a browser cookie, suitably time-stamped and encrypted. Another is URL rewriting. Storing session data on the client is generally the preferred solution: then the load balancer is free to pick any backend server to handle a request. However, this method of state-data handling is poorly suited to some complex business logic scenarios, where session state payload is big and recomputing it with every request on a server is not feasible. URL rewriting has major security issues, because the end-user can easily alter the submitted URL and thus change session streams.\nYet another solution to storing persistent data is to associate a name with each block of data, and use a distributed hash table to pseudo-randomly assign that name to one of the available servers, and then store that block of data in the assigned server.\nLoad balancer features\nHardware and software load balancers may have a variety of special features. The fundamental feature of a load balancer is to be able to distribute incoming requests over a number of backend servers in the cluster according to a scheduling algorithm. Most of the following features are vendor specific:\n- Asymmetric load: A ratio can be manually assigned to cause some backend servers to get a greater share of the workload than others. This is sometimes used as a crude way to account for some servers having more capacity than others and may not always work as desired.\n- Priority activation: When the number of available servers drops below a certain number, or load gets too high, standby servers can be brought online.\n- SSL Offload and Acceleration: Depending on the workload, processing the encryption and authentication requirements of an SSL request can become a major part of the demand on the Web Server's CPU; as the demand increases, users will see slower response times, as the SSL overhead is distributed among Web servers. To remove this demand on Web servers, a balancer can terminate SSL connections, passing HTTPS requests as HTTP requests to the Web servers. If the balancer itself is not overloaded, this does not noticeably degrade the performance perceived by end users. The downside of this approach is that all of the SSL processing is concentrated on a single device (the balancer) which can become a new bottleneck. Some load balancer appliances include specialized hardware to process SSL. Instead of upgrading the load balancer, which is quite expensive dedicated hardware, it may be cheaper to forgo SSL offload and add a few Web servers. Also, some server vendors such as Oracle/Sun now incorporate cryptographic acceleration hardware into their CPUs such as the T2000. F5 Networks incorporates a dedicated SSL acceleration hardware card in their local traffic manager (LTM) which is used for encrypting and decrypting SSL traffic. One clear benefit to SSL offloading in the balancer is that it enables it to do balancing or content switching based on data in the HTTPS request.\n- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack protection: load balancers can provide features such as SYN cookies and delayed-binding (the back-end servers don't see the client until it finishes its TCP handshake) to mitigate SYN flood attacks and generally offload work from the servers to a more efficient platform.\n- HTTP compression: reduces amount of data to be transferred for HTTP objects by utilizing gzip compression available in all modern web browsers. The larger the response and the further away the client is, the more this feature can improve response times. The tradeoff is that this feature puts additional CPU demand on the Load Balancer and could be done by Web servers instead.\n- TCP offload: different vendors use different terms for this, but the idea is that normally each HTTP request from each client is a different TCP connection. This feature utilizes HTTP/1.1 to consolidate multiple HTTP requests from multiple clients into a single TCP socket to the back-end servers.\n- TCP buffering: the load balancer can buffer responses from the server and spoon-feed the data out to slow clients, allowing the web server to free a thread for other tasks faster than it would if it had to send the entire request to the client directly.\n- Direct Server Return: an option for asymmetrical load distribution, where request and reply have different network paths.\n- Health checking: the balancer polls servers for application layer health and removes failed servers from the pool.\n- HTTP caching: the balancer stores static content so that some requests can be handled without contacting the servers.\n- Content filtering: some balancers can arbitrarily modify traffic on the way through.\n- HTTP security: some balancers can hide HTTP error pages, remove server identification headers from HTTP responses, and encrypt cookies so that end users cannot manipulate them.\n- Priority queuing: also known as rate shaping, the ability to give different priority to different traffic.\n- Content-aware switching: most load balancers can send requests to different servers based on the URL being requested, assuming the request is not encrypted (HTTP) or if it is encrypted (via HTTPS) that the HTTPS request is terminated (decrypted) at the load balancer.\n- Client authentication: authenticate users against a variety of authentication sources before allowing them access to a website.\n- Programmatic traffic manipulation: at least one balancer allows the use of a scripting language to allow custom balancing methods, arbitrary traffic manipulations, and more.\n- Firewall: direct connections to backend servers are prevented, for network security reasons Firewall is a set of rules that decide whether the traffic may pass through an interface or not.\n- Intrusion prevention system: offer application layer security in addition to network/transport layer offered by firewall security.\nUse in telecommunications\nLoad balancing can be useful in applications with redundant communications links. For example, a company may have multiple Internet connections ensuring network access if one of the connections fails. A failover arrangement would mean that one link is designated for normal use, while the second link is used only if the primary link fails.\nUsing load balancing, both links can be in use all the time. A device or program monitors the availability of all links and selects the path for sending packets. The use of multiple links simultaneously increases the available bandwidth.\nShortest Path Bridging\nThe IEEE approved the IEEE 802.1aq standard May 2012, also known and documented in most books as Shortest Path Bridging (SPB). SPB allows all links to be active through multiple equal cost paths, provides faster convergence times to reduce down time, and simplifies the use of load balancing in mesh network topologies (partially connected and/or fully connected) by allowing traffic to load share across all paths of a network. SPB is designed to virtually eliminate human error during configuration and preserves the plug-and-play nature that established Ethernet as the de facto protocol at Layer 2.\nMany telecommunications companies have multiple routes through their networks or to external networks. They use sophisticated load balancing to shift traffic from one path to another to avoid network congestion on any particular link, and sometimes to minimize the cost of transit across external networks or improve network reliability.\nAnother way of using load balancing is in network monitoring activities. Load balancers can be used to split huge data flows into several sub-flows and use several network analyzers, each reading a part of the original data. This is very useful for monitoring fast networks like 10GbE or STM64, where complex processing of the data may not be possible at wire speed.\nRelationship to failovers\nLoad balancing is often used to implement failover—the continuation of a service after the failure of one or more of its components. The components are monitored continually (e.g., web servers may be monitored by fetching known pages), and when one becomes non-responsive, the load balancer is informed and no longer sends traffic to it. When a component comes back on line, the load balancer begins to route traffic to it again. For this to work, there must be at least one component in excess of the service's capacity (N+1 redundancy). This can be much less expensive and more flexible than failover approaches where each single live component is paired with a single backup component that takes over in the event of a failure (dual modular redundancy). Some types of RAID systems can also utilize hot spare for a similar effect.\n- \"High Availability\". linuxvirtualserver.org.

{"question":"How do structured reading programs support early literacy development in schools, and what role do community partnerships play in ensuring reading success?","answer":"Structured reading programs support early literacy through daily 20-minute phonics sessions teaching systematic synthetic phonics, where children learn letter sounds, digraphs, and trigraphs. They use schemes like Bug Club books and progress through multiple phases, developing skills like oral blending and segmenting. Students also learn high-frequency and tricky words by sight to encourage rapid recall when reading. As for community partnerships, they play a vital role through Community Learning Centers (CLCs) that provide extensive tutoring and support programs. These partnerships have shown remarkable results - for example, John P. Parker Elementary achieved a 100% success rate among third graders on state reading tests. CLCs bring in resources like literacy specialists for after-school programs and work with organizations like The Children's Home of Cincinnati to prepare children for kindergarten with basic literacy skills.","context":["Reading and Spelling Scheme\nYour child’s reading journey begins in EYFS, firstly through sharing a love of books. Both classes have an open and inviting book corner for children to self-select books to read, share and enjoy. These consist of both fiction and non-fiction books, comics and magazines, aiming to widen children’s experiences and love of reading material. Children will have a book read to them, at least once a day, often at lunch and home time, to share ideas together, learning basic words such as author, illustrator and title, and sharing ideas.\nChildren will take part in a daily, 20 minutes phonics session, teaching systematic synthetic phonics (SSP) and using Bug club books. This programme consists of 6 phases, and most children in EYFS will work through phases 1 to 4.\nIn phonics, children will learn letter sounds, digraphs and trigraphs. They will also learn the skills of oral blending and segmenting as a prelude to reading. Children will practise these skills throughout the session and will bring home activities related to the stage they are working at, for example games to support oral blending e.g. I say c-a-t, cat, you say c-a-t, cat, and word cards to read and support visual blending e.g. CVC flashcards to blend the letter sounds to read the words. When children start to become confident with oral and visual blending, they will move on to reading books. We follow the Bug Club reading scheme and children will bring home a phonetically decodable book which matches the sounds they are learning in phonics that week. These will be changed once children have mastered reading their book, which is usually over a minimum of three reads. It is vital children get the opportunity to read and develop their confidence over time with their reading book, in order to develop fluency when reading. Within the phonics sessions, children will learn high frequency and tricky words such as I, no, go, to, and the, related to the phonics phase. These words will be learnt by sight to encourage a rapid recall when reading.\nEach child will take home a weekly ‘sharing book’. These story books are for sharing with an adult at home to develop a love for reading with others. Children can discuss the story line and characters, give their opinions and thoughts, make comments and predictions and learn early inference skills. Children explore rhyme, alliteration and nonsense words throughout their reading journey in EYFS and a book of the week linked to our topic broadens their reading experience.\nAt Beckers Green Primary School, we teach reading through daily phonics lessons, using a systematic and synthetic approach using Bug Club books. This groups letters (graphemes) together according to their sound (phoneme). By doing this, the children are able to identify when certain graphemes are used. For example, the ay sound has numerous graphemes, for example ai, a-e, eigh. The children will learn where these sounds are likely to be positioned. This helps improve their spelling and overall understanding of the English language.\nThe children will also have a daily tricky word lesson where they revise previously learnt words before being introduced to a new one. Once they have learnt all the tricky words, they focus on the common exception words.\nOur reading scheme is designed to encourage the children to practise reading words with the sounds that they are learning. This means that it can be tailored to each child. The children are given a paper copy of a book, as well as access to the online Bug Club books. Their reading records are looked at daily and each child is heard at least weekly by an adult in the classroom. Their books are changed once they have read it at least twice to a fluent level. Once the children have a secure grasp of all sounds, they move onto Accelerated Reader books. This computer-based programme enables children to complete a quiz on the content of the book they have just read.\nAs well as their reading book, the children will also take home a library book which is one that they will choose. This book will be changed weekly and is designed to develop pleasure for reading.\nIn Key Stage Two, we teach reading through Reading Skills lessons. Forming part of our English lessons each week, Reading Skills lessons aim to cover the skills deemed necessary to become active, engaged and skilled readers. Class texts linked to topics are used as whole class readers to support the delivery of these lessons and writing projects. Children will take part in a variety of whole class activities practising a wide variety of skills such as:\n- Navigating texts\n- Exploring vocabulary\n- Sequencing events\n- Justifying opinions\n- Making inferences\n- Making comparisons\n- Activating prior knowledge\nThere will be opportunities throughout the week for children to read for pleasure, this time can also be used to access the Accelerated Reader programme, where children can quiz on the content of their personal reading books. This computer-based programme has thousands of quizzes based on the content of many well-known books and it assesses children’s comprehension skills. The majority of the books in school (and books you may have at home) are available on this system.\nEvery class from Year 2 to 6 has a Reading Ambassador, who is voted for by the children. On a weekly basis they visit another class and read to the children or discuss a book they are currently reading. Children are encouraged to ask questions and we hope children will aspire to read books from different authors. We also hold in class book clubs where children get to share the book they are reading with others, to review it and offer recommendations. Year 6 also provide Reading prefects, who listen to younger children read during lunchtime reading club.\nAs a Key Stage, we have devised our own scheme for spelling which follows the new framework from the National Curriculum. In accordance with this, the children will be taught spelling conventions each week delivered in specific spelling sessions. Children will develop strategies to help them spell both common and exception words, including those listed for their year group. It is important that children have exposure to a broad range of vocabulary, through reading widely and investigating spelling patterns in order to increase their accuracy when spelling new words and to increase their curiosity in language.\nFollow the link below to accelerated reader where your children can quiz on the books they have read:\nWRITING AT BECKERS GREEN\nWriting is absolutely central to teaching and learning at Beckers Green. Our children are provided with every opportunity, as well as the necessary means, to produce high-quality writing for a range of purposes. Our aim is to develop writers who are as fluent as they are satisfied at having produced outcomes of the highest standard.\nWe expect our children to:\n- develop a fluent, confident and effective writerly voice expressed through a range of text types\n- develop an enjoyment of the English language through being able to write for a given purpose in a structured, organised as well as imaginative way\n- develop the discipline of systematically planning, drafting, amending, improving and evaluation each writing project\n- make explicit connections between oracy and literacy\n- consolidate growing lexical and grammatical recognition skills through the application of them in writing\n- draw lasting satisfaction from having their writing published and displayed across the school\nThe aim is always that pupils will leave our school as confident and formidable communicators in both the spoken and written word.\nThroughout the school the Text Builder model is used to clearly define the progression of skills. Throughout the school day children engage in an enriching variety of activities designed to develop, consolidate and extend their literacy skills. These include:\n- daily phonics session in EYFS and KS1\n- grammar taught as an integral and complimentary component of writing process itself\n- spelling taught on a building block basis, graduating from phonemes and graphemes to root words, prefix, suffix, word families and etymology\n- regular rehearsal of themes in writing projects through discussion, debate and drama\n- a high quality set text which is analysed in detail in reading skills lessons and used as the basis for many of the written responses in English lessons\n- via the Text Builder model, an encouragement of independence by means of a gradual and strategic removal of scaffolding in favour or more open ended planning formats\n- children respond to, and actively participate in, the live modelling of the teacher, following the principle of I do, we do, you do\n- stamina build through time allotted to proof reading and amending, as well as further planned rewrites before publishing\n- detailed self evaluation opportunities are used to consolidate learning and celebrate good progress","Learning to Read, Reading to Learn\nPhotography by Daniel Smyth\nThere are few gifts better than the ability to read, and the teachers at Cincinnati Public Schools (CPS) are working tirelessly to make sure every student in their care is given that gift. Together with community organizations in a respected partnership model, CPS is making sure students can learn to read and read to learn.\n“We have a district-wide emphasis on early literacy,” says Dawn Grady, manager of marketing and community relations at CPS. “We work to meet Ohio’s Third Grade Reading Guarantee, which ensures that students who need extra help in reading are identified and on track by the end of third grade. In addition to our classroom curriculum, many of our schools are home to Community Learning Centers, where community partners provide extensive tutoring and other programs for students to make sure there are no barriers to learning.”\nThe Community Learning Centers (CLCs) are a nationally-respected model where community partners team up with the school to provide services to students.\n“The concept of Community Learning Centers began in the early 2000s with the redesign of our school buildings,” says Julie Doppler, CLC coordinator for CPS. “CLCs turned schools into neighborhood hubs where students, families and community members could participate in programs and the building would be a shared-use facility with room for co-located partners such as health services, after-school programs, family support, art, gardening and more. Whatever the community chose to enhance their neighborhood and enrich the lives of children.”\nHowever, there is guidance behind the programming. “We are intentional about bringing into school buildings what is needed to make students succeed in school and in life,” adds Doppler. “We use data from the school, families and community to understand those needs and to align our partners to specific measurable goals.”\nOne of these goals is the reading initiative, supported by tutoring and other services. “We explore opportunities beyond the school day for students to read and be read to,” says Doppler. “The program aligns with the classroom work so we are moving not only academically but also personally for the students. For example, many of our tutors who come in during the day provide additional academic support, but also engage in supportive and encouraging relationships that build confidence in our students. This supports their success in school.”\nThe results speak for themselves. For instance, John P. Parker Elementary achieved a 100 percent success rate among third graders on the state reading test. And of all 3,000 CPS third-graders, there was only a 3 percent failure ration. These are outstanding figures.\n“The Community Learning Centers have made a big difference,” says John P. Parker Elementary School principal Kimberly Mack. “Prior to the development of these partnerships, we were within the school house trying to solve problems and now we are able to bring in more resources to help us remove any barriers that there may be to the students developing to their full potential.”\nMack says sometimes such basic needs as having enough to eat can make a huge difference on a scholar’s ability to learn. “We have a partnership with the Freestore Foodbank where we can give students what we call a Power Pack, a weekend’s food supply,” says Mack. “If we have children in need of a uniform, we have a partnership with the Assistance League and they’ll outfit our students who don’t have uniforms. If you aren’t dressed properly for school, what might that do to your self-esteem and your confidence?”\nShe explains that it would have been much more difficult to reach a 100 percent pass rate for the Third Grade Guarantee without the CLC model. “Students have to be able to read proficiently at the third grade level to meet that expectation, or they are returned to the third grade,” she says. “It would have been a major struggle to reach that 100 percent without the literacy specialist. My teachers work with the students during the day but she is able to provide them with an extended day program. They stay after school and work with her. Without the partner- ships, we wouldn’t to be able to do that for the students. Starting in preschool, they are instructed in literacy in the after-school program.”\nAnother great example of a partnership to support literacy is with “The Children’s Home of Cincinnati,” says Mack. “They provide a home visitation program for families within the community and begin working with children at ages three and four to prepare them for kindergarten so they have basic literacy skills coming in to school. We are very proud of our 100 percent pass rate, but we acknowledge that this work doesn’t happen in isolation. Parents are supporting what we are trying to do, we are utilizing community resources in innovative ways such as these partnerships to accomplish these goals.”\nThe success has received praise across the board. “Our partnership model is recognized nationally,” says Doppler. “We have received the National Coalition for Community Schools’ District of the Year Award for the work we are doing to engage families, the school and the community to work together in a partnership model. We have 600 partners and school-based health clinics in 21 schools. Districts across the country are contacting us to see how we do it, and we’re helping other districts build a model similar to what we have.”\nSome of the partners include YMCA, FamiliesFORWARD, Beech Acres, Activities Beyond the Classroom, GRAD Cincinnati, Talbert House and more. CPS blends Title I funds with grant dollars from organizations such as the Greater Cincinnati Foundation, United Way and Haile/ US Bank Foundation to help extend the opportunities for students further. “In addition, our non-profit partner Community Learning Center Institute provides six resource coordinators at no cost to CPS,” says Doppler.\nShe explains that CPS not only partners with Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center to show measurable data that the programming is benefiting students overall, but also observes students to make sure they are progressing on an individual level.\n“For instance, we’ve helped students get eyeglasses, and have seen reading levels improve and not only did scores go up, but student attitudes change and parents comment on the change,” says Doppler. “We see a lot of improvement. Getting supportive adults to interface with the students makes a huge difference.”\nThe program, essentially, aims to eliminate any barriers to students succeeding in school and helps to enrich students’ lives.\nPrincipal Mack encourages businesses, organizations and volunteers to reach out to schools to become involved. “This is a concept we as a community need to embrace,” she says. “I’m passionate about this concept. I’ve seen how it can work. I’ve worked in schools without it and I’ve worked in schools with it. I’ve seen how this pushes a school above and beyond. We talk about test scores, and those are important, but to prepare our children for life, we need to go beyond those scores. We need to help them become critical thinkers, to take the boundaries down and help them prepare for life.”\nFor more information about the Community Learning Centers and CPS schools, check out the district website at www.cps-k12.org."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6b12695b-24ed-4854-b49e-5321c9f95a77>","<urn:uuid:150e0080-0e0a-4fe5-9257-ca0c25f879dd>"],"error":null}

{"question":"I'm a construction contractor looking to understand panel materials - what are the key differences in outdoor applications between exterior grade plywood and OSB?","answer":"Exterior grade plywood and OSB serve different typical applications in construction. OSB is more commonly used in residential construction, while plywood is generally utilized in commercial structures. Both function as cladding for roofs, walls and subfloors. The key difference is that exterior grade plywood is manufactured with weather-resistant glue and consists of multiple layers of timber veneers cross-laminated together, making it highly durable for heavy-duty outdoor jobs like soffits, fascias, garages, and concrete framework.","context":["By Alex Anderson, DNR Forest Products Specialist, Rhinelander\nWhen people think of wood-based panel products, plywood and oriented-strand board (OSB) usually come to mind. However, a vast array of panel products whose primary building block is wood do not fall under the auspices of plywood or OSB. Before we explore those, it’s important to understand the distinction between “structural” panels and “non-structural” panels.\nAs the name implies, structural panels are designed to bolster the strength, stiffness and resistance of the items they adhere to. Plywood, generally, is utilized in commercial structures, whereas OSB is more common in residential construction.\nBoth plywood and OSB function as cladding for roofs, walls and subfloors. In Wisconsin, various plywood manufacturers generally produce hardwood plywood for decorative applications, such as furniture, cabinets, pinblocks for pianos and many others. There are also two OSB manufacturers in Wisconsin that utilize OSB as a base for their siding product.\nAlternatively, non-structural panel products are primarily represented by medium-density fiberboard (MDF), particleboard and hardboard. Like OSB and plywood, these panels are prized for their dimensional stability and textural consistency.\nContinue reading “There’s More To Panels Than OSB And Plywood”\nIn early September, the Wisconsin Wood Marketing Team and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources’ Forest Products Services program partnered with the Softwood Export Council and Northeastern Lumber Manufacturer’s Association to host a virtual trade seminar with US softwood manufacturers, US building material brokers, and Pakistani wood buyers.

While firewood is one of the most sustainable heat sources available, the forests that produce it are threatened when firewood infested by invasive species is moved long distances. Fortunately, we can reduce this threat together through responsible use, movement and sale of firewood and wood products.\nContinue reading “Fighting invasives together through responsible firewood practices”\nBy Andrea Diss-Torrance, invasive forest insects program coordinator, Andrea.DissTorrance@wisconsin.gov, 608-516-2223\nMost people know that using locally-sourced firewood helps prevent the spread of invasive pests and diseases.

In order to further understanding of how storm-damaged forest and woodlot salvage harvests differ from traditional timber sales, we have compiled information that will, hopefully, help landowners affected by the recent rash of severe weather events in Wisconsin deal with their damaged woodlands more confidently.\nMany of the downed trees from July’s severe weather are red pines (Pinus resinosa). Pines, particularly white pine (Pinus strobus) and red pine in the Lake States region, are susceptible to staining when they are harvested or killed during a weather event but are not processed quickly enough. The discoloration is a result of microscopic fungi that manifest as a pale, blueish stain in the wood often called “blue-stain” or “sap-stain.” Though there is a small, decorative market for blue-stained pine—sometimes referred to as “denim pine”—it is generally undesirable. Hardwood species are also susceptible to blue stain fungi. End coating logs with a wax barrier may reduce the risk of staining and end checking.\nThese logs show blue staining.

Topics covered in the webinar included: Biochar markets and uses, biochar production systems, applications in vegetable growing.\nThe webinar has been archived and can be viewed here.\nBy Logan Wells, forest products specialist, Hayward\nWorkforce development efforts are a key pillar in the Forest Products Services (FPS) program’s strategic direction. These efforts range from teaching and organizing technical workshops on topics that range from rail tie manufacturing to lumber grading. Traditionally, many efforts have focused on training the existing industry workforce. In addition, several current initiatives to raise career awareness in the forest products industry among students include the UW-Stevens Point LEAF Forest Products Kit and the Skills USA woodworking competition.\nTo build on these efforts of raising awareness about the importance of forest products and potential careers, an industry perspective curriculum is being developed by FPS in cooperation with agriculture teachers, industry partners and LEAF staff. The first installment of the curriculum will focus on the hardwood lumber sector and will be a full weeks’ worth of material. The first class is devoted to establishing basic information about the industry and process of turning logs into lumber. A general overview of the terms, products, jobs and sawmill equipment will be the focus of the first day. The second and third days will allow students to learn and practice the hands-on skill of lumber grading. Lumber grading is one of the most important skillsets in the hardwood industry. Teaching an abbreviated form of lumber grading will provide students a chance to practice applied math and critical thinking in a real-world application. The fourth day will be devoted to learning about the different types of defects in lumber and their causes along with a review exercise for the week. The final day will include resources for classes to connect with a guest speaker, participate in a mill tour or learn about other opportunities to continue to explore the hardwood lumber industry.\nThese materials will target freshman through junior level students and be taught in Career and Technical Education (CTE) classes like industrial technology, woodworking, agriculture or forestry/natural resources. The lumber grading program will be piloted with several schools this fall and be available in late Spring 2020. Eventually this model of industry perspective curriculum will be expanded to highlight information and skills of other sectors of the forest products industry, including logging and trucking.

Perfect for shelving and sheds; for flooring to roofing. Have a browse through the different sheet materials we keep in stock here. And as ever, if you have any questions just give us a call.\nOther Sheet Materials\nWhat is it? Exterior grade plywood is a sheet material which consists of multiple layers of timber veneers glued and compressed together to create a durable building material. Plywood is strong, and this comes down to the aforementioned veneers since the cross lamination process, whereby the grains of each veneer run in opposite directions, give it resiliance and strength.\nIdeal for: Since the glue used in during the manufacturing process is weather resistant, this ply is ideal for use on those heavy duty jobs outdoors where a large section of board is needed such as, general joinery, soffits & facias, van lining, garages, sheds and concrete framework etc.\nSizes available: Standard sheet dimensions - 1220mm x 2440mm (4' x 8'), these can be cut to size.\nThicknesses available: 4mm, 6mm, 9mm, 12mm, 18mm\nMarine Grade Plywood\nWhat is it? Marine grade plywood is similar to the exterior grade plywood we keep. However, this ply is manufactured with water resistant glue.\nIdeal for: The glue used to manufacture this plywood makes it perfect for use where moisture and water are present. As the name suggests, this ply is ideal for use in marine environments, as well as the various areas mentionned above.\nSizes available: It comes in 1220mm x 2440mm boards and\nThis item can be cut to size, however the whole board must be purchased.\nThicknesses available: 4mm, 6mm, 9mm, 12mm, 15mm and 18mm.\nMarine grade ply is not kept always in stock and is a special order item. However, it can be quickly sourced.\nWhat is it? Sheathing ply is manufactured in the same way as both exterior and marine ply, overlapping and cross laminated veneers. However, since this product is used mostly for structural projects, it doesn't use as expensive materials as the other two, hence it is considerably cheaper.\nIdeal for: Wall sheathing, furniture building, roofing, shuttering, packing and flooring.\nSizes available: 1220mm (4ft) x 2440mm (8ft)\nThis board can be cut to size.\nThicknesses available: 9.5mm, 12.5mm and 18mm.\nWhat is it? MDF (which stands for medium-density fiber board) is a composite sheet material manufactured from recycled wood fibers and resin which are compressed and dried to produce high grade, durable material which bears changes in heat and humidity well.\nIdeal for: MDF is best used indoors for shelving, boxing off areas, making doors for wardrobes; most general DIY projects really. Tnis is because it has a smooth surface which gives a professional finish, is easy to work with and is a cheaper alternative to plywood. However, given its fiberous composition, MDF is not suited to outdoor use since it will split and fray.\nNote: Before painting MDF, coat it in a primer. Otherwise the board will absorb the paint and it will be like you never painted it in the first place.\nSizes available: Sheet dimensions are 1220mm x 2440mm which can be cut to size.\nThicknesses: 4mm, 6mm, 9mm, 12mm, 15mm 18mm & 25mm*\n*Special order item.\nWhat is it? Sterling board is a cheap material made from strands of softwood which are glued and compressed together using an exterior grade resin.\nIdeal for: Sterling board is ideal for use where appearance is not an issue given its easily recognizable look. It is a non-structural material and is mostly used for boarding up buildings and lining shed floors and roofing.\nSizes available: Dimensions 1220mm x 2440mm\nThicknesses available: 8mm, 11mm, 15mm and 18mm.\nWhat is it? Manufactured from recycled timber chips, chipboard flooring is a moisture resistant material which comes with a tongue and groove system which allows for easy installation.\nIdeal for: Flooring purposes\nSizes available: These boards come in 600mm x 2440mm sheets.\nThese are sold in full sheets, but we can cut them to size for you.\nThicknesses available: 18mm and 22mm\nWhat is it? This material is a fiber board which is more dense than MDF since it made out of exploded wood fibers which are compressed together under high amounts of pressure. Furthermore, hardboard is made with a resin which means that it will not split or crack. This item comes with a smooth finish on one side, with a rougher mesh on the other side. Hardboard is not water resistant.\nIdeal for: Mostly used for floor covering prior to laying vinyl. It can also be used for general DIY purposes.\nSizes available: It comes in 1220mm (4ft) x 2440mm (8ft)only comes in 3mm thick boards. These can be cut to size.\nWhat is it? This product is a chipboard sheet which comes with a white melamine coating. Its composition makes it quite robust. You can also get this product in a variety of wood grain effect melamine coatings.\nIdeal for: This product is primarily used for shelving given the white coating which gives a neat finish. Many people use it for kitchen carcasses too.\nSizes available: This product comes in 2440mm (8ft) legnths and various widths including:\n152mm (6\"), 229mm (9\"), 305mm (12\"), 381mm (15\"), 457mm (18\") 533mm (21\") and 610mm (24\").\nThe majority of our sheet material comes in 2.4 m (8ft) by 1.2 m (4ft) boards, however we know that most of our customers don't need anything near that size, so we will happily cut these boards to your exact requirements.

{"question":"What is placenta previa and how does it occur?","answer":"Placenta previa is a pregnancy complication where the placenta blocks the cervix. It occurs when the placenta attaches to the uterus in a low position, rather than high up and away from the cervix as in normal pregnancies. The placenta is a structure that transfers nutrients and oxygen from the mother to the baby, and its position determines whether this complication will develop.","context":["During pregnancy, there might be some complications or difficulties that will be experienced by the mother. To be able to detect these in time, regular appointments to your doctor should be made and religiously followed. These would enable the doctor to foresee anything that might be of concern and perform the necessary actions to correct these situations. Awareness is key for doctors and this might be the primary factor in them being able to guide you through a successful high risk pregnancy.\nWhat Exactly Is Placenta Previa?\nPlacenta Previa is a complication during pregnancy that is characterized by the cervix of the woman being blocked by the placenta. The placenta on the other hand, is a structure that enables nutrients and oxygen to be transferred from the mother to the baby. This structure is extremely important in maintaining the baby’s overall health inside the mother’s womb.\nThe position and location of the attachment of the placenta to the uterus plays an important role in determining the chances of the woman having this complication or not. In normal cases of pregnancy, the attachment area of the placenta to the uterus is seen high up and away from the cervix. This position in the uterus avoids the blockage of the cervix. In Placenta Previa, the attachment of the placenta to the uterus is seen in a low position in the uterus. This then leads to the complete or partial blockage of the cervix and therefore, the acquisition of the complication.\nWhat Are The Symptoms of Placenta Previa To Look Out For?\nAlthough symptoms are not present in all women with placenta previa, warning signs may be observed. This includes bleeding of the vagina that happens suddenly. This might not be noticed right away by the mother since the vaginal bleeding happens in a painless manner. The color of the blood is characterized as bright red in color and the manner of the bleeding can be heavy or light. Symptoms of having placenta previa can also include those that are felt during early stages of labor. The mother might experience contractions that happen regularly, as well as pains or aches that are felt on the belly or lower back.\nWhen Should You Call Your Doctor?\nSince the vaginal bleeding may happen in different intensities, you can call your doctor when this happens excessively. When vaginal bleeding occurs in medium or heavy instances when the pregnant woman is on her first trimester, the doctor should definitely be called. Also, during the second or third trimester, no bleeding should happen already. So, if any vaginal bleeding occurs, be it light or medium, the attention of the doctor should be called right away. This is to make sure that no further difficulties will be experienced throughout the pregnancy.\nHow Is Placenta Previa Treated?\nTreatment of women with placenta previa is dependent on various factors. These include whether the woman is experiencing vaginal bleeding and how much she is bleeding as well. Also, the extent of how the pregnant woman’s health is affected and of course how her baby is affected is taken into consideration too. Additionally, the due date of the pregnant mother is kept in mind and whether or not the current time is close to the said due date or not.\nIf Bleeding Is Not Present\nIn cases where vaginal bleeding does not occur, confinement in the hospital is not required. However, the pregnant woman should be very cautious in doing any sort of activity. Anything that is strenuous such as running, jogging or lifting should be avoided. Also, sexual activity should not be made during the pregnancy. And if any form of vaginal bleeding happens, you should go to the emergency room immediately and call your doctor as well.\nIf Bleeding Is Present\nIf this is the case then your doctor might require you to stay in the hospital. When bleeding is present and the pregnant woman has a due date that is close to the current date, the baby will have very high chances of getting delivered right then. A cesarean delivery is always done when doctors see that placenta previa is present during the time of delivery. This is because for a high risk pregnancy, vaginal deliveries could cause the placenta to be disturbed and sever bleeding can ensue."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4a033e41-c954-49bc-9971-b4c8a0e4901f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How should pilots plan fuel stops for long cross-country helicopter flights to account for unexpected conditions?","answer":"When planning fuel stops, pilots should: 1) Make flight segments shorter than the maximum possible range, avoiding the temptation to fly the full 3 hours that a helicopter like an R44 could theoretically manage, 2) Study multiple airports with fuel availability along the route, not just planned stops, 3) Know fuel locations that could serve as alternatives if encountering unexpected conditions like 30 mph headwinds, which can significantly impact fuel consumption and range.","context":["A few things I’ve learned during many hours of cross-country flying.\nBecause I take my helicopter where the work is, I often do long cross-country flights between my permanent and various temporary bases of operation. (After a lot of careful consideration, I’ve decided that it’s safer and more cost-effective to fly the helicopter from point to point than to buy a custom trailer and tow it.) I’ve been making cross-country flights in excess of 500 miles since 2004 and, for six consecutive years, made an annual round trip between the Phoenix area (where I lived) and north central Washington state (where I now live) for cherry drying work. Nowadays, I make an annual round trip between north central Washington and the Sacramento area for frost control. I flew solo on about half of these long flights; the other half was usually spent with a low-time pilot building PIC time at the controls while I tried not to be bored (or sometimes sick from PIO—long story for another time).\nI flew home from California in late April. It was another solo flight, one that I’d been looking forward to mostly because I would be doing all the flying. And, instead of the 5-6 hour direct flight, I planned to fly west and then north up the California and Oregon coasts before turning inland again. Total flight time would be about 6-7 hours.\nAlthough the flight wasn’t as pleasant and uneventful as I’d hoped, I’m not complaining. But it did remind me of some tips I could share with other pilots preparing to do long cross-country flights.\nPlanning the Flight\nWhether you plan to file a flight plan (which I recommend doing) or not, it’s important to plan for the flight. This pretty much goes without saying. In addition to the usual things to check in advance–weather, fuel availability, TFRs, route options–consider the following:\n- Make your flight segments shorter than they have to be. Sure, Robinson Helicopter claims I can get 16 gallons per hour in my R44 so I should be able to fly 3 hours (less 20 minutes reserve) between stops. But do I really want to fly that long without a break? Probably not–especially after those first two cups of coffee. Yet I’ve seen more than a few flight plans that had us in the air as long as possible.\n- Don’t just study your route before the trip—study everything around it. How many times have I tried to fly up or down the coast, only to be forced inland by a typical “marine layer” of fog? Too many to count. I’ve learned to study my route and alternate routes that would be easy to get to if I needed to change course.\n- Know where the fuel is along the way. Do you think you could make a planned fuel stop if you hit 30 mph headwinds that weren’t in the forecast (or flight plan)? This happened to me on my April flight. I was lucky that there were several airports with fuel along my planned route so I could stop sooner than expected.\nPreparing for the Flight\nOnce you’ve planned the flight, you can prepare the aircraft for conducting the flight.\n- Gather and prepare your charts. If you use paper charts, mark them up with your intended route and fold them with the route easy to access. Then stack them in the order of use. That’s how I used to do it when I used paper. Sure beats fumbling around one-handed. Fortunately, we’re in the 21st century and have tools like Foreflight to provide accurate, up-to-date charts. Make sure you’ve loaded and updated all the charts you’ll need. Use the flight planning tools to mark your route. Then make sure you’re fully charged up and, if necessary, have backup power available. A backup device is handy, too. I use, in order: Foreflight on my iPad, Foreflight on my iPhone, and a panel mounted Garmin 430 GPS.\n- Make an airport and frequency list. I don’t do this much anymore–Foreflight makes it easy to get this info on the fly–but when I used paper charts, I also made a list of all the airports along the way that included frequencies for CTAF (or tower) and AWOS/ASOS (or ATIS). I could then program all the airport codes into my Garmin 430 as a flight plan and make frequency changes as I flew from one airport to the next.\n- Bring oil. I use W100Plus oil in my helicopter. It isn’t exactly easy to find. That’s why I usually bring along a quart for every expected fuel stop. That’s not to say that I’ll use it all, but it’s there when I need it.\n- Pack snacks. I always have a small cooler on board for long flights and do my best to fill it with ice (or frozen water bottles) and good snacks before I go. Even if you planned a meal stop along the way, circumstances might prevent you from making that stop. Maybe you had to change your route. Maybe the restaurant closed 30 minutes before you arrived. Or maybe the restaurant that was supposed to be a quarter-mile south is really more than a mile and a half from the only airport gate on the north end of the field. Bringing beverages like water or Gatorade-like drinks is also important. You don’t want to get dehydrated.\n- Pack an overnight bag. If you weren’t planning an overnight stay, pretend you were. A change of clothes, toothbrush, and credit card can make an unscheduled overnight stop a lot more pleasant. And if you think roughing it might be necessary, consider a sleeping bag or bedroll, either of which can make sleeping in an FBO–or the helicopter–a lot more comfortable.\n- Pack an emergency kit. I’ve spent so much time flying over remote areas that I forget that many pilots don’t. My helicopter has an emergency kit under the pilot seat that includes a first aid kit and equipment like fire starters, a signal mirror, a “space blanket,” energy bars, water, and so on. If weight is a factor–and it certainly is in my R44–you’ll have to limit what you bring. But some essentials can save your life if you’re forced to land in the middle of nowhere.\n- Make sure any required power supplies, cables, or batteries are handy. If you rely on electronic devices for navigation, you’d better make sure you’ve got back up power for them. My iPad’s battery can’t survive a 7-hour flight with the screen turned on and the GPS running. I use USB cables hooked up to a power supply to keep the battery charged. If you have a battery-powered GPS, make sure you have a spare set of batteries.\n- Set up your tunes. I listen to music or podcasts when I fly solo. My aircraft’s intercom system automatically cuts the music sound when a radio transmission comes through. Handy.\nDuring the Flight\nIt’s during the flight that your preparation will really pay off. If you’ve done everything right, you’ll be prepared for anything.\n- Open your flight plan. I recommend filing and opening a flight plan for each segment of the flight. Again, with a tool like Foreflight this is very easy. I can open and close a flight plan with a few taps on my iPad screen. This beats the frustration of trying to reach Flight Service on the radio in a mountainous area when only 700 feet off the ground.\n- Remember that your flight plan is not carved in stone. I can’t tell you how many flight plans prepared by pilots who were accompanying me went out the window before the second fuel stop. Stuff happens–usually related to weather–and changes are a fact of cross-country flying life. The only time I’ve ever done a long cross-country flight plan exactly as planned was on one trip from Wenatchee, WA (EAT) to Phoenix, AZ (PHX), and that’s because our straight line route across the Nevada desert didn’t have any other options for fuel stops. We had to do it as planned.\n- Know when to pull the plug and wait it out. Weather an issue? While scud running is something we’ve all probably done at one time or another, it probably isn’t something we should be doing. Tired? Tired pilots make mistakes. When low visibility, severe turbulence, or simple pilot fatigue makes flying dangerous, it’s time to set the ship down and take a break. If you did all your homework before the flight, you should know whether there’s an airport nearby to make the wait a little more comfortable. I remember unplanned overnight stays in Rosamond, CA (not recommended) and Mammoth Lakes, CA (which would have been nicer if I’d been prepared for snow).\nExperience Is Everything\nMy April flight was a mixed bag. It started with a beautiful but slightly hazy dawn just west of Sacramento, a gorgeous morning on the coast, moderate turbulence with strong headwinds, low clouds, hazy coastal weather, drizzly rain, more low clouds, even lower clouds (and scud running), and bumpy air on a cloudy day. If you’re interested in details, you can read about it in my blog. Although it isn’t common, it is possible for me to have a perfectly uneventful cross-country flight of 500 miles or more in a day.\nIf you do enough long cross-country flights, planning and conducting a flight becomes second nature. I’m always thinking about what’s up ahead and working on ways to get more information about alternative routes when things aren’t looking as good as you want them to. I’ve occasionally used my phone to call AWOS and ATIS systems at airports I think might be along a better route. I use radar in Foreflight to get a feel for how weather is moving and where it might be better or worse than I am. I’ll change altitude to avoid mechanical turbulence. If I have to do any scud running, I do it slowly and carefully, always aware of exactly where I am and where I can go if things get worse.\nIt’s all about planning and preparing and using your experience to handle unexpected situations as they come up. After a while, there’s very little than can surprise you."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c8c54d4c-a1fb-4dc1-b200-92db82cf6ffa>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How to use international agents for export?","answer":"International agents are individuals or organizations contracted to market on your behalf in a particular country. They rarely take ownership of products and usually work on commission. While agents are a low-cost option, they offer low control and may represent multiple organizations, including competitors. When using agents, it's important to set targets and ensure contracts allow you to regain direct control of products. Note that agents can be expensive to recruit, retain and train.","context":["Ways to Export\nThe WWW is a new channel for some organizations and the only channel for a large number of innovative new organizations. The eMarketing space consists of new Internet companies that have emerged as the Internet has developed, as well as those pre-existing companies that now employ eMarketing approaches as part of their overall marketing plan. For some companies the Internet is an additional channel that enhances or replaces their traditional channel(s). For others the Internet has provided the opportunity for a new online company.\nThere are direct and indirect approaches to exporting to other nations. Direct exporting is straightforward. Essentially the organization makes a commitment to market overseas on its own behalf. This gives it greater control over its brand and operations overseas, over and above indirect exporting. On the other hand, if you were to employ a home country agency (i.e. an exporting company from your country - which handles exporting on your behalf) to get your product into an overseas market then you would be exporting indirectly.\nExamples of indirect exporting include:\nCollaborative - whereby your new product uses the existing distribution and logistics of another business.\nExport Management Houses (EMHs) that act as a bolt on export department for your company. They offer a whole range of bespoke or a la carte services to exporting organizations.Consortia are groups of small or medium-sized organizations that group together to market related, or sometimes unrelated products in international markets. Trading companies were started when some nations decided that they wished to have overseas colonies. Today they exist as mainstream businesses that use traditional business relationships as part of their competitive advantage.\nLicensing - Licensing includes franchising, Turnkey contracts and contract manufacturing.\nLicensing is where your own organization charges a fee and/or royalty for the use of its technology, brand and/or expertise.\nFranchising involves the organization (franchiser) providing branding, concepts, expertise, and infact most facets that are needed to operate in an overseas market, to the franchisee. Management tends to be controlled by the franchiser. Examples include Dominos Pizza, Coffee Republic and McDonald's Restaurants.\nTurnkey contracts are major strategies to build large plants. They often include a the training and development of key employees where skills are sparse - for example, Toyota's car plant in Adapazari, Turkey. You would not own the plant once it is handed over.\nInternational Agents and International Distributors\nAgents are often an early step into international marketing. Put simply, agents are individuals or organizations that are contracted to your business, and market on your behalf in a particular country. They rarely take ownership of products, and more commonly take a commission on goods sold. Agents usually represent more than one organization. Agents are a low-cost, but low-control option. If you intend to globalize, make sure that your contract allows you to regain direct control of product. Of course you need to set targets since you never know the level of commitment of your agent. Agents might also represent your competitors - so beware conflicts of interest. They tend to be expensive to recruit, retain and train.\nDistributors are similar to agents, with the main difference that distributors take ownership of the goods. Therefore they have an incentive to market products and to make a profit from them. Otherwise pros and cons are similar to those of international agents.\nStrategic Alliances (SA)\nStrategic alliances is a term that describes a whole series of different relationships between companies that market internationally. Sometimes the relationships are between competitors. There are many examples including:\n- e.g. Toyota Ayago is also marketed as a Citroen and a Peugeot.\n- Research and Development (R&D) arrangements.\n- Distribution alliances e.g. iPhone was initially marketed by O2 in the United Kingdom.\n- Marketing agreements.\nJoint Ventures (JV)\nJoint Ventures tend to be equity-based i.e. a new company is set up with parties owning a proportion of the new business. There are many reasons why companies set up Joint Ventures to assist them to enter a new international market:\n- Access to technology, core competences or management skills.\n- To gain entry to a foreign market. For example, any business wishing to enter China needs to source local Chinese partners.\n- Access to distribution channels, manufacturing and R&D are most common forms of Joint Venture.\nOverseas Manufacture or International Sales Subsidiary\nA business may decide that none of the other options are as viable as actually owning an overseas manufacturing plant i.e. the organization invests in plant, machinery and labour in the overseas market. This is also known as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). This can be a new-build, or the company might acquire a current business that has suitable plant etc. Of course you could assemble products in the new plant, and simply export components from the home market (or another country). The key benefit is that your business becomes localized - you manufacture for customers in the market in which you are trading. You also will gain local market knowledge and be able to adapt products and services to the needs of local consumers. The downside is that you take on the risk associated with the local domestic market. An International Sales Subsidiary would be similar, reducing the element of risk, and have the same key benefit of course. However, it acts more like a distributor that is owned by your own company."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:988f93d3-c3f6-4b5c-993d-983fbdffabc8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Soy contratista y necesito organizar los recursos de mi proyecto. Could you tell me how bar charts can help with resource management in construction projects?","answer":"Bar charts can help with resource management through resource aggregation, which is done by adding resources vertically in the schedule. This process allows you to detect the amount of resources needed for a particular project. The main purpose of this aggregation is to estimate work production and establish estimates for both man-hour requirements and equipment needed. Bar charts are particularly useful for this purpose due to their simplicity and adaptability to numerous events.","context":["How are you keeping your project on schedule? Builders and contractors have many options including some simple construction scheduling techniques that will help represent and create construction schedules techniques. Which one is the best for you? We will explain briefly four alternatives that you can use depending on the project requirements and difficulties.\nConstruction Scheduling Using Bar Charts\nBar Charts are the most simple and easiest way to generate construction schedules.\nBar charts – widely used due to its simplicity and multiple adaptations to numerous events. A bar chart is formed with a list of activities, specifying the start date, duration of the activity and completion date of each activity, and then plotted on a project timescale. The detailed level of the bar chart depends on your project complexity and the intended use of the schedule.\nA variation of the bar chart schedule is the linked bar chart. A linked bar chart uses arrow and lines to tie the activities and subsequent items. It specifies the successors and predecessors of every activity. The previous activities are linked to another to demonstrate that one activity must be completed before starting a new one.\nBar charts are useful and used to detect the amount of resources needed for one particular project. Resource aggregation can be done by adding resources vertically in the schedule. The purpose of this aggregation is to estimate the work production and establishing estimates for man-hour and equipment needed.\nConstruction Scheduling: Critical Path Method\nThis process is more complex and detailed than the previous one. With a large list of activities, each activity links to previous and subsequent activities. Specifies that each activity has at least another one that must be completed prior to starting the preceding one.\nThe Critical Path Method establishes and assigns start and end dates based on certain logic like FS, FF, SS, and SF. These keys indicates the sequence of the activities. These constraints determine the first date that an activity can start. Late start, specifying the last possible date that this activity must start to avoid delays in the overall construction process. Early finish, the earlier date that the proposed activity completes; and the late finish, the last date the activity completes without affecting the start of the next one, and subsequently affecting the entire construction scheduling resources. The steps in producing a network are:\n- Listing of Activities\n- Producing a network showing the logical relationship between activities\n- Assessing the duration of each activity, producing a schedule, and determining the start and finish times of each activity and the available float\n- Lastly, assessing the required resources\nLine of Balance Scheduling Technique\nThis construction scheduling process is a planning technique for repetitive work. The essential procedure for this scheduling technique is to allocate the resources needed for each step or operation, to obtain and to avoid delays to the following activities.\nThe principles employed taken from the planning and control of manufacturing processes; a process usually applied in the construction work and more specific in road construction. Also, It is very powerful and easy to use process when the conditions are ideal for this type of work.\nConstruction Schedule: Q Scheduling\nQ Scheduling is quantitative scheduling. In the context that quantities executes at different locations of the construction project form the elements of the schedule. Also, Q Scheduling is Queue Scheduling in the context that trades pass through the different segments of the project in a queue sequence. No interference between two activities allowed at the same location. Basically derived from the Line of balance technique. With some modifications to allow for the nonrepetitive models that are characteristic of the majority of construction projects.\nThe Q Scheduling is a new technique, though getting rapid popularity among contracting firms. Only scheduling technique reveals a relation between the sequence of doing a job and the acquired cost. The Q schedule is similar to the Line of Balance with some modifications. To allow for a varying volume of repetitive activities at different segments or locations of the construction project.

{"question":"What are the serving recommendations for chicken versus salmon when feeding them to dogs?","answer":"For chicken, dogs should be fed about ¼ to ⅓ cup of meat protein per 20lbs of body weight per day. If mixing with rice due to diarrhea, use a 2:1 ratio (⅔ cup rice to ⅓ cup chicken). For salmon, dogs can safely have up to 10 grams per 500 grams of body weight in a single serving, but it should be limited to once weekly as a treat to prevent stomach upset and unwanted weight gain. Both meats should be well-cooked, boneless, and served plain without seasonings. For chicken, it should also be skinless, while for salmon, the skin can be served but should be cut into manageable pieces and given in moderation due to its high fat content.","context":["Chicken is a popular food for humans. It is low in cost and high in nutrients. That’s why many German Shepherd owners want to know if they can also feed it to their German Shepherds.\nThe short answer is “yes”, you can feed chicken to your German Shepherds, but there are lots of things you need to consider before doing so. In this article, we’ll answer every question you have about feeding chicken to your German Shepherds!\nFirst, let’s start with the most basic question:\nIs chicken safe for German Shepherds?\nYes, any unseasoned roasted, poached, grilled, or baked chicken is safe for German Shepherds to eat. In fact, cooked chicken is a better option than raw because of the risk of contamination in raw meat.\nHowever, when you cook chicken, ensure that it is boneless and skinless. It is best not to feed your German Shepherd too much chicken at once as some German Shepherds can be intolerant or allergic to it. If you are feeding it to your German Shepherd for the first time, watch out for any abnormal signs. If you observe any abnormal symptoms like vomiting and loose stools, contact your vet instantly.\nBenefits of chicken in German Shepherds\nProtein: Chicken is a great source of lean protein for German Shepherds. It keeps your German Shepherd’s muscles and tissues healthy and strong.\nOmega-6 Fatty Acids: Chicken is a great source of this type of fatty acid, which helps keep your German Shepherd’s skin and coat shiny and healthy.\nVitamins: Chicken contains Vitamin A, B, D, E, and K. These vitamins are essential to your German Shepherd’s immune system and vision health.\nMinerals: Chicken contains selenium and phosphorus, which support your German Shepherd’s skeletal system and can help fight off certain diseases.\nGlucosamine: This compound is known to improve joint health in German Shepherds.\nDo all German Shepherds like chicken?\nUnfortunately, not all German Shepherds like chicken.\nYour German Shepherds may not like chicken for several reasons. Every German Shepherd has their own food preferences just like people do. In addition, some German Shepherds can be allergic to chicken. If you suspect your German Shepherd is allergic to chicken, don’t force them to eat it. Instead, try other German Shepherd-friendly protein sources like beef or turkey. If you want to introduce a new food to your German Shepherd’s diet, consult with your vet first.\nCan my German Shepherds have chicken every day?\nThere’s no rule about how often you can feed your German Shepherd chicken, but there are a few things to consider.\nIf your German Shepherd has an allergy to chicken, you should not feed them chicken every day. If you’re unsure whether your German Shepherd is allergic to chicken, talk to your vet about doing a food trial to see if chicken is causing them any issues.\nGerman Shepherds that aren’t allergic to chicken can be fed an appropriate amount of chicken every day as long as it’s part of a balanced diet. Talk to your vet about what the correct amount is for your specific pup and make sure that whatever diet you choose has all the nutrients they need in order to thrive.\nCan German Shepherd puppies eat chicken?\nYes, German Shepherd puppies can eat chicken! But it’s important to wait until your puppy turns two months old before you introduce any new foods.\nPuppies have a delicate digestive system, so it’s important to be careful about what you introduce. During their first two months of life, puppies should stay on the specialized diet they were fed while they were still in their mother’s care.\nPuppies can start eating small amounts of cooked chicken (like the kind you’d cook for yourself) after they’ve passed their two-month mark. Don’t feed them raw or undercooked chicken, as this is more likely to cause health problems. If you’re worried about whether your puppy is ready for chicken, consult with your vet before adding anything new to their diet.\nHow much chicken can German Shepherds eat?\nHow much chicken can German Shepherds eat? The answer depends on the age, size and activity level of your German Shepherd. The best way to find out is to consult with your vet about how much chicken to feed your German Shepherd.\nIf you’re feeding your German Shepherd raw meat, plan to feed him about ¼ to ⅓ cup of meat protein per 20lbs of body weight per day. If your German Shepherd suffers from diarrhea, follow a 2:1 ratio with rice. For example, if you’re feeding him one cup of food per day, ⅓ cup would be chicken and ⅔ cup would be rice. It’s always a good idea to start small and see how your German Shepherd reacts before increasing the portion.\nHow to serve chicken to your German Shepherds?\nChicken is a great source of protein for German Shepherds, and you can serve it in a few different ways.\nTo start, you can serve chicken along with your German Shepherd’s usual food by mixing it in. Some German Shepherds are picky eaters, but if you’re worried that your German Shepherd will leave the chicken behind, you can try to mix it with some broth or wet food your German Shepherd likes.\nYou can also serve chicken as a treat on its own. If you’re worried about your German Shepherd becoming overweight, you can try dehydrating the chicken so that it becomes a chewier treat (and contains less fat). You can do this in an oven set to the lowest temperature, or even outside in the sun.\nYou could also try making little meatballs out of cooked rice and broccoli and mixing them with chicken. This way, your German Shepherd gets some healthy grains and vegetables along with the protein from the chicken.\nWhen is chicken bad for German Shepherds?\nSure! German Shepherds can eat chicken!\nHowever, German Shepherds with underlying health problems like allergies may have a negative reaction to eating chicken.\nGerman Shepherds can also overindulge on the protein if they are not properly supervised or don’t have a regular exercise schedule.\nChicken bones can also be harmful to German Shepherds, as they splinter and can cause internal damage. Chicken skin also needs to be avoided as it’s high in fat and can lead to obesity!\nRaw chicken is also a bad idea for German Shepherds, as it could contain bacteria that will make your pup sick.\nOther human foods German Shepherds can eat\nWhat other human foods can German Shepherds eat? Here is a list of some other human foods your German Shepherd can eat.\nSo, can German Shepherds eat chicken?\nThe answer is yes! Chicken is the most popular meat for pet food because of its high protein content and abundance in minerals.\nFor feeding your German Shepherd chicken, you’ll want to make sure you’re feeding them the best parts of the bird. The breast meat is the leanest and best option for your German Shepherd, as it has less fat than other cuts.\nYou’ll also want to make sure that you cooked the chicken thoroughly and doesn’t have any harmful additives like salt or sugar. It’s also important to take cooked chicken off the bone before giving it to your German Shepherd—chicken bones can be dangerous, as they can splinter and cause internal harm.\nSome German Shepherds may be allergic to chicken. If your German Shepherd has an allergic reaction after eating chicken, it’s important that you stop feeding them this kind of food immediately and consult your veterinarian as soon as possible.","Salmon is one of natures’ superfoods, and it’s also one of the most popular fish in the world for people to eat. It’s tasty, versatile, and has excellent health benefits. If you’re a dog owner, you might have found yourself wondering – can dogs have salmon? Is it good for them? And is it safe for them to eat? In this article we’ll be taking a look at what types of salmon are good for dogs, the types of salmon to avoid, and how to cook salmon in ways that are both safe and healthy for your beloved canine friends.\nCan dogs eat salmon?\nIn short – yes, dogs can eat salmon. But they can’t (and shouldn’t) eat all the kinds of salmon that humans do.\nDogs should only be given salmon that has been cooked correctly. Cooked salmon is equally as healthy and nutritious for your dog as it is for you – and dogs can benefit from the extra nutrients in their regular diet.\nMost dogs love the taste of fish – so salmon treats can make a great healthy snack to train or reward your dog.\nIs salmon good for dogs?\nSalmon is known to be low in fat and high in protein, and it also contains many vitamins and minerals that are essential for keeping good health.\nWhen you feed your dog properly cooked salmon, it can pass along a variety of healthy benefits that can keep their skin, coat, and heart health in top condition.\nSalmon is frequently added as an ingredient to both dry and wet dog commercial foods and treats. Look for wild-caught salmon on the ingredient labels, as this is generally a better source of Omega 3s and it’s free of chemicals and pollutants that can be found in commercial, farmed salmon.\nLike any other foods, you shouldn’t overfeed your dog on salmon, as this can cause weight gain and other problems.\nHealth benefits of salmon for dogs\nAs a rich source of Omega 3 fatty acids and various amino acids, salmon can improve your dog’s immunity and heart health, and keep them active and alert. It can also help to relieve some skin irritations and contribute to a healthy coat.\nIf you have an old or arthritic dog, salmon can help reduce joint inflammation and stiffness, allowing your dog to move with comfort.\nPuppies and younger dogs can also benefit from salmon in their diet, as it helps brain development and concentration.\nSome of the numerous benefits of feeding your dog properly cooked salmon are:\n- High in proteins\n- High in Omega 3\n- Low in fat\n- Contains many vitamins including A, B, D\n- Contains minerals including zinc, potassium, and magnesium\n- Reduced inflammation in joints\n- Supports the immune system\n- Eases symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease\n- Can improve concentration and cognitive functions\n- Increases energy levels\n- Promotes weight loss and healthy skin\n- Improves heart health\n- Boosts energy\n- Promotes healthy weight loss\n- Promotes healthy skin and coats\n- Improved cardiovascular health\n- Can often be tolerated by dogs that are allergic to chicken or beef\nIs it safe to feed my dog salmon?\nWe’ve already mentioned that salmon is full of wonderful health benefits for your dog. But while it’s okay for them to eat it when it’s prepared properly – there are still a few safety facts that you need to consider before feeding your dog salmon.\nSalmon is considered to be a fish that’s low in mercury levels, and contains less traces of heavy metals and pollutants than other fish. This means your dog can eat more helpings of salmon, but if you overfeed them on salmon – mercury build-up in their body can eventually become a problem.\nIn addition to the toxins that might be lurking in that tasty piece of raw salmon, there may be lots of small fish bones which are brittle in their raw state, and could either choke your dog, or get stuck in their intestines or stomach – meaning an expensive vet visit!\nMost importantly, you should never feed raw salmon to your dog!\nRaw salmon may contain highly toxic bacteria and parasites that can be potentially deadly to dogs. So it’s better to avoid taking this risk and cooking all salmon that you intend to feed your pup.\nCan dogs eat raw salmon?\nHumans, bears, cats, and other animals can mostly eat raw salmon safely – and have been doing this for hundreds of years. But canid species (such as dogs, foxes, and wolves) are at risk of getting seriously ill from eating raw salmon.\nWhen humans ingest “bad” raw salmon, we might experience gastrointestinal illness – but we won’t develop salmon poisoning in the way dogs can.\nIf you feed your dog raw or undercooked salmon, even if it’s fresh sushi or sashimi that you’ve bought from your favorite store, it can be potentially deadly. No matter how much your pup begs or gives you those big, sad eyes, resist the temptation to throw them a morsel of this raw fish.\nThis is because of the potential parasites that can be found in the flesh of salmon.\nWhat causes salmon poisoning in dogs?\nRaw salmon can contain a parasite called Nanophyetus salmincola. This flatworm is mostly harmless – unless it’s infected with a bacteria known as Neorickettsia helminthoeca. It’s this bacteria that causes salmon poisoning disease.\nIt’s also possible for dogs to contract salmon poisoning through contact with the feces of another dog infected with salmon poisoning.\nSalmon poisoning is most prevalent in Oregon, North California, Washington, and Vancouver Island in Canada.\nIf your dog ingests undercooked or raw salmon, steelhead, trout, or Pacific Giant Salamanders that are infected with flatworms, the worms can lodge themselves in your dog’s intestines, which allows the bacteria they carry to enter your dog’s bloodstream.\nThe bacteria then spreads to your pup’s internal organs – and it’s about that time your dog will begin to show symptoms of salmon poisoning.\nSymptoms of salmon poisoning in dogs\nThe signs of salmon poisoning can take between 6 and 10 days to manifest. If your dog has been infected and remains untreated, they can die in as little as 14 days after eating raw and contaminated salmon.\nNone of us want to lose our best furry friends, so it’s super important that you prevent potential salmon poisoning by being vigilant around your dog when raw salmon is present.\nIf your dog somehow manages to find and eat raw salmon, and displays the symptoms of salmon poisoning – it’s essential to take them to a vet as soon as possible.\nKnow the signs of salmon poisoning:\n- Loss of appetite\n- Increased breathing and heart rate\n- Weight loss\n- Swollen lymph nodes\n- Discharge from eyes or nose\nWhat should I do if my dog eats raw salmon?\nIf your dog eats raw salmon, you should contact your vet and get professional advice. If your pup shows symptoms like the ones mentioned above, and you think they may have eaten raw salmon recently, you should take them straight to the vet.\nGetting treatment as soon as possible for your dog can significantly improve their chances of surviving salmon poisoning.\nSalmon poisoning diagnosis in dogs\nIf your dog is showing signs of salmon poisoning, take them to your vet and tell them you suspect your dog has eaten some raw salmon. The vet will take samples from your dog, which may be fecal samples or needle samples from a lymph node that can show the presence of salmon poisoning bacteria.\nIf the vet discovers the parasitic eggs in your dog’s stools, this will support a diagnosis of salmon poisoning – as the parasites are likely to be carrying the toxic bacteria that is making your dog sick.\nThis bacteria can also be seen under a microscope in the cells taken from your dog’s lymph nodes. If the vet suspects this is salmon poisoning bacteria, they may also undertake a PCR test of the bacteria to detect its DNA.\nYour vet will often carry out blood tests to check the hydration levels, organ function, and blood cell health of your dog.\nSalmon poisoning treatment for dogs\nAs long as your dog gets diagnosed in time, the treatment for salmon poisoning is fairly simple. Your vet will prescribe antibiotics to kill the bacteria – and a dewormer to kill the parasites. These are the most common and effective methods, and your dog will show signs of improvement within a day or two of starting the treatment.\nIf your dog is seriously ill, or their tests come back showing other negative health signs, they may require hospitalization. This can include intravenous drips to rehydrate your pet, anti-diarrhea treatment, blood transfusions, and anti-nausea treatment.\nThe good news is that most dogs recover completely from salmon poisoning if they’re diagnosed early and taken to the vet for the appropriate treatment.\nAs prevention of salmon poisoning is much easier (and less expensive!) than curing it – make sure your dogs don’t have any access to raw fish, fish parts, or salamanders (particularly if you’re in the Pacific Northwest). If you live rurally, or go fishing or camping for vacation – make sure you keep your dog away from fishing docks, trash cans, and other places where there may be discarded raw fish.\nCan dogs eat canned salmon?\nTinned salmon is completely safe for your dog, but it should only be given in small amounts.\nThis is because the salt content of salmon in cans is generally quite high, especially if they are preserved in brine. Salmon preserved in oil is obviously very oily – and too much oil or salt can be harmful for your pets.\nIf you can find canned salmon that’s preserved in water, with no added salt or other additives– this is the healthiest option for your dog as an occasional snack.\nCan dogs eat salmon skin?\nYour dog can safely eat salmon skin as long as it’s cooked and served plain with no added salts or flavoring.\nYou should cut the skin into manageable pieces for your dog’s size. Giving them an entire side of salmon skin is difficult for them to eat, and can be a choking hazard.\nSalmon skin contains all the nutrition of salmon flesh, so it’s healthy for your pup – but make sure you don’t overdo it! The skin has high fat content, so can cause unhealthy weight gain in your dog if they eat it on a regular basis. Feed salmon skin to your dog in moderation as a tasty treat, and avoid feeding the skin to your dog if it’s already overweight.\nCan dogs eat smoked salmon?\nYour dog shouldn’t be given smoked salmon to eat. This is for the same reasons as not giving your dog raw salmon.\nAs smoked salmon is cured and not cooked, it may still contain the live parasites and bacteria that can cause salmon poisoning in your dog. While the chances of infection are less in smoked salmon, it’s still better to avoid the risk to your pet.\nSmoked salmon can also contain excessive amounts of salt, sugar, and other additives and flavorings which aren’t healthy for your dog. Dogs only need a small amount of salt in their diet, and if they get too much they can be at risk of dehydration or potential sodium poisoning.\nCan dogs eat salmon eggs?\nIf you’re feeling generous and have some spare salmon eggs or caviar lying around – these are safe for your dog to eat.\nLike canned and smoked salmon, processed caviar can be very high in salt content, so only give it to your dog as a small, very occasional treat.\nDogs can eat salmon eggs, if they have been processed into caviar. However, it should be noted that caviar has a higher amount of salt and other seasonings. So make sure only to give it to your dog in extreme moderation.\nWhat are the safest types of salmon for my dog?\nYour dog can safely and healthily enjoy salmon as meals or treats when prepared properly. This includes:\n- Freeze-dried salmon\n- Dehydrated salmon\n- Cooked salmon\nThis is a safe, fast process where the salmon is frozen and the moisture is extracted. It’s a good, healthy option when the process is done correctly, and it’s a popular technique for preparing pet food that ensures the rich flavor and nutrients of the salmon are kept intact.\nThis process extracts all the moisture out of the salmon, and ensures a long shelf life. It also kills any bacteria that may be present, while still retaining flavor and nutrition for your dog.\nCooking fresh salmon is the healthiest way to prepare this fish for your dog.\nYou can bake, grill, poach, fry, or broil salmon – pretty much any way you like to prepare it is fine, as long as it’s well cooked before you give it to your dog.\nIt’s important that you cook the salmon plain, with no other garnishes or ingredients that might harm your dog (such as garlic, tomatoes, salt etc).\nHow do I cook salmon for my dog?\nMake sure you choose fresh, boneless salmon fillets if you’re preparing a salmon treat for your dog.\nBe sure to check the fillets carefully before cooking just in case there are still one or two tiny bones lurking in there that could harm your dog. Salmon bones can easily get stuck in your dog’s throat or intestines and cause discomfort…or a large vet bill!\nYou can cook the salmon any way you like (bake, grill, fry, poach) – as long as you don’t add salt or other seasonings, or vegetables like onion, garlic, or tomato that can make your dog ill.\nYour dog doesn’t need garnish – they’ll love the salmon plain, and it’s much healthier for them that way.\nNext time you’re preparing salmon for you and your family, include a small serving for your dog – and he’ll love you for it!\nHow much salmon should I feed my dog?\nLimit your dog’s salmon intake to once a week as a treat. This is the key to keeping your dog healthy. If they binge on too much fatty, rich salmon, it may cause an upset stomach or result in unwanted weight gain.\nYour dog can safely have up to 10 grams of salmon per 500 gram of body weight at a single serve.\nCan dogs with food allergies eat salmon?\nIf you have a dog with food allergies, they can be sensitive to traditional dog foods with chicken or beef ingredients. Foods containing salmon can be a good alternative for some sensitive dogs to ensure they’re getting enough protein.\nCommercial dog foods containing salmon\nSalmon is growing in popularity as a commercial dog food ingredient due to its nutritional qualities, and the fact that it doesn’t trigger allergies like other meats such as chicken and beef.\nWhen you’re choosing any salmon dog food off the shelf, make sure it’s made with real salmon, and includes other high quality ingredients that ensure your dog is getting a balanced diet and all the essential vitamins and minerals they need to thrive.\nDog food labels should mention they are “complete and balanced” and are approved by the Association of American Feed Control Officials, or a similar recognized pet food quality authority.\nSalmon dog food can be beneficial for dogs with dull coats and persistently flaky or itchy skin. And if your dog is a fussy eater, they usually love the taste of salmon in their food!\nBefore you make any decisions about your dog’s diet, consult with your vet to ensure that this is the right option for your best furry friend.\nRecommended salmon dog foods\nRecommended salmon dog treats\nIn summary: Can dogs eat salmon?\nDogs can eat fresh salmon and salmon skin as long as it’s served plain and cooked well. Freeze-dried and dehydrated salmon are also safe for your dogs if prepared properly.\nNever ever feed your dog smoked or raw salmon – even if it’s a tiny morsel, it can still put your dog at risk of salmon poisoning, which can be fatal for your pup.\nCanned salmon and salmon eggs are safe for your dog as an occasional treat, as they can be high in salt and other additives.\nYour dog should only be given salmon in moderation, once a week, to avoid stomach upsets and unhealthy weight gain.\nMany commercial salmon-based dog food formulas are safe to feed daily, as the high-quality brands include all the nutrients of the salmon, together with additional healthy ingredients that form a complete, balanced diet for your dog."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:abedeb9e-ab04-418c-9635-c794ef6f7180>","<urn:uuid:261cc046-a58f-4eb6-9b14-2cab80c47032>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do probiotics and antibiotics affect gut bacteria differently? I'm curious about their contrasting impacts on our digestive health.","answer":"Probiotics and antibiotics have opposite effects on gut bacteria. Probiotics are 'good' bacteria that help balance gut flora, boost immunity and improve GI health. They can be found in fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, aged cheeses, kimchi, and sauerkraut. In contrast, antibiotics kill bacteria that cause infections but can also have a negative impact on the gut microbiome by killing off beneficial bacteria. While antibiotics may sometimes be medically necessary, their use should be minimized when possible to avoid disrupting the gut microbiome.","context":["Prebiotics and Probiotics: Creating a Healthier You\nTable of Contents\n- What Are Prebiotics and What Do They Do?\n- Prebiotics in Your Diet\n- What Are Probiotics and What Do They Do?\n- Probiotics in Your Diet\n- What Makes Prebiotics and Probiotics the “Dynamic Duo?”\nYou’ve probably heard of prebiotics and probiotics, but do you know what they are? Nutrition research has pinpointed specific functional components of foods that may improve health, and prebiotics and probiotics are two such substances.\nAlthough they are available as dietary supplements, it is not necessary to use special pills, potions, cleanses or other concoctions to incorporate prebiotics and probiotics into your daily intake. These “nutrition boosters” are natural ingredients in many everyday foods.\nWhile research continues in this area of nutrition — investigating how effective and safe these substances are and how much we need to obtain health benefits — here’s what we know now.\nWhat Are Prebiotics and What Do They Do?\nPrebiotics are naturally occurring, non-digestible food components that are linked to promoting the growth of helpful bacteria in your gut. Simply said, they’re “good” bacteria promoters. That’s right, not all bacteria are bad! Prebiotics may improve gastrointestinal health as well as potentially enhance calcium absorption.\nPrebiotics in Your Diet\nPrebiotics include fructooligosaccharides, such as inulin and galactooligosaccharides. But rather than focusing on these lengthy words, include more prebiotics in your day by eating more fruits, vegetables and whole grains such as bananas, onions, garlic, leeks, asparagus, artichokes, beans and whole-grain foods.\nWhat Are Probiotics and What Do They Do?\nProbiotics are the “good” bacteria — or live cultures — like those naturally found in your gut. These active cultures help change or repopulate intestinal bacteria to balance gut flora. This functional component may boost immunity and overall health, especially GI health. For instance, probiotics have been used for management of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms.\nProbiotics in Your Diet\nTo include more probiotics in your eating plan, look to fermented dairy foods including yogurt, kefir products and aged cheeses, which contain live cultures such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Also consider fermented, non-dairy foods with beneficial live cultures, including kimchi, sauerkraut, miso, tempeh and cultured non-dairy yogurts.\nWhat Makes Prebiotics and Probiotics the “Dynamic Duo?”\nUltimately, prebiotics, or “good” bacteria promoters, and probiotics, the “good” bacteria, work together synergistically. In other words, prebiotics are breakfast, lunch and dinner for probiotics, which restores and can improve GI health. Products that combine these together are called synbiotics. On the menu, that means enjoying bananas atop yogurt or stir-frying asparagus with tempeh is a win-win.\nIncorporating health-promoting functional foods, such as those containing prebiotics and probiotics, aids in creating a healthier you.\nFor specific advice on obtaining prebiotics and probiotics for your own specific health needs, especially if you have GI issues or a weakened immune system, contact a registered dietitian nutritionist\nWhat is Down Syndrome?

This is about 10 times more than the total number of cells that form your body. These bacteria – which are also called gut flora – perform a wide range of critical bodily functions. They are so important to our health that an imbalance has many negative consequences. Luckily you can take steps to optimize your digestive system’s microbiome. We’ll show you how in this article.\nHow Do You Know If Your Gut Is Not Happy?\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty’s of a gut reset, you need to know the signs of an imbalance.\nAlso called dysbiosis, the imbalance of gut bacteria can cause a wide range of digestive problems. This includes:\nDysbiosis may lead to an array of digestive issues, including (6):\n- Stomach pain\n- Bloating, gas, and cramps after eating\n- Diarrhea or constipation (or both!)\nThese symptoms are common enough that they’re often mistaken for typical IBS symptoms. If you suffer from these chronically, there’s most likely an underlying cause.\nA healthy balance of gut bacteria is necessary for digestion. This means that if you’re experiencing digestive issues, consider working to reset your gut bacteria for better digestive health.\nHealthy gut microbiome may also play an important role in fertility.\nOne review highlighted the relationship between IBS and infertility, concluding that oxidative stress is a plausible mediator of that connection, although data is lacking to confirm that hypothesis (4).\nOne clinical trial found that administering probiotic supplements to men with idiopathic infertility improved sperm quality. The authors suggested that reducing oxidative stress in the seminal fluid was a possible reason for the improvement (23).\nSome scientists believe these microorganisms also regulate key hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and insulin (19). This may help explain why the microbiome has an impact on fertility. While these studies are interesting, they were small and more research needs to be done.\nMany autoimmune diseases involve an interplay between gut and immune system. It makes sense that the microbiome is closely linked to them as well.\nStudies show that those with Crohn’s disease tend to have low microbial diversity, an altered microbiome composition, and an unstable microbial community (1). That said, research is still new, and it’s unclear if this imbalance is a cause of these diseases or a symptom of it.\nHowever, some studies suggest autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and type 1 diabetes can be triggered or worsened by a poor microbiome (26).\nAllergies & Asthma\nOn the other hand, good bacteria help protect us from allergies and asthma.\nHealthy gut microbiome can reduce inflammation related to allergies & asthma which may explain the rise of these diseases in recent decades. One study found that people with allergies have fewer Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) bacteria (16).\nGiving this good bacteria to mice prevented them from developing allergies. It also reduced their immune system response, which is what causes allergic reactions in the first place (5).\nLGG has also been found in animal models to reduce inflammation and improve mucus production (16).\nFor example, Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus have been linked to reduced risk of colorectal cancer. This may be because they produce acetate, hydrogen peroxide, or other molecules that kill off tumor cells (21). However, the mechanisms and links are not well enough understood at this time to recommend a specific probiotic strain to help prevent or treat a specific disease. In fact, requirements and effects may be very individualized. What we can say is that a healthy gut microbiome contributes to a healthy gut.\nAs for other cancers, research is still limited.\nLow Energy And Chronic Fatigue\nDigestive problems can cause low energy and chronic fatigue. That’s because the gut microbiome is so involved in our metabolic function. It helps break down food nutrients, absorb them into the body, and release waste. When it’s unbalanced or unhealthy, you may not be able to absorb nutrients as well. This can leave you feeling fatigued and tired, even when you’re getting enough rest (11).\nAutoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto’s disease may also cause chronic fatigue or low energy. In fact, research shows that people with chronic fatigue sometimes have increased bacterial translocation (when bacteria passes from the intestines to the bloodstream) (24). This is a sign of leaky gut syndrome, which we’ll talk about below.\nAnxiety And Depression\nAbout 90% of serotonin – our “feel good hormone” – is created in the gut. That’s why imbalances in our microbiome can cause anxiety and depression.\nIt’s not exactly clear how this works. However, research suggests an unbalanced microbiome may interfere with serotonin production or the way the body uses it (14).\nThis is because serotonin needs “help” from other chemicals in order to function normally. When you have less gut bacteria, you may not produce enough of them or your body may not produce them in the right amount or at the right time. Either way, your brain chemistry will be thrown off, which can make you more anxious or depressed (14).\nBetterMe app is a foolproof way to go from zero to a weight loss hero in a safe and sustainable way! What are you waiting for? Start transforming your body now!\nHow Do You Reset Good Gut Bacteria?\nRestoring the gut microbiome takes time. But you can start with these 10 tips:\nEat More Fiber For Gut Reset\nFiber is an essential part of a balanced diet and is one of the best foods you can eat for a healthy gut. Adding fiber to your daily eating plan will help reset your gut microbiome by feeding beneficial bacteria and supporting optimal digestion.\nThere are two types of dietary fiber: Soluble and insoluble. Both play an important role in supporting overall health and wellness, but they do so in different ways.\nSoluble fiber is the type of dietary fiber that dissolves in water, forming a gel-like substance. The bacteria in your gut turn soluble fiber into short-chain fatty acids, namely acetate, propionate and butyrate. These are the preferred foods of the good bacteria that hang out in your colon (25).\nSoluble fiber is found in foods that are generally high in water content, such as fruits and vegetables. It can also be found in whole grains, oats, legumes, seeds and nuts.\nInsoluble fiber is not water-soluble. It passes through your intestines relatively intact, promoting regular bowel movements and supporting healthy gut bacteria (n). Foods that are high in insoluble fiber have a high-fiber content overall, including whole grains, vegetables and fruit.\nYou may be tempted to go “high” on the fiber scale right away by dramatically increasing your intake of foods such as leafy greens or cruciferous veggies (think cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower). You certainly can, but you should take it slow.\nFoods that are high in fiber have the potential to cause bloating and gas for those who aren’t used to eating them (27). If you experience these symptoms, consider adding a small amount of fiber daily until your digestive system adapts.\nIf you want to reset your gut microbiome with more fiber, try adding just one new fiber-rich food per week to your current diet.\nRestore Good Bacteria With Prebiotics And Probiotics\nPrebiotics are types of soluble fiber that act as “fertilizer” for the good bacteria in the gut. They help these beneficial bugs grow and multiply, ultimately helping you avoid digestive problems and promoting a healthy gut (25).\nProbiotics, on the other hand, are living strains of good bacteria that are found in certain foods or supplements.\nPrebiotics are found in foods rich in soluble fiber, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and some dairy products. You can also find prebiotic supplements at the local health food store or online.\nIf you want to reset your microbiome with more prebiotics, increase the number of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains you eat daily. You can also supplement your diet with prebiotic supplements.\nResearch shows that there’s a symbiotic relationship between prebiotics and probiotics (20). The two actually work together to help reset the gut microbiome, creating an environment where good bacteria thrive and flourish over bad bacteria. Combining these elements creates the best opportunity for your body to heal.\nEating prebiotics and probiotics together can be as simple as enjoying a cup of yogurt that contains live active cultures, along with fruit for added soluble fiber. While you’re at it, try adding in some berries rich in antioxidants to protect the good bacteria from the inside out.\nEat Fermented Foods\nFermented foods are high in live active cultures that “feed” bacteria in your gut, particularly the types of beneficial bacteria that create short-chain fatty acids. This is important because these acids are the optimum fuel for the cells lining your colon.\nThe process of fermentation breaks down foods naturally high in prebiotics, creating a food source for beneficial bacteria. These include fermented vegetables, miso, tempeh and kimchi. It also includes raw, unpasteurized sauerkraut that contains natural probiotics.\nIn addition to their prebiotic and probiotic content, fermented foods also contain additional nutrients that promote digestive balance and a healthy gut microbiome. These include calcium, magnesium and B vitamins.\nAnother way to reset your gut microbiome may be through fermented dairy products like kefir (a drinkable yogurt), yogurt and cheese.\nResearch shows that these foods contain additional probiotics – considered even more beneficial to gut health – and prebiotics, which help the good bacteria grow while crowding out the bad bacteria. Given their ability to boost lactobacilli populations, kefir and yogurt are linked to better digestive health while supporting a healthy gut microbiome (10).\nTry A Mediterranean Diet\nThe Mediterranean diet is high in fiber, vegetables, fruits and healthy fats. It’s also rich in protein from seafood, poultry and lean meats. What’s more, it contains fermented dairy products like yogurt alongside prebiotic foods such as garlic, onions, almonds and beans.\nPrevious research suggests that the gut microbiome of those who follow a Mediterranean diet is significantly different from those who don’t follow a Mediterranean style of eating. The differences include higher levels of healthy bacteria and less inflammation (17).\nThe easiest way to reset your gut microbiome through a Mediterranean-style diet is by eliminating processed foods. Replace packaged and prepackaged foods with whole, fresh foods that are high in fiber. It’s also important to eat a range of vegetables each day, at least two to three cups worth. Finally, choose whole grains instead of refined products whenever possible.\nEat More Anti Inflammatory Foods\nAcute inflammation in response to an illness or injury is a necessary and helpful part of the immune response. Chronic low-grade inflammation is a different story. Since chronic inflammation has been linked to digestive problems and other health conditions, it’s important to minimize it within the body as much as possible (13).\nTo reset your gut microbiome and potentially decrease those inflammatory markers, try:\n- Adding more fresh produce, especially those rich in anti-inflammatory nutrients like vitamins C and E and beta carotene\n- Replacing refined grain products with whole grains\n- Eating more foods rich in omega 3 fatty acids, such as salmon and other seafood\nIn addition to the health implications from eating a high-fat diet, stress can also have an adverse effect on gut bacteria (22). The reduction of beneficial bacteria levels in turn can create an imbalance in the gut microbiome.\nYou may want to try adding in activities that reduce stress like yoga, spending time outside or engaging in a relaxing activity like listening to music or taking a hot bath. It’s also important to consider making time for yourself each day and getting enough sleep. These are all effective ways of resetting your gut microbiome.\nIntense sweat sessions, working weight loss tips, lip-smacking recipes come in one package with the BetterMe app. And all of it is at your fingertips, start transforming your life now!\nMinimize Using Antibiotics If You Can\nAntibiotics are taken to kill bacteria that are causing infection and illness, but they can also have a negative impact on the gut microbiome by killing off beneficial bacteria (2).\nSometimes they are necessary, and you should always follow your doctor’s advice. But avoiding taking antibiotics unnecessarily is important.\nIf you can’t avoid taking antibiotics, talk to your doctor about taking them along with probiotic supplements. After your antibiotic course is finished, make sure to eat plenty of prebiotic foods that can help restore your good bacteria.\nAvoid Artificial Sweeteners\nIn a bid to lose weight and improve their health, many people are turning from sugar to artificial sweeteners. Unfortunately, research suggests that artificial sweeteners can also have a negative effect on the gut microbiome (8).\nTo reset your gut microbiome and improve your overall health, stay away from artificial sweeteners. You’d be better served by limiting sugar instead.\nIt’s also a good idea to limit your intake of high fructose corn syrup, which is often found in beverages and other products.\nDitch The Western Diet\nThe Western diet is high in animal protein, sugar, and fat, and low in fiber. This type of diet has been linked to an increased risk for developing health conditions like obesity, certain cancers and Alzheimer’s disease (15).\nReducing your intake of meat products, especially processed ones, is one way to reduce inflammation in the body and help reset the gut microbiome. Instead of eating ground beef or sausage or high-fat pork products, consider cooking with leaner poultry like chicken or turkey.\nAdditionally, replace your refined grain products with whole grains and add more vegetables to your diet. You might also want to experiment with different cooking methods like boiling or steaming instead of frying for a healthier meal plan overall.\nA study found that after quitting smoking, participants had more microbial diversity in their gut than when they were smoking (7).\nSmoking is harmful to the body in a number of ways, and it may be affecting your gut microbiome as well. Even if you can’t quit smoking altogether, consider cutting back to limit the potential damage smoking has on your gut microbiome.\nHit The Gym\nStudies suggest that exercise is good for your gut microbiome and overall health (9).\nWhen you work out, you tend to lower stress hormones, which are known to negatively impact the gut microbiome. If you haven’t been exercising regularly, then start slowly and build up. You’ll be able to reap the benefits of exercise on your gut microbiome before you know it.\nPractice Sleep Hygiene\nThe quality and quantity of your sleep is also linked to your gut microbiome. Unfortunately, too many people are sacrificing their sleep in order to get more things done.\nWith today’s busy lifestyle it can be hard to hit the hay at a decent hour, however this is having a negative impact on your gut microbiome. Studies suggest that getting enough sleep improves digestive health by resetting your gut microbiome (12).\nSome sleep hygiene practices that may help include:\n- Setting and sticking to a sleep schedule\n- Winding down before bed with relaxing activities like reading or taking a bath\n- Keeping sleep disruptions to a minimum by staying off electronics before bedtime and investing in blackout curtains\n- Creating a conducive sleep environment including temperature and comfortable beddings\n- Limiting alcohol and caffeine\nThe Bottom Line\nYour gut microbiome is responsible for regulating many processes in your body. Fortunately, there are plenty of steps you can take today to reset your gut microbiome and live a healthier life.

{"question":"As a person with ADHD interested in both neurological and physiological impacts, could you explain how iron affects brain function and what symptoms indicate iron deficiency in the brain?","answer":"Iron plays a crucial role in brain function and deficiency can significantly impact cognitive performance. For brain function, iron is essential for cognitive functioning, helps convey brain signals to muscles, and assists in synthesizing neurotransmitters that transfer information from the brain to other body parts. Research has shown a strong connection between iron deficiency and ADHD - one study found that 89% of children with ADHD were low on iron, compared to just 18% of children without the disorder. When iron levels are low, common neurological and cognitive symptoms include difficulty concentrating, fatigue, headaches, and dizziness. Additionally, iron deficiency can affect sleep quality, with studies showing associations between iron deficiency and sleep difficulties like restless sleep, insomnia, and sleep apnea.","context":["Iron is a mineral that’s vital to your health. All of your cells contain some iron, but most of the iron in your body is in your red blood cells. Red blood cells transport oxygen from your lungs to the organs and tissues throughout your body.\nIron has a role in creating energy from nutrients. It also contributes to the transmission of nerve impulses — the signals that coordinate the actions of different parts of your body. If you have more iron than is needed, it’s stored in your body for future use.\nThe average American gets all the iron they need from the food they eat. But there are certain situations and conditions that may make it necessary to add supplemental iron to your diet.\n1. You Have Iron Deficiency Anemia\nIf you have iron deficiency anemia, there’s not enough iron in your body for your red blood cells to effectively provide oxygen to your cells and tissues.\nSymptoms of anemia include:\n- difficulty concentrating\nIron deficiency anemia is the most common form of anemia in the United States. Almost five million Americans have it.\nCommon causes of anemia include:\n- menstruation, particularly if flow is heavy or prolonged\n- peptic ulcer disease\n- cancer in the digestive tract\n- blood loss from trauma or blood donation\n- gastrointestinal bleeding from prolonged use of medications such as aspirin and ibuprofen\n2. You’re Pregnant\nWomen who aren’t pregnant or nursing need to15-18 mg of iron daily. Women who are pregnant need significantly more iron. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of iron for pregnant women is 27 mg daily.\n3. You Have an Infant\nBabies build stores of excess iron from their mothers while they’re in the womb. These stores are needed during their first six months of life when they’re nursing. This is because their mother’s milk is doesn’t contain enough iron.\nMost pediatricians recommend using a formula that’s fortified with iron if you bottle-feed your baby. Premature babies who haven’t had time to build their iron stores are likely to need supplemental iron as well. Always check with your pediatrician before supplementing your infant with iron.\n4. You Menstruate\nMenstruation depletes iron stores. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 9 percent of women and girls between 12-49 have an iron deficiency.\n- Young children are more likely to be low in iron because of their rapid growth. 14 percent of children under the age of three don’t get enough iron.\n- Iron deficiency and anemia have been associated with reduced academic performance and place children at risk of cognitive delays.\nSome research indicates that the incidence of anemia is influenced by ethnicity. Fully 19 percent of African-American and Mexican-American Women are anemic, compared to 9 to 12 percent of non-Hispanic white women.\n5. You Exercise\nPeople who do regular intense exercise may need up to 30 percent more iron than less active adults, according to the NIH. The reason for this isn’t clear. One theory is that iron cycles through the body more rapidly in people who exercise vigorously.\n6. You Experience Regular Blood Loss\nPeople who experience excessive blood loss frequently need supplemental iron. Regular blood donors and people who have gastrointestinal bleeding because of medications or conditions such as ulcers and cancer are at risk. Donating blood on a regular basis isn’t recommended if you’re consistently low in iron.\n7. You’re On Dialysis\nMany people who are on kidney dialysis need extra iron. This is because you lose a small amount of blood during dialysis. Dialysis diets also often limit iron intake. Some medications that people on dialysis take can use up iron or interfere with the body’s ability to absorb it.\n8. You Take Iron-Depleting Medications\nCertain medications can interfere with your body’s ability to absorb iron. These include over-the-counter antacids and some antibiotics, like quinolones and tetracyclines. Other medications that can deplete your iron include:\n- ranitidine and omeprazole (for ulcers, heartburn, and other stomach problems)\n- angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for high blood pressure)\n- colestipol and cholestyramine (cholesterol-lowering bile acid sequestrants)\n9. You Have ADHD\nResearch has shown that children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may benefit from taking iron supplements. In one study, 89 percent of children who had ADHD were low on iron, compared to just 18 percent of children who didn’t have the disorder.\n10. You Have ACE Inhibitor-Associated Cough\nDoctors prescribe ACE inhibitors to treat a number of conditions, including:\n- heart disease\n- high blood pressure\n- type 2 diabetes\n- mild kidney disease\nThey may even help prevent kidney disease in those with type 2 diabetes.\nAn annoying, dry cough is a common side effect of the medication. Research shows that iron supplements may significantly reduce the frequency of coughing in people who take ACE inhibitors.\nMost people respond well to taking iron supplements, which are available in capsules and intravenously.\nIdeally, you should take iron supplements on an empty stomach because food can decrease the amount of iron your body absorbs. Be sure to take only the recommended dose. Too much iron can be toxic, especially for children.\nTalk to your doctor to find out how long you need to take an iron supplement.","Do you get exhausted early? Do you find it difficult to climb the stairs without a gasp, even though you are physically fit? If yes, chances are you may be low on iron- especially if you are a pregnant woman.\nAlthough you might not think of iron as an essential nutrient, you will be shocked to know that figures from the CDC show, more than 10 million Americans are deficient in iron, and 5 million of those develop iron deficiency anemia.\nLet us delve into why iron is so essential for your health, how much iron you need to take daily, its food sources, causes and symptoms of iron deficiency, and when you need to take iron supplements.\nHealth Benefits of Iron\nYou may know iron to be essential for the synthesis of hemoglobin- a protein that carries and transfers oxygen from lungs to other body parts. But it has a lot more to do with your health. It gives you energy, improves your muscle stamina, keeps your focus and concentration, boosts your immunity, detoxifies your body, and makes you sleep well and enough.\n● Hemoglobin-Oxygen Delivery: Iron is a crucial mineral required to synthesize hemoglobin- the major protein in your red blood cells, which helps carry and transfer oxygen from lungs to every cell of your body. The cells in your body need oxygen for their metabolism (energy production, waste degradation, etc.). Without enough iron, your body fails to make enough numbers of red blood cells, leading to iron deficiency anemia. You get easily fatigued, shortness of breath, pale skin, headaches, and lightheadedness.\n● Energy Production: Some enzymes that catalyze oxidative phosphorylation (the process of generating ATP- the ultimate energy source for cells, from the foods you eat) require iron as a cofactor for their optimum functioning. Without enough iron, you may not be able to convert food into energy and feel fatigued and lethargic.\n● Brain Health: Iron is also beneficial for your brain health. It is essential for the cognitive functioning of our brains. It increases your attention span and concentration. It helps convey your brain’s signals to muscles and helps them move. It also helps synthesize neurotransmitters- chemicals that transfer information from your brain to other body parts.\n● Body Detoxification: Iron acts as a cofactor for enzymes that neutralize the harmful radicals and toxins from your brain and body as well as other potential toxins entering the body from the outside environment.\n● Immune Health: Iron is essential for both your innate and adaptive immunity. It activates your immune cells to fight against foreign invaders and pathogens. It also helps in the synthesis of different chemicals that boost immunity. Moreover, iron can also directly damage bacteria and pathogens. All these effects of iron boost your immunity and keep your disease-free.\n● Temperature Regulation: Iron is also essential for your body’s temperature regulation. It helps heat production and prevents heat loss from the body. Iron deficiency has been associated with disturbed thermoregulation. It may be due to bad thyroid functioning due to iron deficiency.\n● Sleep Quality: Iron also promotes your sleep quality. A 2015 study showed an association between iron deficiency and sleep difficulties like restless sleep, insomnia (inability to sleep), and sleep apnea. Iron supplementation in iron-deficient individuals significantly improves their sleep length and quality.\n● Healthy Pregnancy: Iron also promotes a healthy pregnancy. Adequate iron levels help make new red blood cells to deliver oxygen and other nutrients to the developing baby. Moreover, iron is also crucial for the early brain development of the embryo. Iron deficiency can lead to serious health problems in the baby as well as the mother.\nHow Much Iron Do You Need Daily\nYour daily requirements for iron may vary depending upon your age, sex, and diet.\nBoth males and females need a little more than usual amounts of iron during their puberty. Females during their reproductive age need more iron than males due to massive iron loss in menstrual bleeding. Pregnant and lactating mothers need an additional amount of iron to meet their baby’s iron demands.\nHere is a detailed description of the recommended daily allowance of iron, depending on the age of a person.\n● Newborns up to six months old: 0.27 milligrams per day.\n● Seven months to one-year-old: 11 milligrams per day.\n● 1-3 years old: 7 milligrams per day. ● 4-8 years old: 10 milligrams per day.\n● 9-13 years old: 8 milligrams per day. ● 14-18 years old: 11 milligrams per day. ● Older than 19: 8 milligrams per day.\n● 9-13 years old: 8 milligrams per day. ● 14-18 years old: 15 milligrams per day. ● 19-50 years old: 18 milligrams per day. ● Older than 51 years: 8 milligrams per day. ● Pregnant women: 27 milligrams per day ● lactating women: 10 milligrams per day.\nIron is found in a variety of both animal and plant foods. Animal foods provide you with heme-iron while plant foods offer non-heme-iron. Heme-iron is better absorbed from the gut.\nNon-heme-iron absorption from the gut is also affected by other foods you eat along with iron foods. Fruits high in vitamin C, like lemons and oranges, significantly increase the absorption of iron from intestines.\nSimilarly, there are certain foods and medicines which hinder the absorption of iron from the intestines. Foods include legumes, beans, cereals, and coffee, and medicines include proton pump inhibitors (used to treat stomach ulcers), tannins, and phosphates in carbonated water.\nIron is a low bioavailability nutrient. It means that your gut can absorb and utilize only a small portion of the iron you eat. Your intestine absorbs around 40% of heme-iron from animal foods you eat. For non-heme-iron from plant foods, you can absorb only 2% – 20% of the foods you eat.\nTherefore, the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of iron for vegetarians is 1.8 times more as compared to non-vegetarians who take most of their iron requirements from animal meat.\nHere are some excellent food sources of heme and non-heme iron.\n● 3.5 ounce (100 grams) of Beef Liver provides 4.2 milligrams (mg) of heme-iron. Pregnant women should not eat beef liver as it contains high amounts of retinoic acid. ● 3.5 oz (100 grams) of Turkey Meat may provide up to 1.5 mg or heme-iron. ● 3.5 oz (100 grams) of Canned Clams provide 3 mg of heme-iron. ● 3.5 oz (100 grams) of Canned Tuna Fish delivers 1.6 mg of heme-iron. ● 3.5 oz (100 gm) of Red Beef provides 2.7 mg of heme-iron.\n● 3.5 oz (100 grams) of cooked Spinach may provide 2.5 milligrams of iron. ● 3.5 oz (100 gm) of boiled Chickpeas offer 6.4 mg of iron. ● 1 cup of stewed Tomatoes provides 3.5 mg of iron. ● 1 cup of Tofu provides 5 mg of iron. ● 3.5 oz (100 gm) baked Potatoes provide 1.87 mg of iron. ● 1 cup (150 gm) serving of Broccoli provides 1 mg of iron.\nWhat Is Iron Deficiency Anemia\nAnemia is a health condition in which your body fails to synthesize enough numbers of red blood cells to carry and deliver oxygen from the lungs to other body parts. There are many causes of anemia, but iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia.\nAs described above, you need iron to synthesize hemoglobin- the main oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. Less iron leads to less hemoglobin synthesis, ultimately leading to decreased synthesis of red blood cells.\nCauses Of Iron Deficiency\nIron deficiency appears either when you don’t get enough iron from your diet, don’t absorb iron through your gut, or you lose a lot of iron due to blood loss of any cause.\nHere are some common causes of iron deficiency leading to anemia:\n● Insufficient Iron Intake. Not eating iron-rich foods (e.g., vegans) over an extended period may lead to iron deficiency. As iron is essential during the growth and development period, children and pregnant women should prefer eating even more iron-rich foods. ● Defective Iron Absorption from Gut. Despite including adequate iron-rich foods in your diet, you may still go iron deficient if your gut doesn’t absorb the iron from the foods you eat. Certain intestine disorders or surgeries can affect the iron absorption from your stomach. ● Heavy Blood Loss. Blood loss, due to any reason, also accompanies the loss of iron from the body. Internal bleeding due to ulcers in the stomach or intestine or external bleeding due to any injury, heavy menstruation, or during childbirth may also lead to iron deficiency. Heavy bleeding due to endometriosis may also cause iron deficiency in women. ● Pregnancy. Pregnant women need extra blood cells to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the developing baby. They need excess iron to synthesize new red blood cells. If not met through diet, this requirement may lead to iron deficiency in pregnant women.\nSymptoms of Iron Deficiency Anemia\nAt first, the symptoms of iron deficiency anemia may remain mild, and you may not even get a hint about them. The data from the American Society of Hematology shows that most people just don’t know that they have symptoms of mild anemia until they get a regular blood test.\nThe main symptoms of moderate to severe iron deficiency anemia include:\n● Pale Yellow Skin ● Paleness in the white of the eye ● Unusual weakness and fatigue ● Dizziness ● Shortness of breath ● Headaches ● Light-headedness ● Cold extremities ● Tingling sensation in the legs ● Tongue soreness ● Brittle nails, and ● An irregular, fast heartbeat.\nTreatment of Iron Deficiency Anemia\nThe treatment options for iron deficiency anemia aim to replenish the iron levels in the body. You may increase the iron-rich foods in your diet (but it is a time taking option) or may take iron supplements to meet ion demands on an urgent basis. For better absorption, you should take iron tablets on an empty stomach. You may need to take iron supplements for about six months. Iron supplements may also cause constipation.\nTreating the cause of heavy bleeding and preventing blood loss may also be a good treatment option for iron deficiency anemia if due to blood loss.\nIron is a nutrient essential for your health. Its primary role is in the synthesis of hemoglobin. It also benefits your brain health, immune system, and sleep quality. Not eating enough iron-rich foods over a long time may lead to iron deficiency anemia. Pale skin, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and headaches are symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. You should consult your doctor if you have these symptoms. Iron supplements are commonly used to treat iron-deficiency anemia."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:14d54bba-8372-47d7-8d5c-ed430b1fab1b>","<urn:uuid:f2130f9a-3b42-45a9-9037-ce9f32890ca8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the proper storage methods for dried herbs, and what essential electrical safety measures should be implemented in homes?","answer":"Dried herbs should be stored in airtight glass jars, keeping the leaves whole until ready to use to ensure longer-lasting preservation. For electrical safety, homes should implement several measures: use proper sized bulbs in lighting fixtures, cover unused electrical outlets with plastic plugs, maintain three-prong plugs without removing the grounding prong, keep combustible items at least three feet from heaters, and have wiring inspected if the house is over ten years old (immediate inspection for houses over forty years old). Additionally, never place electrical cords under bedding or rugs, and fix electrical problems immediately.","context":["A dehydrator provides its users with a quicker, easier and more consistent drying compared to drying herbs in the sun or through other methods. When using a dehydrator, there are certain things you need to do so that the herbs dry evenly and do not lose any of their functional properties. It is worth noting that drying herbs proves to be a useful and reliable way to preserve the herbs for later use in craft and cooking. It also helps in retaining the herbs’ flavors and as such; they remain nutritional beneficial throughout the time they will be preserved. Same as the article posted by Paul Woods, this article provides a guide on drying herbs in a dehydrator. Below are some of the steps to follow:\nWash the herbs\nHerbs may contain a ton of dirt from the garden, and as such, they should be washed to remove the dirt. When washing the herbs, ensure that you rinse them gently using clean water to remove the dirt without damaging the herbs. After washing them, spread the herbs on towels in the shade to remove the surface water. Avoid sun drying the herbs in the sun to remove the surface water, as this may be detrimental to the nutrients and moisture content in the herbs. A mild warm breeze is enough to remove the surface water when the herbs are spread out for about an hour.\nPrepare the herbs\nAfter all the surface water has been removed from the herbs, the next thing you should do is prepare the herbs for drying. Remove the stems (if you are drying leafy herbs). This helps in increasing the surface area of the herbs thus allowing for quick drying. Spread out the leaves on drying screens to provide sufficient space for air circulation. Do not place too many leaves on the tray at once, as this is likely to lead to uneven drying whereby some parts of the herbs dry more than the others.\nDehydrate until crumby\nOnce you have prepared the herbs for dying, the next thing you should do is place the herbs in the dehydrator to dry. You should then set the ideal temperature of the dehydrator depending on the herbs you are drying. Some herbs require high temperatures to dry while others require low temperatures. As such, it is necessary to understand the temperature requirements of the herbs you are drying. Avoid using too high or too low temperatures, as this is likely to interfere with the nutritional composition of the herbs. Generally, herbs take between 6-24 hours to dry well. The best way to know that the herbs are fully dried is by checking if they are crumby.\nStore the herbs in a glass jar\nAfter drying the herbs in the dehydrator, you should store them in a glass jar. Ensure that you use airtight storage to prevent moisture from affecting the moisture. Keep the leaves whole makes it possible to have a long-lasting from the herbs than if they were crumbled. As such, only crumble the herbs when they are ready to use.\nDrying herbs in a dehydrator provide you with control, flexibility and guarantee of constant supply of the herbs throughout even when the herbs are the off-season. This process is reliably fast and not as complicated as it is presumed to be.…","Electrical Fire Safety Info for Cables and Other Home Equipment\nWhile electricity is a wonderful aspect of modern life, it can be dangerous if we aren't careful. Electrical fires are a common occurrence in the United States, causing injuries, claiming lives, and resulting in losses of property. The majority of electrical fires are a result of old wiring and faulty outlets. Damage to appliance cables and extension cords and plugs can also lead to electrical fires in the home. To help prevent electrical fires in your home, it’s important to check your electrical appliances and wiring on a routine basis. Use the following information and tips to learn more about electrical fires, hidden hazards, statistics, circuit interrupters, and safety tips.\nFacts and Figures\n- More than 15 million appliances have been recalled in the last five years for defects that could result in a fire, including 1,942 incidents reported.\n- According to data analyzed by the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS), more than 69,000 fires were reported from 2002 to 2009 associated with appliances.\n- Residential appliance fires result in an estimated 9,600 fires, 525 injuries, 25 deaths, and $211 million in property loss annually.\n- Nationwide, there is a home fire death an average of every three hours.\n- According to the National Fire Protection Association, fire statistics data reported that 85 percent of fire deaths occurred in the home in 2009.\n- Each year fires started in electrical systems or lighting equipment result in damage to more than 24,000 homes and cause 830 civilian injuries and 320 civilian deaths.\nHidden Electrical Hazards\nExamples of unsafe home conditions that can lead to fire include:\n- Damaged extension cords, electrical conductors or plug wires\n- Short or overloaded circuits\n- Use of modified, unapproved or faulty electrical equipment\n- Insufficient clearance between combustibles and electrical heating equipment\n- Loose electrical connections\n- Running power cables through walls to a wall-mounted TV. This problem is quickly remedied with a recessed power outlet. Learn how to hide your TV cables safely.\nWarning signs of electrical dangers include:\n- Reoccurring or frequent issues associated with blowing fuses in appliances or tripping circuit breakers\n- Tingling sensation as you touch an electrical appliance\n- Sparks coming from an outlet or discolored or warm wall outlets\n- A continuous burning smell from a room or appliance\n- Lights that frequently flicker or dim\nElectrical Circuit Interrupters\nElectrical circuit interrupters protect against fires by monitoring electrical current. These devices respond to overloads and short circuits, such as with circuit breakers. Electrical circuit interrupters help to save lives and make homes safer by eliminating a significant source of electrical-related fires. When an electrical switch is opened or closed, a discharge of electricity occurs across the circuit, known as arcs. When arcs are unintentional, such as when wires or cords are loose or damaged, sparking can result in possible igniting of combustibles. These devices do not interfere with smoke alarms and other appliances and do not affect power supply reliability.\nWhen you run cable through any building you first need to consider plenum spaces. Plenum spaces are the open spaces above the ceiling or below the floor that are used for air circulation. Technically, any ductwork is considered a plenum space too. These spaces are important for air circulation in any building, but they also bring some problems if you ever have a fire because of the high oxygen content and lack of fire barriers. Using untreated cables in plenum spaces can spread the fire to other areas very quickly and spread noxious smoke throughout the building. Plenum cables are coated with flame retardant and made using special plastics that don’t smoke nearly as much as other plastics to help prevent this problem. Any cable that you run through plenum spaces must be plenum rated, even wiring used for information transfer, like Cat5 wiring.\nThe problem with plenum cables is that they are often more expensive, which is why people can become tempted to cut corners and use non-treated cables. An easy and far less risky solution is to use unterminated bulk cable and terminate it yourself. This process is fairly straightforward with most types of wiring, but Cat5 wiring can be a bit more complicated. To help you out we’ve made a Cat5 wiring diagram that shows you what you need to do.\n- Consider having the wiring inspected in your home if you live in a house that is over ten years old. If the house is over forty years old, an inspection should be immediate.\n- Always follow the usage instructions on all appliances.\n- Fix electrical or appliance problems right away. Use caution if fuses blow often, switches become hot or cause shocks, or circuit breakers trip often.\n- Never place electrical cords under bedding or rugs. Sparks or heat from the wiring can cause a fire.\n- Check labels on lighting fixtures and lamps to ensure you are using the right size bulbs. Check the label on the fuse box to ensure you are using the right size fuses.\n- Always cover unused electrical outlets with plastic plugs.\n- If a cable or cord has three-prongs, always use it properly. Do not remove the extra prong as the appliance must be grounded to reduce the risk of electrical shocks.\n- Do not overhaul electrical outlets. Extension cords should not be used as permanent cords in homes.\n- Routinely check your electrical appliances, electronics and wiring for signs of damage.\n- Replace all damaged, old, or worn appliance cords immediately and do not use appliances with frayed wiring.\n- Keep electrical appliances away from wet counters and floors. Be cautious when using electrical appliances in the kitchen and bathroom.\n- Do not allow children to play with or around electronics or electrical appliances, including hair dryers, space heaters, and irons.\n- Keep curtains, clothes, and other combustible items at least three feet away from heaters.\n- Some electrical appliances are designed to be left “ON” all the time. Check the manufacturer directions if you are unsure.\n- Learn the wiring colors and be sure to follow all instructions given by the manufacturer when fitting a plug.\n- Use proper rated cable, such as plenum HDMI, plenum Cat5e, and plenum siamese cable.\n- U.S. Fire Administration: Fact sheet from the U.S. Fire Administration on home electrical fire prevention.\n- Electrical Appliance Fire Safety: Learn what to check for on your electrical appliances to prevent fires.\n- Home Fire Statistics: Facts and figures associated with home fire statistics, including information on civilian home fires and fire-related deaths.\n- Electrical Safety Foundation International: Series of articles relating to fires caused by electronics and appliances.\n- Microwave Ovens Safety Issues: Learn about the common dangers associated with microwave ovens and how to use them safely.\n- Building and Fire Safety: Tips on how to identify electrical safety problems with this electrical safety check list.\n- The Danger of Electrical Shock: Information on how to stay safe from electrical shocks, injury, and death.\n- Kitchen Fire Prevention: Tips on how to prevent kitchen fires from fireproofing dangerous electrical appliances.\n- Electrical Safety: List of electrical hazards that can lead to shocks, burns, fire, or electrocution.\n- Plug into Electrical Safety: Information on fire-related accidents that can be prevented by taking a few electrical safety precautions.\n- Electrical and Fire Safety: Fact sheet on how to prevent fires and burns from electrical appliances.\n- Electrical Fire Safety: Tips for preventing electrical fires in the winter seasons in the home and workplace.\n- Fire Safety Tips: List of important fire safety tips to use in your own home to keep your family safe."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4064b42f-b8b1-4ff8-b903-73b6583142b6>","<urn:uuid:37293d77-7439-4009-a43f-ad96782b95d1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hello! I am studying food history. When Ethiopia and Indonesia first got coffee, which country started using it first?","answer":"Ethiopia was actually the birthplace of coffee, as mentioned in the first document which discusses Ethiopian cuisine. In contrast, coffee was only introduced to Indonesia much later - specifically in 1696 when the Dutch first planted coffee seeds at the Kedawoeng estate near Batavia (present-day Jakarta), though this initial attempt failed due to floods. The first successful coffee cultivation in Indonesia began a few years later.","context":["How to make a tasty Ethiopian breakfast in a hurry\nEthiopian breakfast food a popular dish at home for the couple behind Langano Skies\nChef Amsale Sumamo doesn't just like to cook; she loves to cook. You would think that after spending six days a week in the kitchen of her Edmonton restaurant, Langano Skies, she would want a break on her day off.\nInstead she whips up extravagant meals for her family. The passion for cooking runs deep for Sumamo, a native of Gondar, Ethiopia.\nSumamo didn't grow up cooking. She says her parents wanted her to focus on her schooling and not worry about making meals. Even though she wasn't helping her mom in the kitchen, she was always watching and learning.\nWhen Sumamo was 19, acting on advice from her father, she and a friend fled the political unrest of Ethiopia. They walked 11 hours a day for a week to reach El-Gedaref, Sudan.\nOnce they got there, Sumamo quickly realized she would have to learn to cook for survival, and taught herself to make simple dishes with inexpensive ingredients that she had grown up with.\nTwo years later, in 1983, she found herself en route to Edmonton, sponsored by her future husband Paul.\nAdapting to Edmonton had its own challenges, as not only were Ethiopian restaurants virtually non-existent here at that time, but even ingredients for her food couldn't easily be found — if at all. Sumamo was teaching herself to cook traditional Ethiopian dishes while having to adapt to the ingredients available.\nThese days most Ethiopian ingredients can be found here, but Sumamo, a self-professed control freak, insists on bringing some specific spice blends back from her trips home.\n\"If I'm using it, I want to know what's in it,\" she said. \"We go to a spice lady who makes a berbere blend for us, and we bring it home with us — sometimes as much as 75 kilograms on a trip.\"\nAt the Whyte Avenue restaurant she owns with her husband, Sumamo likes to focus on serving customers healthy food.\nShe takes pride in limiting the fat and salt while boosting the flavour with quality spices.\n\"Ethiopian food is all about spices,\" she said. She doesn't skimp on them.\nThat focus on healthy transfers to eating at home too.\nWhile they eat most lunches and dinners at the restaurant, the Sumamos often start the day with a healthy breakfast of avocado toast or scrambled eggs, always served with fresh fruit, and — of course — Ethiopian coffee. Ethiopia was the birthplace of coffee, after all.\nAnother popular dish in the Sumamo household is fül (pronounced \"fool\"), a mixture of fava beans, onions and cumin sautéed in butter, then mashed and topped with diced jalapeno, tomato and crumbled feta.\nSumamo's first memory of the dish is sharing it with her father in an Arabic café in Ethiopia, and it was one of the first dishes she recreated after arriving in Sudan.\nThere are many variations of the dish across Africa and the Middle East, but Sumamo decided on her version because she likes the burst of flavour from the fresh jalapeno and tomato on top. Usually eaten for breakfast or a snack, the dish is sure to keep you full and satisfied for hours.\n- 1 19-ounce can fava beans\n- 3 tablespoons butter or olive oil\n- ¼ medium onion, sliced\n- ½ tablespoon cumin\n- salt to taste\n- 1 jalapeno, diced\n- 1 medium tomato, diced\n- 2 spring onions, chopped\n- 3 tablespoons feta, crumbled\nAdd butter to frying pan over medium-high heat.\nAdd sliced onion and sauté until softened.\nAdd canned beans, including the liquid.\nSauté until warmed through, and mash slightly in the pan.\nSpoon onto serving platter and top with diced jalapeno, tomato and feta.\nServe with pita bread.","History of coffee in Indonesia, a timeline\nSomething for those always looking for curiosities, as well as for those who just accidentally learn something very cool!\nBelow you will find a short history of coffee in Indonesia – its cradle, colonizers from the Netherlands and stories about the first plantations, pirates and royal expeditions.\nWe invite you to delve into undiscovered stories straight from the Indian Ocean – sit back (preferably with a cup of Indonesian coffee in your hand) and learn more.\nIn 1614 Dutch traders visited Aden in Yemen. Pieter van den Broecke, a cloth merchant in the service of the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost- Indische Compagnie—VOC), visits the bustling trading port of Mocha on the southernmost tip of the Arabian Peninsula where he stumbles upon a drink that he describes as “something hot and black”.\nHe believes the drink, called qahwa by the locals, is interesting enough to be brought back to Amsterdam for analysis. For this he needs the seeds and given that the penalty for exporting seedlings is death, he is forced to smuggle them out. By 1616 Pieter van den Broecke was the first one to steal a bush from Mocha, Yemen and became the first person to bring a live coffee plant to Europe!\nIn 1640, the magical drink arrived in Amsterdam in the local cafes.\nThe Dutch by this time considered how to grow the coffee by themselves, rather than buying from Yemen and later from India.\nThe VOC, which is empowered to fight wars, drove the Portuguese from Ceylon by 1658—known today as Sri Lanka, hence securing the monopoly over cinnamon. As a bonus, it also acquires a small coffee plantation that is ready for harvesting. The Portuguese had colonized the Arabs 150 years previously and had stolen coffee seeds from them. Around this period, scientists at the Amsterdam Botanical Garden successfully cultivated coffee plants. They send some of the seeds to India’s Malabar Coast for planting.\nA little side tour – the VOC was often regarded as the first Ltd company in the world, which directly was the world’s first multinational corporation.\nEstablished in 1602 no other company predates. Granted powers to facilitate the spice trade, they became the monopoly of it, with powers to attack nations and individuals in their purpose of facilitating their trade, for 21 years. In 1619, only 17 years after its establishment it had 150 merchant ships, 50 warships, 50.000 employees, 10.000 soldiers and a ROI of 40% per annum.\nThe spice empire in Asia was ruled by the 17 Heren, The 17 Gentlemen (1725), who were shareholders representing different chambers of the VOC.\nThe Mayor of Amsterdam, Nicholas Witsen, instructs Adrian Van Ommen, the Dutch commander of the Malabar Coast, to ship seedlings from the Indian city of Cannanore to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies.\nThe seeds are planted on the Kedawoeng Estate, which is owned by Governor-General Willem van Outhoorn.\nThe pioneering effort fails as the fledgling coffee plantation is destroyed by floods. A second shipment of seedlings reaches Java in the following year. After a successful trial run on the island, the Dutch set their eye on cultivating the coffee in Indonesia.\nThe history of coffee in indonesia started 1696 in Java, Kedawoeng estate in Jakarta, or how it was known back in the days; Batavia. Unfortunately due to flooding this was not a success. It was 3 years that a high ranked Official in the VOC gave it another try. They moved land inwards from Jakarta toward the mountains and applied some of that dutch water management magic. These Yemenese varietal developed in Malambar, India, Arabica beans became the genes of most of the coffees found throughout Indonesia.\nThe plants traveled back along with their spoils to Amsterdam, which by the time of the 17th century was a rich trading hub for coffee from Asia, Africa and South America, due to the International character of the VOC. After 2 acclaims of being the best beans of the auction, and raised quite the premium for the dutch, colonially cultivated beans organised by the VOC.\nIn 1707 The governor met with all the regents in Priangan to discuss growing coffee on the higher plateaus of West Java, South of Jakarta. This area was not only selected for its nearness to the trading port of Jakarta, but also for its favourable growing conditions for the industrious scale of coffee cultivation (high plateaus). Only one local regent agreed, from Cianjur regency.\nIn 1711 the first 405 kilograms arrived from Cianjur and received the highest price ever paid at an Amsterdam auction. The equivalent of around 20 USD per KG, or a day wage for a worker in Amsterdam at the time.\nKing Louis XIV of France, asked for seeds of Coffea arabica var. Arabica or referred to as Coffea arabica L. var. typica which is hereinafter referred to as typika of the mayor of Amsterdam Nicolaes Witsen.\nThis is because the French King got the fact that Coffee from Java island got the highest price at an auction in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. So he wanted the coffee variety to be part of the Jardin des Plantes botanical garden in Paris, France. Javanese coffee seeds in the Jardin des Plantes botanical garden were brought by French naval officers to Martinique, one of the French colonies in the Caribbean.\nIn 1714, the Mayor of Amsterdam presented a gift of a young coffee plant to King Louis XIV of France. The King ordered it to be planted in the Royal Botanical Garden in Paris. In 1723, a young naval officer, Gabriel de Clieu obtained a seedling from the King’s plant. Despite a challenging voyage — complete with horrendous weather, a saboteur who tried to destroy the seedling, and a pirate attack — he managed to transport it safely to Martinique.\nOnce planted, the seedling not only thrived, but it’s credited with the spread of over 18 million coffee trees on the island of Martinique in the next 50 years.\nIn addition, in the early 1720s, the Dutch also sent Javanese coffee seeds to Suriname, because they were tempted by the high price of the variety’s, to open a plantation there. Of the two places, Javanese coffee seeds spread to Central and South America. According to Prawoto Indarto, who studies the history of coffee, Java coffee’s traces can still be found in South America.\n“Tipika is still found in their plantations,” he said. Blue Mountain coffee planted in Jamaica and Geisha (or Gesha) – in reference to a coffee-producing hamlet in Ethiopia-in Panama are two examples.\nIn 1726, no less than 2,145 tons of coffee originating from the island of Java flooded the continent of Europe, defeating Mocha coffee from Yemen which had previously been the ruler of the market. And because of that, coffee originating from Java Island began to be known as Java Coffee.\nIn the early 18th century, Amsterdam became the world’s coffee capital thanks to the coffee beans supplied from Java to Europe. The coffee trade was profitable and was under the control of the Dutch colonial government.\nThe main region to supply the huge demand, with hyperbolic margins, was between 4 peaks near Bandung, West Java: Malabar, Mega, Puntang and Haruman.\nFollowing the great profits from the trade, the Dutch further pushed coffee cultivation through the archipelago to East Java and later mandating its growth on Bali, Timor, Sulawesi and Sumatra.\nWith the VOC reeling from financial disaster, the Netherlands government takes over control of the archipelago and appoints Willem Daendels as Governor-General in 1808. His landmark policy is the construction of the Great Post Road that stretches from Anyer in the west of Java to Panarukan in the east.\nApart from postal purposes, the road is essential for the mobilization of troops, as well as to transport coffee from plantations that are scattered throughout different regencies to the port of Batavia.\n1876 AND LEAF RUST\nIn 1876 the whole lands of Coffee in Java were devastated by leaf-rust, which left a huge gap in supply that was quickly filled by the Brazilians.\nAs a first response the Dutch shipped Liberica varietal coffee that was native to west and Central African regions, these trees grew up to 20 meters, they produced larger fruit than arabica. The strategy worked, but unfortunately the success was short, as leaf rust attacked again in 1907, where the Dutch responded with the introduction of Robusta.\nHowever due to the agricultural impact that Robusta cultivation had, the Dutch only replanted the old plantations with Robusta, while new ones continued on Arabica.\nThe year is 1893, an exhibition to commemorate Christopher Columbus’s discovery of America was held in Chicago, presenting some of the latest technological and industrial innovations as well as cultures from across the world. One of the most popular venues at the event was the Java Village, an initiative bankrolled by some of the wealthiest benefactors in the Dutch East Indies.\nThe history of coffee in Indonesia found came to acclaim. Central to the village was the Java Lunch Room, where it served nothing but pure Java coffee. The experience was so memorable for the visitors that soon they would refer to the delicacy as “a cup of Java”. The impact of the marketing stunt was profound. To this day, the word “java” is still understood by many as meaning coffee.\nIn 1908 the Dutch returned the coffee business into the hands of the local people, in accordance with their new ethical policy in regards to colonial exploitation.\nSince then Indonesia has been developing many directions of unique flavors in coffee, that formed over a 350 year old history with the plant.\nIndonesia’s colonial masters did contribute immensely to the development of coffee in Java. After all, it was they who first introduced coffee to Indonesia, planting their pioneering seeds in 1696 at what was known as the Kedawoeng estate on the outskirts of Batavia, present-day Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia.\nThe experiment in Kedawoeng turned out to be a success with the coffees regarded as being of a very high quality. By the start of the 18th century, coffee from the estate was sent to botanical gardens around Europe, including King Louis XIV’s Royal Botanical Garden, which later spread it to France’s colonies in the West Indies, eventually reaching South and Central America.\nWhile the Kedawoeng estate no longer exists, many plantations left by the colonies are still in production, several of them are run by state-owned companies.\nOne notable mention is PT Perkebunan Negara XII. The company runs six estates in East Java with a combined size of 5,600 hectares.\nWhile most of the produce is Robusta coffee, the company still grows one of the world’s finest Arabicas at its estate in Jampit.\nWe hope you enjoyed the History of coffee in indonesia, NOW ARE YOU READY FOR A JOURNEY INTO THE BEST COFFEE INDONESIA HAS TO OFFER?\nCoffee varieties, varietal, cultivar; What does it all mean?\nWHY ARE COFFEE VARIETIES IMPORTANT?

{"question":"What is the significance of flood prevention planning, and how do recent scholarship essays address natural disaster preparedness?","answer":"Flood prevention planning is critical as demonstrated by Cedar Rapids, where a 500-year flood in 2008 caused $6 billion in damage and displaced 24,000 residents. The city implemented innovative solutions like a 220-acre greenway that serves both as recreational space and flood protection, with features like the McGrath Amphitheatre that demonstrates 'double-duty infrastructure.' Recent scholarship essays highlight that while natural disasters cannot be prevented, preparation is essential - as noted by students like Courtney Farr who emphasized the importance of having 'a safe and effective plan' for floods, and Tazeen Dhanani who stressed that planning well in advance will most effectively serve victims' needs during crises.","context":["Getting Creative in the Floodplain\nPlanning for rising waters and flood at Cincinnati's John G. and Phyllis W. Smale Riverfront Park\n100-year flood. 500-year flood.\nThese are the curious and somewhat misleading terms that meteorologists, emergency response organizations, and resiliency planners use to discuss flood events. A 100-year flood is one that reaches a level that, statistically speaking, stands a good chance of occurring once in a hundred years. Likewise, a 500-year flood might occur once every 500 years. However, this is not a schedule; It’s merely a statistic based on historical data and future projections. It’s useful for planning for the “worst-case scenario”, but it is important to remember that major floods can happen at any time. Optimistically, a city might go three or four centuries without hitting 100-year flood levels. On the other end of the spectrum? Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\nCedar Rapids, a city of 130,000, had only eight years between their first and second highest floods on historical record. First was the 2008 flood. Exceeding the 500-year flood level (that is, a flood that has only a .2% chance of occurring in any given year), the water crested at 31 feet above the riverbank. Emergency evacuation protocols and sufficient warning prevented any loss of life, but the impact shows in terms of displacement and dollars: 10 square miles of the city were flooded, some 24,000 residents were evacuated; damage to 7,000 affected properties tallied up to $6 billion. The impact of the more recent flood—this September—was considerably less. This is due both to the lower flood level (the water still crested at 22 feet, making it the second highest on record) and the fact that the city was more prepared this time—largely due to a river corridor plan developed by Sasaki and the City.\nWriting for Landscape Architecture Magazine (LAM), reporter Zach Mortice tells the tale of the city, its floods, and the years in between in “Cedar Rapids, Readier for this Flood.” He interviewed Sasaki Principals Gina Ford, ASLA, and Jason Hellendrung, ASLA, on work that the firm has done for Cedar Rapids. Ford and Hellendrung, as Mortice relates, have a unique connection to the city and its challenges. Having traveled to Cedar Rapids on June 11, 2008 for a greenway master plan kick-off, they awoke the next morning to experience the impact of the flood firsthand. The flood would rise higher through the 12th, before finally cresting on the 13th.\nYou can read the full story of those surreal days in the field on LAM—but it is no exaggeration to say that this flood would prove to be a defining moment of the project. It not only brought Ford and Hellendrung closer to the community’s experience, but refocused the entire purpose of the master plan. What was originally intended as a reinvigoration of the riverfront and city core quickly shifted to incorporating protection against future floods. Community outreach was critical and irrepressible to developing the plan—the community truly bonded together to share thoughts on how best to rebuild after this disaster. One of the most pressing questions moving forward centered on how to treat properties that had flooded.\n“What made this effort so successful was how engaged the community was from day one,” says Hellendrung. “Together, we developed several strategies against future floods as well as plans to reinvigorate the city. Options varied from walling off the river entirely to buying out the 7,000 properties that had flooded. Through working with the community, we landed in the middle—leading to the development of the greenway and a vibrant Riverwalk in the downtown that could be protected with demountable flood walls.”\nThe purchase of 1,300 parcels paired with city-owned property enabled the creation of a 220-acre greenway. Today, the sloping, lush greenway is a place for circulation, play, and programming in good weather, but serves as a levee in floods—a buffer between the river and the city. Along the west bank of the river is the popular McGrath Amphitheatre, which hosts several major concerts and events throughout the year—successfully activating the riverfront. The amphitheatre, completed in 2014, and the greenway illustrate another central goal of our work in Cedar Rapids: designing double-duty infrastructure:\n“Traditional flood prevention strategies often call for building tall flood walls along the riverbank,” says Ford. “While this is an effective strategy, it cuts communities off from their river—a great resource for recreation and natural beauty. In Cedar Rapids, we flipped the traditional treatment on its head. More than 99% of the time, the river isn’t flooded, so the question became ‘how can we design great public places that also offer proficient flood protection?’”\nThe pre-flood impetus for the plan was to reinvigorate the riverfront and its connection with adjacent neighborhoods. “The Cedar River is an amenity that serves to enhance the quality of life attraction for the City,” says the original request for qualifications, “and its plans are to rival any of the greatest river towns in America.” Though the 2008 flood changed the conversation in many ways, the city and community was still committed to celebrating the recreational and social value the river offers.\nIt’s a smart investment, and Cedar Rapids is in good company. Cities across the country have begun viewing their river and waterfronts—which have all too often languished as post-industrial dead zones—as major opportunities for revitalization. Investing in riverfront recreation is a proven economic generator for cities. A study we recently completed for Riverlife, a Pittsburgh riverfront advocacy group, draws a dramatic correlation. The study connects the city’s $130 million in riverfront investments to over $4.1 billion in development and soaring property values.\nA 2013 study by the Friends of the Chicago River show that each dollar invested in the Chicago River “provides a 70% return through business revenue, tax revenue, and income while creating 52,000 construction jobs and 846 permanent operations and maintenance jobs.” The Chicago Riverwalk, which celebrated the opening of its final phase last week, is palpable proof of the activation power riverfront design offers. Blair Kamin, architecture critic for the Chicago Tribune, described the project as a “path that will stretch uninterrupted for 1 and ¼ miles and will have transformed harsh industrial-era docks into a teeming postindustrial amenity” in a recent review.\nWe are humbled to have worked with such a strong community as Cedar Rapids. Together, we created a plan that invests not just in recreation space, not just in flood protection—but in both. That approach is reinvigorating the city’s vibrancy and has become a successful case study for planning for the worst while raising the quality of life to their best levels yet for the people of Cedar Rapids.","APHA's 2010 Get Ready Scholarship: Excerpts from winning essays\nSix students — at the high school, undergraduate and graduate college levels — were chosen from 900 applicants as the winners of APHA's 2010 Get Ready Scholarship. Below are excerpts from the winning essays.\n• Leah Wight— Golden Valley High School, Merced, Calif. (high school level)\nGeographically, the most probable natural disaster to occur where I live would be an earthquake. I live in the Central Valley of California, so I have experienced a mild earthquake or two. But I certainly haven't experienced anything even close to the same magnitude as the Haiti earthquake. This recent catastrophe has urged me to rethink my own family's earthquake disaster plans....Earthquake prevention is impossible, and earthquake prediction is near impossible. The only way we can protect ourselves is through planning and preparing. Earthquakes can shatter windows, destroy houses, annihilate entire cities, but they cannot eradicate my earthquake preparedness.\n• Courtney Farr — Robert L. Patton High School, Morganton, N.C. (high school level)\nGreat floods in the valley\nI live in the Foothills of North Carolina and happen to be in the direct vicinity of the large Catawba Valley. We do not receive a tremendous amount of precipitation, but when we do the rain usually comes in such large quantities, flooding seems almost inevitable...Based on my experiences and watching the devastating effects in my community, I am now more aware of the weather expected for my area. If another natural disaster such as a dangerous flood were to occur again, this time I would make sure to have a safe and effective plan and follow through to the best of my abilities...Ultimately, you have to know there is no way to stop a natural disaster, just be prepared for it the best you can and take the necessary precautions.\n• Brittany Voorhees — Holy Names University, Oakland, Calif. (undergraduate level)\nEarthquake reality: The first 72 hours\nLiving in Northern California, and the San Francisco Bay area specifically, there is always the potential for a significant seismic event. This is particularly true in both the area I live and the university I will be attending this fall as a junior. Living and going to school on two major active earthquake faults presents an ever-present awareness and challenge to prepare for the inevitable. The thought that \"it will never happen here,” simply is not a viable approach to follow. With this awareness comes the need to be prepared to survive for at least 72 hours without assistance from outside sources. This requires food, water, medical necessities and information on friends and fellow students on campus.\n• Delaney Moore — Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Ind. (undergraduate level)\nWinter is the season for cold skies and warm, bacteria-filled buildings. People constantly find themselves overcome with illness. This is the time of the year when hygiene is most important, especially in a dorm setting where students are in close corridors. Preparation for the flu season as well as constant awareness and care throughout the flu season will result in less illness and life-changing habits. In the incident of an emerging epidemic, such as the recent H1N1 (outbreak), taking precautions is vital for protection. It's important to educate, supply and enforce hygiene behavior. At a college campus, many actions can be taken.\n• Tazeen Dhanani — George Mason University, Fairfax, Va. (graduate level)\nPrevention, preparation and partnership to fuel community readiness\nPublic health emergencies like natural disasters and infectious disease outbreaks are inevitable. Events such as fires, floods, earthquakes and hurricanes are disasters that people usually have very little to no control over, yet these disasters have the most impact on its victims and others indirectly affected by them...However, whether it is a devastating earthquake that affects the entire global community or a small house fire that (displaces) only a single family, the need for planning well in advance of these disasters will most effectively serve the victims' needs. Having a plan and putting that plan into action during crises will prepare communities on a scale far superior and with more efficacy than having no plan at all.\n• Kristen Paz — Pepperdine University, Malibu, Calif. (graduate level)\nEarthquakes: Prepping for the aftermath of California’s faults\n...All Californians should ensure that their communities are prepared to sustain themselves for three days in the event of a major quake. Each family should have a preparedness plan. Creating guidelines on how to prepare should be a consolidated effort of the fire and police departments, county agencies, city officials and residents. Distributing these guidelines can be accomplished at city council meetings, via direct mail pieces and articles in local papers, neighborhood watch meetings and through local groups such as baseball and soccer leagues and YMCA. City engineers can advise on which areas are more likely to sustain higher levels of damage as they have a greater understanding of possible structure and soil issues.\nReturn to main Get Ready Scholarship page"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1c6b5876-ea6a-4559-89c6-3c452bad16d0>","<urn:uuid:541031ad-c63e-4763-9877-dcf9aa2cd4b5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As an environmental researcher, I'm curious about how different cities are implementing mobile air quality monitoring systems. What are the key differences between the TRAX train-based monitoring in Salt Lake City and Sheffield's MOBIUS vehicle, and how do their measurement capabilities compare?","answer":"The TRAX system in Salt Lake City uses light rail trains with sensors measuring ozone and particulate matter across three lines (red, green, and blue), covering different areas of the Salt Lake Valley. In contrast, Sheffield's MOBIUS is a fully electric Nissan eNV200 van equipped with air quality analyzers that can measure NOx, particulates, and ozone. MOBIUS has additional capabilities including a weather station that measures temperature, humidity, and wind patterns, plus a telescopic mast that can take measurements up to nine meters high. While TRAX sensors have been validated with 96% accuracy compared to stationary sensors, MOBIUS is specifically designed to calibrate fixed sensor networks and can also gather data about structural materials and wireless networks.","context":["For more than five years, University of Utah air quality sensors have hitched rides on TRAX light rail trains, scanning air pollution along the train’s Red and Green Lines. Now the study, once a passion project of U researchers, has become a state-funded long-term observatory, with an additional sensor on the Blue Line into Sandy and Draper and additional insights into the events that impact the Salt Lake Valley’s air, including summer fireworks and winter inversions.\nIn a new study published in Urban Science, researchers including Daniel Mendoza and Logan Mitchell report the latest from the TRAX Observation Project, including data validation studies that bolster the data’s value for other researchers and three case studies from recent events showcasing the abilities of the mobile air quality sensors.\nWhat’s new: Blue Line and data validation\nUTA’s TRAX system consists of three light rail lines: red, green and blue. Up until November 2019, U sensors measuring ozone and particulate matter were installed only on the Red and Green Line trains, because both lines used the same train cars. These two lines travel through downtown Salt Lake City, the central I-15 corridor and the valley’s west side. With an additional sensor on the Blue Line, however, air quality measurements now extend into the Salt Lake Valley’s southeastern quadrant.\n“That’s a really important area of the valley,” Mitchell says. “There’s a lot of people down there.” The Blue Line also goes up and down in elevation, just as the Red Line does as it ascends from downtown Salt Lake City to the U campus. “Since elevation is such a key part of the air quality and understanding the depth of the inversion on different days, under different conditions,” he says, “it’s going to be a really important piece of the dataset for us.”\nExtending into the south valley also allows researchers to learn more about how air masses move back and forth between Salt Lake and Utah counties, through the narrow Point of the Mountain passage.\n“That’s actually really critical because we sometimes have very different meteorological phenomenon going on between the two valleys,” Mendoza says. “We can now examine in our basin an exchange of air masses.”\nThe other major development in the TRAX Observation Project is the validation of the data coming from the mobile sensors. This is an important step in a pioneering project such as this, and serves along with quality assurance and quality control protocols as a certificate on the archived data now being made available to other researchers. It also assuages any concerns that the air turbulence caused by the moving train might skew the readings.\nThe experiment involved a stationary particulate matter sensor placed about 10 feet (3 m) from the rail line that would take readings whenever the TRAX trains were within 500 feet (150 m) of the sensors. Comparing the mobile and stationary readings, Mendoza says, showed 96% accuracy. “That really gives us a great deal of confidence that our TRAX sensors are actually performing really well compared to regulatory sensors and can be used for health studies, policy and so on,” Mendoza says.\nWatching the fireworks\nWith five years of continued observations, the TRAX Observation Project has captured many air quality events. Mendoza, Mitchell and their colleagues document three particular events in their paper: an elevated ozone event from August 2019, a cold air pool inversion event in November 2019 and the fireworks on July 4, 2019.\nThe fireworks event was unique—it wasn’t a phenomenon caused by an atmospheric event or by the geography of the Salt Lake Valley. It was an incidence of multiple point sources of particulate matter air pollution, allowing observation of how those plumes of particulate matter moved through the valley.\nFollowing generally good air quality, hotspots of elevated pollution started appearing in the TRAX data between 10-11 p.m. on Independence Day. By midnight, the majority of the valley was experiencing moderate to unhealthy air quality.\nMendoza says that the train data shows not only the dispersion of the smoke—something you don’t see in wintertime inversions, which have low atmospheric energy—but also the evening winds coming down Emigration Canyon on the valley’s east side, which washes out some of the air pollution.\n“These are examples of the kinds of things that we’re seeing that you couldn’t see with stationary monitors,” Mitchell adds. “It’s helping us understand where the gradients are in the valley, how they evolve through pollution events such as during the Fourth of July or an inversion or an ozone event. You can see the air masses moving around. You can see where the pollution is and how it moves from different parts of the valley.”\nNext, Mitchell says, the team hopes to add sensors that measure oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide, both important components of atmospheric chemistry. They’d also like to expand the study to light rail trains in cities such as Portland or Denver.\n“It would be really interesting for us to be able to compare the spatial patterns we’re seeing here with another city that has different topography around it and a different mix of emission sources,” Mitchell says, “so that we can understand how cities, in general, are being affected by these things and how that’s similar or different from what’s going on in Salt Lake City.”\nFind the full study here.","The Urban Flows Observatory has developed a unique vehicle-based platform for measuring the multiple factors affecting and influencing the quality of the environment Sheffield inhabitants experience. The MOBIle Urban Sensing vehicle, ‘MOBIUS’, will be making its first appearance on the city’s streets this summer.\nBased on a Nissan eNV200 van, MOBIUS is fully electric and uses additional on-board battery systems to power the installed equipment. This means no fossil fuels are used as it moves around the city collecting data. In addition to measuring the environment, we’ll also be gaining insight into the infrastructure currently available within Sheffield to support electric vehicles (EVs), and the potential challenges faced by EV owners.\nWhat are MOBIUS’ capabilities?\nOur mobile sensing vehicle features air quality analysers, a weather station and antenna air monitors. This enables it to:\n- Collect accurate measurement of air quality, including NOx, Particulates and Ozone\n- Collect information on influencing factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and wind direction\n- Provide air quality metrics at a height of up to nine metres via a telescopic mast\n- Gather information about the materials used for structures, their thermal efficiency and the effect on energy consumption\n- Map the use of radio technology supporting mobile phones, Wi-Fi and new Internet of Things (IoT) devices\nWhy are we collecting this data from our mobile sensing vehicle?\nThe Urban Flows Observatory includes a network of fixed location, distributed air quality sensors, but the accuracy of these must be checked to ensure the ‘picture’ of the area affected by pollutants is representative and not misleading.\nMOBIUS enables us to take additional measurements at the same locations to calibrate the data generated by the fixed sensors.\nStructural material and energy observations will help us to understand the extent to which the city uses energy and recommend ways that could improve usage efficiency and hence positively impact air quality and reduce fuel poverty.\nAdditionally, wireless networks are almost everywhere in one form or another, but all use the same basic technology in the form of radio. Many also occupy similar parts of the available spectrum. By surveying a wide range of network types, we hope to form a view as to how networks may be installed and operated more effectively, gaining a better understanding of how conflicts and inefficiencies can be avoided.\nInformation from MOBIUS will be combined with data from our air quality sensors, weather stations and other sources to create a growing and evolving sense of the environment in Sheffield and, we hope, point to ways that it can be improved.\nMOBIUS beyond the Observatory\nWe expect MOBIUS to play a role both locally and nationally in raising awareness of the effects of air quality on health and what we can do to help. We will be visiting schools and science festivals around the country, accompanied by researchers. The first such appearance will be at the Bluedot Festival from 19th-22nd July at Jodrell Bank in Cheshire, in partnership with the Grantham Centre.\nCome and see MOBIUS at the festival to find out how tracking flow through our site can help us understand how cities work. Try our Virtual Reality headsets, Thermal Cameras, and LIDAR mapping to develop your own real-time data and analysis of the festival.

{"question":"As a sheep farmer concerned about parasite control, I'd like to know: what are the current recommendations for worming ewes during lambing season, and what are the safety precautions when using diazinon-based dips?","answer":"For worming during lambing season, the current approach recommends selective treatment based on body condition score (BCS) rather than blanket treatment of all ewes. Ewes showing loss of body condition are more likely to produce high numbers of worm eggs and should be prioritized for treatment, while leaving the fittest ewes untreated. This targeted approach helps reduce resistance development while maintaining effectiveness. Regarding diazinon dips, strict safety measures must be followed: operators must adhere to safety precautions, dip wash disposal regulations must be strictly followed, and sheep must be immersed for at least one minute with the head plunged under twice. Never use on humans, dogs, or cats. The product requires specific replenishment rates: for baths under 2250 liters, add 1 liter after every 36 sheep; for larger baths, add 2.5 liters after every 90 sheep.","context":["Brand: SUMMER DIP CONCENTRATE\nPARASITES CONTROLLED (spectrum of activity)\nTo prepare the bath:\nMeasure the required volume of cold water into the bath.

Keep the sheep moving forward and crutch the head under at least once. Care should be taken to see that they do not swallow or inhale the wash.\n- Dip baths of 2250 litres or less must be replenished every 36 sheep. Dip baths over 2250 litres are replenished every 90 sheep Replenish, as the levels fall, as directed hereunder. This combined with a clean bath, will give best results. If this recommendation is not observed, sheep passing through the bath at a low dip level (or a foul bath) will not be as effectively treated or protected as those passed through earlier.\nTo replenish the bath:\n- Baths less than 2250 litres (500 gallons): after every 36 sheep dipped, add 1 litre [i.e. 4 x 250ml deliveries from the dispensing pump] into the dip tank and sufficient water to restore the bath to its original volume.\n- b) Baths greater than 2250 litres (500 gallons). after every 90 sheep dipped , add 2.5 litres [i.e. 10 x 250ml deliveries from the dispensing pump] into the dip and sufficient water to restore the bath to its original volume.\n- When a bath becomes foul, always empty it and refill with fresh dip.\n- For the purposes of the control of sheep scab, sheep must be totally immersed in a bath and all parts of the sheep except the heads and ears must remain immersed for not less than one minute.\n- Plunge the head under at least twice, allowing time to breathe between plunges.\nRead the complete product label carefully and ensure thorough accomplishment of all the use instructions.\n- LD50 (acute oral) in rats: for the a.i. 1250 mg/kg\n- LD50 (acute dermal) in rats: for the a.i. >2150 mg/kg\n- Estimated hazard class according to the WHO: III, slightly hazardous.\nSuspected poisoning?

Incorrect use is usually the most frequent cause of product failure.\nSo far there are no reports on resistance of blowfly maggots, lice, keds or ticks to organophosphates in Europe. However, resistance of blowflies and lice to these and other chemicals has been reported elsewhere (e.g. Australia, New Zealand).\n- Macrocyclic lactones (e.g. doramectin, ivermectin, moxidectin, etc.) only as injectables.

Such products were rather popular in Europe and elsewhere till the 1990s but have been vastly replaced by less toxic and more convenient pour-ons (mainly synthetic pyrethroids or insect hrowth regulators) and injectables (mainly ivermectin and other macrocyclic lactones).\nDiazinon (also called dimpylate) is a veteran broad-spectrum organophosphate introduced in the 1950s by GEIGY (later CIBA-GEIGY → NOVARTIS) that has been very abundantly used worldwide in agriculture, hygiene and veterinary insecticides. In sheep, diazinon was particularly appreciated for the control and prevention of sheep scab mites, blowfly strike and lice. It has a high affinity for wool lipids, where it dissolves after administration and remains for a long period of time ensuring several weeks and even months protection against re-infestation.\nUsage of diazinon products in sheep strongly declined after several countries imposed very strict safety precautions and dip wash disposal regulations (e.g. the UK & Australia) for all dips in the late 1990s. As a consequence, using these products became rather inconvenient and often also expensive. Soon after, NOVARTIS, the market leader for diazinon products for sheep, divested all its organophosphates for strategic reasons, including its diazinon sheep brands (NEOCIDOL, TOPCLIP). Nowadays, in many countries sprays and dips containing diazinon, other organophosphates and even synthetic pyrethroids have been vastly replaced by injectable macrocyclic lactones (e.g. doramectin, ivermectin, moxidectin, etc.) that have become affordable, are much more convenient than sprays & dips and as effective. Diazinon is still abundantly used worldwide in insecticide-impregnated ear-tags for fly control on cattle.\nUsed as recommended this product is highly effective against established infestations of mites (incl. sheep scab), blowfly strike, lice, and keds and ensuresl several weeks protection against re-infestation. Control of ticks is usually less effective. But to ensure efficacy it is crucial to dip the sheep correctly. To learn more about correct sheep dipping click here.\nAll organophosphates are veteran pesticides developed in the 1950s-1960s and are basically contact insecticides. This means that when the parasite comes in contact with it (e.g. during the blood meal, after landing on a treated host, etc), the active ingredient that impregnates the host's hair coat penetrates through the cuticle (i.e. the \"skin\" of insects and other arthropods) into its organism and disturbs essential biological processes in the parasite's body, in this case its nervous system.\nAfter administration to livestock or other animals, organophosphates do not have a systemic mode of action, i.e. they are not transmitted to the parasite through the blood or the host. Topically administered organophosphates are very poorly absorbed through the skin of the hosts, and what is absorbed is quickly broken down and/or excreted. Consequently the concentration reached in the blood is too low to kill blood-sucking parasites.\nThis article IS NOT A PRODUCT LABEL.

This is known as the peri-parturient rise and the worm eggs, passed out in the ewe’s dung, contaminate the pasture grazed by their lambs later in the season.\n“The objective of using a wormer at lambing time is to reduce the level of pasture contamination and the subsequent challenge to lambs. It normally has nothing to do with the health of the ewe.”\nThe problem is that worming all ewes at lambing time in the hope of reducing the risk to their offspring is high-risk in terms of accelerating the development of resistance to wormers on a farm. Reducing the proportion of ewes wormed reduces this risk and helps slow the development of resistance.\nMs Stubbings continued: “For some years, SCOPS has recommended at least one in 10 of the fittest ewes are left untreated to reduce the selection for resistance in the worm population. However, as resistance levels increase, we need to better identify those ewes likely to produce the highest level of contamination and when this if likely to occur, so treatment can be timed more accurately.”\nMs Stubbings said SCOPS has been watching with interest a research project in Wales that has shown a significant variation in the extent, timing and duration of the peri-parturient rise, both between individual ewes and between farms.\nNutritional stress, measured as a loss of body condition score (BCS), was the key to establishing which ewes had the highest faecal egg count (FEC) and when this occurred relative to lambing.\nMs Stubbings said: “This latest research suggests, rather than just leaving the fittest or single rearing ewes untreated, you can use loss of body condition in your ewes to identify those under the most nutritional stress and therefore more likely to produce a high number of worm eggs in their dung.\n“In most flocks this means the proportion treated can be reduced. This is critical to address concerns over the blanket use of long-acting moxidectin 2% wormers in ewes.\n“While these products reduce egg output over an extended period, and therefore can reduce pasture contamination, they also mean the worm population is exposed to the active for longer. Taking this new approach means we can target only those ewes likely to produce the most contamination, harnessing the potential of moxidectin while ensuring minimum selection pressure is exerted.”\nKevin Harrison, a sheep farmer on the Gloucestershire/Somerset border, is the chairman of the SCOPS Steering Group.\nHe said: “As the incidence of anthelmintic resistance continues to increase across UK sheep farms, the need to use wormers only when necessary is becoming more and more important.\n“A better understanding of why and when we worm ewes and targeting treatment to ewes based on reduced body condition score is a really practical recommendation and a positive step all producers can take. In our flock we have drastically reduced the number of ewes we worm in recent years, without any detriment to the lambs, and of course we have also saved money. I urge other producers to consider taking steps to reduce wormer use in their ewes this spring.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9aa96642-ce00-4c5e-8e6e-f6ea43d74f72>","<urn:uuid:d5013ede-3311-42a1-8195-08bd3831fcc8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As an environmental scientist, I'm curious about how climate change affects both freshwater and marine ecosystems - what are the habitat requirements of darters in streams, and how does global warming impact coral reefs?","answer":"Darters require clear, rocky streams with swift-flowing sections for survival. Most species cannot tolerate siltation and need clean water. They typically stay near the bottom, using their enlarged pectoral fins to hold position against the current. Some species, like sand darters, prefer sandy stretches of sluggish streams, while others inhabit quiet pools with submerged plants. For coral reefs, global warming poses severe threats through multiple mechanisms: Rising water temperatures disturb the photosynthetic process of their symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae), leading to coral bleaching. Increased ocean acidity from absorbed CO2 disrupts coral calcification and weakens their skeletal structure. Additionally, rising sea levels can cause corals to 'drown' by making it difficult for them to receive adequate sunlight for photosynthesis at deeper depths.","context":["Darters have been described as the hummingbirds of the fish world: colorful, small, and quick. Missouri has about 44 different types of darters. They are most diverse in the fast, clear, rocky streams of the Ozarks.\nLike other Missouri members of the perch family (including the larger walleye, sauger, and yellow perch), darters are slender, fairly cylindrical fish with rough-edged (ctenoid) scales. The fins have spines. The dorsal fin is divided into 2 separate parts, with 6 or more stiff spines in the forward part and fewer than 23 rays in the second part. One or 2 spines are present at the front of the anal fin; the second spine, if present, is never more than half again as long as the first spine. The pelvic fins are attached far forward on the body, nearly beneath the pectoral fins, and each pelvic fin has 1 spine and 5 soft rays. There are about 44 species of darters recorded for Missouri. Some are widespread and occur in a variety of aquatic habitats, while others are restricted to certain stream systems — some of those are rare and endangered.\nDarters are not well-known to most people. Anglers sometimes capture them while seining for bait and think they are young walleyes or saugers. Here are good ways to tell darters from young walleye and sauger:\n- Walleye and sauger have large, prominent canine teeth on the jaws and roof of the mouth, while darters have teeth that are small and inconspicuous.\n- The pectoral fins of most darters are large and fan-shaped, while those of walleye and sauger are of a size and shape more typical of fish in general.\n- Many species of darters do not exceed a length of 3 inches; the largest species, the logperch, rarely exceeds 7 inches. Walleye and sauger reach larger sizes.\nMissouri’s darters are in the genera Ammocrypta (our 2 sand darters), Crystallaria (the crystal darter), Etheostoma (about 29 species), and Percina (about 12 species of roughbelly darters, including the logperches). The numbers are approximate because researchers using DNA data have been discovering new species.\nHere are the darter species known from Missouri:\n- Western sand darter, Ammocrypta clara\n- Scaly sand darter, A. vivax\n- Crystal darter, Crystallaria asprella\n- Mud darter, Etheostoma asprigene\n- Autumn darter, E. autumnale\n- Greenside darter, E. blennioides\n- Brook darter, E. burri\n- Rainbow darter, E. caeruleum\n- Bluntnose darter, E. chlorosoma\n- Arkansas darter, E. cragini\n- Meramec saddled darter, E. erythrozonum\n- Arkansas saddled darter, E. euzonum\n- Barred fantail darter, E. flabellare\n- Swamp darter, E. fusiforme\n- Slough darter, E. gracile\n- Harlequin darter, E. histrio\n- Yoke darter, E. juliae\n- Least darter, E. microperca\n- Sunburst darter, E. mihileze\n- Niangua darter, E. nianguae\n- Johnny darter, E. nigrum\n- Goldstripe darter, E. parvipinne\n- Cypress darter, E. proeliare\n- Stippled darter, E. punctulatum\n- Orangethroat darter, E. spectabile\n- Speckled darter, E. stigmaeum\n- Highland darter, E. teddyroosevelt\n- Missouri saddled darter, E. tetrazonum\n- Current darter, E. uniporum\n- Redfin darter, E. whipplei\n- Banded darter, E. zonale\n- Goldline darter, Percina aurolineata\n- Logperch, P. caprodes\n- Channel darter, P. copelandi\n- Bluestripe darter, P. cymatotaenia\n- Ozark gilt darter, P. evides\n- Ozark logperch, P. fulvitaenia\n- Blackside darter, P. maculata\n- Longnose darter, P. nasuta\n- Slenderhead darter, P. phoxocephala\n- Dusky darter, P. sciera\n- River darter, P. shumardi\n- Stargazing darter, P. uranidea\n- Saddleback darter, P. vigil\nSimilar species: The following groups of fishes share some characteristics of the perches: sculpins, temperate or sea basses (such as white and striped bass, white perch, and so on), sunfishes (including smallmouth bass, crappie, and so on), and freshwater drums. Paying attention to the characters mentioned above will help separate darters and other perches from the other families.\nAdult length varies by species. Most grow no larger than about 3 inches. Our largest darter, the logperch, rarely exceeds 7 inches. Our smallest darter, the least darter, has a maximum length of just over 1¾ inches.\nMost parts of Missouri have one or more species of darters, but none are present in most streams in the northwestern prairie section of the state. Some darters have a very restricted distribution; at least three species occur nowhere else in the world except for Missouri.\nHabitat and Conservation\nDarters are adapted for life in the swift-flowing sections of clear, rocky streams. To keep them from being swept downstream, the gas-filled swim bladder found in most fishes is absent or much reduced in darters. They sink immediately to the bottom when they stop swimming, and the press of the current against their enlarged pectoral fins tends to hold them in place.\nDarters remain much of the time beneath or between rocks and are afforded some measure of protection from the direct action of the current.\nWhen moving from place to place, darters proceed by a series of short, quick dashes, and it is this characteristic form of locomotion that has earned them the name “darter.”\nNot all darters are found in swift currents. The sand darters (Ammocrypta spp.) inhabit the sandy stretches of sluggish streams. Here they hide much of the time beneath the sand with only their eyes showing. The least darter and its close relative the cypress darter live in quiet pools, where they clamber about over the leaves and stems of submerged plants.\nIn Ozark streams, darters, along with minnows, are the dominant groups of small fishes. The geographic separation of the various stream systems has led to a great variety of uniquely different species. The common and widespread darters in the Ozarks are the greenside, rainbow, fantail, stippled, orangethroat, and banded darters, and the logperch. The yoke darter is abundant in the White River basin. The bluestripe, Niangua, and Missouri saddled darters are unique to the Ozarks of Missouri.\nIn the Mississippi Lowlands of Missouri’s Bootheel, darters are well represented but have fewer overall numbers than in the Ozarks. The principal darters in Missouri’s southeastern lowlands are western and scaly sand darters, and the bluntnose, slough, cypress, speckled, blackside, and dusky darters.\nIn the prairie (dissected till plains) region in the northern half of Missouri, darters are not very diverse. The johnny darter is the only species that is widespread. The logperch and the fantail, orangethroat, and slenderhead darters are common in some streams.\nFour species of darters — the logperch, and the slenderhead, river, and western sand darters — are fairly common in the Mississippi River but are rare in the Missouri.\nDarters usually eat a variety of small aquatic insects such as the larvae of midges, mosquitoes, blackflies, caddisflies, mayflies, and stoneflies, and small crustaceans such as aquatic isopods and amphipods, small crayfish, and sometimes snails. Different species have slightly different diets.\nSeventeen darters are species of conservation concern, meaning that their presence in our state is to some degree imperiled:\n- Seven Missouri darters are listed as endangered in the state of Missouri: crystal darter, swamp darter, harlequin darter, goldstripe darter, redfin darter, longnose darter, and Niangua darter. The Niangua darter is also listed as threatened on the federal list.\n- Ten other Missouri darters are listed as species of conservation concern in Missouri: western sand darter, scaly sand darter, Arkansas darter, Current saddled darter, Arkansas saddled darter, least darter, channel darter, bluestripe darter, river darter, and stargazing darter. The Arkansas darter has been a candidate for being placed on the federal endangered species list and is considered “near threatened.”\nAt least three Missouri darters are endemic to our state, occurring nowhere else in the world: the Missouri saddled darter and bluestripe darter are found exclusively in streams of the northern Ozarks, and the Niangua darter is known only from a few tributaries of the Osage River.\nLike most other perches, darters usually spawn in spring or early summer. Some of our earliest species to spawn are the greenside, rainbow, and orangethroat darters. The males of many darters occupy small territories during the spawning season and possess brilliant colors that advertise their presence to other fish of their own species. Most do not practice parental care, abandoning the territory once spawning has been completed. The johnny darter and fantail darter are exceptions: they spawn on the underside of rocks or other submerged objects, and the male remains with the eggs until they hatch.\nBecause of their small size, bright colors, and interesting habits, darters can be excellent aquarium fishes. Their main disadvantage is that they prefer live food, although they can be conditioned to eat frozen brine shrimp. Nongame fishes may be collected for aquarium purposes by the holder of a fishing permit, using techniques and in numbers specified in the Wildlife Code of Missouri. Make sure you identify the fishes correctly, since 17 species are listed as species of conservation concern, which may limit or prohibit their possession (consult the current Wildlife Code of Missouri).\nIt is possible to observe fishes in nature, and darters can be fun to watch. Most of them occur in clear, fairly shallow waters, and in spring, you can watch them feeding and spawning. During spawning season, many darters have brilliant colors and have interesting behaviors. If you are looking at them from above water, approach cautiously and avoid creating vibrations that may be transferred to the water. Consider using binoculars, or wear polarized sunglasses to reduce glare from the reflected sunlight. Choose days with little wind to break up the water’s surface.\nThe construction of large hydroelectric and flood control reservoirs in the last century has altered and destroyed stream habitat, leading to declines in many types of fishes, including some darters. The presence of a dam, and an immense lake not inhabitable by stream-dwelling fishes, blocks waterways, preventing fishes from one side of the dam from recolonizing streams on the other side of it. So if a population in a small tributary stream is eliminated for some reason, there may be no way for it to become repopulated.\nOther environmental changes that have caused declines are due to land management, such as timber cutting, construction, and agricultural practices, that disturbs soils and, through runoff, leads to increased siltation in streams. For fishes like our various Ozark darters, which require clear-flowing streams with rocky or gravelly substrates, siltation is a major threat.\nDarters comprise 4 genera and about 215 species. They are endemic to North America and are found nowhere else in the world. Because most species do not tolerate siltation or pollution very well, they are sensitive to habitat degradation. A large proportion of their species are threatened, endangered, or extinct. On the flip side, their presence in a stream can be a sign of good water quality.\nMissouri is the home to about 21 percent of all the species of darters worldwide. Our state is rich with unique and diverse aquatic ecosystems, and it’s the responsibility of all of us to protect them.\nGenerally speaking, most animals where the males possess bright colors are species that have the ability to see color. They use color as a way to communicate their gender, their condition, and even their mood.\nThe nonbreeding coloration of darters is typically tans and browns, with darker mottled, banded, barred, saddled, or blotchy patterns. These camouflage them against the bottom substrate of streams.","Coral reefs are one of the ocean’s most astonishing sites. They are like modern day cities providing homes, food and protection to many different species of sea life. The reefs also provide erosion protection to the coastlines from battering waves. In addition, they contribute to local economies through fishing and tourism. The most beautiful coral reefs in the world have existed for thousands of years, such as, the Great Barrier Reef on the Australian Coast. Sadly, they are now being destroyed. “Researchers estimate that nearly 60 percent of the world's reefs are seriously threatened,” (Anonymous, 2001, 4) and “it is estimated that 30% of coral reefs have now lost >90% of reef-building corals and there is little to no prospect of recovery” (Trappon et. al., 2011, 2). There are many detrimental factors that affect the fragile corals. One of these is global warming. Climate change has caused increased water temperatures, sea level changes, ocean acidity, increased carbon dioxide levels and more. There are also many human related factors. Some of these factors are: water pollution, coastal development, destructive fishing practices, coral mining and careless tourism. All of these things are contributing to coral bleaching and other issues that kill the coral reefs.\nCoral reefs are called the rainforests of the sea because of their diverse ecosystem (Anonymous B, 1). “The ancient Greeks mistakenly believed that corals were plants. Corals are actually animals, related to anemones and jellyfish” (Woods 2003, 0). They consist of many colonies with each individual coral being called a polyp. The corals have hard skeletal structures that are made from calcium carbonate that is secreted by the polyps. The calcium carbonate builds up over time, continually adding to the size and shape of the structure (Anonymous B, 3). The corals have a symbiotic relationship with a single-cell allege called zooxanthellae. These algae live inside the coral. The coral provides a safe home for the zooxanthellae and zooxanthellae provide food for the coral from the sugar it produces through photosynthesis. In turn, the corals excrete nitrogen waste, which the alga consumes as food (Woods 2003, 1). The zooxanthella also gives the coral its vibrant color.\nCorals are sessile animals, which means they do not move, but are fixed in one place. (Anonymous B, 4) In order to survive, they live close to the surface so light can penetrate down to reach the corals for the purpose of photosynthesis. The water, in which the corals thrive, needs to be 68 -82 degrees Fahrenheit (Kalman 2008, 1). For these reasons, they live in shallow, tropical waters. The reefs are home to more than 25% of all marine life. They provide food, homes and breeding grounds for sea life that inhabit the area, which makes them a big part of the oceans' ecosystem (Kalman 2008, 1).\nIn addition, coral reefs provide many benefits to humans. The reefs contribute billions of dollars to local economies through the fishing and tourism industries. They also provide the main protein food source for many impoverished coastal lying countries (Glick 1999, 7). “More than 30 million people depend on coral reefs for their livelihoods” (Anonymous, 2001, 11).\nFor all of the beauty and benefits that the coral reefs provide, in return they are being destroyed. Corals are “often thought of as the ocean’s “canaries in a coal mine.”” This is because they are particularly sensitive to changes in their watery environment (Kalman 2008, 1). “Nearly one-third of the 704 species studied are listed as “Critically Endangered,” “Endangered,” or “Vulnerable.” (Kalman 2008, 5) So, what is it that is destroying these beautiful fragile reefs?\nCoral bleaching is one of the main complications for corals. This process happens when there is an increase in environmental stress (Kalman, 2008, 3). Causes of bleaching can include: increased water temperatures, increased water acidity, increased water levels, increased UV radiation, storms, chemical exposure, sediment covering the coral, chemical household products, and overload of nutrients and fertilizer (Woods 2003, 6).\nGlobal warming has had many affects on the oceans. One of these affects is the rising water temperatures. This increase of temperature causes the fragile corals to be threatened. Due to the increased water temperature, the photosynthetic process of the zooxanthellae is being disturbed. This causes a buildup of substances that are poisonous to the algae. In order for the coral to protect itself, it releases the zooxanthellae along with some of its own tissue. This process causes the coral to lose their color and become bleached (Woods 2003, 5). Bleached corals are weaker and more prone to disease. However, they can survive if conditions return to normal quickly (Anonymous C, 4).\nIncreased ocean acidity is also contributing to the killing of the coral reefs. The ocean’s acidity has been changing as the result of the astonishing increase of human produced carbon dioxide that has been released into the atmosphere over the past 250 years. This is because the waters absorb the carbon dioxide from the air, which benefits humankind by reducing greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, but dramatically affects the waters (Anonymous C, 2). The dissolved carbon dioxide in the water lowers the oceans pH level. The decreased pH level causes a disruption of the corals calcification process and weakens the existing coral skeleton making it more vulnerable to disease, erosion, and damage from fishing and tourism. The reduced pH also affects other ocean life by reducing food levels and the calcification of shellfish (Springer-Verlag 2009, 5).\nOver the last century, the sea level has risen 20 cm. This is “due to thermal expansion and melting of land-based ice, and is projected to be another 60 cm higher by 2100” (Springer-Verlag 2009, 9). With the rising sea levels, the coral reefs can drown. This event occurs because it is difficult for corals to obtain the proper amount of sunlight at these deeper depths necessary for photosynthesis. Without photosynthesis, the algae will not be able to produce the food needed for the corals to survive (Knowlton 2001, 12). This will especially affect the slow growing corals and will cause a drastic reduction of this species (Anonymous A, 4).\nBeyond the environmental factors affecting the reefs, there are other human related factors. One of these is over-fishing. Coral reefs have an extensive amount and variety of seafood, which fishermen have long taken advantage of. Many fisheries, dependent on coral reefs, have harvested unsustainably and depleted the numbers of sea life faster than it can reproduce. As the fishermen continue to take from the reefs, the ecosystem becomes unbalanced. With this imbalance, the corals can be affected greatly by the consequences, such as, the overgrowth of algae, which can smother the reef. Also, the reefs are damaged by harmful fishing practices such as the use of cyanide. Cyanide is used to stun the fish prior to capture, but this harmful chemical is absorbed by the coral (Glick 1999, 11, 12). Other causes related to fishing practices are stick banging and the use of explosives, which damage the corals structure (Anonymous C, 9).\nAnother human related factor is coastal development. More and more of the world’s coastlines are being developed without any regard to the habitat of the coastal waters. Channels are being dug for safe ship passage, piers are being built on top of the reefs, and land is being paved allowing polluted water and silt to runoff into the oceans. “Rapid development over the past 50 years has contributed to excessive sewage runoff, which harms coral reefs by causing accelerated algae growth.” Other practices such as mining, farming, destruction of forests and the use of fossil fuels create air pollution and water run off pollution. These pollutants poison marine life. All of this is destroying the coral reefs and, in turn, endangering the coastline from the erosion that was being prevented by the coral reefs (Glick, 1999, 10).\nThere are also numerous threats to the coral reefs from tourism and coral mining. Although tourism generates millions of dollars to local economies, it can have a devastating affect to the coral reefs in two ways. First, sewage that is not properly contained or resorts that dump waste directly into the ocean hurt the coral reefs. Secondly, is the physical contact tourism brings to the reefs. Tourists swimming, diving, boating and fishing cause direct damage the corals by touching, kicking, grabbing, walking on or stirring up sediments. Boaters also drop anchors directly on top of the corals causing damage to their structure (Anonymous C, 11). Removal of coral through mining has also contributed to coral depletion. The corals have been mined for souvenirs to be sold in the tourist trade and for use in various types of construction (Anonymous C, 10).\nIn order to save the magnificent coral reefs, action must be taken. The reduction of greenhouse gasses must be reduced worldwide. This will require researchers to come up with better environmentally friendly technologies. In addition, water pollution, habitat destruction and harmful fishing practices must be controlled internationally. Funding for research on how the coral reefs are affected by different issues and how to protect the reefs from these issues is essential, as well as increased funding for reef restoration (Eakin, Kleypas, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2008, 4). Enlarging protected marine areas around reefs worldwide, to protect them from dangerous fishing practices and tourism related damage, would also aid in their survival. The reefs are minimally protected in this way now (Glick 1999, 13). “Some scientists have predicted that by 2030 massive and devastating coral bleaching events will occur every year” (Woods, 2003, 10). So, it is vital to take actions now to protect the fragile coral reefs.\nCoral reefs provide not only beauty, but contribute to the vast ocean ecosystem. They provide food, protection and breeding grounds to thousands of species of sea life. Human beings also benefit from these amazing reefs by their ability to contribute billions of dollars into the local economies through fishing and tourism. Coral reefs also provide a source of a food protein to impoverished coastal countries. Yet, these slow-growing magnificent structures of the ocean are being destroyed at an alarming rate. These fragile animals and their symbiotic partners, zooxanthellae, are greatly affected by global warming and its consequences, such as, increased water temperature, increased acidity levels, and increased water levels. These threats can cause devastating, mass coral bleaching events. In addition, human activities like destructive fishing practices, careless tourism, coral mining and coastal development are adding to the threats. In order to save these important and invaluable beautiful reefs, the world population must change their habits, improve technologies in order to reduce pollution and use environmentally friendly construction and development practices. If we do not take action, these beautiful life and economy sustaining structures will forever be lost for future generations. This would be a tragic event for the earth’s oceans and to the worldwide society."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:410d77ff-b70b-4d45-b55b-3c4251591f7a>","<urn:uuid:d3a02c8a-7f47-422f-b8e8-a9e242d449d8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do IR satellite imagery and Weather Underground's personal weather stations compare in measuring cloud temperatures and weather conditions?","answer":"IR satellite imagery measures cloud temperatures using infrared radiation detected by geostationary satellites, with colder high clouds emitting less infrared radiation than warmer low clouds, visualized through a color scheme from gray to yellow. Weather Underground, on the other hand, uses a network of nearly quarter-million personal weather stations that directly measure multiple parameters including temperature, humidity, pressure, rainfall, and wind conditions at ground level, supplemented by NEXRAD radar data from the National Weather Service.","context":["To celebrate fall, we’ve added a touch of color to our global satellite layer! The color-enhanced infrared (IR) satellite image is designed to visually highlight the coldest cloud tops. Cold cloud tops are often indicative of active thunderstorms that can produce severe or extreme convective turbulence. The animated satellite layer updates every thirty minutes and is accessed in the map mode menu in the Maps view.\nHow IR Satellite Imagery Works\nAny object that has a temperature warmer than absolute zero will emit radiation at many different wavelengths. Radiation produced by the earth and its atmosphere is emitted spaceward from land masses, oceans, lakes and the top of most clouds. Satellite sensors are used to measure this radiation that includes both visible light and those wavelengths that are invisible to the naked eye. The radiation emitted in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum is the source of data used to build our IR satellite layer.\nTo create this layer, five geostationary satellites look at the entire earth (with the exception of polar regions) and measure the amount of infrared energy being emitted. The infrared satellite sensor measures the amount of energy and calibrates it to temperature using a very simple physical relationship known as Planck’s Law.\nHigh clouds are very cold and emit less infrared radiation than warmer clouds near Earth’s surface. Furthermore, land masses are usually warmer than most clouds. Since the satellite can’t directly distinguish between the earth’s surface and clouds, we employ a software algorithm that determines where it is cloudy and where the sky is clear. While this works well most of the time, snow cover, fog and even the oceans can sometimes fool the algorithm. We recommend using the Sky Coverage and the Satellite layers together to get the most accurate picture.\nHow To Interpret IR Satellite Imagery\nData measured by the satellites is calibrated and colorized according to the temperature. Warmer objects emit more infrared energy and colder objects less. Shades of gray are used to represent the lowest-topped clouds; the darker the shade of gray, the lower the cloud tops. For higher-topped clouds, color is added. Just above the lightest shades of gray you may see blue and green colors introduced representing still colder and higher tops. Above this, shades of red, orange and yellow represent the coldest and highest cloud tops.\nAs the temperature of the atmosphere generally decreases with height, a pilot can get a pretty good idea which clouds are high-level and which are low-level based on the color or shades of gray depicted.\nThe IR Satellite layer allows you to quickly locate the most dangerous weather anywhere in the world. Ground-based radar provides a multitude of information on the location and movement of convective weather, however it is limited to US and Canada. The IR Satellite layer gives you a global, at a glance view of significant weather. This is especially important if you are planning a flight over large bodies of water.\nIn this image over central Africa, you can quickly see where the most significant weather is located, especially in regions that have a cellular appearance depicted in deep red, orange and yellow colors.\nOne thing to note is that thick cirrus clouds at very high altitudes will also show up as very cold clouds even though they may not be associated with deep, moist convection. Most of the time these high cirrus clouds do not have the same cellular appearance as convective clouds and thus have very little variation in color.","Whether you’re just wanting to keep your family safe from foul weather or you’re an amateur storm aficionado with dreams of tornado chasing, there are all sorts of applications you can use to keep track of big storms in your area. But the weather apps you’ll find in the App Store and Android Store are also based on all sorts of different technologies, so it’s important to understand what you’re looking for in a storm tracking app.\nThe two real keys to success in tracking storms with a mobile app is current radar and cellular connectivity. See, radar is the best way to determine the size, speed, direction and duration of a storm. Connectivity is important because weather is constantly changing, and no accurate weather app works offline.\nLet’s look at some of the best apps for different kinds of storm trackers.\nBest for Amateurs: Storm by Weather Underground\nFirst of all, this is the best-looking weather and storm tracking app on the market with the highest resolution (250m) radar that can generate interactive animations for past, current and future data. This sweeping radar imagery appears on the main screen along with a twister icon if your geographic area is under a tornado watch or warning. The full screen radar map can be customized with a wide variety of data that includes surface and Jetstream level winds, earthquakes, fronts, and tropical data.\nThe app will also generate National Weather Service alerts that you can read with the tap of the screen. Storm offers another setting that will generate a text message if precipitation or lightning is found within ten miles of your location. The base app is free, although Weather Underground does sell in-app subscriptions to remove advertisements as well as offer more advanced features. With data based on more than a quarter-million personal weather stations, Storm offers the best general storm tracking experience.\nBest for Semi-Pros: Radarscope\nFancy chasing down F5 twisters like Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt in the movie? Radarscope is the best app for people who are serious about the dangerous science of storm chasing. This dynamic little app was designed for specifically for storm chasers as well as professional TV meteorologists, which make it a pretty nifty tool for science-minded hobbyists as well. Radarscope can access data from any NEXRAD or TDWR radar site in United States, Guam, Puerto Rico and South Korea, which is kind of random but powerful for stateside users.\nWhile the app’s interface is fairly straightforward, the amount and type of data that Radarscope is able to correlate is quite complex. The app is able to layer in more detailed information such as storm total surface rainfall as well as technical data to predict patterns like velocity. The base app is plenty powerful at just $9.99, but the company also offers a Tier 2 upgrade for $99 annually that enables a 30-day archive, rotation detection, hail size detection, and multi-device activation.\nBest for users with no attention span: Dark Sky\nDark Sky has the simplest interface of all the storm tracking apps, but there’s a lot going on under the hood. The app pulls data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s network for 140 radar stations positioned around the country, but also uses a proprietary algorithm to hyper-localize your weather. By focusing on the weather patterns in a smaller local area, Dark Sky gives a very contemporary picture of your local conditions by mostly focusing on the next hour of weather in your area. However, the app’s global radar feature can also give you a sense of how the weather in your geographic location fits into the larger state, national and global weather picture. The data can also be augmented by user reports to add another layer of weather data to the mix.\nBest for Outdoorsy Types: Weather Underground by Weather Underground\nThis is the hefty big brother to Storm, utilizing the same network of nearly a quarter-million personal weather stations that measure temperature, humidity, pressure, rain fall, and wind speed and direction, augmenting by NEXRAD’s radar data generated by the National Weather Service. Because of the density of the data and the number of layers that Weather Underground can correlate, it provides one of the most comprehensive platforms for storm tracking. The app also features forecasts, maps and augmented features like first light/last light, which is handy for outdoorsy types who want to get in a bike trip or a run before it gets dark.\nBonus App for Fun: Texas Storm Chasers by Fifty Pixels Ltd.\nThis nifty app is the companion to a company dreamed up by two Texas high school students in 2009, which has since evolved into a full-fledged community of storm chasers. This free app not only features interactive weather radar but also real-time Texas weather articles, live storm chase video, and safety tips to ensure your family’s safety during severe weather. For armchair enthusiasts of severe weather, the Texas Storm Chasers Live Storm Chasing Feed is a pretty amazing thrill ride through Tornado Alley."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:48e34e13-d7f6-42b8-aff5-2dc66cd48e4f>","<urn:uuid:3fa7cce4-8a91-453a-a988-175502319b81>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the importance of innovation in investment banking, and how does cultural awareness affect cross-border banking transactions?","answer":"Innovation is crucial in investment banking as the industry completely recreates itself every 20 years, with 80% of current revenue coming from businesses that didn't exist 20 years ago. For example, when derivatives trading first began, completing eight swaps in a year was considered successful, while now that many can be done in seconds. Regarding cultural awareness in banking transactions, it's essential because different cultures have different rules and norms for behavior and procedures. Companies engaging in cross-border transactions must understand how headquarters culture differs from other countries, as adopting an 'our way or the highway' mentality often leads to poor outcomes. Cultural differences need to be respected throughout the transaction process to ensure success.","context":["Innovation is the key to successful investment banking, said Brady Dougan, AB ’81, MBA ’82, CEO of Credit Suisse Group during a CEO Spotlight sponsored by the student-led Investment Banking Group at the Charles M. Harper Center. “It’s a great place to start at entry level.”\nOne of the reasons innovation is required to be successful, he said, is because investment banking “recreates itself every 20 years.”\nEighty percent of the revenue we make in businesses now come from businesses that didn’t exist 20 years ago, he said. When Dougan started off in investment banking, he said he was in derivatives or the “swap business.” He said he did eight swaps in a year then. Now, he said, you can snap your fingers on a trading floor in the amount of time it takes to do eight swaps, but back then if you were successful, you did eight swaps in a year.\nDougan advised future MBAs to work overseas to lay the foundation for their careers in today’s global market. “It’s not a question of whether you should,” he said. “It’s a question of which direction you go. Working in different areas of the world is really valuable. This is a global business.”\nDuring a five-week period in September and October, Dougan visited Moscow, Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich, Jeddah, Riyadh, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, San Paolo, Mexico City, Zurich, London, New York, and Chicago, he said. “And I wouldn’t say that’s atypical,” Dougan said.\nMany job candidates are interested in working in big economic centers such as New York or London, he said. “I think that’s good, but I would also suggest that you get some pretty interesting experiences in smaller branch offices,” Dougan said. “It’s usually on a much more intimate scale. You can get to know other parts of the business and see how they work. You also get exposure to things you wouldn’t otherwise: such as going to breakfast with the CEO when he comes through town!”\nWorking in management is a valuable experience, but not just because it furthers careers or places people in senior positions, he said. “It can produce a tremendous amount of good in a broader, nobler sense,” Dougan said. “A lot of people want the fame, prestige, or perks that go with management. To me that doesn’t really work. What works is if you are sincere about helping the people you’re working with, making the organization succeed, and making the people succeed. People are smart. They can see the motivations of their leaders.”\nThe evolution of the global economy makes today an ideal era for students of the Chicago School of Business approach, he said. “It is becoming a more global world and in many respects a somewhat more rational world,” Dougan said. “Thoughtful analysis, quantitative approaches to things, and what I call a more collegial approach are becoming more and more effective. They are the future of global business. I think students from Chicago are going to play a very, very important role in these markets as they change.”","28 Mar Bridging the Culture Gap in Cross-Border M&A\nIt is no secret that cultures change from country to country. They may even change from region to region within the same country. Having an M&A advisor who is intimately familiar with the culture of your target country is a critical component to executing a successful transaction.\nIn this final installment of our Buy-Side-as-a-Service (“BSaaS”) series we will discuss culture from the perspective of a nation and an organization. It is true that individual culture exists and is important; however, it is less significant in our discussion. For that reason we will focus solely on national and organizational culture.\nBefore we jump into the weeds it is important to ensure we are speaking the same language when we discuss culture. Sociologists and anthropologists may argue over the definition of the term culture, but for our purposes we will use the following: culture is the total way of life of a people, composed of their learned and shared behaviour patterns, values, norms, and material objects.\nIn the world of M&A, the culture of the target company is generally acquired in its entirety when the transaction is finalized. Throughout the integration process the culture may evolve to reflect that of the Buyer. When approaching a cross-border transaction management shouldn’t focus on if the culture, at the national or organizational level, is the same or different. Rather, management should approach the culture question from the perspective of the expected synergies. Will the changes necessary to recognize deal synergies cause a conflict in both cultures?\nIt is natural to expect that some bumps will be encountered along the way for both the Buyer and Seller. It is management’s job to evaluate to what degree these bumps may actually become roadblocks to achieving the business goals. When conducting this analysis management can look at culture from the perspective of the nation in which the target is located and the organization itself.\nA national culture connects people who share a common history, beliefs, and values. It represents how these people interact among each other and how they react to someone external to their culture. Companies engaging in cross-border M&A transaction must take care to understand how culture at HQ differs from the culture found in other countries where the target entity is located.\nBuyers approaching an M&A transaction with a foreign company that adopt an “our way or the highway” mentality are likely in for a poor outcome. This is due to the fact that different cultures have different rules and norms for behaviour and procedures. It is unlikely that they will change due to new ownership of their company. Both buyers and sellers should be aware that work will need to be done before, during, and after the transaction to ensure that cultures are respected throughout the process.\nSavvy buyers will try to get an idea as to a country’s culture prior to engaging with a target. Various methods could be utilized in this endeavour from traveling to the country for a first hand experience, speaking with colleagues in the country, or dong some online reading. All can be beneficial, though some are obviously more fun than others. To provide an introduction to various forms of culture we will present Hofstede’s cultural dimensions theory below. This is a theory, and not a law, and should be viewed as a jumping off point and not the finish line in your cultural research.\nHofstede’s Cultural Dimensions Theory\nProfessor Geert Hofstede surveyed IBM employees from around the world from 1967 – 1973. His research led to the creation of Hofstede’s cultural dimensions theory and studies how culture influences values in the workplace. The original study produced the following six dimensions:\nHow does society handle inequality? To what degree do the lower members of society accept and expect that power is unequally distributed?\nIn a high power distance society people tend to accept that a hierarchy is necessary and don’t question the status quo. In a low power distance society people demand a more equal distribution of power. People in a low power distance society will want justifications for any inequalities.\nIndividualism vs. Collectivism\nIndividualistic cultures are defined by people who are obligated to take care of themselves and close family only.\nA collectivist culture is more tight-knit. People in a collectivist culture can rely on support from extended family and even other, unrelated members of the community.\nIndividualism vs. collectivism gets down an “I” vs. “We” mentality.\nMasculinity vs. Feminism\nIf a culture tends to focus on material rewards, assertiveness, and achievement it would be defined as masculine.\nOn the other hand, a feminist culture is more focused on cooperation, modesty and is more consensus-oriented.\nTo avoid gender stereotypes masculine and feminine can also be referred to as tough and tender, respectively.\nThis dimension gets down to how comfortable or uncomfortable members of a society tend to be with uncertainty.\nA country strong in uncertainty avoidance would exhibit unwavering beliefs and not tolerate non-traditional ideas or thoughts. Countries that are low in uncertainty avoidance are more open to different thoughts and experimenting with new ideas.\nLong Term vs. Short Term Orientation\nHow do you respect your past while also preparing for a future that is certain to change? Countries around the world approach this from different perspectives.\nA short term orientation culture adheres to time-honoured traditions and tends to be skeptical of change.\nLong term oriented cultures are more open to change. They encourage efforts to plan today for what changes may come tomorrow.\nIndulgence vs. Restraint\nOf all the dimensions these are probably the easiest to grasp.\nA country that leans towards indulgence accept gratification of basic human needs and other wants and desires. Live life and have fun may be a slogan for these cultures.\nThose that are more restrained suppress gratification and may go so far as to do so via strict social norms or laws.\nNaturally, just because a country tends to lean toward one direction doesn’t mean a company operating in that country is the same. For example, you could have a company that has adopted a culture of experimentation and challenging the status quo that just happens to be located in a country generally defined by strong uncertainty avoidance. Management should use Hofstede’s cultural dimensions as a tool to start understanding other cultures and not as a law written in stone.\nWe’ve reviewed how national culture influences individuals. Now let’s explore how culture influences the companies that operate within a country’s borders. A review of organizational culture and the role it plays in M&A follows.\nBefore you can understand an organization’s culture, you must first understand the national culture. The organization, by operating within a country, will have many similarities with the national culture. However, differences will also be evident.\nAs buyer’s consider the culture of a foreign entity they can divide the organization into two parts:\n1) The organizational climate\n2)The national culture\nA new owner can influence the organizational climate. This includes changing thinking about how the business operates and introducing new practices and technologies.\nThe national culture part of the organization, however, cannot be changed. A company located in the U.S. will have employees who mostly adopt American culture. In more authoritarian regimes aspects of the national culture may be imposed by law on companies.\nIt can be helpful to classify the organizational culture of your company as well as your target. While we don’t have a universally agreed upon set of categories for organizational culture, the following are a good start:\nMarket Culture – Develop a competitive advantage and pursue a market leading position\nClan Culture – Develop strong internal morale among employees to create a more tight-knit and cohesive company\nHierarchical Culture – A bureaucratic structure\nAdhocracy – A flexible organization that encourages innovation and an entrepreneurial mindset\nPower Culture – Focus on power with well-defined rules\nRole Culture – Formal procedures and written rules. Similar to a hierarchical culture\nPerson Culture – Personal growth and development is a focus\nAs two companies plan to merge it is necessary to consider and plan for obstacles arising from conflicting cultures. This will not be isolated to one level of the organization. Incompatibilities in culture can be witnessed from the ground floor employees all the way up to the C-Suite executives.\nWhere is Culture Reflected in the Organization\nWhen examining an organization, culture is reflected in various processes:\n1) Policies & procedures: How are procedures documented, who is responsible for developing the policies and procedures, and how are changes approved?\n2) Systems & controls: What type of relationship do managers have with personnel? Is the objective to manage and control or to coordinate?\n3) Information & communication: What information is shared and how it is distributed to various levels of the organization\n4) Decision making: who makes decisions, who is involved in the process, and what level of the organization is responsible for certain decisions\nApproaches to Connecting Cultures\nVarious theories exist that try to guide companies with different cultures through the integration process. Like many theories, they sound good on paper but may be harder to execute in the real world. The following are a few established theories. Your integration may be able to incorporate pieces from the following or may require an entirely different approach. Motives for the transaction, the geographies involved, the human resources and other factors will all play a role in deciding upon a strategy when connecting cultures.\nImpose Your Culture\nThis method is very straightforward. The buyer, as the new owner, will impose their culture on the newly acquired company. If you decide to go this route ensure it is done with careful planning and execution. Employees will want to understand the motives behind the decision and will seek justification as to why your organizational culture should be adopted.\nThis approach allows the buyer and newly acquired entity to retain their existing organizational culture. Pros to this method are that culture shock can be reduced, or eliminated, and employees can continue to perform at a high level as they aren’t distracted by change. This approach could also reduce the risk of M&A failure. Cons include difficulty in communication and limiting potential synergies.\nCreate a New Culture\nIf neither of the above sounds appealing then why not create a brand new culture. This will be a complex task. Management will need to identify the pros and cons of each existing culture and then structure a better culture that works for all parties. This approach starts with a detailed understanding of the various cultures and creating bulletproof reasons as to why certain elements should be included in the new culture. To pull this off management will need to be expert communicators.\nRegardless of which approach you take to connecting two cultures conflicts are bound to arise. In preparation for a transaction management should openly acknowledge that conflicts will occur and have a plan to quickly identify and resolve issues before they get out of hand.\nSources of Cultural Conflict\nUnderstanding the differences of national and organizational culture can help a buyer plan for a cross-border M&A transaction. It is also helpful to understand various sources of conflict. Below we describe a few various sources you should consider throughout the M&A process.\n1) Cultural differences – Misunderstandings that result from differences in point of view and methods of communicating\n2) Assimilation vs. ethnic identity maintenance – The needs to assimilate with a new culture competing with conservation of a cultural and ethnic identity\n3) Power imbalance – The manner in which power is distributed\n4) Competing goals – Different divisions within the organization may have competing goals, resulting in conflicts during interaction\n5) Competition for scarce resources – From capital to raw materials different divisions within the same company will be competing for limited resources\nWhen preparing for a cross-border M&A transaction a buyer will have many important facts to consider. While valuation, deal structure, and integration plans are critical, buyers must also recognize that culture plays an important role. It is important to create a global corporate culture for your business that respects and incorporates the various national cultures.\nIf you are exploring M&A opportunities in the United States our team of licensed investment bankers would love to have a conversation.

{"question":"What fossil evidence reveals dinosaur characteristics, and how quickly did their extinction occur according to the K-Pg boundary analysis?","answer":"Fossils provide key evidence about dinosaurs through remains of teeth, bones, claws, footprints, and eggs that have hardened into rock. These fossils form when dead animals are buried in sediment, their flesh rots away, and minerals from surrounding stone seep into and harden the bones over millions of years. According to analysis of the K-Pg (Cretaceous-Paleogene) boundary layer, the extinction appears to have been extremely rapid, with species seeming to vanish overnight. New research examining soot deposits in this boundary layer suggests that the bulk of the extinction occurred in less than ten years, primarily due to the rapid climate effects of the asteroid impact.","context":["Dinosaur Facts and Information\nA Brief History of Dinosaurs\n- Dinosaurs, the word itself makes us imagine something huge and big.\n- Dinosaurs were creatures that walked the earth for millions of years.\n- They were able to survive for so many years because they adapted to the changing conditions in that era.\n- These animals lived long ago much before people existed and hence are called prehistoric animals.\n- The dinosaur age is known as the Mesozoic Era.\n- The Dinosaurs belonged to the reptile family.\n- Reptiles are animals like snakes and crocodiles that we see today. They have scaly and waterproof skin and lay eggs.\n- You must be wondering, if people didn’t exist in that era, then how have we gathered so much information about these creatures.\n- Well, here is the interesting part.\n- Information about dinosaurs has been gathered through fossils.\n- We know about dinosaurs from the clues left behind such as fossils of their teeth, bones, claws, footprints and even eggs.\nSo what are Fossils?\nFossils are the remains of a prehistoric plant or animal that have hardened into rock .\nHow are these Fossils Formed?\n- A fossil starts forming when a dead animal gets buried in sand or mud called sediment and the flesh and skin rot away but the bones remain. Over millions of years more and more sediment builds up in layers and gradually turns into stone.\n- The minerals in the stones seep through the holes in the bones and become hard turning the animal skeleton into a fossil.\n- Wow! Fascinating isn’t it?\n- The study of fossils is called paleontology (pronounced as pa-li-on-tol-uh-ji)\n- Scientists who study fossils are called palaeontologists.\nScientists split Dinosaurs into three main periods – Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous.\n1. The Triassic Period :\n- The Triassic Period (stated around 250 million years ago)\n- At the beginning of the Mesozoic era the continents were all joined together in a huge supercontinent called Pangea and was surrounded by a massive ocean called Panthalassa.\n- This period saw small meat eating dinosaurs like the Herrerasaurus (he-rair-a-sore-us) that walked on their hind legs and the Compsognathus (komp –sog-nay-thus).\n2. The Jurassic Period\n- The Jurassic Period (started around 200 million years ago)\n- In this period the one super continent Pangea began to split into two continents, the Gondwana and Laurasia. The continents drifted away taking animals with them forming different groups of dinosaurs.\n- This period saw some large dinosaurs.\n- Some of the dinosaurs of this period were Stegosaurus and Brachiosaurus.\n3. The Cretaceous Period\n- The Cretaceous Period (started around 145 million years ago and ended 65 million years ago)\n- During this period the continents kept drifting apart. Earth divided into the various continents we see today. Different landforms shaped on our earth.\n- This period included dinosaurs like Pentaceratops and Tyrannosaurus rex.\nLet’s take a look into the ‘Dinosaur World’ that existed millions of years ago. The ‘Dinosaur World’ was hot and sunny. There were areas of desert and forests of conifers and ferns. Many dinosaurs of different shapes and sizes roamed the Earth. They varied from the small, bird-like dinosaurs to the huge gigantic ones who lived on land.\nPlant Eating Dinosaurs :\n1. Sauropods :-\nSauropods were the largest plant eating dinosaurs (herbivores). They were found in the Jurassic period. There were various kinds of sauropods.\nThe largest of all were the long–necked Barosaurus (Barrow-sore-us), they were plant eaters and could nibble leaves from treetops as tall as a five-storey building. A long tail helped it maintain it’s balance.\n2. Saltasaurus :-\nThe slowest dinosaurs were sauropods like Saltasaurus (Sal-tah-sore-us). They had huge bodies and short legs.\n3. Apatosaurus :-\n(A-pat-oh-sore-us) were sauropods that ate large quantities of greenery everyday, they did not chew the tough plants before swallowing, instead they gulped stones that ground up the food in their stomach.\n4. Edmontonia :-\nThere were some who were ground grazers and did not munch on treetop leaves like the Edmontonia (ed-mon-toe-nee-a). These ate mainly ferns and mosses.\nThese plant-eating dinosaurs roamed in herds as they felt safe and were able to look for food and warn each other about any danger.\nMeat Eating Dinosaurs\n- These dinosaurs existed during the Cretaceous period. They were gigantic meat eaters and ruled the land.\n- Some of the largest flesh eating dinosaurs –\n1. Tyrannosaurus rex (Tie-ran-oh-sore-us-recks)\n2. Giganotosaurus (Jig-anno-toe-sore-us)\n- Some of the fish eating dinosaurs with a head like a crocodile –\n1. Suchomimus (Sue-koh-mime-us)\n2. Baryonyx ( Barry-on-icks)\nThe End of Dinosaurs\nNo one knows for sure how these creatures became extinct and died out from the face of the earth.\nSome scientists believe that a huge meteor hurtled through space and hit the earth in Central America forming a huge crater.\nThis meteor created a huge cloud of dust into the sky. It is believed the dust blocked out the sunlight for many years, the climate changed, it became very cold and many plants and animals died.\nSome believe that at the end of the Mesozoic era, there were volcanoes erupting, spurting out hot molten rock called lava. The lava and the poisonous dust and chemicals emitted out of the volcanoes blocked the sunlight making the Earth cold and killing most plants and animals.\n5 Interesting Facts about Dinosaurs\n- The Dinosaur Provincial Park in Canada is considered as the world’s greatest dinosaur graveyard as nearly 40 kinds of dinosaurs have been found here.\n- The dinosaur wall, in Utah (Western United States of America) has hundreds of dinosaur fossils on a ledge of sloping rock.\n- The desert climate in Central Asia is considered perfect for preserving fossils.\n- Some of the best preserved dinosaur trackways are in Australia.\n- Scientists divided dinosaurs into two groups according to the shape of their hip bones. They were called lizard hipped or saurischian and bird hipped or ornithischian.\nGet more Information:\n- 10 Interesting Facts about Dinosaurs, visit: http://mocomi.com/fun-facts-about-dinosaurs/","posted on 22 July 2016\nfrom The Conversation\nSixty six million years ago, the dinosaurs suddenly disappeared, along with most of the species on the planet. The extinction occurred at precisely the same time that a giant asteroid struck the Earth. The fact that the two events happened at the same time makes it all but certain that the asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs, but just how did that extinction happen? Was it dust, shot into the sky, blocking out the sun? Acid rain produced by sulphur vaporised during the impact? An inferno of hot debris?\nA new study may get us closer to solving this mystery. The asteroid struck the Yucatan Peninsula, a region with vast quantities of crude oil buried underground. New data shows that the burning of the oil produced billions of tons of soot, enough to dim the sun for years and lead to a decade of global cooling.\nThe Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event was severe, wiping out over 75% of all species, including not just dinosaurs but also many birds, mammals, snakes, lizards, plants, and even insects. It was global, hitting all continents and all oceans. And it was rapid, with species seeming to vanish overnight.\nDeep impact Shutterstock\nIn 1979, physicist Luis Alvarez was trying to figure out just how much time the extinction took. He focused on a thin layer of clay - the K-Pg boundary - that marked the extinction. His clever idea was to look at iridium levels in the boundary clay. Iridium is a rare metal found primarily in meteorites, so the slow trickle of iridium from meteorites burning up in the atmosphere should act as a sort of cosmic hourglass, telling the passing of time.\nHis plan backfired spectacularly: iridium levels in the clay were orders of magnitude above the normal background levels. The K-Pg boundary was the debris of a giant asteroid impact. A few calculations suggested that it would take an asteroid 10 kilometres across to produce all that iridium. The idea that an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs was widely ridiculed - but then, in 1990, the giant Chicxulub crater in Mexico was discovered.\nBut how does an asteroid impact in Mexico cause a worldwide extinction? Alvarez read about the 1815 explosion of Tamboro. Sulphate gas shot into the atmosphere caused a volcanic haze that reflected sunlight. It lead to the \"Year Without a Summer\", when freezing temperatures in summer lead to widespread crop failures and famine. Alvarez proposed that debris from Chicxulub had blocked out the sun. Without the sun, plants and plankton couldn't make food and the entire ecosystem starved.\nIt was a clever idea but studies of the K-Pg boundary revealed a problem. The debris was mostly coarse and would have dropped out out of the sky in a matter of a few months or weeks - not long enough to starve giant dinosaurs. There wasn't enough fine debris that could stay aloft for years to cause an extinction. So what did?\nOil field on fire Jonas Jordan/Wikimedia Commons\nA new study by Kunio Kaiho and colleagues published in the journal Scientific Reports suggests a possible explanation. The K-Pg boundary contains soot. Although originally thought to be produced by wildfires, studies of its chemistry suggest that it is actually derived from burning hydrocarbons (crude oil). This fact seems puzzling until you consider that the Gulf of Mexico contains vast oil reserves. The Jurassic Cantarell oil field, the largest in Mexico, is nearby and, in fact, the Chicxulub crater was only discovered because geologists were mapping the area in search of oil.\nAs the Chicxulub asteroid tore into the earth, it released the oil locked in the rock. The Deepwater Horizon spill produced 4.9 million barrels of oil from just a tiny hole in the ocean floor. The Chicxulub crater was 180 kilometers across. The intense heat of the impact would have burned the oil to create clouds of black soot and shot them into the stratosphere. Critically, tiny soot particles can stay up in the atmosphere for years. But was there enough to block out the sun?\nThe researchers from Tohoku University in Japan studied the chemistry of soot at the K-Pg boundary and then estimated the amount of soot produced by impact. The total burned carbon produced was on the order of 1.8 to 60 billion tons.\nDark and cold\nThey then used computer models to estimate the effects on the climate. Their models showed that the soot would have been highly effective in blocking light. Depending on the amount of soot, sunlight would have been reduced by 50% to 90%, and the global temperature would have cooled by between 6°C and 18°C, with cooling being especially severe towards the poles. Cooler temperatures would have also reduced rainfall, leading to widespread drought.\nCritically, the soot cloud would stay aloft for years. The darkness and cooling were most severe in the first few years, but it would have taken a decade for light levels to slowly return to normal, and even longer for the climate to return to normal.\nThe research also helps put a time limit on the dinosaur extinction, suggesting the bulk of it took place in a span of less than ten years.\nIt's probably too soon to say that we have definitively solved the extinction puzzle. Science is rarely that neat and tidy. The nature of science is that, at best, we need to run more analyses and collect more data to confirm new finds, and at worst, it's full of seemingly promising dead ends.\nBut the new study is one of the most exciting developments in years, and it suggests that we may be closer to finally understanding the extinction of the dinosaurs. It may be that their extinction was caused by pollution and climate change caused by burning oil.\nThis could also explain why other asteroid impacts aren't associated with mass extinctions. It may have been the unlucky coincidence of a huge oil field and a giant asteroid impact that made Chicxulub so deadly. And there is a certain irony in the possibility that the same oil that did in the dinosaurs is now being used to run our own civilization - and perhaps threatening it as well.\n>>>>> Scroll down to view and make comments <<<<<<\nThis Web Page by Steven Hansen ---- Copyright 2010 - 2016 Econintersect LLC - all rights reserved"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7584ffee-4d4b-40fc-91da-9ef0910fbaf9>","<urn:uuid:2deb5c75-6324-410c-8c4d-850bd3cad0dc>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What were the specific staging requirements for performing Stockhausen's Susani's Echo for alto flute?","answer":"According to the instructions for Susani's Echo, the performer must play in darkness, face away from the audience, and wear a nude-colored bodysuit made of lustrous material. Additionally, there should be a spotlight positioned above the performer to create the effect of a pallid moon, as if the performance was taking place on the reedy shore of a lake.","context":["UPDATE: Videos are ready! Check out the 'Gallery' section for links.\nI recently performed a solo recital at the Whitworth Art Gallery. This was my programme:\n15 November 2015\nWhitworth Art Gallery - Grand Hall\nSelf Portrait for flute & wind anemometer Alvin Lucier\nLes Folies d'Espagne Marin Marais\n(Arr. Hans-Peter Schmitz) (1656 – 1728)\nTango Etude No. 3 Astor Piazzolla\n(1921 - 1992)\nPartita in A minor, BWV 1031 J.S. Bach\n(1685 – 1750)\nThe Dance Along the Artery Larry Goves\nSusani’s Echo for Alto Flute Karlheinz Stockhausen\n(1928 – 2007)\nSelf Portrait Alvin Lucier\nI chose my programme as an exploration into solo flute music intended for or created by movement.\nAlvin Lucier’s Self-Portrait is one of a set of three works which explore the directivity of sound waves from musical instruments. The performer is to place a wind anemometer (a device used to measure wind speed) several feet away from their face, with a light shining through it on the opposite side to the performer. The light is used to cast shadows across the performer's face - and the performer can choose how much or how little to show of themselves based on their wind speed. The auditory decisions are left up to the performer and the resulting physical actions create a unique combination of sights and sounds.\nI made the naive assumption that finding a wind anemometer would be a fairly easy task - I thought Amazon Prime could sort it for me. However, apparently modern wind anemometers are digital and I needed one that had large, sensitive blades and could stand up on its own, meaning I'd need a vintage one. I scoured eBay and found most of them were located in Germany or The Netherlands. Panic stations! I obsessively checked for new vintage wind anemometer listings, and with great luck I found one in North Wales! By this time, it was the day before my recital so I set off immediately to fetch it from a lovely gentleman who, apart from being a semi-pro rugby player and primary school teacher, sells antiques from his garage. I felt like a huntress bringing her prey back to the den (or in this case, the practice room). A photo from rehearsal:\nI chose Marin Marais Les Folies d’Espagne, Piazolla Tango Etude No. 3, and JS Bach Partita in A minor to provide a basis for the exploration into music composed for/created by movement, since they were all composed for specific practices.\nLarry Goves’ The Dance Along the Artery is part of an ongoing collaborative project exploring how observing and learning about the Dalcroze Eurhythmics method might inform an approach to composition. The piece has, at its core, a very simple physical limitation; it only features fingerings that either use all the fingers, all the fingers of the left hand, all the fingers of right hand or no fingers at all. In addition, the performer has to alter separately the embouchure, dynamic of key clicks, articulation, and sound dynamic. The variations on these elements of playing the flute and finger patterns produce an strong visual element to the performance. Larry wrote the piece for me this past summer and I premiered it at the Second International Conference of Dalcroze Studies, Vienna, in July. I had my Whitworth recital professionally filmed and when watching it back, I was struck by how different it was to watch it than to play it. That might sound obvious but the finger patterns came across much more than I realised. I'll have a video up here soon!\nSusani’s Echo is the solo version of a duet between the alto flute and basset-horn from Montag aus Licht, from Stockhausen’s opera cycle Licht: The Seven Days of the Week. The performance includes physical staging, melodies filled with swirling tendrils and micro-tones, articulated by rushing noise-glissandi, tongue-clicks, wind tremolo, key-clatter, flutter-tongue, and whispered numbers up to 13. The instructions state that the performer is to play in darkness, facing away from the audience, wearing a nude-coloured bodysuit of lustrous material, and to have a spotlight of a pallid moon above the performer, as if she was playing this on the reedy shore of a lake. Now, that's a fairly tall order in this venue! I did manage to do all of these things in my International Artist Diploma recital at the RNCM last February. I had an artist create for me a reedy lake shore and had it projected above me and I managed to stop eating puddings and do sit ups every evening for two weeks in preparation for the bodysuit debut. For Whitworth, I did a simpler version of asking a friend to switch off the lights, donning a shimmery cardigan, sitting atop a table, and using a desklamp to create a moon effect. Luckily I kept my balance, the table didn't break, and the light cast some pretty gnarly shadows!\nThe Whitworth is such a wonderful venue and it was great to try this combination of pieces to help explore what a solo flute recital can offer (not to mention, test my stamina and balance!)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9660f280-5d26-415e-99b4-d55f82815a90>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm tracking food trends. How do yellow pea milk and almond milk compare in terms of protein content?","answer":"Yellow pea milk (Ripple) contains 8g of protein per serving, which is the same as dairy milk and significantly higher than almond milk, which contains just 1 gram of protein per serving. This low protein content in almond milk is surprising given that almonds themselves are high in protein - a single serving of almond milk contains fewer than four actual almonds, as it is largely composed of filtered water.","context":["For one Silicon Valley startup, yellow peas are milk’s future\nShare this article\nNEW YORK, Sept 13 — In recent years, alternative sources of milk have begun to disrupt the dairy industry, from soy to almond to rice. The latest contender for space in your refrigerator is milk made from yellow peas.\nIn 2015, sales of dairy milk decreased by 7 per cent (US$17.8 billion or RM74.8 billion), and they are projected to fall an additional 11 per cent through 2020, according to market intelligence agency Mintel. Meanwhile, Bloomberg has reported that almond milk sales rose 250 per cent from 2011 to 2015.\nBut there are barriers to mainstream adoption: Soy milk can taste chalky, and soy beans are notorious for being genetically modified. Almond milk, despite its high-protein reputation, has only one-eighth the protein of dairy milk and requires huge amounts of water to produce. Rice milk has a pleasant enough flavour but is also low in protein.\nEnter Ripple, a new line of dairy products powered by US$44 million from Google and Silicon Valley venture capitalists. Since it launched in April 2016, the company has sold 2.5 million bottles of product and generated US$20 million in revenue, using milk made from simple yellow peas. The vegetable is inexpensive to grow and also produces a surprisingly clean taste.\nThe duo behind this plant-based milk is a formidable team. Adam Lowry is a co-founder of eco-minded cleaning line Method, which generated revenue of more than US$100 million when he sold it to Ecover, a Belgian company, in 2012. Neil Renninger helped build Amyris Biotechnologies, which uses technology to create renewable fuels, which started with a grant from the Gates Foundation; he has also been an entrepreneur-in-residence at the Menlo Park VC firm, Khosla Ventures.\nIn 2014, the two friends saw an opportunity to change the dairy industry. “The food system represents 20 per cent of the world’s carbon emissions, and dairy is one-quarter of that,” said Renninger via telephone. “The impact is massive. More than beef, more than chicken, dairy is actually the largest contributor to emissions by volume. That challenge scratched my sustainability itch.”\nLowry and Renninger began searching for a product that would simultaneously taste better and be more eco-friendly than existing alternate milks. They maintain that food businesses don’t spend a lot of money on research and development to create better products. “Their idea of innovation is a brand extension,” said Renninger. “We saw huge potential for impact — a lot of white space in the world of food innovation through technology.”\n“What we did is use technology to create really good food,” reported Lowry. “The world has recognised that we need to go more plant-based. You see it in the burger world with products like the [meatless] Impossible Burger. But most plant food sucks, particularly in the alternate dairy space. It’s low in protein, thin, and chalky.”\nUsing Renninger’s technology, they began to experiment extracting protein from different plants that had a notable amount of the biomolecules. “You name it, we screened it,” says Renninger. Most of them tasted terrible.\nThen the pair tried yellow peas, which are inexpensive to grow and don’t yield a strongly flavoured product. The result was a drink that has a hint of concentrated powdered milk taste and a smooth, creamy texture.\n“It’s not that we have the only pea milk on the market; what makes us unique is that, thanks to technology, we have the purest plant protein in the world,” says Renninger.\nThe milk made from yellow peas also delivers the same amount of protein as those from cows (8g per serving, comparable to soy milk but much higher than almond milk). But what really sets Ripple apart from other alternative milks is its eco footprint.\nAccording to their research, each 48-ounce bottle of Ripple (made from 100 per cent post-consumer recycled material) represents a savings of 3.5 pounds (1.6kg) of carbon dioxide emissions and 925 gallons (3,501 litres) of water, versus dairy milk. The 2.5 million bottles Ripple has sold adds up to nearly seven million fewer pounds of CO2 emissions — the equivalent of taking more than 600 cars off the road for a year. And getting the same amount of protein from almond milk would require 66 billion gallons of additional water.\nCurrently, five kinds of Ripple milk are on sale at such places as Whole Foods and Target Corp stores: Original unsweetened milk is the best seller, along with flavours like chocolate milk and vanilla milk, plus half-and-half and kids’ packs. Meanwhile, Ripple is expanding its product base: This winter, the brand will enter the burgeoning yogurt business with a plant-based, Greek style yogurt.\nThe flavours will range from vanilla to blueberry and strawberry — “plus some dessert-oriented flavours,” added Lowry. “We’re playing with flavours like maple and key lime.” Yogurt is a logical step for Ripple, putting it solidly in the snack category. “Only 14 per cent of people who buy non-dairy milk are lactose intolerant. Most consumers do it to be greener. That trend is only going to get bigger,” said Renninger.\nAnd though the toughest challenge is still getting people to try it, the cost of yellow-pea milk may currently be too much for cost-conscious consumers to ignore. (At US$5.99, a quart is about a dollar more expensive than soy milk and about 30 per cent pricier than organic dairy milk). But Renninger is looking into the future. “In a couple years, we’ll be able to make liquid milk for less than the cost of milk,” he said. — Bloomberg","Almond milk is flying off the shelves.\nIt's now America's favorite alternative to dairy milk by a massive margin, easily overshadowing choices like soy milk, coconut milk and rice milk. According to Nielsen, almond milk sales grew by 250 percent between 2011 and 2016.\nCow's milk is as American as apple pie, but as plant-based diets continue to become more mainstream in our culture, many have abandoned it. Almond milk looks and tastes similar to cow's milk, and almonds have long been associated with a plethora of health benefits. But is the healthiness of almond milk grossly overestimated by the general public?\nWhen it comes to almond milk brands, White Wave is king. The company—which produces both the Silk and So Delicious lines of almond milk—did nearly $94 million of almond milk sales in 2016. That makes them the most popular almond milk company in America.\nWith that, let's dive into the nutrition facts for Silk Original Almondmilk. A one cup serving contains 60 calories, 2.5 grams of fat, 0 grams of saturated fat, 35mg of potassium, 8 grams of carbohydrate, less than a gram of fiber, 7 grams of sugar and 1 gram of protein. It also contains 45% of your daily calcium, 25% of your daily vitamin D and 20% of your daily vitamin E.\nSilk Organic Original Almondmilk possesses almost identical nutritional facts (albeit with significantly less calcium). Silk Unsweetened Almondmilk also possesses similar nutritional facts, but with 30 calories, 0 grams of sugar and less than a gram of carbohydrate per serving.\nSuch varieties of almond milk contain significantly less calories than cow's milk (a cup of whole milk contains 148 calories while a cup of skim milk contains 83 calories). If you simply begin using a cup of unsweetened almond milk with your morning cereal in place of a cup of whole milk, you'll instantly cut out 826 calories a week.\nHigh amounts of calcium, vitamin D and vitamin E are all pluses. Calcium is crucial for building strong bones and maintaining healthy heart, nerve and muscle function. Vitamin D plays an important role in bone health, but it also has a big impact on athletic performance (and many people are unknowingly deficient in it). Vitamin E helps prevent plaque from developing inside your arteries and helps the body make red blood cells.\nBut almond milk is low in one important nutrient commonly associated with cow's milk—protein. Protein is a powerhouse nutrient. It can help curb overeating by keeping you fuller for longer. High-quality protein provides the amino acids muscles need to repair and rebuild, allowing you to recover from exercise and get stronger over time. The body can also use protein as a source of energy.\nMost almond milks contain just 1 gram of protein per serving (both whole and skim milk contain 8 grams per serving). Kinda strange considering that almonds themselves are known as an awesome source of protein, right? Well, here's the thing—almond milk actually contains very little almonds. A serving of 23 almonds (1 oz.) contains 6 grams of protein. That means that one serving of almond milk (which has just 1 gram of protein) contains less than four actual almonds. In reality, almond milk is largely composed of filtered water.\nAside from protein, sugar can be a concern when it comes to almond milk. If you're looking for the absolute healthiest form of almond milk, you'd be wised to go for an unsweetened, unflavored variety. Unsweetened almond milk contains zero grams of sugar. Therefore, we can conclude that the sugar content in sweetened almond milk is of the \"added\" variety. Sweetened, unflavored almond milks usually contain about 7 grams of added sugar per serving. Not terrible, but not ideal. But flavored varieties (such as vanilla or chocolate) of almond milk often contain 16-22 grams of added sugar per serving—a downright dreadful amount.\nAdded sugar is perhaps the biggest issue in the modern American diet. \"Added sugars contribute additional calories and zero nutrients to food,\" the American Heart Association states. \"Over the past 30 years, Americans have steadily consumed more and more added sugars in their diets, which has contributed to the obesity epidemic.\" Diets high in added sugar have been linked to obesity, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, tooth decay and even cancer. The AHA recommends a daily limit of 24 grams of added sugar per day for women and 36 grams per day for men, but the average American consumes a whopping 88 grams of added sugar per day. If your almond milk is packed with added sugar, it's not a healthy choice.\nOne other concern to keep in mind is carrageenan, a potentially dangerous ingredient we've covered previously. Some almond milks do contain carrageenan, but many do not. To check out what products do and do not contain carrageenan, check out this guide from the Cornucopia Institute.\nAlmond milk does possess a clear advantage over cow's milk for the many people who are unable to properly digest the latter. Issues such as lactose intolerance, a milk allergy or sensitivity to A1 casein are all reasons why an otherwise healthy person may struggle to digest dairy milk. For such folks, products like almond milk can be a godsend.\nSo, is almond milk actually healthy? It's hard to give a definitive answer on this one. If you're looking to cut down on calories and added sugar and aren't overly concerned about protein content, unsweetened almond milk can certainly be considered a healthy beverage option. It's also high in calcium, vitamin D and vitamin E. Is it better for you than cow's milk? That's debatable, but it really depends on the individual.\nHowever, flavored varieties stuffed with added sugar just aren't a wise choice. Not only do they make it easy to consume large amounts of added sugar quickly, but they don't have enough protein or fiber to help balance things out.\nIf you're someone who's looking to move away from cow's milk, there's no harm in giving almond milk a shot. Just make sure you're checking out the sugar content before you buy, and realize that you need to find additional protein sources to make up for what you're missing by nixing cow's milk.\nPhoto Credit: bhofack2/iStock, pashapixel/iStock\n- Is Halo Top Ice Cream Actually Healthy?\n- Got (Almond) Milk?

{"question":"What major challenge would an alien civilization face when trying to gather intelligence about Earth before a potential attack?","answer":"The major challenge is the intelligence lag created by the finite speed of light. Due to the enormous interstellar distances, any information collected would be significantly outdated by the time the attacking civilization arrives. For instance, if civilizations are on average 200 light years apart, there would be at least a 400-year lag time - 200 years for signals to reach the attackers and 200 more years for them to travel to the target, even at near light speed.","context":["People have expressed concern regarding the broadcast of powerful electromagnetic signals into space and deliberate attempts to contact extraterrestrial intelligences. The reason for such concern is that extraterrestrial intelligences could be hostile to humanity as they might see Earth as an attractive exploitable resource or the growth of human technology might be perceived as a threat to their future safety. British theoretical physicist Dr. Stephen Hawking states: “We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn’t want to meet. I imagine they might exist in massive ships, having used up all the resources from their home planet. Such advanced aliens would perhaps become nomads, looking to conquer and colonize whatever planets they can reach… If aliens ever visit us, I think the outcome would be much as when Christopher Columbus first landed in America, which didn’t turn out very well for the Native Americans.”\nIn recent years, the technologies used to detect new planets and humanity’s ability to find alien life has improved dramatically. As the possibility of finding extraterrestrial life catches up with science fiction, the question of whether extraterrestrial intelligences are likely to be “friend or foe” seems increasingly pertinent. In a paper written by Janne M. Korhonen from Aalto University in Finland, the author suggests that conflicts between extraterrestrial intelligences are very unlikely and also examines a number of factors that would deter such conflicts from taking place. The author assumes that extraterrestrial intelligences are rational and have a concept of risks and benefits.\nA major problem for any extraterrestrial civilization that might launch an attack involves knowing what to attack in the first place. Gathering information about another civilization over interstellar distances is going to be extremely difficult and full of uncertainty. Due to the finite speed of light, it takes many years for electromagnetic radiation to travel the enormous interstellar distances that separate individual planetary systems. As a result, whatever information that is collected by a potential aggressor is likely to be outdated by the time the attacking civilization arrives at the target civilization. If the Milky Way galaxy contains one million randomly distributed extraterrestrial civilizations, then the average minimum distance separating one civilization from another is ~200 light years. This creates an intelligence lag of at least 400 years because it takes 200 year for signals from the target civilization to arrive at the attacking civilization and another 200 years or more for the attacking civilization to travel at near the speed of light to the target civilization. The huge lag time can provide ample opportunity for the target civilization to develop some retaliatory capabilities and also allows the target civilization to establish contacts with other civilizations.\nThe rise of human civilization is only a very recent phenomenon in Earth’s history. Given that the galaxy is billions of years old and considering how much human civilization has progressed in just the last century alone, any extraterrestrial civilization is very unlikely to be at the same level of technology as human civilization. Instead, any extraterrestrial civilization is going to be significantly more advance. Assuming an exponential growth of technology, it is hard to imagine a civilization that is a billion, a million or even a thousand years ahead. A civilization that is technologically able to detect signs of another civilization for the first time will deduce that the detected civilization is already far ahead of theirs.\nDetectable signs of an extraterrestrial civilization such as electromagnetic transmissions and signatures of mega-scale engineering projects cannot be reliably used to gauge that civilization’s level of technological development. This is because a hyper-advanced civilization can still use old and obsolete technologies simply for recreational or educational purposes. Furthermore, if a hyper-advanced civilization believes that hostile civilizations can develop, it can create “baits” that mimic less advance civilizations to lure out hostile civilizations and pre-emptively attack them.\nIf an aggressive civilization were to launch an attack on another civilization, it will be nearly impossible for the aggressor to be certain that it will not face retaliation. Survival of some form of the victim civilization is very likely, especially if the victim civilization has self-sustaining off-world colonies that can easily evaded detection. Just a few survivors from the victim civilization can grow to billions of individuals in a few hundred years assuming a growth rate of one percent per year by human standards. It is uncertain if survivors from the victim civilization will subsequently launch a retaliatory strike. Nevertheless, as long as there are survivors, the attacking civilization cannot completely discount the possibility of a subsequent retaliatory strike.\nEven if the attacking civilization completely eliminates the victim civilization, there is always a possibility that the attack may be noticed by other extraterrestrial civilizations. These other civilizations can also include off-shoot colonies of the victim civilization and even the attacking civilization itself. A civilization that launches an unprovoked attack on another civilization is likely to be seen as a danger by other civilizations as well. One or more of these other civilizations may launch a pre-emptive strike on the attacking civilization to eliminate the danger it poses.\nAttacking another extraterrestrial civilization for the purpose of resource exploitation is also very unlikely to occur. The reason is that distances involved in interstellar spaceflight are so enormous that the resources required to travel to another planetary system is likely to vastly outweigh any returns. For example, transporting a 1000 ton payload across interstellar space at just 10 percent the speed of light would require at least as much energy as the current annual energy consumption of the entire human civilization. Long before achieving the overwhelmingly more difficult feat of interstellar spaceflight, an extraterrestrial civilization is likely to already have technologies that allow full recycling of its resources which alleviates the need for any further exploitation. As a result, an extraterrestrial civilization with a mastery of interstellar spaceflight is unlikely to attack another civilization since the gain of all resources from a single planet would be trivial. The risk of future retaliation from survivors or witnesses is also expected to greatly outweigh any benefit.\nIt seems that any attack launched by an extraterrestrial civilization on another is a dangerous gamble for the attacker. An extraterrestrial civilization is unlikely to attack another civilization because the benefit of not attacking is expected to outweigh any benefit derived from an attack. Studies also show that “pacifistic” civilizations tend to perform better than aggressive ones in the long run. Unfortunately, the arguments put forth here are obviously limited since humanity’s own history serves as the only source of reasoning. Any extraterrestrial intelligence is going to have a reasoning process which differs from ours. Besides, extraterrestrial intelligences that are far ahead of human civilization may be entirely incomprehensible.\nEven though the threat of an attack by an extraterrestrial civilization appears irrational and very unlikely, a certain amount of caution should still be taken. The design and operation of an interstellar spacecraft can potentially be seen as a threat by another extraterrestrial civilization. For example, a planetary system can be home to an advance civilization and still appear uninhabited because the civilization chooses to remain undetectable. An interstellar spacecraft sent from Earth may accidentally crash into one of the civilization’s planets and cause massive damage. That is not hard to imagine because a 100 ton interstellar spacecraft travelling at just 10 percent the speed of light can release a comparable amount of energy upon impact as humanity’s entire nuclear arsenal. Such an incident can cause the extraterrestrial civilization to strike back at Earth to prevent further “attacks”. As a result, any mission which involves sending an interstellar spacecraft to explore another planetary system must ensure that the planetary system is uninhabited or that the spacecraft will not appear to pose any danger to an extraterrestrial civilization that may reside in the planetary system.\nJanne M.Korhonen, “MAD with aliens?

{"question":"How can Ravintsara and Ravensara essential oils be distinguished and what should consumers check on supplement labels?","answer":"Ravintsara (Cinnamomum camphora) and Ravensara (Ravensara aromatica) can be distinguished through their chemical profiles - Ravintsara has high levels of cineole while Ravensara contains methyl eugenol or methyl chavicol depending on the plant part used. When checking supplement labels, consumers should look for: the complete Latin name, plant part used, country of origin, standardization details, and concentration. Labels should also be examined for 'Other Ingredients' to avoid unnecessary synthetic additives, preservatives and fillers. Additionally, consumers should be wary of proprietary blends which may contain mostly cheaper substances, and verify the manufacturer follows GMP standards and conducts third-party testing.","context":["A Study in Identity Confusion and Confliction\nBy Jeanne Rose – Summer 2021\nIntroduction ~ Ravintsara #163, Cinnamomum camphora, is organically grown and not to be confused with Ravensara. Ravensara (Ravensara aromatica) and Ravintsara (Cinnamomum camphora) are two essential oils distilled from 2 very different trees, often misnamed from two separate botanical family, as well as two different countries. The leaves and wood of the tree are used for different essential oils and often also have different names. It is imperative that all who use essential oils, and any company that sells them, begin to label these oils using both common and scientific name, as well as part of the plant used, and country of origin.\nNAMING AND DESCRIPTION ARE CONFUSING.\nNaming & Background ~ Cinnamomum camphora, the tree, has different oils with different names depending upon whether you are talking about leaves or wood and whether you are discussing the tree from Madagascar or elsewhere. The leaves of the tree from Madagascar, CT cineole, are called Ravintsara and they are used in products as an application for fatigue, and postpartum infections. The essential oil from the leaves/stem, and bark has different therapeutic benefits. Often, it seems, when using the term C. camphora, camphor laurel, we are talking about the tree that grows in China and whose seeds have been studied as an anti-bacterial and whose wood is distilled and releases a solid, white, waxy substance called ‘camphor’.\nNames and part and country as follows:\nCinnamomum camphora, CT cineole, leaves, Madagascar is Ravintsara oil\nCinnamomum camphora, CT linalool, leaves, China is Ho leaf oil.\nCinnamomum camphora, CT linalool, wood, China is Ho Wood oil\nCinnamomum camphora, CT linalool, wood and leaves, China is Shiu oil\nCinnamomum camphora, CT camphor, wood, China is called white camphor, yellow camphor, and other names.\nRavensara aromatica, CT methyl eugenol, leaves, Madagascar is Ravensara or Hazomanitra oil.\nRavensara aromatica, CT methyl chavicol, bark, Madagascar, is Anise wood oil aka Ravensara anisata.\nSometimes the leaves are picked with stems and when distilled, have that anise-scent of R. aromatica type anisata, bark, Madagascar is called Anise wood oil, and called Ravensara anisata. –– this from Material review 2005 [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hector-\nAlso, some scientific sources call this tree and another, Ravenala madagascariensis which is family Strelitziaceae, a palm-type tree. There is much confusion and Ravensara aromatica (the old name) is still confusing in the literature. Ravenala madagascariensis Sonn. (Family STRELITZIACEAE), a palm tree whose leaves are used for asthma and the stem used for hypertension.\nI remember these essential oils by scent and even that has changed over the years.\nFamily ~ Family Lauraceae – Cinnamomum camphora – Ravintsara. The essential oil of leaves, Cineole type, from the Madagascar tree is commercially known as ravintsara. The leaves are steam-distilled and depending upon terroir there are different chemical families represented. The main ones are linalool and cineole. This tree with a common name of Camphor laurel has different names depending upon the six different chemical variants called chemotypes. These are camphor, linalool, 1,8-cineole, nerolidol, safrole, and borneol.\nCountries of Origin ~ Ravintsara is a product of Madagascar.\nEndangered – Probably, it depends upon to whom you are speaking and what plant and plant part they are discussing. Even in the scientific literature, often the plant part being discussed is missing as evidenced from many articles in the literature as well as any book discussing essential oils.\nIf you are using the leaves only of the R. aromatica, the tree itself is not endangered; however, if you are using the bark of this same tree [but called R. anisata], this tree is endangered.\nGeneral Description of Plant habitat and Growth and Confusion ~ I am unable to provide a proper description of the tree, only that at this writing this essential oil still causes confusion. “Obtained from the leaves of a tree (Cinnamomum camphora (L.) J. Presl), which was introduced from Taiwan as an ornamental tree and now grown widely in Madagascar and with increased demand from the international market. This essential oil has often been misreported and traded as ravensara, or Ravensara aromatica. The true ravensara (R. aromatica) essential oil is extracted from the leaves of an endemic species locally known as “havozo,’ or “hazomanitra, which means “aromatic tree” in the Malagasy language.”1\n“Another source of confusion with Ravensara species is that R. aromatica and R. anisata (a synonym for R. aromatica) were considered different species producing different essential oils, whereas the plants were one and the same. Both essential oils come from the same plant, but the oil of R. anisata usually refers to the bark oil of R. aromatica (rich in methyl chavicol), while the essential oil of the true R. aromatica is extracted from the leaves. The species that was first described by Sonnerat was further renamed as R. anisata by Danguy.”2\nPORTION OF PLANT USED IN EXTRACTION AND YIELDS ~ Ravintsara Essential Oil is steam distilled from leaves of Cinnamomum camphora CT cineole in Madagascar during the months of September through December. The bark yields another product. Always carefully analyze the odor of the essential oil as there are certainly different grades and scents. Wood, leaf, bark produce different essential oil by SD. See above.\nYield ~ I was unable to find the specific yield of essential oil of leaf of Cinnamomum camphora from Madagascar.\nThe chemical composition of R. aromatica bark is in all cases characterized by a high amount of methyl chavicol (83–98%), whatever the chemotype.\nORGANOLEPTICS ~ The organoleptic, physical, and chemical profiles of the essential oils of ravintsara (C. camphora) and ravensara (R. aromatica) oils showed that both essential oils can also easily be differentiated using chemical fingerprinting. It has been proposed that new standards for their botanical and essential oil authentication and species identification be written.\nRavintsara – Cinnamomum camphora CT cineole, leaves, Madagascar\nColor – colorless\nClarity – clear\nScent Intensity – 6\nTaste – bitter and aromatic\nTenacity – very good\nDescription of scent – The leaf oil is herbaceous, woody, spicy, and green and more suitable to therapeutics than perfumery.\nAroma Description – Ravintsara has an odor much like Eucalyptus due to the same chemical component of Cineol. It is pleasant and refreshing, fruity, herbaceous, and spicy. Waft the scent enough times to remember it by its odor.\nGENERAL PROPERTIES of Ravintsara CT cineole\nProperties of Ravintsara ~ This essential oil is considered anticatarrhal, decongestant, and expectorant. It is helpful and useful for rhinitis, pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis (by inhalation).\nBLENDING RAVINTSARA FOR PURPOSE ~ This robust and pleasant oil is best used in blends for the respiratory system and in massage blends, to refresh and uplift the body. It blends well with herbaceous oils such as Rosemary and Marjoram, the citrus oils such as Lemon and Bergamot, and spicy oils. Included in this list are some resins and some grasses such as Frankincense and Palmarosa. Try very tiny amounts in perfumery to make the perfume sparkle.\n>Formula for rhinitis ~ For perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR), the essential oils of Ravintsara, Geranium, (Pelargonium graveolens), Eucalyptus and Niaouli, used together, release their decongestant, tonic, and anti-infectious properties, and can be used in a base of saline solution and rosemary hydrosol, and provide great benefits in case of a blocked nose, (loss of sense of smell), and irritation of the ear, nose, throat (ENT) tract.3\n1 oz Rosemary hydrosol\n+ 1 oz double strength saline solution*\n+ 3 drops Ravintsara (Cinnamomum camphora, CT cineole, leaves, Madagascar is Ravintsara oil\n+ 1 drop each of (Frankincense or Rose Geranium), Niaouli, and Eucalyptus.\nPlace all in a 2 oz nasal spray bottle, shake vigorously to use.\n*[Double strength saline solution is made by bringing to a boil 1 cup of water covered for 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Add 1 t. salt and a pinch of baking soda. Stir until dissolved. Store in the refrigerator no more than 2-days.]\n>Another formula for rhinitis is the inhalation of a combination of EO that include Sandalwood, Ravensara aromatica, and Frankincense.2\n>Sore throat Formula ~ For the beginning of a sore throat, I have used Ravintsara, a drop on a sugar cube, to slowly dissolve in my mouth. I have found this to be very helpful.\nHERBAL ~ A tea of the leaves of Cinnamomum camphora in Madagascar is used for fatigue and post-partum infection.\nChemistry and Components ~ We have discussed this in the beginning. It is important for the consumer to look at the GCMS; if you want Ravintsara it must be from Madagascar and have high levels of cineol, 50-70%. The scent will help guide you. I have seen a product called this name (from a well-known essential oil company) that had a high percentage of linalool and that is NOT Ravintsara but Ho Leaf oil.\nKey Uses ~ Ravintsara is the oil of the Respiratory system. Just like the citrine in the opening photo, ravintsara is a powerful cleanser.\n- Searching for the Real Ravensara (Ravensara aromatica Sonn.) Essential Oil.

The essential oil extracted from the leaves is used in aromatherapy. Previous chemical studies have generated some confusion about the chemical composition of this essential oil. To eliminate this uncertainty, we undertook a systematic evaluation of the chemical composition of essential oils from leaves of this species. The study focused on 28 individual samples formally identified as R. aromatica. The essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC and GC–MS. It was possible to distinguish four groups of trees through principal components analysis and agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis of the seven chief molecules identified in their essential oils. Two groups were characterized by a prevalence of compounds with an aromatic structure: methyl chavicol (representing more than 90% of the essential oil) in the first group and methyl eugenol (74–82%) in the second group. The predominant compounds of the other two groups proved to be of the monoterpene type: α-terpinene (25–28%) and limonene (15–22%) in the third group, while sabinene (25–34%), linalool (7–21%) and terpinen-4-ol (6–12%) were the primary constituents of the essential oils in the fourth group. The importance of these results for the commercial production of the essential oils from this species is discussed. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Understanding the standards of the industry and decoding the labels on products can allow consumers make healthier choices.\nNot all Supplements are created equal\nOften consumers will follow the old adage “you get what you pay for” or rely on a brand they trust for products other than supplements. There are ways of distinguishing product quality so that you don’t have to simply go by a price tag, website, advertisement or salesclerk advice.\nInvestigate the “Other Ingredients”. There often have to be some other ingredients, to help lubricate the machine, bind tablets or encapsulate the product. Additives like synthetic colors, preservatives and fillers are certainly not necessary. Also, for chewable vitamins, look to see what the flavorings and sweeteners are. A small amount of fruit or alcohol sugars are a better choice than other artificial sweeteners.\nBe wary of Proprietary Blends. Blends allow sellers be ambiguous about the amounts of each ingredient, often times leading to large amounts of the cheaper substances and small amounts of more expensive ones. The ingredients must still be listed in order by weight, which will help distinguish what is more plentiful in the supplement.\nCheck out the source. Forms of vitamins can greatly affect efficacy and absorption. For example, calcium carbonate is a cheaper and less bioavailable version of calcium than Calcium citrate/malate. With botanical medicine, the latin name, part of the plant used, concentration and standardization are all important to be listed.\nWhat is the proof that the labels are accurate?\nThere have been many documented cases of misidentification and or extraneous ingredients in end product supplements. One documented instance that was a case where foxglove, a cardiac herb effective in very small doses, was substituted for plantain and put into a product at much higher amounts, leading to digitalis poisoning. Plant and compound identification can be verified with lab tests done in house or by a third party.\nOften products will claim to have a certain amount of botanical medicine or nutrients and have the wrong form, wrong species and a variable amount. Many major studies have been conducted looking at consumer supplements and their labels. The results commonly showed ranges of potency below or above what was labeled, and in some cases very little or none of the correct species.\nConcern also lies with other ingredients found along with the botanical or nutrient. Fish oils are known to have potential heavy metals due to their source, but actually most supplements have this concern. The solvents used in the extraction or production have also been documented, such as benzene and acetone.\nIt defeats the purpose of supplementing your diet if the incorrect amount of the wrong substance is in a capsule with solvents and pesticides.\nSeeking out Standards\nThe good news is professionals are aware of these issues, and several measures are already being put in place to ensure quality supplements.\nGMP or Good Manufacturing Practice, a set of standards enforced by the federal government, begins to address the pitfalls in production of nutritional supplements. Companies are held to standards in quality and disease control, receiving and testing of raw materials, and procedures for storage and distribution. Companies having GMP certification are more likely to have higher quality supplements.\nEven among GMP certified companies, solvent testing and raw material testing standards are not all equal. Many healthcare providers and companies feel current standards are not strict enough. Third party testing for potency as well as extensive solvent testing is being shown to be necessary to ensure quality and safety. Thorough testing especially of raw materials for solvents and other toxic substances is only practiced by a handful of nutraceutical companies at this time. To know if a supplement company is doing this sort of testing, they should be able to supply information on their quality assurance, with the testing done by either themselves or ideally by a third party. GMP certification is a step in the right direction, but thorough solvent and potency testing is ideal.\nThe goal of taking a supplement is to improve overall well being. Making healthy supplements, free of harmful ingredients and proven to have the correct amounts of nutrients and medicine should be an established standard. Until it is, it is important to read the label carefully and know the company’s standards.\nJoiner Bey, Herb. Conflight in a Capsule: Is Stearic Acid As Bad As Some Manufacturers Say? 2007.

{"question":"How do the health and hardiness characteristics differ between Belted Galloway cattle and dairy replacement heifers?","answer":"Belted Galloway cattle are known for their exceptional hardiness and natural immunity, particularly against conditions like pink-eye, with issues like dwarfism being almost non-existent in the breed. They have excellent adaptation to rough conditions and possess a protective hair coat that provides waterproofing and insulation. In the dairy industry, replacement heifer success is often incorrectly measured by cull rate or herd turnover, when in fact, herd health is better indicated by replacement costs and management decisions. Healthy dairy herds have lower death losses and higher quality culls, while unhealthy herds experience higher death losses and poorer quality culls, regardless of cull rates.","context":["Belted Galloway cattle are in reality a beef cattle breed. They’re raised for meat production.\nThe Belted Galloway cattle are a breed of beef cattle coming from southern Scotland. It’s a legacy breed and is adapted to moorlands of the area and living on the bad pastures. The strain is also understood by a few other titles like Beltie, Oreo Cow and Panda Cow.\nBelted Galloway Cattle\nBelted Galloway cattle are moderate-sized creatures. The qualities of this strain are the white belt which encircles their entire body and that their hair jacket. They are polled so that they don’t have any horns.\nAs well as their undercoat offers waterproofing and insulation, allowing the animals to invest out. Dun color of this strain is also available that a mutation from the PMEL gene causes.\nThe identical mutation which leads to silver dun and also duns from Highland cattle. The average body weight of the Belted Galloway cows differs from 450 to 675 kg. Along with the cows on a burden between 850 and 770 kg.\nThe Belted Galloway cattle are hardy, thicker and bigger creatures. They are silent in nature and are of great behavior. The cows are mothers, and their calves can be protected by them against predators and dangers.\nThey’re excellent grazers and are well adapted for rough grazing land and may use rough grasses that other cattle breeds would normally prevent. They have the ability to keep state and generate an excellent beef product on the grass.\nThe strain is also employed as a dairy breed because of their nature. The cows are fairly good produce milk and milk producers. They’re noted for calving and their procedure is free of complications.\nThe Belted Galloway cattle are creatures, and they have immunity against pink-eye, and issues such as dwarfism are nearly unheard of in the strain. This type of durability using a immune system is a desired characteristic for those farmers that are ready to maintain their herd sturdy and healthy.\nThey create excellent meat, although the strain is a grower. Their beef is low in fat and marbled. Carcass dressed weight is greater than 60% of the body weight that was a live reduction. The strain is dispersed popular, although in several nations around the world chiefly.\nRoots of this breed are uncertain. Nonetheless, it’s often suggested that the white belt of this strain might be due to cross breeding with all the Dutch Lakenvelder belted cattle. The strain is named so due to the belt. An institution for the strain called the Belted Galloway Association was made in 1921 at Scotland. Along with the title of this institution was changed to the Belted Galloway Society in 1951.\nThe institution records pedigrees to get Belted Galloways and keeps and manages the enrollment of Red and White Galloways. Presently the Belted Galloway Cattle Society is directed by the UK and a thriving program is. Mrs. McLean of East Kortright, New York first imported the strain into the United States of America.\nThe prior famous American Belted Galloway Breeders Society was made in the USA on 1st July 1951, however, it is currently Called The US Galloway Society Inc. The strain is now recorded with the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy as a “regaining ” breed. And the population of this strain is increasing.

Nunes\nBethard is with Dairy Records Management Systems, Raleigh, N.C., and G&R Dairy Consulting, Wytheville, Va. Nunes is with Genske, Mulder & Company, Salida, Calif.\nThey’re probably your third largest expense. There’s no one way to lower costs.\nThe top three costs of producing milk on most dairies in the U.S. are feed, replacements, and labor. Normally expressed on a hundredweight basis, these three key areas depend greatly on herd performance and your management skills.\nConceptually, replacement cost is the cost of maintaining herd size and structure. Although dairy accountants have various methods to determine replacement costs, all methods basically are similar in concept. The formula [(value of cows sold minus cost of replacement) divided by hundredweight milk sold] is the basis for determining replacement costs.\nOften, cull rate or herd turnover is used to measure herd health and replacement success. When fully considering the concept and implications of replacement cost, it becomes obvious that cull rate or any measure of herd turnover is a poor proxy for herd health or cost of maintaining herd size. The best measure of successful herd replacement is replacement cost per hundredweight, and a reasonable goal in most areas of the country is less than $1.50.\nSince it normally is expressed on a hundredweight basis, replacement cost doesn’t depend on herd size or production level. It can be compared for herds milking 100 cows or 10,000 cows or for herds milking 50 pounds per day or 100 pounds. In the simplest of terms for a 1,000-cow herd, replacement cost is the cost of keeping 1,000 cows in the herd day after day.\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are rules that all accountants in the U.S. are required to follow when preparing accrual-based financial statements. For dairy purposes, when a cow is put into productive use, the cost is depreciated over the animal’s useful life which usually is 5 to 7 years. It is referred to as depreciation of dairy cow’s expense. Once the cow is removed from the herd (sold or died), the remaining cost that has not been depreciated is removed and compared to the cull cow proceeds.\nThe cash method for determining replacement costs utilizes the following formula:\n(Cost of raising or purchasing replacements) minus (cull cow income) divided by hundredweights of milk produced.\nThe first part of the numerator is “cost of raising or purchasing replacements” which includes all costs incurred for getting a heifer to the day of calving. For home-raised heifers, this includes all costs from birth until day of calving and includes feed, labor, vaccines, health treatments, equipment costs, and so forth.\nTo answer the question “should an expense be included in replacement costs,” consider whether this cost would go away if the heifers were off site. If the answer is yes, then it should be part of replacement cost.\nFor purchased heifers, it includes all costs involved with purchasing the animal, including hauling and commissions. It also includes the costs incurred from the time of purchase until calving, such as feed, labor, and health costs.\nThe second part of the numerator is “cull cow income.” This includes the revenue received from selling cull cows and cull heifers plus any revenue received from selling heifers for dairy purposes.\nIn a situation where all heifers are purchased, the value of heifer calves sold can be included in the value of cows sold.\nThe table illustrates replacement costs for four 1,000-cow herds with varying cull rates, death losses, and production levels. The four herds dispel some of the myths related to replacement costs.\nMyth Number 1: High cull rate means high replacement costs. This often is true but not always. Herd D is a high-producing herd that has excellent herd health. Death loss is relatively low, and the cull cows are valuable. The dairy ships a lot of milk which dilutes the replacement costs over more hundredweights.\nMyth Number 2. Low production is not a viable business model. Actually, a low-production, low-input model can be very successful, provided feed, labor, and replacement costs are low. Lower-producing herds can achieve low replacement costs by having low death loss, low cull rate, and high-quality culls. Herd C is an example of this.\nMyth Number 3. A dairy only sells milk. Truth is you also sell a lot of beef. The quality of cows being sold greatly affects cull cow income and replacement costs. Selling heavier, late-lactation cows is very different from selling skinny, fresh cows or thin, lame cows. The high death loss and low value of culls is killing Herd B.\nMyth Number 4. Lowering cull rates will always lower replacement costs. Nope. Depending on market conditions, simply lowering cull rate may not improve replacement costs. Keeping low-producing cows and holding on to cows too long to where their cull value is lessened typically will not improve replacement costs.\nMyth Number 5. Herd health is tied to cull rate. Low replacement costs result from a healthy herd where management makes good economic decisions on cows, regardless of cull rate. Herd D is a high-producing herd with a high cull rate but reasonable replacement costs. Unhealthy herds like Herd B have higher death loss, poorer quality culls, and higher replacement costs despite reasonable cull rates.\nDairyman Extras feature: \"Accrual accounting for replacement costs”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f793d331-e089-435a-80c5-ab2b07e0dd07>","<urn:uuid:172fb882-a93d-4629-aea9-6ff6f3839cfe>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do data mining and predictive analytics differ in their approach to statistical significance and customer behavior patterns?","answer":"Data mining and predictive analytics differ significantly in their application and validation approaches. Data mining often faces challenges with statistical significance, as testing multiple correlations in a dataset (for example, 45 distinct pairs in a 10-variable dataset) can lead to spuriously significant results by chance alone. This makes traditional statistical checks potentially worthless if the mining is extensive enough. In contrast, predictive analytics focuses on using existing customer data to detect specific patterns and predict future actions, with clear validation through actual customer behaviors. For instance, predictive analytics can track concrete customer actions like declining purchase frequency (e.g., from 10 to 6 to 2 orders) to predict churn and take preventive action, providing more practical and verifiable results than broad correlation hunting.","context":["‘Data mining’ is an interesting term. It’s used very positively in some academic circles, such as departments of marketing, and very negatively in others, most notably departments of economics. The term refers to the use of clever automatedsearch techniques to discover putatively significant relationships in large data sets.\nThe paradigm example, though a very old-fashioned one is ‘stepwise regression’. You take a variable of interest then set up a multivariate regression. The computer then tries out all the other variables in the data set one at a time. If the variable comes up significant, it stays in, otherwise it’s dropped. In the end you have what is, arguably, the best possible regression.\nEconomists were early and enthusiastic users of stepwise regression, but they rapidly became disillusioned. To see the problem, consider the simpler case of testing correlations. Suppose, in a given dataset you find that consumption of restaurant meals is positively correlated with education. This correlation might have arisen by chance or it might reflect a real causal relationship of some kind (not necessarily a direct or obvious one). The standard statistical test involves determining how likely it is that you would have seen the observed correlation if there was in fact no relationship. If this probability is lower than, say, 5 per cent, you say that the relationship is statistically significant.\nNow suppose you have a data set with 10 variables. That makes 45 (=10*9/2) distinct pairs you can test. Just by chance you’d expect two or three correlations that appear statistically significant correlations. So if your only goal is to find a significant relationship that you can turn into a publication, this strategy works wonders.\nBut perhaps you have views about the ‘right’ sign of the correlation, perhaps based on some economic theory or political viewpoint. On average, half of all random correlations will have the ‘wrong’ sign, but you can at expect to find at least one ‘right-signed’ and statistically significant correlation in a set of 10 variables. So, if data mining is extensive enough, the usual statistical checks on spurious results become worthless.\nIn principle, there is a simple solution to this problem, reflecting Popper’s distinction between the context of discovery and the context of justification. There’s nothing wrong with using data mining as a method of discovery, to suggest testable hypotheses. Once you have a testable hypothesis, you can discard the data set you started with and test the hypothesis on new data untainted by the process of ‘pretesting’ that you applied to the original data set.\nUnfortunately, at least for economists, it’s not that simple. Data is scarce and expensive. Moreover, no-one gets their specification right first time, as the simple testing model would require. Inevitably, therefore, there has to be some exploration (mining) of the data before hypotheses are tested. As a result, statistical tests of significance never mean precisely what they are supposed to.\nIn practice, there’s not much that can be done except to rely on the honesty of investigators in reporting the procedures they went through before settling on the model they estimate. If the results are interesting enough, someone will find another data set to check or will wait for new data to allow ‘out of sample’ testing. Some models survive this stringent testing, but many do not.\nI don’t know how the marketing guys solve this problem. Perhaps their budgets are so large that they can discard used data sets like disposable syringes, never infecting their analysis with the virus of pretesting. Or perhaps they don’t know or don’t care.\nUpdate Kevin Drum at CalPundit gives the perspective of a marketing guy, with lots of interesting points (for example, loyalty programs are there to collect data for mining). He doesn’t accept my main point and raises the dreaded “B” word – Bayesian.\nFor those familiar with debates among statisticians, this is the point at which things typically become both heated and incomprehensible (just like a lot of blogs, really). A real challenge, which I may tackle at some point, is to explain the Bayesian concept of statistical reasoning in ordinary language. For the moment, though, I’ll just agree that a debate like the one over data mining ultimately makes sense only if it’s cast in Bayesian terms, that is, with a discussion of the beliefs we hold before we begin the statistical analysis.","When running a business, acquiring new customers on a consistent basis might seem like the best way to grow your business at first. However, as you move forward you will begin to realize the importance of focusing on increasing a customer's lifetime value in your business, which can be achieved through repeat purchases. Customer experience analytics software are highly popular to generate customizable dashboards and charts to offer insights for every customer interaction.\nIncreasing a customer's lifetime value reduces the cost of new customer acquisition, and leads to savvy usage of your marketing budget. With the emergence of big data analysis, generating repeat purchases from customers based on predictions is becoming highly effective. Using big data, Netflix saves $1 billion per year on customer retention. Hence, intelligent customer retention strategies help to reduce customer churn and increase profits.\nWhat is Predictive Analysis?\nPredictive analysis is the process of using existing data to detect patterns and predict future actions in order to make informed business decisions.\nThe predictive analysis makes use of propensity models which is the likelihood of taking a particular purchasing action.\nThese insights will enable you to take proactive actions to alter future outcomes to become favorable for your business growth and revenue.\nWith big data, predictive analytics can reveal your customers shopping behaviors and habits to enable you to make accurate predictions.\nInfact, 97.2% of organizations are investing in big data and AI.\nFor example, let's say Joe used to make 10 meal orders on a meal delivery website at an average per month, then that number drops to six, then it drops to two and then he makes orders every couple of months.\nWith the use of predictive analytics this shows that Joe is about to churn this brand, the food delivery brand takes action and sends Joe a 15% discount in his next 3 orders. This prompted Joe to start making purchases again.\nThis brand has leveraged Joe's transaction history to alternate future outcomes. By predicting Joe's intent to churn, they led him to further make purchases with the use of incentives.\nSo how can you use predictive analytics to generate repeat purchases?\nThe following are the steps to follow to use predictive analytics to generate repeat purchases.\nStep #1- Collect Data\nFirstly, you need to collect data on your customer shopping history. This can be done by tracking their past actions, transactions, interactions, and purchases on your website and mobile applications.\nInteractions such as:\n- Regular purchases\n- Discounts purchases\n- Returned purchases\n- Most browsed products categories\n- Wishlist items\n- Abandoned carts\nBecause when someone visits your website they create as many as 40 data points. You can also collect data from customers' transactional history on your CRM.\nLet's collect the data of 2 customers namely Sarah and Matt.\nSarah regularly visits a hair brand website, makes certain searches, enquires about particular products, completes purchases.\nWhile Matt is a coffee and tea lover who shops a beverage brand and gets specific items on an irregular basis.\nWe will collect the data from Sarah and Matt's transactional history.\nMoreover, ecommerce companies can make use of specialized customer value optimization platforms like Omniconvert Reveal.\nReveal focuses on improving the customer lifetime value so that you can maximize profits by increasing the number of loyal customers. The best part of the software is you can track the products that are generating the highest or the lowest revenue.\nAs seen in the above image, the Omniconvert Reveal dashboard displays the lowest product return for the Vans brand. You can take the required actions to increase the number of repeat purchases.\nBesides, there is software like Woopra that tracks customer’s data.\nBelow is an example of a customer profile on Woopra.\nWoopra syncs existing user data to give you a customer full historical data.\nStep #2- Analyze\nAfter collecting that data it's time to interpret that data, to gain valuable insights into customers patterns and behaviors by asking questions like:\n- What was a customer's most visited page?\n- How many times did a customer purchase a particular product?\n- Which product did a customer mostly search for?\n- Which potential customers abandoned their carts?\n- Which device did a customer frequently use to shop? Was it mobile or desktop?\n- Which customers are reducing their engagement with your products?\nWoopra also helps with analyzing the collected customer data. Simply click on the analysis section on the dashboard and it will lead you to the analytics.\nWoopra also provides retention reports for you to easily uncover at-risk users and engaged heroes.\nLet's continue with our example above, from the data collected, you find out that Sarah regularly browses the dry hair shampoo products category on the hair care online store, and her wish list is filled with dry hair shampoo products.\nYou also realize that Sarah is an active buyer and hasn't slacked in her purchases regardless of the availability of incentives like discounts.\nAdditionally, Sarah once searched for travel-sized dry shampoo and further made inquiries about it.\nWhile Matt shops his steeped coffee and jasmine tea from the beverage brand sparingly and has some accessories on his wishlist.\nMatt buys coffee products in one month, then buys tea products in another month. He once bought both coffee and tea products at a time but had to return the coffee product later.\nMatt only gets both his steeped coffee and jasmine tea products when there's a discount.\nOne day Matt was browsing through the brand's website for his coffee and tea products.\nHowever, this time after adding both the steeped coffee and jasmine tea product, he decided to add an accessory on his wishlist to the cart. But before checking out, Matt abandons his cart.\nThis analytics will then help you with the next step which is prediction.\nStep #3- Predict\nBased on your customer's history you can predict future outcomes using the propensity model, which is projecting the likelihood of a customer to take certain actions.\nThis will help you to categorize your customer base into 4 categories:\n- The ones likely to purchase again\n- The ones likely to churn\n- The ones that abandoned your business\n- The ones who are repeat customers\nThis categorization has predicted the future actions of these customers and leads you to find ways to increase their CLTV.\nLet's continue with our example, so we have analyzed our collected data and from that data, we can make accurate predictions on the likelihood of what's to happen.\nFrom Sarah's data, we can project that she's a repeat customer and has a likelihood to buy the products again.\nWhereas Matt's data has revealed that he has a likelihood to churn the brand, we can't say for sure that Matt has abandoned the business because of his abandoned cart.\nHowever, one thing is clear, Matt is in a frustrating dilemma that might lead him to seek out competitors of the beverage brand to satisfy his desires.\nTherefore, our prediction is that sooner or later, Matt is going to abandon the business.\nNow, it's time to ensure that the future outcomes are in favor of these brands.\nStep #4- Define your Desired Alternative Future Outcome\nThe next step is to change this predicted future outcome to become favorable for your business.\nWhich in this case is to draw them back to purchase your products again. Which takes us to the next step:\nSo how can we generate repeat purchases from these two individuals?\nStep #5- Design Befitting Strategies\nBased on the propensity models, it's time to make customized offers that are befitting for each category of customers.\nPredictive analytics will prevent you from taking the one size fits all approach by providing information from the mined data.\nThis analysis will provide you with information on which customers are worth your time, the cost of investment required, and the right approach to use in reaching them.\nWoopra also provides you with actionable steps to take and site optimizations to make based on your data.\nFor example, they enable triggers after a customer's action.\nYou can automate routine tasks with Woopra features that can help prompt customers to make purchases.\nFurthermore, Woopra lets you connect with unengaged users who are at the risk of churn by designating an action.\nGoing back to our example, the predictive analysis will help us personalize our outreach to Sarah and Matt, this will save our profit margins and prevent us from making unnecessary costly offers.\nBased on Sarah's shopping history, she doesn't need an additional incentive to buy her dry hair shampoos, she loves them and doesn't depend on discounts to get them.\nSo what can we do to ensure Sarah keeps coming back?\nRemember Sarah previously made inquiries about travel-size shampoos? We are going to constantly reach out to Sarah with exclusive recommendations of travel-size dry shampoos that we know Sarah can't resist.\nAnd then we will promise Sarah a gift of a free hair product or free shipping on her fifth order.\nDoing this will make Sarah happy and undoubtedly increase her CLTV.\nHowever, Matt will need a bigger incentive to make regular purchases with the brand again.\nWe will send Matt the oldie but goldie abandoned cart emails, offering him a good discount on his purchases, say 30%, for him to checkout. We will proceed to offer him a lower discount on his third steeped coffee and jasmine tea order.\nThe cost of giving this discount is incredibly low in comparison to its benefits.\nBecause we didn't only gain a sale, but we also retained a customer who after this marketing strategy will consider increasing his CLTV to the brand. We would have lost both without taking these actions.\nAlso, if a 15% discount has triggered a sale from Matt in the past, then there's no need to reinvent the wheel simply make the same offer and you will get results.\nWith predictive analysis, we have been able to change Matt's unfavorable decision.\nPredictive analytics is here to stay and will continue to grow. Take advantage of its exclusive insights to maximize the ROI of your marketing investments such as generating repeat purchases.\nLet's recap: The first step is to collect data of customers' past history, use an analytic software for this, and then interpret that data to make predictions.\nBased on the predictions, define your alternative outcome, and finally, take corresponding actionable steps to grant you the opportunities of generating repeat purchases."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:86327804-2d84-4e5b-880b-361595335a93>","<urn:uuid:00ab0b38-5bbb-4772-ad97-40827d66171e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the difference between food loss and food waste in terms of where they occur in the food supply chain?","answer":"Food loss occurs between farms and retailers, such as produce damaged during harvesting and transportation. On the other hand, food waste occurs after food reaches the market, specifically referring to food discarded by retailers and consumers, like unsold food destroyed by supermarkets after expiration or uneaten food at hotel buffets.","context":["PETALING JAYA: Every year, an average Malaysian household throws away more than one month’s salary on food they don’t eat, research by Solid Waste Corporation Management (SWCorp) concluded.\nThe food that Malaysians waste not only affects their pockets, but it is estimated to be enough to feed millions daily.\nThe research found that about a quarter of the food is wasted by Malaysians during preparation, production and consumption.\n“In one study conducted by SWCorp, a household with five people spends an average of RM900 on food alone.\n“If we take into account the fact that a quarter of food is wasted during preparation, production and consumption, the value of food thrown into the trash can every month is equivalent to RM225,” said SWCorp Technology Research Division environmental control officer Agustina Fithri Kasmaruddin.\nThis would total a whopping RM2,700 a year, which is more than RM2,400, the mean monthly salary for an individual in an urban area, according to the Department of Statistics’ Salaries & Wages Survey Report 2014.Another study conducted by SWCorp showed that Malaysians generated 38,000 tonnes of solid waste daily in 2016, of which 15,000 tonnes was food waste.\nIt found that 20%, or 3,000 tonnes, of this food waste was avoidable.\nAvoidable food waste, Agustina explained, was food that could still be eaten when it was thrown, adding that “people rarely finish the food on their plates.”\n“Based on SWCorp’s study, the average weight of an individual’s meal is 0.45kg a meal.\n“15,000 tonnes of food waste can feed 11 million people with three meals a day,” said Agustina.\nAvoidable food waste, using the same logic, could feed 2.2 million people three full meals a day of perfectly edible food.\n“It’s very worrying. Looking at the economy right now, people are suffering. Some can’t even afford to eat,” said Agustina.\nThe issues of food loss and food waste are becoming more and more prevalent as key matters for leaders to address as Malaysia’s food security becomes increasingly a national concern.\nFood loss here means the loss of food between the farms and the retailers, in the case of the produce damaged during harvesting and transportation.\nFood waste, on the other hand, is the food that is discarded by retailers and consumers, for instance unsold food that is destroyed by a supermarket after they pass their expiry date as well as uneaten food at hotel buffets.\n“The issue of food waste is relatively new in the Malaysian context. It was very recently that the FAO said that food waste was important to food security.\n“If we can reduce food waste, we can improve the food security situation. After post-harvest losses, the main issue in food security is food waste,” said Mardi’s Economic and Social Science Research Centre director Dr Rozhan Abu Dardak.\nBut what can the average Malaysian do to reduce food waste?\nAccording Dr Ainu Husna M S Suhaimi, head secretariat of the MYSaveFood Initiative, it is all about proper planning and awareness.\n“It all starts with planning, if you plan your shopping well, you can reduce food waste.\n“Use a basket instead of a trolley, use cash instead of credit card.\nDr Ainu also said that overeating was itself a form of food waste and that reduced portions were encouraged.\n“Malaysians believe it is better to cook more than being insufficient, but it should be the other way round,” she added. Leftovers should be frozen for later consumption and whatever that remains can be composted or fed to pets.\nPassing this information on was part of the MYSaveFood initiative agenda, she explained.\n“The MYSaveFood initiative gathers a network of government agencies, private companies and NGOs and informs everyone that everyone wastes,” she said.\nThey do this mainly through awareness programmes and forums such as the forum that was held last week in conjunction with the Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Ministry.\nInitiatives by other agencies have also helped to bring food waste into the forefront, including the Lost Food Project that was recently launched.\nThe project introduced a food surplus collection service in partnership with Jasons Food Hall that pools together products and delivers to five charities twice a week.\n“Everyone can do our own bit. Food waste is definitely a change of attitude and mindset, while food loss is more about technology,” said Dr Ainu.","Just how much of global food production are we wasting annually?\nIt’s a simple question, but a complex topic, and the answer is, it depends. Are we talking about food loss, food waste, or both together? And what elements of each? In what sectors?\nA newly released report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the Food Waste Index Report 2021, provides a wealth of important new information on the food waste component, while at the same time reminding us of the criticality of terminology to avoid misunderstanding. Words and definitions matter, especially regarding research and conversations on global food loss and waste – and without continued focus and sharp messaging we risk confusing stakeholders despite opposite intentions.\nFor quick background, we use a lot of terms in this area, such as food loss, food waste, food wastage, excess food, excess edible food, edible parts, inedible parts, and more. And we can go further and distinguish between food waste reduction and food waste prevention, and recovery and diversion.\nGenerally, we get more specific when delving deeper into causes of food loss and food waste in seeking to develop effective, targeted solutions for them. We typically use the term “food loss” to denote the amount of annual food production that goes to waste (i.e. food that is not consumed by humans) between farm and market. Often this is discussed with a focus on less developed countries, where food is lost after harvest due to inadequate storage facilities and/or poor transportation infrastructure. To some degree this definition implies that the loss of food was beyond the control of relevant stakeholders (i.e. it was unintentional).\nSimilarly, we often speak of “food waste” with a focus on developed countries, where much food is wasted after it reaches the market – in consumer-facing businesses (ex. supermarkets, distributors, foodservice operators and restaurants) and/or in the homes of consumers. There’s a greater element of responsibility here, with a connotation that the waste of the food could have been avoided as a result of different actions or behavior on the part of consumers.\nSome use the term “food wastage” to denote food loss and food waste together, while others often simply use the term “food waste” when speaking of the combined figure.\nAnd additional terms come into play when researching and measuring food loss and waste to differentiate between edible and inedible food components.\nAll of these terms matter, especially with regard to measurement, because the clearer we can be about 1) how much food loss and waste occurs throughout the food supply chain, 2) where it occurs, and 3) why it occurs – the better we can be at devising interventions and longer-term solutions while also measuring and reporting on progress (or lack thereof).\nStepping up a level\nIt’s also important to communicate accurate, high-level measures on food loss and waste (including a combined figure) to global citizens and policymakers in order to continue to advance the progress on food waste reduction efforts over the last decade, and more importantly, to rapidly accelerate national and global plans and actions designed to achieve the Target 12.3 goal of halving global food loss and waste by 2030.\nIn many ways, the world has awakened to the gravity of the global food waste challenge, anchored by a seminal report from FAO in 2011 that estimated that roughly one-third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted across the globe, about 1.3 billion tonnes annually. Other reports suggest higher figures, but the world has largely coalesced around a figure of 33% of annual food production being lost or wasted.\nOn the plus side, high concern over the scale of that level of wastage, coupled with widespread global hunger and the extreme environmental and social externalities associated with food loss and waste, led to the creation of a specific SDG target related to food waste reduction as well as recognition that fixing the food system requires fixing food waste.\nOn the negative side, the widely cited 33% figure is so large that it can seem daunting to many individuals, leaving them feeling powerless as to what they as individuals can due to impact it. And if they feel powerless, they are unlikely to act.\nBoth reactions are important. There is no question that the world must come together to cut food loss and waste with urgency, and at the same time, we must connect with individuals (particularly in developed countries) such that they place a higher value on food – changing behavior to waste less, influencing others to do the same, and raising expectations for responsible behavior among food organizations.\nIn essence, we need to transition from our current developed-world culture of abundance which creates excessive waste to a culture of responsibility which wastes much less. And at the same time, we must address food losses – especially in less developed regions — through the transfer of knowledge, tools, technology and financing.\nNew findings, new messaging\nIn the continued quest for greater accuracy to guide research, measurement and interventions, FAO and UNEP have been working on two new indices – the Food Loss Index and the Food Waste Index – to update the “one-third” finding of the previously-mentioned FAO report.\nThe new UNEP report reflects what the authors note is “the most comprehensive food waste data collection, analysis and modelling effort” to this point. By combining estimates of food waste for every country in the world (including estimates based on extrapolations for countries without primary data), the authors determined that 931 million tonnes of available food were wasted in 2019 across the three sectors studied (61% of that waste stemmed from households, while 26% stemmed from food service operations and 13% came from the retail sector).\nSignificantly, that leads to a new estimate for global food waste of 17%.\nThe report included several other key findings:\n- Household per capita food waste was found to be similar across country income groups; significant in that it challenges the notion that food waste in the home is largely a developed world problem (and suggesting the need for further study of household food waste in lower income countries)\n- Global food waste at the consumer level could be significantly higher than prior estimates (perhaps twice as high)\n- Additional data is needed on the level of edible versus inedible food across country groups to guide food waste reduction and diversion interventions\nSo the report has indeed created valuable new learnings while laying the foundation for more detailed measurement across countries to more effectively shape national strategies and policy interventions to advance progress toward Target 12.3.\nAnd now we come back to the importance of terminology, and why it is important to clarify messaging related to the reported 17% figure for global food waste.\nUnfortunately, it may be easy for many global citizens to view the new 17% figure in an overly positive light, because most individuals are now accustomed to a 33% figure for global food waste (even though many are unaware of the combined loss and waste nature of that figure).\nFor example, shortly after the release of the new report, I was asked if the level of global food waste had suddenly been found to be half the amount of prior estimates. Further, in a subsequent call, a speaker casually used the 17% figure while seemingly referring to food loss and waste together. And headlines that once mentioned “one third of food going to waste” now have been replaced with “one fifth.” They may be more accurate in terms of “food waste” alone, but it is likely that many of the writers (and millions of readers) lack the in-depth understanding of the difference.\nAnd, significantly, while the release of the new 17% food waste figure may inadvertently convey a decline in the minds of some, the report notes that prior estimates of consumer food waste may be significantly understated. In fact, as noted above, food waste at the consumer level may be twice as high as prior estimates.\nSo what seems like less could in fact be more.\nThinking deeper, one might quickly gravitate to the idea of adding the new 17% food waste figure from the Food Waste Index report to the 14% food loss figure (from FAO’s 2019 report, The State of Food and Agriculture: Moving Forward on Food Loss and Waste Reduction) in order to come to a new combined figure for global food loss and waste. Doing so would yield a figure of 31%, which on the surface might make sense compared to the traditional one-third (i.e. 33%) combined estimate.\nBut such a compilation isn’t accurate, and as report co-author Hamish Forbes noted, the team is not encouraging it due to differences in the composition of the two figures (i.e. it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison). As the report states, there are scope differences – the food loss index (FLI) includes losses for “multiple utilizations” of food (i.e. food, feed, seed, and others), while the food waste index (FWI) focuses on consumer food waste (i.e. final food products exclusive of animal feed and seed). Further, there are differences in the definitions of the two estimates – the FWI includes inedible parts, while the FLI focuses only on edible parts.\nIdeally, we would be able to combine the two indicators, and FAO and UNEP are working on developing such a clean summation of food loss and waste. Doing so will provide a new and consistent reference point to guide the global conversation on food loss and waste, essentially replacing the 33% frame that most individuals had centered upon.\nAction from clarity\nIn the interim, despite the need for messaging on the twin components of food loss and waste (essentially to avoid an incorrect re-set to 17% as a combined figure in the minds of many), there are many positives to draw on from the new Food Waste Index. The report:\n- Provides a new, more accurate estimate of global food waste at the consumer level\n- Shows that consumer food waste is likely much higher than previously estimated\n- Indicates that consumer food waste at lower income levels warrants further study\n- Reinforces the importance of, and need for, accurate measurement of food loss and waste\n- Reflects the importance of getting increasingly granular to maximize the effectiveness of policy interventions\n- Prompts countries to develop national food loss and waste reduction strategies\n- Lays the foundation for an updated combined global food loss and waste figure\n- Highlights some data gaps for further research\nThere is an important timing element here as well, in my opinion. I believe the new report can provide a spark to re-energize food loss and waste reduction efforts globally following a challenging pandemic year which seemed to derail the momentum with which we entered this critical Decade of Action.\nMoreover, the future release of a new combined metric, perhaps with a term (food wastage?) that clearly denotes the summation of food loss and food waste components can, in my view, provide a new centering point for 1) education on the scale and impact of global food loss and waste, 2) heightened commitment for policy interventions and national reduction strategies to reduce food loss and waste, and 3) a heightened level of meaningful collaboration between nations to address food loss and waste with a focus on achieving the 50% reduction goal by 2030.\nAfter all, food loss and waste isn’t a problem unique to specific nations, it is truly a global problem with massive hunger, health, climate, and security implications. And while it is too early to predict, my bet is that if consumer food waste (which as the original ReFED report indicated is such a large portion of food waste in developed countries like the U.S.) is significantly higher than previously estimated, it is likely that the new combined figure for global food loss and waste will be higher than the prior 33% estimate.\nIn any case, as Hamish Forbes noted, one big takeaway from the report involves the notion of agency. As consumers, we can all take actions to reduce the amount of food we waste. The better we understand where and how we contribute to food waste, the better we can change our behavior. And that’s important, because as WRAP noted in this recent post, the “unpalatable truth about food waste” is that it is “everywhere.”\nSo let’s look forward to the future release of a combined figure for global food loss and waste from FAO and UNEP.\nAnd in the interim, let’s all be clear on terminology, and caution fellow stakeholders that the combined level of global food loss and waste didn’t suddenly get much better.\n2030, the date by which the world seeks to cut global food waste in half, is just nine years off.\nWe all still have a lot of hard, necessary, rewarding work to do on food loss and waste reduction.\n*Thanks to Richard Swannell and Hamish Forbes of WRAP for informative exchanges regarding the Food Waste Index report."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6f532706-8303-43e5-8840-095ad84a24f4>","<urn:uuid:7dcce914-4db5-4566-9842-f66c9dcce251>"],"error":null}

However, dam construction faces several major risks: flooding during construction if the river diversion system isn't adequate (designed for 30-50 year flood events), risks from explosive demolition of temporary cofferdams, and potential internal erosion in the joint zones between impervious materials and concrete structures. Additionally, embankment dams are particularly vulnerable to being overtaken by floods both during construction and operation, as this can reduce material cohesion and cause wall collapse.","context":["Pascal’s Law tells us that pressure in a fluid depends on the height and density of the fluid. This is something that you’ve experienced firsthand if you’ve ever tried to dive in deep water. The deeper into the water you swim, the greater the pressure you feel, especially in your ears. Go deep enough and the pressure difference between your inner ear and the water becomes outright painful.\nIn the video demonstration above, you’ll see how a tall, thin tube containing only 1 liter of water is able to shatter a 50-liter container of water. Not only does this show just how powerful height is in creating pressure in a fluid, but it shows how a fluid can be used to transmit pressure over a distance – one of the fundamental principles of hydraulics! (Video credit: K. Visnjic et al.; submitted by Frederik B.)\nReader @hoosierfordman77 writes:\n“They’re pressurizing the line by using a syringe sealed to the tube. Of course, the volume of water in the tube added to this. But it was not the only source of pressure. Also explaining that pressure only has one vector as in the illustration using Hoover Dam is preposterous. Sir [sic] later stated correctly that pressure is evenly distributed through the inside of a container. If her demonstration was correct then the pressure of the water in lake Meade is not proportional to the volume of the lake…only proportional to its depth. Now I’ve not done testing but I do not believe a 100,000 acre lake that’s 1 foot deep would be held back by the walls of a kiddie pool that routinely handle that depth.” (emphasis added)\nHi, hoosierfordman77, thanks for your comment! It does seem counter-intuitive that pressure in a reservoir is proportional to depth, not volume, but it is correct. If you go swimming 1 meter below the water surface, the pressure you experience is the same whether you’re in a backyard pool or the Gulf of Mexico. And, yes, a 100,000 acre lake that’s 1 foot deep has a static pressure that could be withstood by a kiddie pool.\nNow engineers don’t build it that way for a couple of reasons. 1) Pascal’s Law only describes hydrostatic forces – that is, the force experienced when the water is motionless. In reality, a dam would need to withstand not only the hydrostatic forces caused by the water’s depth but also any forces exerted when the water moves due to wind action, temperature differences, etc. And 2) after evaluating all of the expected forces a structure will endure, engineers add a factor of safety to make the structure strong enough to withstand forces above and beyond what is expected in ordinary or extraordinary operation.\nAs for the syringe, it only adds additional pressure to the line if they do not allow a gap for air in the line to escape. That can be a bit of a challenge, as they acknowledge in the video when they discuss the effects of air bubbles in the line. However, there is every indication that they were aware of this potential in their demonstration and did everything they could to ensure that it was not affecting the result. The fact remains, however, that extra pressure in the line is unnecessary – the 1 liter of water’s depth alone will shatter that container.","MAJOR RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DAM CONSTRUCTION\nA dam is a Civil Engineering construction which serves to contain the water of a natural course with two different aims, either alternative or simultaneous, according to the cases:\n- To increase the level so that it can be diverted through a spillway in order to regulate the volume of water.\n- To create a reservoir in order to retain the excess of water, allowing the supply of the liquid in moments of shortage.\nDams must fulfill a double function:\n- they must be impervious and\n- stable to resist the water pushing behind it.\nConde Guadalhorce Dam\nDams can be grouped into two major categories on the basis of their composition:\n- concrete dams and\n- embankment dams.\nThe selection of one or the other type depends on the topography and conditions of the ground.\n- Concrete dams are fundamentally constructed with concrete, with or without steel frameworks.\nThere are three different subcategories:\n- Gravity dams: The water is held back because of the own weight of the dam, without the intervention of the arch shape.\nGravity dam scheme\n- Arch dams: Arch dams transmit the thrust (vertical and horizontal loads) towards its foundation and abutments, due to the “arch” effect. They may have horizontal or double -horizontal and vertical- curvature, which is the most normal.\nDouble curvature dam\n- Arch-Gravity dams: A combination of the two previous dam types. The single action of the curvature is insufficient to withstand the thrust and the dam must be provided with a certain weight to compensate this defect.\n- Embankment dams are constituted by materials provided by nature which do not suffer any chemical process of transformation, being treated and laid through compaction procedures of soil mechanics, acting by gravity. They are composed of stone, gravel, earth, silt and clay, in accordance with the following classification:\n- Rockfill dams. When more than 50% of the material is composed of rock.\n- Earthfill dams. Also known as “rolled earth dams”. For materials with lower grain size.\nAccording to the distribution of materials:\n- Homogeneous: When all the material that the embankment dam is made of has the same characteristics. It may deal with more or less impervious materials (clay or silt). It requires very smooth slopes for the haunches to be stable under the different actions which may show up.\n- Zoned: This is the most common type of dam, with employment of different materials, with an impervious core (usually clay) and more permeable materials as we get further from the dam core. So, one part of the dam fulfills the impermeability criterion and the rest has enough resistance to provide the construction with overall stability. They allow for higher slope inclination, so that the dam occupies a lower surface area.\nZoned dams may have two different construction typologies:\n- An impervious core (made from clay or silt), either in the interior of the dam, in the centre (vertical or almost vertical) or near the upstream facing (inclined).\nHeterogeneous embankment dam with central core\n- An impervious facing covering the upstream slope area. This can be achieved through concrete or asphalt fabric screens.\nHeterogeneous embankment dam with impervious screen\nDam construction follows the following process:\n- River diversion\nFor the construction of the dam side in the course of the river, it is necessary to divert the river to create a dry work area at the dam site.\nThis dry area can be created in two different ways:\n- By totally diverting the river through an artificial course. It consists of the construction of an artificial course, for which it is needed to construct a temporary dam, called cofferdam (or diversion dam), in order to make a pool for the water to enter through the new course. It is a conduit (open channel or pipe) which transports the diverted water to a spot downstream. Moreover, the cofferdam shall contain the waters which cannot be held by the conduit.\nDiversion tunnel at Ralco dam (Chile)\nStone cofferdam at Three Gorges Dam (China)\n- By leaving only a portion of the waterway dry and channelling the passage of current through the rest, thus successively carrying out the work.\n- Auxiliary works\nIt is necessary for dam construction to transport large amounts of construction material, in many cases across very irregular or mountainous land. Therefore, it becomes necessary to construct provisional access roads and bridges, as well as tunnels (in occasions) or even to carry out slope filling works, etc.\nMoreover, depending on the function to be fulfilled by the dam, different water pathways must also be built -most of them underground- including the respective water inlet and outlet structures.\nThese works include:\n- Water intake towers and supply tunnels for water supply projects.\n- Upstream and downstream galleries.\n- Surge shafts.\n- Galleries for hydroelectric plant turbine room and transformers.\n- Construction of the dam itself\nThe construction method varies depending on the type of dam:\n- Concrete dams. These are built basically through two different methods:\n- Conventional method. Individual sections are constructed as blocks and concreted forming “towers”, the size of which depends on considerations in relation to the construction project and the setting heat to be expected. In this case, the decisive factors are: the temperature during the on-site concrete casting, the cement percentage, the concrete cooling system and the weather conditions at the dam site, as the setting and cooling temperatures may be affected.\nConstruction with blocks\nThere must be interruptions during the construction, so that construction joints are produced, which are practically horizontal shaped. Besides, the so called functional joints are constructed in order to prevent cracks from occurring in the concrete expansion and contraction processes -with possible seepage and resistance reduction-, causing the division of the dam into blocks with certain independence from each other. After the project completion, when the dam’s own weight acts, and prior to filling the reservoir, cement suspension is injected in the block cracks in order to achieve the monolithic structure.\n- RCC (Roller Compacted Concrete) Method. RCC is also known as “Rollcrete”. In this construction technique, the concrete is transported to the dam surface by trucks or conveyor belts. Then, it is distributed with bulldozers and compacted with vibratory rollers. The thickness of the concrete layer ranges between 30 and 50 cm. In order to ensure watertightness on both sides (dam facings), these are built of concrete according to the conventional method. Additionally, cement mortar is laid between the horizontal layers of Roller Compacted Concrete.\nConcrete is saved by using this method, together with a lower setting heat, thus avoiding the functional joints. Therefore, it is more economical than the previous technique.\nRalco dam construction (Chile)\n- Embankment dams:\n- Impervious inner core. Embankment dams are built by placing selected layers (30 to 50 cm thick) of fill material with different grain size, pre-treated if necessary. This material is compacted, important operation to prevent settlements and obtain the maximum resistance. During compaction, as the optimum degree of density depends on the water content of the material, work must stop during rainfall. In isolate cases, hard rainfall may make necessary the removal of material already placed and compacted before placing the next layer.\n- Rockfill dams with impervious face\n- Concrete-faced rockfill dams (CFRD): The impervious element in this type of dam is a concrete slab on the upstream slope in contact with the reservoir water. The concrete face is made up by triangle-shaped or quadrilateral-shaped slabs joined by means of impervious joints (corrugated copper plates or some bituminous substance), and allowing the independent movement of each slab.\nAt the dam toe, on the upstream side, the slab is connected to a concrete retaining wall which forms the transition between the rock subsoil and the impervious concrete slab.\nThe fundamental defect of the concrete face is the great difference in deformability compared to the material of the dam, which makes it very sensitive to possible dam settlements, which may leave the wall unsupported, and therefore they are reinforced in two directions.\n- Asphalt facing: The impervious element is a bituminous layer placed on the upstream slope of the dam.\nThe advantage lies in the fact that, besides being impervious, the material is also flexible, so that it adapts very well to dam settlements. Additionally, the construction and repair are easy and fast, and in the event of cracks occurring, they may close on their own thanks to the plasticity feature of the material.\nExecution of asphalt layer at Ralco dam\nThe construction method is similar to concrete facing rockfill dams, with the difference that the asphalt layer is laid once the dam body has reached its definitive height. The face is generally built in several layers (30-50 cm thick), and it must be supported on a flat surface made of porous or asphaltic concrete. The tamping is done with rollers moved from the crest.\n- The project and construction of a dam present special problems demanding high knowledge of several sciences and techniques: Geology, foundations, Hydraulics, properties and treatment of materials, etc. Perhaps, that is the reason why it requires, more than any other construction project, the collaboration of several specialists and team work. As a conclusion, the plan and the project have special importance in dam construction, for the corresponding works and for the river diversion system.\n- River diversion. The maximum flood to be diverted is the major problem in designing and determining the dimensions of the diversion elements. It must be determined based on the following dilemma:\n- If we fall short, floods higher than the diversion capacity will be spilt over the diversion works and will flow through the old natural course, flooding the works that are being built.\n- If, in order to avoid this, a very wide diversion is done, it may be excessively costly.\nThe drainage capacity of diversion tunnels is generally designed to have a 30 to 50-year return period flood event, in order to prevent flooding during the construction. Therefore, the two major risks associated with dam construction during the construction stage are: 1) The possible flooding of the works due to rain-induced floods (they are very sensitive to natural hazards), as such flows are not contained by the diversion elements; and 2) The risks derived from the necessary explosions to demolish the temporary cofferdams.\nTwo moments of a cofferdam demolition (with explosives) at Three Gorges Dam (China)\n- Auxiliary works. Due to the fact that access roads are provisional, no coating layer is applied on them, meaning that they are exposed to rain and possible floods.\nIn general, temporary works (roads, bridges, fillings, etc.) are very affected by landslides induced, for example, by hard rainfall; as well as natural hazards (earthquakes, etc.).\n- Materials storage warehouses and construction machinery are highly exposed to landslides, if they are located in the proximities of slopes susceptible to landsliding.\n- Embankment dams. These dams do not withstand being overtaken by floods, both during construction and once under operation, as the little cohesion of the materials they are composed of could be reduced, which might cause the collapse of part of the wall, as well as filtration areas. That is why it is important to carry out a good study on historical rainfall on the river during the project stage.\nThe dam toe is one of the most important elements in the construction of concrete facing dams. Its correct formation is essential to assure the watertightness of the dam.\nInternal erosion may develop in the joint zones between the impervious material of the dam core and the integrated concrete structures (bottom drain, etc.). In order to prevent this phenomenon, they must be planned and constructed with special care.\n- Double curvature dams. They are very slender and may adopt very daring and complex shapes, which allows them to be very high and with small thickness. This complexity requires great skillfulness and experience from the constructors, who must resort to uncommon construction systems and the use of expensive construction equipment as well. Due to this, any mistake made either during the planning or the project stage may lead to future accidents.\nGenerally, because of the large loads transmitted to the ground due to the “arch” effect, it must be resorted to extensive foundation works.\nConcrete may be altered by the presence of meteorological or environmental agents, by increasing its resistance in direct proportion to its thickness. Increase in thickness may lead to being less demanding with the quality of the materials in order to save costs.\n- A double curvature dam must be monolithic, so that the dam site is required to be resistant and little deformable, resorting if necessary to ground improvement techniques (injections, etc.).\n- Although damage by fire is not one of the major risks for these construction projects, material warehouses, workshops and construction equipment must be equipped with their corresponding fire extinguishing equipment.\nAs for the basin (bowl-shaped piece of land which serves for containing water) and the dam site (piece of land where the dam itself is located), they are required to be impervious, so that it is necessary to prevent seepage insofar as possible. Due to this, it is vital to conduct a proper ground study in order to get to know its characteristics and mechanical behavior. For example, limestone soil which may have caverns would be bad soil, whereas marl or granite grounds (provided they are not jointed) show a good behavior.\nPelatihan terkait risiko Konstruksi Bendungan:\n(Untuk info lebih detail & konsultasi gratis tentang Risk Engineering)\n+628129992037 (Russel Effandy)\n+6281293617419 (Cepa Jasa Indonesia Center – CJIC)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:aaf64358-d485-40e8-bb02-a1bcd2bf252c>","<urn:uuid:5e285c46-fbbe-45ac-93e8-957d987b071c>"],"error":null}

This is a great time to be coming into public health, with many exciting opportunities. But students need to realize that this is a challenging career,” said Bissell.\n“This is a pivotal time for public health. We need to learn from what went well and what didn’t go so well with COVID-19. It put a spotlight on our health capabilities and infrastructure. But the core task of getting the right care and services to those that need it the most, to those that are underserved, remains.”\nPublic health services actively promote policies, systems, and overall community conditions that enable optimal health for all and seek to remove systemic and structural barriers that have resulted in health inequities.\nA public health degree provides graduates with a variety of employment opportunities, including health care settings, nonprofit organizations, public health departments, and other government agencies, while public health graduates with training in fields such as biostatistics, epidemiology and environmental health often obtain research or policy positions in government agencies, research institutions, private industry, and academic settings.\n“Students need to realize that this is a challenging career. We need to meet our clients where they are, and we must go out to them and work within the constraints we find in that environment. They will need to embrace uncertainty. The uncertainty that comes from working with people, who often have priorities and demands other than just health, and they may or may not do what you want them to do. And then there is the uncertainty of limited resources,” said Bissell.\n“We have so much to do in public health. These students made a great career investment decision four years ago, pre-pandemic, in starting on a public health pathway. They are now well placed to make an impact and have an opportunity to grow their careers in many different ways,” said Bissell.\nBissell was born and raised in the Baltimore area. She received her bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Johns Hopkins University and her M.D. from the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Board-certified in internal medicine, she served four years in the U.S. Navy as a flight surgeon. Before public health, Bissell practiced inpatient and outpatient medicine and college health.

{"question":"How do traditional biography writing practices compare with modern livestock brand registration in terms of their historical documentation purposes?","answer":"Both practices serve as historical documentation tools but in different ways. Biographies have existed since ancient times, initially focused on religious figures and evolved to become cultural and historical records, with biographers carefully documenting facts about individuals' lives. Similarly, livestock brand registration has served as a historical documentation system since 1865 in Colorado, with the oldest recorded brand dating to 1899. Both systems create lasting records - biographies preserve personal histories while brands are documented like property deeds that can be transferred, sold or inherited, creating a traceable history of ownership in the livestock industry.","context":["A bio is a comprehensive account of the life of an individual. This type of work focuses on greater than just the standard truths concerning an individual’s life, yet likewise information their experiences. A biography is an excellent method to discover somebody’s accomplishments as well as payments to the world.

In addition, bios are commonly written from the point of view of the individual’s course, sex, as well as amount of time. Although biographies are generally about individuals, they also attempt to assess their personality.\nBiographies have been written given that ancient times, however their objective has actually progressed in time. In The Center Ages, several biographies were written by devotees of a religious number. They often took their ideas from the Christian gospels or the Old Testament. In this duration, bios ended up being a lot more prominent and became bestsellers.\nBiographers need to very carefully consider their sources when covering a historic individual. Their choices need to be considered versus the general public’s right to understand. Additionally, the biographer needs to stabilize the burden of obligation for historical truth against the pain and misery experienced by other individuals. There is no global criterion for biographical principles, but Boswell as well as Manchester are eloquent instances of writers that were able to avoid these problems.\nAn excellent biographer can narrate that’s fact-based and entertaining. They can also illustrate typical qualities between various people and suggest a way humanity can advance. A great biographer additionally recognizes the emotions of their topic in relation to their target market. Nonetheless, when creating a bio, it is necessary to think of whether the tale is a story, an imaginary scholastic account, or a prophetic account.\nWhen creating a bio, a student must perform a significant amount of study to understand the subject completely.

In addition, students should provide their present employer as well as the area of proficiency they are currently working in.\nThe category of biography has a long history.

Initially, bios were seen as historic documents, yet they at some point changed right into cultural impressives. Plato’s Apology is a great example of this, while the Gospels of the Christian Scriptures have 4 bios concerning Jesus Christ. James Boswell has also improved the genre of bio with his Life of Samuel Johnson.\nAs biographers strive to portray the unfolding of a person’s life, they are faced with a problem. Biography has 2 basic goals: to share the story of a life as well as to provide a compelling picture of a person’s character. Fundamentally, the biographer is trying to understand the individual’s personality, motives, and also personality characteristics. The writer who understands their subject personally in life will certainly have the ability to draw on their very own experience to illuminate their personality.\nAnother style of bios is the documentary genre, which makes use of archival video footage and interviews to tell the story of a specific topic.

An additional instance is I Am Not Your Negro, which documents the life of the introducing American writer James Baldwin.\nComposing a bio requires a lot of study.

By integrating a psychoanalytic perspective, biographers were able to cast the subject in a much more precise light than ever before.","Brands. The return address for 3 million livestock in Colorado.\nChris Whitney grabbed a pair of worn leather gloves from his back pocket, pulled them on with his teeth and stoked the campfire and the red-hot branding irons which read Lazy T Reverse F.\nThe young calves were restless and noisy. Whitney looked across the Uncompaghre Valley at the towering snow-capped peaks of the Cimarrons and San Juans. It would be his last spring roundup at his family’s ranch in Ridgway, Colorado, before he left for college at the University of Colorado.\nArmed with a master’s degree, and a commission as an Air Force lieutenant, he was assigned, in 1968, to an intelligence unit in Vietnam (6499th Special Activities Group, based in NhaTrang).\nAfter the Air Force, he spent the next 35 years as an attorney in private practice in Washington, D.C. and Colorado, and served as an in-house litigation and general counsel to several large public companies.\nThe memories of life in the mountain valley lingered with Whitney. He returned to Colorado in 1996 and renewed acquaintances with the cattle industry, eventually being selected to serve on the State Board of Stock Inspection. In 2011, he was appointed Brand Commissioner.\nLike thousands of people in Colorado, Whitney owns a registered brand but has never used it on cattle or horses. About half of the more than 35,000 brands on file at the Brand Board are not used on livestock but designed and registered by citizens for their own enjoyment. The 4,000-year-old custom of creating brands is a necessity for livestock owners and remains valued by people who just want a brand of their own. His brand reads Bar 2D.\nI created the brand in honor of my two daughters. Every five years I pay my assessment to keep the brand. It comes to you as a deed. It passes like real property. You can buy or sell it or leave it to an estate. Brands have been a part of Colorado’s history in one form or another since 1865. The oldest brand we have on file was registered in 1899 to H.F. Dreyer of Brighton, Colorado.\nWe’ve had brands that have been transferred within families, bought and sold, so all the legal niceties that you can imagine go along with ownership — just like selling a car or real estate.\nThat’s where your legal background comes in,\nIt has been valuable, yes.\nLast year, according to your staff, the Brand Board’s 60 inspectors traveled 1.1 million miles, covering Colorado’s 104,000 square miles inspecting several million head of livestock and picking up almost 4,000 strays. And, the office staff registered more than 400 new brand applications. That’s a lot of work. How many livestock are in Colorado.\nWe estimate about three million head of livestock. Our job is to verify ownership in order to protect Colorado’s $3 billion livestock industry from loss by theft or straying. This is by far the biggest piece of what we do. We like to say brands are livestock’s “return address”. Colorado is an open range state. Livestock have always been permitted to range wherever they want. If you don’t want them on your property, you have to fence them out. The livestock owners don’t have an obligation to fence them in. So now you can see why brands are important because you can have thousands of head of cattle wandering everywhere and no one can watch every single head. Brands have always been, and still are, the identifier of choice.\n“Livestock” includes cattle, horses, mules, burros and sheep. Branding is not required in this state, but cattlemen tend to brand because their cattle roam. Horses don’t tend to wander as much and they are considerably less valuable than cattle. If you figure the “blended price” of cattle, from a calf all the way to a bull, is around $1,000 a head, that’s a lot of money walking around. You can’t give away horses in this day and age because there are too many around. So only about 50 percent of horse owners brand their horses. Almost all cattlemen brand their cattle.\nOne of the reasons for the creation of the Colorado Cattlemen’s Association, a century ago, was to solve the problem of cattle rustling. They established the brand registration system.\nIt was put together by the cattlemen because they wanted a means of protecting their herds and their livelihoods. It is still 100 percent funded by the roughly 12,900 livestock producers. We don’t receive a nickel of state money. We are funded by the fees and assessments for the brands and brand inspections. We are responsible to the people who pay us which are the men and women in the livestock industry.\nA round up and inspection tax was imposed by the young State of Colorado in 1879 and a three-member Board of Inspection Commissioners was created with the power to hire brand inspectors to inspect cattle at markets inside or outside of Colorado, and to inspect herds of cattle being shipped or driven out of the state.\nI had one person ask me one time, “Well, don’t the cattlemen resent you guys out there conducting inspections?”\nMy response is: we’re with those guys. They want us to perform this service. We’re not the enemy; we’re their allies. That doesn’t mean we always see eye to eye on things. But they see value in what we do or they wouldn’t continue to fund us.\nLivestock theft in most western states is trending upward. Cattle rustlers haven’t disappeared have they?\nThat is because the value of cattle is high and it’s worth the risk. The market for cattle is very strong and getting stronger because the total herd size is smaller. What you have is worth more. In this day and age, you can drive a truck into a pasture somewhere and quickly load some animals and be gone before anybody knows you were there.\nWhere are they taken? To resale? Straight to slaughter?\nGenerally what the thieves do is go across state lines to states that don’t have brand laws. We have very close working relationships with most of the western states, though. When we have missing cattle we talk to each other and we have a whole protocol about reporting to each other.\nLast year, we inspected 4.3 million cattle, 34,167 horses, 1,157 sheep and issued 4,582 permanent travel permits on horses. We identified ownership of lost, stolen, strayed and questionably-owned livestock valued at over $24 million.\nIt is very tough for you to go straight to slaughter because you will be required to show brand papers upon arrival. If you take them to sale, the same is true. If you show up without papers, we’ll seize the animal. We may allow it to be sold, but we’ll hold the proceeds from the sale until you can demonstrate, through a brand inspection, or some other means satisfactory to us, that you are the owner.\nWe also license sale barns, certified feedlots and alternative livestock, which are captive domestic elk and fallow deer. We inspect them just like we inspect cattle.\nHas the method of branding changed to computer chips, ear tags, bar codes, that sort of thing?\nHot iron branding is still the preferred method. That’s because most branding is still done outside and no one has a that long of an extension cord for an electric branding iron. Horse brands tend to be applied with a method called freeze branding.\nWhat about altering brands? Is that still attempted?\nYes. Absolutely. Altering a brand is a felony. There are a plethora of statues that deal with livestock and branding. If you steal livestock for example, you face penalties under the livestock laws and felonies for theft under criminal laws. Theft is theft. That said, there are number of laws that are peculiar to branding and the livestock industry.\n_________________________The High Lonesome You can feel all alone in a city that’s big,\nWhere people will walk all over someone\nAnd not care a fig.\nYou see that, and your nerves come undone. You need to light out to the High Lonesome.\nCome out to repair the rips in your psyche and soul.\nBetter that than to bury yourself in some city hole.\nCome out to the High Lonesome, and be back in control. Look at the forest, and don’t miss the trees.\nSmell the freshness in the mountain meadow breeze.\nSpy a stag unawares drinking from a stream with no cares.\nWonder at the stars, and forget about putting on airs.

{"question":"How do successful projects serve their stakeholders while ensuring effective knowledge management across the organization?","answer":"Projects serve stakeholders by creating value for customers, society members, employees, owners, and team members, with success measured by net value creation. The interests of these stakeholders should be aligned rather than seen as conflicting. For example, an organization's profit interest is realized by providing value to customers who pay for project products. Regarding knowledge management, organizations implement structured approaches through PMOs to ensure effective knowledge transfer. This includes developing knowledge-sharing platforms, establishing knowledge brokers who specify critical knowledge to be transferred, and creating a knowledge-sharing culture. The knowledge transfer process must address both explicit and tacit knowledge, with particular emphasis on capturing valuable tacit knowledge that is learned through collaborative experience and interpretation of events. Success in both areas - stakeholder value creation and knowledge management - requires effective communication and a supportive organizational culture.","context":["Chapter 2: Lean Project Management (LeanPM) Principles\nLean Project Management (LeanPM) can only be fully utilized by an organization that builds and sustains a lean culture in its quest to become a Lean organization, that is one that continuously provides net value to its stakeholders in a continuously improving way. Given this important condition, LeanPM principles describe the philosophy and mindset necessary for project success. The principles are not independent. They reinforce each other and work as a system.\nThe Lean Project Management principles are one pillar of LeanPM, with the other pillar and theoretical foundation being the creation-flow-value generation model of project management. Read here about the concept and pillars of Lean Project Management.\nThe six lean project management (LeanPM) principles are:\n1) Serve People\nThis principle is at the heart of LeanPM. Projects benefit people, and people undertake projects. That is why this principle has two aspects: “for people” and “by people”.\nTo serve people is the only reason for a project to exist. Projects should serve customers, society members, employees, owners and team members. They need to receive specific benefits, depending on their particular interests and needs. These interests should not be seen as conflicting. In fact, they are mutually supportive. It is perfectly possible to align the interests of these stakeholders, and the project should aim for that.\nFor example, the interest of a business organization and its owners in profiting from a project is realized by providing value to the customer who pays for the project products. To build a sustainable business, the organization must deliver value to the customer base on which the business depends. The client and the organization reward project team members in various ways for creating value for them.\nTherefore, the most important question for any project is:\n\"How does this project serve people?\"\nProjects do not happen just because:\n- we have a brilliant idea\n- the project is aligned with the strategy\n- the top management supports the project\n- we have secured funding for the project\n- we have a good project plan\n- the client is willing to pay for the products\n- … etc.\nAll these things are important. But what turns a potential project into a real project is the people who work on it. They breathe life into the project, create its deliverables, and deliver benefits.\nProjects are “human beings”:\n- Success or failure of a project depends only on people.\n- People create the whole value of a project.\n- People's problems are at the root of all project problems.\n- People make all decisions and all mistakes in a project.\n- People build quality in.\n- The untapped potential of people is the root cause of all project waste.\nTherefore, the most crucial question of project management is:\n\"How can people's potential be unleashed so they can make a project successful?\"\nFrom this point of view, we should value any project management method, practice, technique or tool only in terms of its ability to facilitate and serve people working on and benefiting from a specific project.\n2) Create Value and Eliminate Waste\nThe total project value is a combination of the following values:\n- Value for the customer\n- Value for the project owner (the sponsoring organization)\n- Value for the project team members and project partners and\n- Value for the society\nWe measure the success of a project by its net value. Projects that do not create value create waste. Projects that create value that is less than the costs they generate have a negative return, which is also a manifestation of waste.\nTo increase the net value of the project and the return on investment, we need to:\n- increase the value created by the project\n- reduce project costs by eliminating waste\nProject value is something beneficial, useful, worthwhile or important to a project stakeholder. The value for each project stakeholder is a function of the customer value resulting from a customer’s appreciation of project outputs.\nValue is a subjective perception of a positive change in one’s status or state. It’s often pointed out that customers place value on project outputs through their willingness to pay for them. But for non-profit projects, we should replace the willingness to pay with a willingness to use/consume project outputs.\nThe project translates the client's willingness to pay and/or use the project's outputs into certain characteristics, such as features, price, quality, time and place. These characteristics objectify the value, but we must remember that value always has subjective components and many aspects that we cannot easily objectify.\nLet’s assume a customer pays for and uses a project product. Has the customer realized the value of the product? Not necessarily. This will only happen if the customer's status or state has changed as desired because of using the project product. In other words, if the project product is used in the customer’s value stream, which generates the (expected) benefits for the customer. The expected value (the value paid for) and the realized value may differ.\nThe project value for an organization is measured by economic return (profit), or social return on investment for non-profit projects. The organization receives value from the project by delivering value to its customers. Value is delivered either directly from the project to external customers who use the project deliverables, or to the organization’s customers who use its products and services. In the latter case, the project deliverables are used within the organization’s value stream system. Therefore, the focus of any project should be to create value for the ultimate customer.\nA project that creates value:\n- is based on a complete understanding of customer value\n- is aligned with the organizational strategy and the value stream system\n- is designed to create and deliver value effectively\n- applies value-based metrics\n- fully engages the customer and adapts to changes in the needs and the perception of value\n- manages value delivery\n- continuously tests and validates value hypotheses\nWaste in a project is anything that does not add value to the customer – and hence, to the project owner organization – but absorbs project resources. The greater the waste, the lower the return on project investment. As we will discuss in the next chapters, the waste can lead not only to lower return but even to a negative return, which may go below minus 100% of the initial investment. Therefore, one of the most important tasks of project management is to identify and eliminate project waste.\n3) Build Knowledge and Continuously Improve\nKnowledge building and continuous improvement are closely related and play an important role in project success.\nKnowledge is understanding of something; knowing the facts, circumstances, relationships and behaviors associated with the project is important. What makes it even more important is that continuous improvement is only possible when we base it on knowledge intentionally created for this purpose.\nProjects undertaken under uncertainty should be viewed as knowledge-creating initiatives. We should base them on hypotheses that we should test and validate. If we prove a hypothesis to be invalid, we must change the project based on the knowledge gained. The knowledge creation continues with definition and testing of new hypotheses. Each cycle of knowledge creation should improve the net value of the project. Similarly, stakeholder feedback should be used on product increments to build knowledge, to improve project value.\nKnowledge alone is not sufficient to judge, decide, and act. It works in a system together with learning, skills and wisdom.\nKnowledge-building refers to creating, transmitting and keeping knowledge. In the context of the project management process, knowledge about successful and unsuccessful practices for improving the process needs to be created. We create such knowledge through the application of a defined process that is continuously subject (after we establish a baseline) to change through experiments. We measure the success of the experiments by the change in the net value of the project. Through the experiments, we create knowledge that serves to improve the process and create a new baseline, which is challenged in its turn.\nExplicit knowledge can be formalized and codified in written, verbal or audio-visual form. This makes it easier to pass on to others.\nTacit knowledge, on the other hand, is gained from personal experience and is expressed as intuition, subjective judgment, or insight. It cannot be formalized, and it is difficult to transmit.\n\"We know more than we can tell.\"\n- Michael Polanyi\nThe following may be useful to retain explicit and tacit knowledge:\n- Establish a culture of knowledge-creation and sharing\n- Foster social interaction\n- Use of cross-functional project teams and on-the-job knowledge sharing\n- Osmotic communication\n- Formalizing knowledge in guides, manuals, tutorials, lessons learned, standard work processes, audio-visual materials\nThere are two aspects of continuous improvement related to project management.\nThe first aspect refers to the improvement of the project management process. In lean project management, the areas subject to continuous improvement are:\n- Customer value definition and project alignment\n- The design of the temporary value stream (project design)\n- The customer pull system\n- Waste elimination\n- The flow of project value\n- Plan-do-check-act processes\nThe second aspect relates to the organization’s continuous improvement. A considerable part of it comprises daily improvements. Other improvements require greater effort and management structure, and we implement them through projects. The success of these projects plays a key role in continuous improvement of the organization.\n4) Apply Systems Thinking\nA system is a collection of entities and links between them that form a whole which is more than the sum of the individual entities. There are several project-related systems:\n- the organization that owns the project\n- the extended enterprise that includes the organization and its customers, suppliers and partners\n- the value stream systems of the organization and customer\n- the individual value streams (the value streams of each product and service)\n- the project itself\n- the configuration of project deliverables\n- the project team\nSystem thinking requires that:\n- We should not try to analyze the components of the system independently.\n- We should not attempt to improve individual components, but rather the whole system.\n- We must account for the interrelations between the components of the system. A change in one component may affect other components or the whole system.\n- We should create systems whose components fit well together.\n- We should be conscious of system dynamics.\nFor example, we should not aim to improve the productivity of individual team members or specific parts of a value stream, but the productivity of the team and the whole value stream, respectively.\nHuman behavior and mental models are the major factors that affect the performance of project-related systems.\nUnless project management takes into consideration the systemic character of projects, many projects are doomed to failure.\n5) Communicate and Collaborate Effectively\nUndoubtedly, inefficient communication and collaboration are a major reason for project failure. They are at the root of any delay, cost overrun, quality issue, misunderstanding of stakeholder expectations, lack of project alignment, and waste.\nCommunication is the act of sharing meanings between people. The purpose of communication is to inform, express feelings and emotions, share ideas, thoughts and knowledge, and to influence. Through communication, people reach mutual understanding and facilitate each other's growth.\nOne cannot perform project management, and project stakeholders cannot co-create value without communication. To be effective, the project-related communication should be:\n- Meaningful (should add value)\n- Transparent (everyone on the project should be able to see the work of the others, which will facilitate finding ways for improvement)\n… and as much as possible:\nIn a project context, collaboration is a process where stakeholders work together to co-create value for each party. Effective collaboration requires involvement of all stakeholders in creating project value from concept to realization. Those stakeholders should be empowered to own the project and motivated to bring project benefits into existence. Lean projects are not created for the customer, but created with the customer.\nCo-creation continually engages all stakeholders in reaching mutual understanding and consensus on the shared goals and the value that the project will create for each party. This process relies on the collective wisdom and the full potential of people involved. Co-creation is facilitated by effective communication, servant leadership, collaborative and decentralized project management, and a self-organizing project team that includes the client and the partners.\n“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”\n- Leonardo da Vinci\nWe'd love to hear from you.\nShare your thoughts in the comments below!\n de Bono, Edward (1998).

Penguin Books","How to Support Knowledge Transfer through PMOs\nMUSTAFA HAFIZOGLU PMP\nSDT Space and Defense Tech.\nBURAK ATAGUN PMP\nSDT Space and Defense Tech.\nKnowledge is being gained through a challenging path and it has great value for a company to survive and be competitive. As projects are completed, knowledge is accumulated and re-usability increases. In turn, the value of knowledge and its transfer also increasingly becomes the main focus of companies.\nThis paper, analyzes the challenges of managing and transferring knowledge and introduces some relevant key concepts such as data, information, and knowledge. The knowledge transfer life cycle, which is already mentioned in PMI's Pulse of the Profession®: Capturing the Value of Project Management Through Knowledge Transfer will be visited, and based on this cycle the method used in PPMO (project portfolio management office) at SDT (Space and Defense Tech.) will be explained in the Knowledge Transfer Framework in SDT topic with the following three headings: Developing a knowledge-sharing platform, creating knowledge sharing culture, and evaluating knowledge transfer success.\nPPMO of SDT has been assigned a new role: knowledge broker. The function and responsibility of this new role, as well as the results and impacts of applying it to projects will be presented.\nKeywords: knowledge, PMO, broker, culture, people\nKnowledge is becoming an even more powerful element to create unique products and services than ever. Meanwhile, transferring this knowledge within the organization from one project to another, from retiring staff to younger staff, and from outside of the organization to inside of the organization also gets more challenging.\nThe journey starting with data, then becoming information, and ending with knowledge is costly for any organization. The culture and the people are the two main factors affecting the effectiveness of this journey. The first part of the paper will be explaining these concepts and factors.\nThe main challenges to manage the knowledge will be explained in the second part of the paper from the perspective of complexity, uncertainty, and culture.\nThe knowledge transfer life cycle will be visited and Space and Defense Tech.'s (SDT's) approach for each step will be presented. As this approach reveals a framework, the role of “knowledge broker” is to be introduced. The conclusion of the paper analyses the gain and impact of this approach.\nDEFINING CONCEPTS AND FACTORS\nData is the structural value of the organization. As data is collected and analyzed, information is created so that decisions can be made. Organizations may have systems such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) to collect data and may have tools to analyze this data. On the other hand, the challenging part begins with communicating this information at the right time, to the right people, in the right way, and with the right content. That's why project managers spend most of their time by communicating. Effective communication positively affects the success of the project however it's not as effective for the new-starting projects. This is because the information is generally specific to the project itself unless very similar parts are planned to be used again in the coming project. What affects the success of the new-coming project is the experience, wisdom, and insight gained from the previous projects. This is simply called knowledge.\nKnowledge can be explicit or tacit. Explicit knowledge is easier to get transferred whereas tacit knowledge is encoded knowledge which needs to be interpreted and is difficult to transfer. Many researchers admitted that tacit knowledge is crucial for building sustainable development (Cavusgil, Calanlone, & Zhao, 2003). Hence this paper especially will focus on the transfer of tacit knowledge, which is learned through collaborative and/or individual experience, and interpretations of events.\nOrganizational culture and environment, and people are two key factors affecting the success of knowledge transfer. Informal communication level, lack of trust, and turnover rate may shape the culture, resulting in effective or ineffective knowledge transfer. Expectations, happiness, and feeling valuable may determine the people's perspective to knowledge transfer.\nProjects increasingly become global in terms of using resources, having customers and suppliers. A greater variety of disciplines is getting involved in the projects and uncertainty level is not decreasing. Hence, increasing complexity and uncertainty are the first two challenges for the knowledge to capture and transfer.\nIdentifying and capturing knowledge for an employee during operational work or executing a project is not at first priority for this employee most of the time. Achieving his task is more important. Hence organizational culture is another challenge to motivate these employees to get involved in knowledge transfer cycles.\nKNOWLEDGE TRANSFER FRAMEWORK IN SDT\nPMI's Pulse of the Profession®: Capturing the Value of Project Management Through Knowledge Transfer defines the steps of the knowledge transfer life cycle as Identifying, Capturing, Sharing, Applying, and Assessing. PPMO is assigned for the knowledge transfer in SDT by the executive management, and PPMO has used these steps to develop its own knowledge transfer structure as summarized in Exhibit 1.\nExhibit 1: The Knowledge Transfer Structure of SDT.\nPPMO first established a categorization of knowledge before the Identifying step as follows: Knowledge created outside the company, knowledge accumulated in the reusability database, knowledge not known formally but informally within the company. This categorization helps determine the essential knowledge to transfer and an assessment phase specific to each project is defined before a project is initiated in order to elaborate this categorization.\nPPMO identifies knowledge brokers (KBs), who are responsible to specify critical knowledge to be transferred. The main characteristics of knowledge brokers can be stated as follows:\n- KB is not a role in the hierarchy of the organization\n- KBs can be project managers, systems engineers, or any other key team members.\n- PPMO is responsible to identify and lead KBs\n- KBs are expected to smooth out the barriers to access knowledge\n- KBs are expected to utilize the knowledge-sharing platform effectively\n- KBs are expected to help creating knowledge-sharing culture\nPPMO guides knowledge brokers on how to identify and capture the knowledge at different phases of the project. This guidance is also defined in the project governance management plan of each project.\nPPMO has established a knowledge-sharing platform called a knowledge bank and knowledge brokers are key members of this platform and all the employees have access to this platform. The structure of this platform is designed so that there is an active link between ongoing projects and this platform. For example, a lessons-learned knowledge of a project is designed such that lessons learned are accumulated throughout the project life cycle and each lessons learned is linked to an action item, which is also put in the knowledge bank. The aim of generating an action item is to analyze the effects of that lessons-learned to the organization and other projects and put this knowledge to the knowledge bank.\nKnowledge brokers are the key persons to make sharing a habit within the organization. People need a trustworthy environment as well as expect to have a benefit so that they share knowledge. PPMO is expected to suggest ways to create such a knowledge sharing culture.\nTo be able to measure knowledge transfer success is also crucial for a sustainable knowledge sharing culture. PPMO defines metrics and makes analysis according to the collected data and presents benefits. Examples for metrics are as follows: reusability level, project success rates, interaction rate between the knowledge bank and the people, number of knowledge brokers, and so forth.\nGaining knowledge, identifying specific knowledge, capturing it, sharing and assessing the value of this captured knowledge…each step is very challenging and each step is related with people and culture which makes this challenge even more difficult to achieve. On the other hand if an organization succeeds in transferring the right valuable knowledge then it will gain an incredible competitive advantage. SDT is aware of this benefit and the structure it has established already started to show the gains.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nMustafa Hafizoglu, PMP, has 17 years of experience in hardware and software development projects, especially on aerospace and defense industry.

{"question":"¿Cuál es más efectivo para minimizar la fricción durante la perforación: sonic drilling o gundrilling when considering wear and mechanical properties?","answer":"Sonic drilling is more effective at minimizing friction during drilling. It features friction-reducing qualities that affect both the drill string and drill bit through inertia effects, liquefaction, and temporary soil porosity reduction. This results in requiring less power compared to traditional drilling methods. In contrast, gundrills experience increased friction as they wear out, requiring more thrust and torque while producing more run-out and experiencing greater drift, eventually leading to failure.","context":["If you have a relevant background in the oil exploration and drilling industry, you’d understand why you must be familiar with the many different kinds of drilling techniques. Like for instance, you need to know what makes sonic rig drilling work that major industry players prefer to use it over other available drilling methods.\nSonic drilling is a qualified technique to penetrate the soil. This ground penetration technique is sought out by companies when they need to drill into the ground for various purposes due to its friction-reducing quality that occurs both on the drill string and the drill bit due to inertia effects, liquefaction, as well as the temporary soil porosity reduction. The combination of all these factors makes it possible to have seamless penetration for many different kinds of soil quality.\nBesides, this technique also makes the penetration rate in the vast majority of bedrock types faster.\nGenerating Sonic Vibration with the Drill Head\nDrill heads normally house the oscillator, which is highly responsible for the generation of resonant, high-frequency energy. Usually, this is directed into the drill string. While drilling is in progress, the rotational movement is combined with resonant energy. By this measure, there is an even distribution of the energy and this will leave an impact on the drill string and drill bit of tooling.\nDrill operators have full control over the intensity of sonic vibration that the drill head will generate. This will significantly help in matching up the required force needed in penetrating bedrock and soil formations.\nSonic Rig Mechanics\nIf you will try to engage a powerful drill head, you’re taking the entire drill string to a vibration frequency reaching as high as 150 Hz. This will induce the drill string and bit to lose hold of its structure. And with this, it will also reduce soil friction and drill cuttings so they become extremely loose to the point of assuming a liquified form. Thus, it can be flushed or removed easily from the borehole.\nThe drill bit vibrations will render the soil to significantly lose its porosity and density, and eventually its structure. By this measure, the soil and cuttings will get moved in the sample barrel as well as up the drill string, helping your tooling to freely advance on its own.\nThe inertia effects and liquefaction allows for the collection of continuous and long samples. And because of the presence of the high-frequency vertical movement, the odds are high that the drill string will be staying extremely straight yet with very little possibility of deflection.\nLess power, fewer problems\nDue to the reduced amount of friction that will likely occur on the drill string length, sonic rig drilling will require lesser amounts of power to achieve the exact or same drilling power as what can be witnessed from other traditional drilling methods. This is one attribute that is solely unique to sonic drilling and will help in keeping torsional forces to begin appearing on the drill string.\nAnother major benefit that can be enjoyed from applying sonic high frequency is how easy and seamless is the process of retrieving the drill string, even when working on quick expanding clays, boulders, and other similar but difficult or challenging conditions. All drilling rods, toolings, and casings can be pulled easier and way faster.\nSonic Drilling Means Clean Drilling\nThere are a handful of situations where you want to shy away from using air, drilling mud, or even water while drilling work is in progress. In a sonic type of drilling, they are not necessary. Hence, this is the reason why it is the most preferred geo-construction, environmental and geotechnical applications.\nEnvironmental projects will also enjoy significant savings on their costs if they will take advantage of the sonic type of drilling method. These kinds of drilling projects necessitate a good amount of time and money so that project managers will be able to properly dispose of their investigation derived drilling waste.\nAlso, in every mining project, there is a leach pad. If you add air or water it is going to be a disturbance and may influence the soil’s mechanical properties. Under extreme cases, doing so may bring about the possibility of erosion which can pave the way for failure of drilling operations such as a partial landslide.","The modern gundrill is an engineering high tech marvel, a well-designed piece of equipment that does one thing exceptionally well: producing round, straight holes with enhanced cylindricity even at its deepest points. And it does all this while simultaneously providing a fine I.D. finish and excellent tool life.\nLike all tools, gundrills wear out. While a talented operator can still drill a hole with a worn gundrill, it will more often result in a loss of hole tolerance and finish at best. As gundrills wear, they require more thrust and torque while producing more run-out and experiencing greater drift . A dull cutting edge will produce irregular chips, which in turn cause spikes in coolant pressure – sure signs that failure is imminent.\nUnlike some tools, gundrills are excellent candidates for resharpening. When performed correctly, the same gundrill can be resharpened to perform as well as a new drill as many as 8 to 10 times. The only visible difference will be seen in the length of solid carbide on the gundrill’s tip.\nEven coated drills can be sharpened. Naturally, this will reveal the raw carbide on the face, but this does not impact performance. The coating will remain on the wear pads and continue to improve the gundrill’s size control and ability to leave behind a finished surface . Tool life will be impacted, but the only other option is having it fully resharpened and re-coated by the OEM, which will likely be less cost effective.\nStraightness control in deep hole gundrilling of is challenging. The drills are found to degrade rapidly on the cutting edges, bearing pads and side margins, largely due to the extreme heat resistivity of the high temperature superalloys. Severe adhesive wear developed on the rake and flank faces deteriorates cutting efficiencies of the cutting edges while diffusive wear on the bearing pads and side margins deteriorates self-piloting efficacies of the drill. Coupled with highly irregular wear rates on the inner and outer cutting edges, the drills are forced against the hole at high rotational speeds – leading to escalations in frictional contact, heating and thermal damage on the bearing pads and side margins. As a consequence, the drills are deflected from the designated drilling course and resulted in straightness deviation on the part of hole drilled. Through the accumulation of partial straightness deviation over the course of high aspect ratio drilling, the final hole produced is deflected in a constant trend as governed by the rate and behaviour of tool degradation.\nThe machine adopts precision rolling track, high-speed motor.

{"question":"What are the color differences between runway lights and taxiway lights in airport movement areas, and how do they compare to the colors used in approach lighting systems like MALSR?","answer":"Runways use white lights, with white edge lights, centerline lights, and touchdown zone lights. In contrast, taxiways are illuminated with blue edge lights and green centerline lights. The MALSR approach lighting system uses white lights, specifically sequenced flashing white lights leading to an array of steady burning white lights to provide horizontal guidance to the runway.","context":["Preventing runway incursions is one of the Federal Aviation Administration’s highest priorities. Not only do they have the potential to put lives at risk due to the number and proximity of aircraft operating on the airport surface, but they take place in a complex and dynamic environment.\nFrom a safety perspective, an airport is divided into two distinct areas: the Movement Area, which is under the control of air traffic, and usually includes the runways, taxiways, and other areas of an airport that aircraft use for taxiing, takeoff, and landing; and, the Non-Movement Area, which includes taxi lanes, aprons, ramps, and other areas not under the control of air traffic. The movement of aircraft or vehicles (i.e., tugs) within the non-movement area is the responsibility of the pilot, mechanics, the vehicle operator, or airport management.\nIn addition to watching for moving aircraft, be careful not to get too close to a parked aircraft. Aside from nicks and dents that are expensive to repair, you could be hurt if an aircraft suddenly started its engine and you were too close. You should also be aware of the problem of jet blast or prop wash. There have been several cases where vehicles have been overturned by jet blast. If a pilot is about to start the engine(s) or the engine(s) are running, the aircraft’s beacon should be flashing. At most airports, the movement and non-movement areas are separated by a solid yellow line and a dashed yellow line (Figure 1).\nIt is permissible to cross from the dashed side to the solid side; however, ATC permission is always required to cross from the solid side to the dashed side at an airport with an operating control tower.\nAs an operator of a vehicle, get the controller’s permission before going onto a runway or taxiway, the associated safety areas, or any other part of the movement area. There are at least two ways to get permission: by radio or advanced coordination with ATC. Check the airport diagram and be sure of the location of the movement areas.\nSurface Incidents, Runway Incursions\nA surface incident is a broad term encompassing all movement areas (including runways and taxiways) and is any event where unauthorized or unapproved movement occurs within the movement area, or an occurrence in the movement area associated with the operation of an aircraft that affects or could affect the safety of flight. Surface incidents may be caused by pilots and reported as pilot deviations (PD); by vehicle drivers or pedestrians and reported as vehicle/pedestrian deviations (V/PD); or, by air traffic control and reported as operational errors/deviations (OE/OD). FAA further classifies a surface incident as either a runway incursion or a non-runway incursion.\nA runway incursion is any occurrence on the airport runway environment involving an aircraft, vehicle, person, or object on the ground that creates a collision hazard or results in a loss of required separation with an aircraft taking off, intending to take off, landing, or intending to land.”\nThe vast majority of vehicle operators perform their tasks in the non-movement area of the airport. Ramps have markings for aircraft parking and tiedowns. Some ramps also have special markings for vehicle operations. If there are vehicle or roadway markings, always drive the vehicle within marked areas. In addition, taxilanes may be marked on the apron to show aircraft routes to gates and parking areas.\nInadvertent entry by vehicles onto movement and non-movement areas poses a danger to both the vehicle operator and aircraft that are attempting to land or take off, or that are maneuvering on the airport. Methods for controlling access to the airside vary depending on the type and location of the airport.\nSince January 2000, vehicle operators have been involved in approximately 1,958 surface incidents/runway incursions. After analyzing the preliminary incident reports, it was found that the vehicle operators did not have any problem with communications, or communicating with air traffic.\nAs a matter of fact, air traffic reported vehicle operators had acknowledged and read the instructions back correctly; however, they still proceeded into the movement area, crossed active runways, and entered active taxiways without proper authorization or clearance. When the completed investigation reports were analyzed, it became apparent that quite a few of the vehicle operators may have been unfamiliar with the markings and signs that were associated with ATC instructions.\nRecognition and understanding of markings, especially those associated with ATC instructions, is of paramount importance to preventing incursions. Through communications, FAA seeks to determine if it was a failure on the part of vehicle operators to recognize airport markings that lead to the incursions, or if operators were preoccupied performing other tasks.\nAirport operators should keep vehicular and pedestrian activity on the airside of the airport to a minimum. Vehicles on the airside of the airport should be limited to those necessary to support the operation of aircraft services, cargo and passenger services, emergency, and maintenance of the airport. Vehicles should use service roads or public roads in lieu of crossing movement areas whenever possible. Where vehicular traffic on airport operation areas cannot be avoided, it should be carefully controlled.\nNavigating the Airfield\nMost towered airports have markings, signs, and lights designed to assist in navigating around an airfield.\nRunways are identified by wide, white-painted edge lines and a white-painted dashed centerline. Taxiways are marked with double yellow-painted edge lines and a yellow-painted solid centerline. The yellow taxiway centerlines may lead on, off, or cross a runway.\nDuring low visibility or night operations, the runways, in addition to the white-painted markings, have white lights along the edge, centerline, and touchdown zone. However, on instrument runways the last 2,000 feet will have yellow edge lights. Taxiways are illuminated with blue edge lights (or reflectors) and green centerline lights (or reflectors). Vehicle operators need to know that when these markings, signs, and lights are missed or ignored, the opportunity for errors increases. Guidance on how to operate safely in the airport environment is critical.","by Jonathan M. Stern\nNon-Terminal VOR Approach\nYou can resume your position over the Bradley VORTAC by recalling the situation that you saved when you neared the destination. Then, you can execute the VOR Rwy 24 approach to Bradley International Airport.\nFirst, you need to call up the situation that you saved on the way into the Bradley International Airport terminal area, named Bradley. Recall that you were over the VORTAC at 3,000 feet when you saved the situation. To retrieve it:\n- From the Options menu, select Situations.\n- Choose Bradley from the list and press the OK button.\nFigure 18.1 is the VOR or TACAN or GPS Rwy 24 IAP chart for Bradley International Airport. You can review the significant items on this chart for planning and executing your approach.\nFigure 18.1. VOR or TACAN or GPS Rwy 24—Windsor Locke. Connecticut.\nThe plan view depicts the Bradley VORTAC, the various segments of the instrument approach, and the feeder routes, which provide the bridge between the enroute navigation system and the approach environment. With this approach, there are two routes depicted to transition from the enroute environment to the approach.\nThe first option is from Putnam VORTAC. This option is indicated by the thick line and arrow running from Putnam to ERICS intersection. An aircraft over Putnam flies along the 302° radial from Putnam for 29.1 nautical miles at or above 3,000 feet to join the final approach course. Because you are beginning the approach at the Bradley VORTAC, try flying the second option.\nThe plan view contains various communication radio frequencies in the order that you are likely to use them for an approach. First is the ATIS, which you should monitor as soon as it comes in range on your trip inbound. Then, in the correct order, are approach control, tower, and ground. Although Flight Simulator does not take advantage of these frequencies, some of the add-on programs that you will read about do use them.\nThe plan view also reflects all of the courses necessary to fly the approach segments, including the missed approach, should that become necessary. You can see that the final approach course is 240° and that the way you need to get established inbound on the final approach course is to fly outbound on the Bradley 60° radial to ERICS intersection.\nWhen a holding pattern, rather than a procedure turn, is depicted, the holding pattern method for course reversal is mandatory. A teardrop entry is used in this type of situation (when the holding fix is reached in a direction 180° from the holding direction). A teardrop entry is made by turning the airplane 30° toward the outbound leg, or to a heading of 90 degrees. The 90° heading is maintained for one minute before a left standard rate turn is used to turn onto the inbound course.\nThe 10 NM ring reflects that everything within 10 nautical miles of DENNO intersection is drawn to scale. The location of the enroute facilities depicted on the chart may or may not be drawn to scale.\nThe profile view generally contains information about altitudes to be flown during the approach. In this case, you can see that the minimum altitude in the holding pattern is 3,000 feet. As is almost always the case, the holding pattern is a one minute holding pattern, meaning a one minute inbound leg.\nAfter the holding pattern is completed and the airplane is inbound and established on the final approach course, the airplane may descend to 2,200 feet.\nDENNO intersection, identified by 6.8 DME from Bradley, is the final approach fix. The final approach fix is indicated by the Maltese Cross. After the airplane passes DENNO, descent to the MDA is permitted. The approach also contains a VDP, however, as is indicated by the V at the BDL 2.2 DME point. This VDP limits descent below the MDA until the VDP is reached—even though the runway may be in sight earlier.\nFinally, the .9 DME from BDL denotes the missed approach point. Although the VORTAC is on the airport, the missed approach point is actually reached almost a mile before the VORTAC. Aircraft that are not equipped with DME must use time flown from the FAF to identify the MAP. The bottom of the profile view also contains the distances between the various fixes along the approach.\nFrom the minima section, you need only note the MDA and requisite visibility for your category A aircraft (see Table 18.1). It is also helpful to check the airport diagram to see how the approach lines up with the runway. In this case, you should expect to be slightly right of the runway centerline at the completion of the approach.\n|Approach Category||1.3 Vso (Knots)|\nWhen you unpause, turn right to join the Bradley 60° radial outbound while maintaining 3,000 feet. Doing so requires a 20 or 30 degree intercept. You need to backtrack to ERICS intersection, which is an IAF, or initial approach fix, for this approach. An IAP can have one IAF or many.\nNote that ERICS can be identified either by the 60 degree radial at 14.0 DME or by the Bradley 60 degree radial where it intersects the Barnes 121° radial.\nWhen you arrive at ERICS, you need to turn the airplane around and head back toward the airport. The method depicted for the course reversal is the holding pattern (the racetrack shape). It is a mandatory procedure. You are not free to substitute some other form of course reversal when a holding pattern is depicted on the approach chart.\nAt ERICS, follow these steps:\n- Note the time and turn right to a heading of 90°.\n- At the same time, tune the OBI to the inbound course of 240°.\n- The beginning of the course reversal is also a good time to slow the airplane to approach speed, which in the Cessna is generally 90 KIAS.\nThese steps can be remembered as the four Ts: time, turn, throttle, and tune.\nThis holding pattern entry is known as a teardrop procedure. Holding pattern entries can be of the direct, parallel, or teardrop method. The appropriate method is determined by the direction from which you approach the holding pattern. The teardrop method requires that you turn 30° toward the outbound leg of the holding pattern.\nAfter one minute has passed, begin a standard rate left turn toward the final approach course of 240 degrees. As the airplane nears the inbound course, note any deflection of the CDI and roll out with an intercept angle of 20 or 30 degrees. (Figure 18.2 shows the airplane when it's about to cross ERICS.)\nFigure 18.2. This airplane is about to cross ERICS and used a 30 degree intercept to return to the final approach course after flying one circuit in the holding pattern.\nAs the CDI centers, turn to 240° and use normal VOR tracking procedures to follow the final approach course.\nNote on the profile section of the chart that a descent to 2,200 feet is permissible after the aircraft passes ERICS inbound. The next intersection of importance to the approach is DENNO, which can be identified by 6.8 DME or the 158 degree radial off Barnes. DENNO is the final approach fix, which is indicated by the Maltese Cross in the profile view. As you pass DENNO, note the time, lower the landing gear, begin the descent to the MDA, and report final approach fix inbound to ATC (in a nonradar environment).\nFigure 18.3 shows the airplane just inside the FAF with the landing gear extended. You can tell the airplane is just inside DENNO for several reasons:\nFigure 18.3. This airplane is just inside of DENNO.\n- The DME reads 6.5.\n- The NAV 2 CDI, which is set to the Barnes 158 degree radial, is slightly left of center.\n- The airplane is descending and below 2,200 feet\nFinal approach fix inbound is where you typically lower the landing gear in preparation for landing. On an ILS approach, the gear should be lowered as the airplane intercepts the glideslope. Doing so typically provides sufficient time to use a manual method of gear extension should the electrical system fail. In the 182RG, there is a hand pump that acts as a backup to the normal system.\nThe Before Landing checklist should be completed prior to or just inside the final approach fix. For Flight Simulator purposes, this calls for:\n- landing gear extended and checked\n- fuel selector on both tanks, mixture rich\n- propeller to high RPM\n- carburetor heat on as needed\n- GUMP check (gas, undercarriage, mixture, and propeller)\nThe GUMP check is a last check to ensure that the fuel is selected to the fullest tank (or, in the case of many Cessnas, to both tanks), the landing gear is down and locked (three in the green), the mixture is set to full rich, and the propeller is at high RPMs.\nThe MDA for a straight-in approach on this approach is 560 feet, The 390 is the height above touchdown (HAT) at the MDA. There are several additional significant points along the approach:\n- First, at 2.2 DME, a visual descent point is indicated by the letter V. A visual descent point is the point along the approach at which a normal descent and landing can be made from the MDA.\n- The significance of the VDP is that, if you have the landing runway in sight prior to reaching the VDP, you should not descend below the MDA until you actually reach the VDP. There is a tendency to descend below a normal glidepath when flying in reduced visibility or at night. That is the reason that VDPs were established for certain non-precision approaches.\nFigure 18.4 shows the Cessna at the VDP (note that the VASI indicates that the airplane is on glidepath).\nFigure 18.4. With the airplane at the visual descent point, the VASI (see arrow) indicates that the aircraft is on a proper glidepath.\nThe missed approach point, depicted by the point where the thick course line becomes dashed, signifies the point in space at which the missed approach procedure must begin if the runway environment has not come into view, or if the airplane is not in a position from which a normal approach and landing can be made.\nAccordingly, if you get to .9 DME and don't have the runway environment in sight, you must begin the missed approach procedure. If that happens, you must report to ATC that you are executing the missed approach procedure and advise ATC of your intentions (try again, proceed to alternate, or proceed elsewhere).\nThe following items may be visually observed to determine whether the runway environment is in sight:\n- The approach light system, except that the pilot may not descend below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable\n- The threshold\n- The threshold markings\n- The threshold lights\n- The runway end identifier lights\n- The visual approach slope indicator\n- The touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings\n- The touchdown zone lights\n- The runway or runway markings\n- The runway lights\nApproach lights help the pilot make the transition to visual flying. Approach lights make the runway environment more visible and help the pilot align the airplane with the runway.\nAirports use a variety of approach light systems, as illustrated in Figure 18.5.\nFigure 18.5. There are several different approach lighting systems.\nThe most common on the standard Flight Simulator database is the MALSR, or medium intensity approach lighting system. The MALSR consists of a series of sequenced flashing white lights that leads to an array of steady burning white lights, providing horizontal guidance to the runway. Figure 18.6 shows the MALSR.\nFigure 18.6. The MALSR is the most common approach light system.\nThe series of lights runs from 2,400 to 3,000 feet from the runway threshold. The sequenced flashing lights appear like a bright ball of light traveling at high speed toward the runway threshold. Pilots often refer to this portion of the approach lighting system as the rabbit. When the intensity of these lights is distracting, they may ask ATC to kill the rabbit.\nOther approach lighting systems include the ALSF1 (shown in Figure 18.7) and ALSF2 (shown in Figure 18.8) approach lighting systems.\nFigure 18.7. The ALSF1 (shown here) and ALSF2 include the red ferminating bars that can be used to allow descent below 100 feet.\nFigure 18.8. The ALSF2 contains the largest array of red lights of all the approach lighting systems.\nThese two types of approach lighting systems contain the red terminating bars that may be used to identify the runway environment and permit a descent below 100 feet AGL when none of the allowable visual references other than approach lights is in sight.\nThe type of approach lighting system is encoded on the airport sketch of the instrument approach procedure chart. You can see the approach chart legend in Appendix A.\nIn addition to the approach lighting system, there are other lights associated with the runway. They include VASI, runway end identifier lights, threshold lights, runway edge lights, and runway centerline lights (see Figure 18.9).\nFigure 18.9. This runway has VASI, threshold lights, edge lights, and centerline lights.\nMany of the Flight Simulator runways are equipped with visual approach slope indicators (VASIs). The VASI uses red and white lights to indicate to an approaching aircraft whether it is on a proper glidepath, below the glidepath, or above the glidepath. An aircraft on a proper glidepath will observe red lights over white lights. Figure 18.10 shows the two-bar VASI.\nFigure 18.10. The two-bar VASI is the most common type of VASI in the United States.\nThe other possible combinations of lights can best be remembered by the saying: \"White over white means too much height, but red over red, look out, you're dead.\"\nRunway end identifier lights, or REILs, are a pair of synchronized flashing white lights, one on each side of the runway threshold. These lights are directed out along the approach and are typically canted upward at an angle of between 10 and 15 degrees.\nThese lights help pilots confirm that they are looking at a runway rather than a parking lot or fast-food restaurant.\nThe runway threshold lights are bi-directional. On the approach side of the runway, the threshold lights appear as a bar of green lights. To a departing aircraft, however, the lights appear red, indicating the end of the runway and its concomitant danger.\nRunway edge lights display the outline of the runway during periods of reduced visibility or at night. In real life, these lights are amber for the last 2,000 feet of runway on instrument runways. This feature is not yet replicated on Flight Simulator.\nRunway centerline lights are flush-mounted in the runway centerline of some runways. They help pilots maintain alignment with the runway centerline during takeoff and landing. On Flight Simulator, they are white lights all the way down the runway. In the real world, they appear alternating red and white, and then all red, as you near the end of the runway. They are, like the threshold lights, bi-directional, so that pilots beginning their takeoff roll on one end of the runway do not see the red lights that would be seen from the opposite direction.\nHopefully, you will successfully complete the VOR Rwy 24 IAP and land on runway 24. If not, execute the missed approach procedure, which is stated in textual format in the profile view and is depicted graphically in the plan view.\nClimb to 3,000 feet while tracking outbound on the Bradley 238° radial. When you arrive at the PENNA intersection, which can be identified by 10.2 DME from Bradley or the intersection of the Hartford 322° radial, enter the holding pattern using a teardrop entry procedure. Holding patterns are discussed in the chapter \"Advanced Instrument Procedures.\""],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7aab1e9d-f8ac-4c1f-9718-ff2d62b67ee3>","<urn:uuid:fea73a15-6a06-4835-8eaf-2c55efb82f22>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a cybersecurity researcher, I'm curious: how do quantum key distribution and KLJN protocols compare in terms of their security against quantum computer threats?","answer":"Quantum key distribution (QKD) and Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN) protocols offer different approaches to secure key exchange. QKD relies on quantum physics principles and can detect eavesdropping through changes in quantum states during key sharing. However, practical quantum communicators have been fully cracked according to peer-reviewed publications. In contrast, the KLJN protocol, which uses two pairs of resistors with enhanced Johnson-noise and a Kirchhoff-loop, has been shown to provide information theoretic security levels superior to today's quantum key distribution.","context":["Considering the low efficiency during the process of traditional calibration for digital-display vibrometers, an automatic calibration system for vibrometers based on machine vision is developed. First, an automatic vibration control system is established on the basis of a personal computer, and the output of a vibration exciter on which a digital-display vibrometer to be calibrated is installed, is automatically adjusted to vibrate at a preset vibration level and a preset frequency. Then the display of the vibrometer is captured by a digital camera and identified by means of image recognition. According to the vibration level of the exciter measured by a laser interferometer and the recognized display of the vibrometer, the properties of the vibrometer are calculated and output by the computer. Image recognition algorithms for the display of the vibrometer with a high recognition rate are presented, and the recognition for vibrating digits and alternating digits is especially analyzed in detail. Experimental results on the built-up system show that the prposed image recognition methods are very effective and the system could liberate operators from boring and intense calibration work for digital-display vibrometers\nThe frictional resistance coefficient of ventilation of a roadway in a coal mine is a very important technical parameter in the design and renovation of mine ventilation. Calculations based on empirical formulae and field tests to calculate the resistance coefficient have limitations. An inversion method to calculate the mine ventilation resistance coefficient by using a few representative data of air flows and node pressures is proposed in this study. The mathematical model of the inversion method is developed based on the principle of least squares. The measured pressure and the calculated pressure deviation along with the measured flow and the calculated flow deviation are considered while defining the objective function, which also includes the node pressure, the air flow, and the ventilation resistance coefficient range constraints. The ventilation resistance coefficient inversion problem was converted to a nonlinear optimisation problem through the development of the model. A genetic algorithm (GA) was adopted to solve the ventilation resistance coefficient inversion problem. The GA was improved to enhance the global and the local search abilities of the algorithm for the ventilation resistance coefficient inversion problem.\nThere is an ongoing debate about the fundamental security of existing quantum key exchange schemes. This debate indicates not only that there is a problem with security but also that the meanings of perfect, imperfect, conditional and unconditional (information theoretic) security in physically secure key exchange schemes are often misunderstood. It has been shown recently that the use of two pairs of resistors with enhanced Johnsonnoise and a Kirchhoff-loop ‒ i.e., a Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN) protocol ‒ for secure key distribution leads to information theoretic security levels superior to those of today’s quantum key distribution. This issue is becoming particularly timely because of the recent full cracks of practical quantum communicators, as shown in numerous peer-reviewed publications. The KLJN system is briefly surveyed here with discussions about the essential questions such as (i) perfect and imperfect security characteristics of the key distribution, and (ii) how these two types of securities can be unconditional (or information theoretical).","Feature Articles: Research and Development of Security in the IOWN Era\nVol. 20, No. 1, pp. 32–39, Jan. 2022. https://doi.org/10.53829/ntr202201fa6\nSecure Optical Transport Network\nThe implementation of an optical transport network, especially between datacenters, has been progressing. Similar to the Internet, communications on the optical transport network are protected by public-key cryptography and symmetric-key cryptography, but there are concerns that advances in the research and development of quantum computers will pose a risk to current cryptographic systems, public-key cryptography and key exchange in particular. In response to this problem, researchers at NTT Social Informatics Laboratories and NTT Network Innovation Laboratories are engaged in the research and development of safe key-exchange schemes to counter the cryptographic risks posed by quantum computers. They are also engaged in architecture design and tests with actual equipment with the aim of applying such key-exchange schemes to the optical transport network.\nKeywords: optical transport network, quantum key distribution, post-quantum cryptography\n1.1 What does “transport” mean?\n“Transport” is often defined as “carrying” (as in physical distribution) or “transmission” (as in communications). In other words, it generally refers to corporate distribution and transport services and to communication and transmission services. To make it easy to imagine the features of a secure optical transport network as a technology affixed with the label “transport,” we begin our discussion using distribution and transport services as an example (Fig. 1).\nWhat are the features of distribution and transport services by truck? Various images may come to mind, such as the carrying of many goods at one time and the prompt delivery of goods after orders are placed. We take up such features from the five viewpoints listed in Table 1.\nFirst, in distribution and transport services, large capacity and low delay are features that are most important to customers and that give value to these services. Large capacity means a large number of trucks and low delay means short truck queuing time. From the viewpoint of running a distribution and transport business, efficient operations are essential, which can be expressed as the optimization of distribution and the economical management of daily operations. Many questions are now being asked about the social impact of services, so concerns about environmental load and safety have also become service features. Environmental load means low levels of exhaust gas/carbon dioxide (CO2) and safety means correct delivery of goods and few traffic accidents.\nWhat do these features mean in communication and transmission services? Large capacity and low delay are also the features that are the most important to customers and that give value to these services. Using terms from the field of communications, large capacity means high throughput and low delay means low latency. From the viewpoint of running a communication and transmission enterprise, efficient operations are likewise essential, which can be expressed as network efficiency in providing communication and transmission services. Finally, it is also true in the communications industry that the social impact of services has come under the spotlight, so environmental load and safety have also become of concern. In this industry, environmental load means low power consumption and safety means few network failures and a high level of security.\nAmong the five viewpoints listed in Table 1, the Innovative Optical and Wireless Network (IOWN) and All-Photonics Network (APN) under research and development at NTT aim for services that take into account the three points of large capacity, low delay, and low environmental load that appeal most to customers . The first step in adding the viewpoint of “safety = security” to IOWN/APN is the secure optical transport network proposed in this article.\n1.2 Necessity of an optical transport network\nMany people have come to appreciate how their lives have become more convenient thanks to the proliferation of mobile phones and smartphones and the expansion of the large-capacity and low-latency fifth-generation mobile communications system (5G). Large capacity and low latency are also desirable features in communication and transmission services targeting corporate customers. Customer needs have come to focus on datacenter interconnect services envisioning the need for datacenter disaster recovery as well as on uncompressed video transmission services for remote production to enable simultaneous and parallel work between a video production site in the field and an editing site. Transmitting such large-capacity data with low latency in real time to the extent possible requires the application of optical transport . This article introduces our efforts in adding security to optical transport.\n2. Current technologies\n2.1 Internet standards\nTo add security to communication and transmission services, we can expect the application of current technologies used on the Internet to be effective and to mature in terms of evaluating security the longer they stay in use.\nOn the Internet, Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) and Security Architecture for Internet Protocol (IPsec) are typical protocols used for configuring safe communication paths (secure channels). SSL/TLS is a standard protocol for configuring a secure channel between a web server and client. IPsec is a standard protocol for configuring secure channels between sites such as between a company’s main office and its branch offices. It is a technology used in virtual private network services. The secure optical transport network introduced in this article is a communication and transmission service operating between sites.\nIPsec for configuring a secure channel between sites is specified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an organization that formulates de facto Internet standards. The IPsec specifications are organized into architecture, encryption, authentication, and key exchange .\nIPsec’s architecture features the following mechanisms: Internet key exchange (IKE) that exchanges keys, encapsulated security payload (ESP) that performs encryption and authentication, authentication header (AH) that performs authentication, and security association database (SAD) that conveys the keys agreed upon in IKE via ESP or AH (Fig. 2). “Authentication” includes message authentication and entity authentication, which test the validity of a message delivered from a communication destination and that of the communication destination, respectively.\nNext, we discuss how this IPsec configuration might change in a secure optical transport network.\n3. Issues and proposals (I): Possibility of advances in quantum computers\n3.1 Possibility of advances in quantum computers\nCurrent communications on the Internet and other networks use key exchange based on public-key cryptography, which uses a problem that is difficult to solve mathematically as a basis for ensuring security. For example, the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) cryptosystem uses the fact that factoring the product of two large prime numbers takes an extremely long amount of time as a basis for security. However, if a genuine quantum computer having error resilience could be achieved, factoring the product of two large prime numbers could be performed in a relatively short time. If so, the RSA cryptosystem could no longer be called secure. To solve this problem, we have been researching and developing a key-exchange scheme that cannot be broken by a quantum computer.\n3.2 Quantum key distribution\nQuantum key distribution (QKD) is a mechanism for distributing keys by quantum physics. It shares information on a secret key via quantum states on a quantum channel that can transmit quantum states. The most outstanding feature of QKD is the ability to detect eavesdropping by a third party when sharing the secret key. This originates in a property unique to quantum mechanics that measuring a quantum state changes the state. If a third party is attempting to eavesdrop, that is, to carry out measurements while two parties are sending and receiving a quantum state, the sent quantum state and received quantum state will differ. Consequently, if the two parties should then check with each other on their sent and received states and find that they differ, they would be able to detect that a third party is eavesdropping. Performing this process of sending/receiving quantum states and checking for eavesdropping repeatedly increases accuracy and eventually enables the two parties to share a secret key.\n3.3 Post-quantum cryptography-based key distribution\nPost-quantum cryptography (PQC) is a public-key-cryptography and key-distribution mechanism in which problems that are mathematically difficult to solve provide a basis for security. In particular, problems that are assumed to be difficult even for a quantum computer to solve are used as grounds for security. In lattice-based cryptography, for example, it is assumed that finding the lattice points closest to the origin in a given set of lattice points is a difficult problem to solve even for a quantum computer, thereby providing a basis for security.\nAt NTT, research and development in this area is centered about NTRU, a type of PQC lattice-based cryptography incorporated in technology developed by a team including NTT (Fig. 3).\nWe generically refer to QKD and PQC-based key distribution (PQKD) as xKD.\n4. Issues and proposals (II): Countermeasures against new attackers in architecture design\n4.1 Countermeasures against attackers in a zero trust network\nDesigns that envision attackers in a zero trust network, which, as the name indicates, is a closed network that cannot be trusted  have become widespread. In this architecture design, it is necessary to assume attackers on all types of networks including telecommunications carrier networks and intra-site networks. In a telecommunications carrier network, it is assumed that an attacker will be intercepting communications by physically connecting to optical fiber, while in an intra-site network, it is assumed that an attacker intercepting communications has access rights in that network.\nWe first consider an attacker attempting to intercept communications by physically connecting to optical fiber in a telecommunications carrier network. A defense can be mounted through hop-by-hop encryption such as OTNsec, a protocol that protects Layer 1 (physical layer), and MACsec, a protocol that protects Layer 2 (data link layer). Implementing encryption functions in lower layers in this manner should enable the addition of security without hindering the low-latency feature of IOWN/APN.\nNext, to defend against an attacker who is attempting to intercept communications within an intra-site network while having access rights in that network, architecture design for inter-site communications typified by IPsec must be reviewed from the bottom up. In the secure optical transport network, key exchange equivalent to IPsec/IKE described above will correspond to xKD equipment, and encryption equivalent to ESP/AH in IPsec will correspond to an optical transponder or white-box switch. Given the trend toward a disaggregated architecture described later, it must be assumed that separate devices will perform key exchange and transmission and that the key exchange and encryption functions that were integrated in IPsec will take on a separated configuration (Figs. 4, 5, and 6). As a result, key information corresponding to SA(D) in IPsec will circulate in a network external to the device, which means that new measures must be studied for protecting communications on any type of network assuming a zero trust network. Specifically, it will be necessary to design a secure method for key distribution from xKD equipment to the optical transponder and a secure method for equipment authentication between xKD equipment and the optical transponder. For details on these studies, the reader is asked to consult a previously published paper .\n4.2 Necessity of architecture and equipment that can be tested from the outside\nIn a zero trust network, the ability to test the reliability of architecture, protocol, equipment, etc. from the outside is required. The ability to make updates separately to architecture, protocol, equipment, etc. is also required as a fundamental security measure in anticipation of some type of danger. For architecture design, protocol design, and equipment selection described in this article, we adopted formal verification and the white-box switch as technologies for testing reliability from the outside and making updates separately.\n4.3 Formal verification\nAt the time of protocol design including cryptography, there is a need for testing that can mathematically guarantee security as in maintaining the confidentiality of secret information within a protocol and ensuring the integrity of messages. In this regard, formal verification technology has been used for testing the safety of protocols such as SSL/TLS and IPsec that serve as transport layers and for testing the safety of authentication protocol on the 5G standard. Formal verification is a technology that describes a system and the properties that the system must satisfy in a formal language and that tests whether the system is satisfying those properties on the basis of logical reasoning. In formal verification, there are many components that can be automated by computer, so this technology excels in testing results from the outside including checking for reproducibility and in adaptively retesting in the face of protocol updates. For the secure optical transport network introduced in this article, we designed an IPsec-based protocol that combines xKD equipment with an optical transponder and tested its security using the ProVerif formal verification tool .\n4.4 White-box switch\nTransmission equipment for optical-transport purposes had been provided in a form that integrated optical modules and various functions. In contrast, there is also equipment that adopts technology that enables flexible configuration changes, the addition of new functions, cost reductions, etc. by separating the various functions of the transmission equipment and controlling them by standardized interfaces in a disaggregated architecture. This equipment is called a white-box switch or white-box transponder. In our current research, we have taken a white-box switch and added an xKD client function for obtaining an encryption key from xKD equipment in the software function group in order to set the key and control the encryption function of the hardware function group (Fig. 7). We also added a function for directly inputting an SDI (serial digital interface) signal (video signal) and showed that uncompressed 8K60P video in excess of 40 Gbit/s could be securely transmitted with ultra-low latency using this function. Therefore, we have demonstrated the feasibility of secure optical transport linking xKD equipment and optical transponders.\n5. Toward the future\nIn this article, we introduced a secure optical transport network as an initiative to add security functions to IOWN/APN now being researched and developed at NTT. We also introduced key issues and proposals in relation to this initiative. We consider our efforts to be one step in our ongoing plan to contribute to the provision of safe and secure technologies and services."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:93ab606a-b0fd-4b1f-881a-a22eab8d1498>","<urn:uuid:e1fb8003-b725-4048-851f-e2e5d14cca20>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the relationship between the conservatism principle and investment gains reporting?","answer":"The conservatism principle requires that liabilities be accounted for even if they are not likely to occur, but this treatment does not apply to revenues and gains. For investment gains, they can only be accounted for when they actually occur - if recorded before they take place, total earnings might be overstated beyond the actual collected amount. This is reflected in how investment gains are calculated and recorded, by taking the actual selling price minus the purchase price to determine the realized gain or loss.","context":["Accounting is governed by several standards to ensure that professionalism is maintained. These standards ensure that the accounting activities are harmonized all over the world. In absence of these standards, different firms would have different ways of accounting and these would call for the people interested in the companies to familiarize themselves with the different accounting practices that each company applies (United States & Valukas 2010).\nAccounting standards are set by international accounting bodies, which govern the accounting practice. These principles are referred to as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). They are generally accepted by the accounting profession since they are set by an authoritative accounting body. These principles are elaborated below.\nOne of the principles is the accrual concept. This principle states that transactions should be recorded when they occur and not when the cash is exchanged. This means that revenues, regardless whether its earned on credit or cash basis, should be recorded when it is earned. Liabilities should also be recorded according to the period they are incurred (Finney, Miller & Johnson 1970).\nAnother principle is known as the consistency concept. This concept states that once a firm chooses a certain accounting technique, it should apply it all through its operations, unless there is a valid reason not to do so.\nBuy Issues and Controversies of Accounting essay paper online\nAnother principle is the going concern principle. It states that an accountant should put into consideration that the firm is healthy to remain in business upto the foreseeable future. This will depend on the leverage ratio of the firm. A high leverage ratio means that the firm is not a going concern whereas a low leverage ratio means that the firm is a going concern. In case the accountant finds that the company is not healthy enough to grow into the future, he should give evidence to support such claims.\nAnother one is the conservatism principle. This principle states that liabilities should be accounted for even if they are not likely to occur. This means that any liability that the accountant anticipates that it might occur should be recorded even before it occurs. However, this does not apply to revenues. Revenues are only accounted for when occur. If they are recorded before they take place, the total earnings might be overstated beyond the actual amount that is actually collected in a given period.\nMateriality is another accounting principle. This principle requires that only material facts, which have a monetary value, are recorded. This means that only the transactions that bear monetary information are put into the financial records (Finney, Miller & Johnson 1970). The materiality of the item or transaction in question is based on how the monetary valuation of the product. Non-monetary information is included in the notes of the financial statements if it is considered relevant to the investors. Therefore, they guide the readers of the financial statements on the non-monetary aspects of the firm.\nAny accounting practice that is beyond these principles is considered unethical. Basically, they act as guidelines to be followed by the accountants across the globe in their activities. They provide uniformity in the accounting practice all over the world since they are made by governing bodies that govern accounting.\nRepo 105 is an accounting trick in which short-term liabilities are referred to as sales. A company raises funds using short-term liabilities. Proceeds received are subsequently used to offset some of the company’s liabilities. In a Repo market, a company gains access to the extra funds from other companies for short durations and in return they give collateral, referred to as a bond. The company offers to repay the short–term liability with an interest. However, the collateral never changes hands from the borrower to the lender.\nLehman Brothers’ used Repo 105 to help them resettle a large amount of liabilities. They used this accounting manoeuvre to resettle a long-term liability amounting to $50 billion so as to lower their leverage on the statement of financial position before the earnings of the company were announced (Needles et al. 1990). This portrayed a picture of them as not reliant on external debt as what was the actual picture. The company was having a high leverage before them selling bonds to cover the large amount of liabilities.Want an expert to write a paper for you Talk to an operator now\nAccording to the generally accepted accounting principles, Repo 105 should not be legally accepted as an accounting technique. Since the practice tends to assign to a firm funds which they actually do not have. The image portrayed after this practice does not reflect the true financial position of the firm. Thus, it ends up giving wrong information concerning the firm and thus investors, who rely on the financial position of the firm, make wrong investment decisions and might end up incurring losses. Also, as it happened to Lehman Brothers, the company might end up failing to repay its debts, which results to bankruptcy.\nIllegality of ‘Repo 105’ can be demonstrated by going concern principle. This principle states that a firm should be considered to be healthy enough to remain in business to the foreseeable future. However, whenever the accountant of a company finds that the company is not capable of remaining in business for a long period, then he/she should, with reasons make it known to the stakeholders of the company (Duska & Duska 2003). ‘Repo 105’ denies the possibility of determining whether a company is a going concern or not depending on the lowered leverage that it generates thus changing the actual image of the company’s financial position. It, therefore, compromises the decision making by directors.\nLehman Brothers’ failed to record the Repo 105 transaction as a loan. As a result, they failed to meet the conservatism principle, which requires that liabilities should be accounted for even though they have not occurred. The funds obtained through this technique are not referred to as long-term debts or liabilities. Therefore, they are not recorded as liabilities to the company, which is inconsistent with the generally accepted accounting principles. This shows that ‘Repo 105’ is unethical and thus illegal in operation.\nRepo 105 is used as a contingency technique to assist shield the firm from effects of a high leverage. It is, however, not part of the initial techniques applied during the inception of the firm. Thus, it compromises the consistency principle, which requires firms to be consistent with the accounting techniques that they apply. This shows that the technique cannot be legally accepted.\nReasons for Manipulating Reported Earnings\nSome firms engage in the unethical practice of manipulating their reported earnings before they could be announced. However, they bear different reasons for making the manipulations based on each firm. The objectives of this unethical practice, therefore, differ.\nOne of the motives for manipulating the earnings of a firm is to lure investors to make investments into the firm. A firm can manipulate its earnings such that it reports more earnings than its real income is and thus, helps to create a financial position image that attracts investors into investing into the company based on the given statement of financial position (Duska & Duska 2003). Therefore, the investors are lured to make investments into the firm, which most likely was not a going concern, thus providing it with funds that will help it to continue running. It also helps convince creditors of the creditworthiness of a firm and thus they are able to secure credit from the lending firms. Creditors usually analyze the net income of a firm as a representation of its future stream of incomes. By manipulating the incomes before reporting, they are able to convince the creditors of their creditworthiness, which is not the case. An example is the Lehman Brothers. The company sought funds from short-term sources, where they used their assets as collateral to secure short-term sources.\nAnother motive for manipulating earnings is to evade tax. Each firm is responsible of remitting a certain percentage of its earnings to the government as a tax. Some firms lower their revenues before reporting so as to reduce the amount of tax burden that a firm owes to the government. Little amounts of income translate to low amount of tax payable to the government. Multinational corporations are fond of manipulating their earnings so as to reduce their reported earnings in order to reduce the amount, which they pay as tax (Duska & Duska 2003). Examples of tax evading multi-national corporations include Apple and Microsoft. These companies shift their intellectual property so as to reduce their revenues generated from within America. They shift these rights to countries that have lower tax or no tax jurisdictions such as Ireland. In this way, the companies report lower sales and eventually lead to reduction in amount of tax owed to the government.\nAnother motive for manipulating earnings is to influence the decisions of the users of the financial statements. Mostly, the users are mostly the shareholders of the firm who seek to maximize their wealth. Therefore, the managers who seek to maximize their earning in-terms of salary. They are, therefore, charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the firm generates more profits if they are to retain their positions as managers (Weygandt 1996). In case the firm reports low profits, the managers can manipulate them so as to convince the shareholders of their capability to continue the firm and thus demonstrate the need of retaining them. In Lehman Brothers’ company, the company sought to ensure that they maintain a good image in the face of its customers and clients. Since, they feared losing them to other customers when they realize their leverage ratio and start questioning the safety of their money within the bank. Eventually, once it starts losing customers, the profits will continue dwindling till the company closes.\nImposition of More Regulations\nRegulations are meant to regulate the conduct of individuals at any field. Accounting regulations are meant to regulate the conduct of individuals in the accounting profession. There are loopholes in which some accountants take advantage of and end up engaging in unethical practices.\nLehman Brothers, with the help of Repo 105 accounting technique, ended up into bankruptcy. This was a result of having more short-term debts, which they failed to meet on maturity of the bonds. They had used the funds collected to settle their long-term liabilities in an attempt to lower their leverage.\nImposing more accounting regulations will assist in preventing accounting scandals like with Lehman Brothers. The going concern principle was compromised by trading long-term debts with short-term debts. A regulation, such as the maximum level within which a firm can make such a trade-off, will help to keep firms from displaying the wrong financial position. If there was a maximum leverage ratio, which prevented firms from entering the securities market, Lehman Brothers could have been saved from bankruptcy before it participated in the trade (Weygandt 1996).\nThere should be restrictions on who should engage in certain activities. Some ventures are said to have a higher level of risk. Therefore, to prevent firms from the adverse effects emanating from such risky activities, there should be well set regulations to control entry of firms into such ventures. For example, trading in securities should be controlled and restrictions put so as to restrict the entries into a market. This will help to prevent firms such as Lehman Brothers from trading in such securities whereas they have a higher leverage.\nThe guidelines set as the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles have been applied widely. These guidelines help to create uniformity in undertaking the discipline though it has been faced by unethical practices in practiced by some accountants.\nAn example of unethical practice is the Lehman Brothers where they traded in bonds so as to lower their leverage. This lead to the increase of the company’s debts and consequently, resulted in bankruptcy of the company. This shows one of the consequences of violating the principles of accounting.\nConsidering that there exist regulations that govern the accounting discipline, it appears that these principles are not fully followed or suffer from loopholes that lead to mal-practice by some accountants. These mean that these regulations are not enough to monitor the performance of the accountants. Therefore, additional regulations should be added to the already existing ones in order to make accounting practice to be well carried out.\nRelated Free Economics Essays\nMost popular orders","Take the selling price and subtract the initial purchase price.

{"question":"What are the historical cultural significance of trees in human society, and how do modern arborists contribute to preserving this natural heritage through community education?","answer":"Trees have historically held deep cultural significance, with ancient civilizations showing awe and reverence for them. The Greeks gave trees spirits called dryads and attributed religious significance to them, while different species held symbolic meaning - yews represented eternity, birches were considered holy trees, and larches were seen as guardians against enchantment. In modern times, arborists play a crucial role in preserving this natural heritage through community education and outreach activities. They conduct workshops, seminars, and public events to raise awareness about tree care, native species preservation, and environmental sustainability. These educational initiatives help foster a sense of ownership and stewardship among community members, ensuring continued support for conservation efforts.","context":["Values People have always been impressed by trees, by their massiveness and majesty, by the sound of wind in their branches, and by their visual beauty. Legend and folklore suggest attitudes of awe and reverence: YEWS, symbols of eternity; BIRCHES, holy trees; LARCHES, guardians against enchantment.\nTreesTrees are single-stemmed, perennial, woody plants taller than 3 m and exceeding 8 cm in diameter at breast height; shrubs are multistemmed and smaller. These definitions are somewhat arbitrary, since many species (eg, willow, alder, cherry, maple) can grow as trees or shrubs, depending on the environment. Counting the 30-odd shrubs that assume tree form under favourable conditions, there are about 140 native Canadian trees. The largest and oldest grow in the Pacific temperate rain FOREST. Douglas fir is an imposing example and, although it does not reach the size of redwoods or the age of bristlecone pines, specimens 90 m tall, 5 m in basal diameter and older than 1000 years have been reported. Canada's tallest reported tree (95 m) is a Stika spruce, the \"Carmanah Giant\" in the Carmanah Valley on the west coast of Vancouver Island. Canada's tallest Douglas fir, 94.3 m in height and 8.07 m in circumference, stands near Coquitlam, BC.\nPeople have always been impressed by trees, by their massiveness and majesty, by the sound of wind in their branches, and by their visual beauty. Legend and folklore suggest attitudes of awe and reverence: YEWS, symbols of eternity; BIRCHES, holy trees; LARCHES, guardians against enchantment. The Greeks gave trees spirits (dryads), attributing religious significance to them, as did the druids, who conferred on forest groves and oak woods a sacred, precommercial value now, unfortunately, lost.\nToday, trees are valued for their products: pulpwood, sawtimber, poles, plywood, particle board, paper, cork, rubber, gums, tannin, pharmaceuticals, fruits, nuts and syrups. Indirect benefits include soil stabilization and prevention of EROSION, windbreaks, sound barriers and air purification.\nApart from a few large, single-stemmed FERNS, trees are classified as gymnosperms and angiosperms. Gymnosperms (CONIFERS), with scalelike or needlelike leaves, appear first in the FOSSIL record (Carboniferous period, 353-300 million years ago) and, by early Mesozoic times (Triassic, 250-205.7 million years ago), dominated Earth's vegetation. Later in the Mesozoic, during the Cretaceous period (144.2-65 million years ago), broadleaf angiosperms evolved to become the more important group, perhaps profiting from their close relationships with INSECT pollinators and with larger animals which spread their fruits. Angiosperms also developed the ability to reproduce vegetatively by sprouting, an advantage which is shared by few conifers.\nConifers tend to concentrate growth in a central trunk from which many small branches are offset, producing a conical crown. They are usually evergreen, an adaptation fitting them for difficult environments by allowing internal recycling of nutrients from old to new foliage. Broadleaf trees tend to have rounded crowns because side branches grow just as well as main stems, which may fork repeatedly. They are typically deciduous, and grow on more fertile soils and in more moderate climates. There are numerous exceptions: some conifers (eg, larches, CYPRESSES, dawn redwood) are deciduous; some pines have relatively hard wood; some broadleaf trees (eg, POPLARS) have soft wood; others are evergreen, especially in subtropical and tropical climates. The only native Canadian broadleaf evergreen is the red-barked arbutus of southwestern BC.\nTree roots perform both anchoring and absorbing functions. Like the tops, they are distinctive according to species and environment. They may penetrate deeply (taproots of PINE) or spread horizontally just below the surface (platelike system of SPRUCE). Buttress roots, thickened vertically, characterize wet sites, particularly in the tropics, although they are sometimes seen on ELM. Adventitious roots, sprouting from the lower trunk (as on spruce and poplar), are a response to burial by accumulations of peat, silt on river floodplains, or windblown sand.\nIn climates that vary seasonally, the \"growth ring\" is a characteristic anatomical feature of trees. Regenerative, meristematic cells (cambium and cork cambium) sheathe the living trunk, branches and roots just under the bark, annually forming layers of phloem and corky cells to the outside (bark) and xylem cells to the inside (wood). Both bark and wood thicken with age. Products of photosynthesis and various other biochemicals are transported by phloem; water is transported chiefly by active xylem in sapwood surrounding older, darker, nonfunctional heartwood.\nThe water-conducting efficiency of xylem cells is a function of their size, controlled by growth regulators released from the tree's growing tips. When shoot growth begins in spring, cambium produces large-diameter cells. Later, in summer, as growth slows and stops, wood-cell diameters decrease. Therefore, a cross-section of trunk, root or branch shows concentric \"growth rings\" outlined by the contrast between the small, dense, latewood cells of one year and larger, lighter earlywood cells of the next. An uncritical count of a tree's growth rings may overestimate its true age, since extra flushes of growth in a year can be triggered by weather changes or defoliation, forming false annual rings.\nRing size reflects growing conditions. Where precipitation is the limiting factor, sensitive trees record wet and dry years in wide and narrow rings. Where heat is limiting, ring sizes mirror sequences of warm and cold summers.\nTrees were eliminated by ice-age GLACIERS which covered most of Canada. Deglaciation began about 18 000 years ago, allowing the migration of plants to newly exposed soils. Species with small, winged seeds travelled fastest and farthest, and the boreal zone was filled by spruce, pine, larch, FIR, poplar and birch. Trees that migrated more slowly or were less stress tolerant came later, and they now characterize more favourable environments: southern BC, with numerous conifers; and southern Ontario, with an even greater variety of broadleaf deciduous trees.\nAltitudinal and latitudinal distributions are in part related to wood anatomy: small-diameter xylem cells of boreal species (spruce, fir, ASPEN, ALDER, WILLOW, birch) are less prone to freezing damage than larger cells of \"ring porous\" southern hardwoods (OAK, hickory, WALNUT).\nEach wide-ranging tree species includes locally adapted varieties. Although they seem similar, white spruces from the territories, Newfoundland and southern Manitoba are genetically different and respond differently when planted together. Successful planting is best accomplished, therefore, by using seed from trees native to the area. This variation within species means that the preservation of native trees, as well as that of other plants and animals, in all their genetic diversity, requires the protection of many large, widely distributed, natural areas as ecological preserves.\nSee also individual tree entries.","Environmental conservation is an urgent global imperative, with a growing focus on preserving and restoring natural ecosystems. Trees are pivotal in these efforts, as they are critical components of ecosystems, sequester carbon dioxide, and contribute to overall biodiversity. Tree expertise is paramount to conserving and managing trees effectively. We will explore how the team of certified tree experts, often called arborists, contribute to environmental conservation efforts, including the restoration of urban forests, preservation of native species, mitigation of climate change, and sustainable land management practices.\nHow do experts contribute to environmental conservation efforts?\n1. Urban Forest Restoration\nUrban forests, consisting of trees within cities and metropolitan areas, are vital for improving air and water quality, mitigating heat island effects, and enhancing urban residents’ overall quality of life. Nevertheless, urban trees face numerous challenges, including pollution, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, and disease. Tree experts play a significant role in restoring and maintaining urban forests. Arborists assess the health of urban trees, identify and manage pests and diseases, and implement tree planting and care programs. They also collaborate with city planners and local communities to select appropriate tree species and establish tree-friendly policies. By restoring and expanding urban forests, arborists contribute to conserving vital green spaces within urban areas, promoting sustainability, and enhancing urban biodiversity.\n2. Preservation of Native Species\nConserving native tree species is paramount for maintaining the ecological balance of natural ecosystems. Native trees furnish habitat and food for wildlife, contribute to soil health, and support native pollinators. In many regions, invasive tree species threaten native plant communities, disrupting local ecosystems. Arborists are instrumental in pinpointing and managing invasive species. They develop strategies for extracting and controlling invasive trees and promote the preservation of native tree species through habitat restoration efforts. By preserving native tree populations, tree experts contribute to the overall health and resilience of natural ecosystems and support the survival of native wildlife.\n3. Carbon Sequestration and Climate Change Mitigation\nTrees are among the most effective tools for mitigating climate change due to their capacity to absorb and store carbon dioxide (CO2) through photosynthesis. As CO2 levels in the atmosphere continue to rise, tree expertise becomes indispensable in maximizing the carbon sequestration potential of forests. Arborists work to ensure the health and longevity of trees in natural and urban settings. They assess tree health, implement appropriate care practices, and combat threats such as pests, diseases, and drought, which can weaken trees’ ability to sequester carbon effectively. Additionally, arborists promote sustainable tree-planting initiatives and advocate for incorporating trees into urban planning to enhance urban carbon sinks.\n4. Sustainable Land Management\nSustainable land management practices are essential for conserving trees and maintaining healthy ecosystems. Arborists collaborate with landowners, government agencies, and environmental organizations to develop and implement sustainable land management plans. These plans often involve tree preservation, reforestation, and afforestation efforts to combat deforestation and habitat loss. Arborists assess the suitability of tree species for reforestation projects, ensure proper planting and maintenance techniques, and monitor the progress of these initiatives. Guided by tree expertise, sustainable land management practices help protect and restore landscapes, promoting long-term ecological health and resilience.\n5. Community Education and Outreach\nArborists are instrumental in educating communities about the significance of trees and conservation. They engage in outreach activities, such as workshops, seminars, and public events, to raise awareness about tree care, native species preservation, and environmental sustainability. Community education efforts often include tree-planting initiatives that implicate residents in conservation projects. These initiatives foster a sense of ownership and stewardship among community members, ushering in continued support for conservation efforts. Arborists serve as valuable resources for disseminating information and promoting environmental consciousness within communities.\n6. Research and Innovation\nTree experts are implicated in research and innovation to advance tree care and conservation practices. They study tree biology, diseases, and pests and investigate innovative tree care and maintenance techniques. Research findings help announce best practices in tree care and conservation. Additionally, arborists collaborate with scientists and researchers to address emerging challenges, such as the impact of climate change on tree health. They contribute valuable data and insights to the broader scientific community, aiding in developing sustainable and effective conservation strategies.\nTree expertise is indispensable for environmental conservation efforts, implicating urban forest restoration, preservation of native species, climate change mitigation, sustainable land management, protection of endangered species, community education, and research and innovation. Arborists play a paramount role in safeguarding trees, which are paramount components of ecosystems and vital contributors to the well-being of our planet. As we face escalating environmental challenges, including habitat loss, deforestation, and climate change, the knowledge and skills of tree experts become increasingly important. Their dedication to conserving and caring for trees helps maintain ecological balance and contributes to our natural world’s overall health and resilience. Tree expertise is a cornerstone of environmental conservation, ensuring that future generations can continue benefiting from the invaluable services and beauty trees provide."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d0dcabe5-b955-4906-a2ff-bab89be208dc>","<urn:uuid:c10bc732-39fa-4747-99d0-e6d3f323bd98>"],"error":null}

Along with the Mongols under Genghis Kahn, and the Axis powers in World War II, The Aztecs or Mexica probably hold the record.\n2 Who Were the Aztec?We know they came from somewhere up north—how far north is anyone’s guessMythically, they came from “Aztlan, the Land of the Herons,” of which “Aztec” is a derivationThey were mercenaries of the Toltec centered in Tula, although even that is bound up in mythWhen Tula fell, the Aztec migrated to an area of five lakes dominated by Lake TexcocoAn area dominated by “Epigonal Toltecs”No one really knows where the Aztecs came from. Historical linguistic data and legend alike suggest they came from the north—but how far north or where is anyone’s guess. Mythically, they came from a place called “Aztlan,” or “Place of the Herons,” the name “Aztec” is derived from this place name. More likely, they lived in Tula for a while, acting as mercenaries for the Toltecs. With the fall of Tula, they migrated to Lake Texcoco, a lake near Mexico City which has since dried up. The area was dominated by what Wolf calls “Epigonal Toltecs.”\n3 Epigonal ToltecsThe first were the Otomi-speaking Tepanecs, who founded the city of Atzcapotzalco on the western shores of Lake TexcocoThe second was Xaltocan, an Otomi-speaking state on the north shore of Lake TexcocoThe third was the Acolhua who dominated the eastern shore of Lake Texcoco, organized also by ChichimecaThe fourth was Colhuacán on the southwest part of the Valley of Mexico, at the cusp between Lakes Texcoco and Xochimilco.The fifth was a small state Xicco.\n4 Aztec NomenclatureInitially, they did not settle at the site of TenochtitlanTheir names changed from “Chichimec from Aztlan” a contemptuous term that meant “Barbarian”To “Tenochca” after a patriarch by that name, who also gave the name to TenochtitlánTo “Mexica,” which they adopted after attaching themselves to the Colhua of Colhuacan as mercenaries, calling themselves “Colhua Mexica”\n5 Formation of the AztecInitially, they did not settle at the site of TenochtitlánAfter numerous wanderings they settled at a swampy site mythically where an eagle was perched on a nopal cactus devouring a snakeFirst, they served as mercenaries of AtzcapotzalcoThey then switched sides, allied themselves with the Acolhua of Texcoco, overthrew Atzapotzalco, and eventually formed a triple alliance between themselves, the Acolhua, and a liberated part of Atzapotzalco called TlacopanThird, they established hegemony in 1500, 21 years before the actual conquest.Although Tenochtitlan, at the site of today’s Mexico City, would become the capital of the Mexica (Aztec) empire.\n6 Formation and Society Bilateral descent does allow for flexibility. To enjoy a rapid rise from a muddy village settled in 1345 or so to an empire less than 200 years later, you have to be flexible.1427 saw the formation of the Triple AllianceSo to envision an “Aztec society,” the question arises just which society are we talking aboutBerdan describes society at it was on the eve of the ConquestBut were they patrilineal groups in the past? We don’t know; records were often destroyed by the victors\n7 What Were the Calpulli? What is known for sure: There were 20 “Big Houses” by that nameThey were landholding groupsThey were organized territoriallyThey had their own councilsThey had their own templesThey comprised the macehual, or commoner, generally peasantsThe debate: kin groups or peasant class?\n8 Calpulli as Kin Groups Kin groups or clans Reasoning: the Aztecs themselves were tribal groups at most 300 years beforeWhat kind? Evidence is lacking?Indication of a patrilineal bias among nobility: preference for “junior lines” in allocating economic assets and political favors.\n9 Calpulli as Social and Economic Classes Developed into administrative subclassesCould have been units organizing not only peasants but also craftspersons and tradersExample: in Texcoco under Hungry Coyote (Nezahualcoyotl), calpulli were organized featherworkers and goldworkersPochteca (luxury good traders) may also have formed a calpulli; we do know they were hereditary\n10 Calpulli as Both Kin and Class Conical clans in which privileges are based on order of birthKept wealth and privileges in the family, but some members were more equal than othersKin trace their ancestry to a founder, real or fictiveBut through such justification as precedence of birth, the lineal descendants (junior lines) get preferential treatmentThis suggests that unilineal descent might have been dominant at one time\n11 Calpulli and Ethnicity As conquests proceeded, Tenochtitlan became more ethnically diverse.Thus calpulli included not only kin but also “allies” from the conquered provincesFlexibility of kin thus allowed fictive (fictional) ties as wellThus, the European Catholic tradition of compradrazgo fit in very well with indigenous society.Thus their flexibility is not at issue; only their “pristine” characteristics.\n12 Calpulli and Land Tenure Land was held in common in the calpulliSystem was based on usufructPeasants “owned” their plot so long as they used it and paid their taxesLand reverted back to the commons if the peasant stopped using the land or pay the taxesLand could be rented, but not bought or sold\n13 Aztec: Kin ReckoningReckoned kinship bilaterally; traced relations through paternal and maternal side.Kinship terms bilateral: e.g. tlatli is an uncle, whether father’s or mother’s brotherPossibly reflected the extreme instability one expects from a state in rapid formationAnd one in which there are shifting alliances\n14 Marriage among the Aztec Marriage was endogamous by class: pipiltin to other pipiltin, macehuallin to other macehuallinThere was no other rule of exogamy outside the immediate familyThis meant that marriage could involve one’s cousin; cross-cousin marriage was not unknownPolygyny was common among nobility and tied in with social class; wives were put to work.\n15 Marriage Alliances and Power Nobility: Marriage had a political function: female from Texcoco married a male from the subordinate Teotihuacan to maintain a tieThe son of the Teotihuacan ruler would then be subordinate to Texcoco because of the “gift” of a wife.Marriage was to man’s mother’s brother’s daughter—his matrilateral cross-cousin.Failure to repay in Maussian terms means the Teotihuacan nobility would be “beggar” to Texcoco nobility.This would persist for generations.\n16 Aztec Markets: Common Goods There were two kinds of marketsOne dealt in ordinary goodsMarkets usually met every five daysTrading outside the market was illegal and one could be imprisoned or the goods confiscatedReason: market transactions were subject to taxati\n17 Aztec Markets: Luxury Products Texcoco had been a market town long before the Aztecs assumed powerMarkets were a daily affair in Texcoco; major markets comprising up to 50,000 buyers and sellers met every fifth day—they were the center of luxury productsA hereditary class of merchants called Pochteca were probably active long before the AztecsThey occupied a precarious positionOn the one hand, they were vital as sources of military intelligence to the rulers and were protectedOn the other hand, their economic power were a threat to the rulers; toward the end, they hid their wealth.\n18 Sociopolitical Organization of the Aztecs Society: A Twofold DivisionPilli: The noblesMacehual: The peasantsHowever, the peasants themselves were stratifiedMacehuales who excelled in battle could themselves become nobleThis requires some background in the principles of political anthropology\n19 Social Class: Overview General types (Fried)Egalitarian societies:Social systems with as many valued positions as person capable of filling themExceptions: age, gender, special characteristicsRanked societiesSocial systems with fewer valued status positions than those capable of filling themStratified societiesMinority control of strategic resources\n20 Stratified Societies Access to strategic resources is unequal Examples Water in irrigation societiesLand in patrimonial (feudal) societiesClaims to capital assets (stocks, bonds) in capitalist societyCapital: goods/services used for productionMoney, stocks, bonds are also capital\n21 Emergence of Stratification Manipulative Individuals/ FamiliesForm alliances (chimpanzee-like)Play one faction against anotherForm dynasties (bonobo-like)Control over Life-Sustaining ResourcesWater systems in semi-arid regionsAgricultural landsMechanisms of TaxationLaborTribute\n22 Political Organization: Basic Principles Power vs AuthorityPower: compliance by coercion or forceAuthority: compliance by persuasionLegitimacy: Beliefs rationalizing ruleExamples: Divine Right, Peoples ConsentSanctions: reinforcements of behaviorPositive: rewards, recognitionNegative: punishment\n23 Power versus Authority Extreme examplesPower: concentration camps: Auschwitz (above); Guantanamo (below)Authority: !Kung, Inuit, YanomamoNeither is absoluteDictatorships need to persuade: Nuremberg rallies, Mayday paradesPower is evenly distributed in nonstate cultures\n24 Legitimacy as Justification for Political Order Justification necessary even in authoritarian statesMonarchies: the divine right to ruleSoviet Union: Socialist transition to communist economyNazi Germany: Racial purification; delivery of full-employment (Nuremberg rallies, above)Democratic forms: consent by the governed (below, State of the Union)\n25 One Myth Behind Mexica Power War Against the Tepenacs of AtzcapotalzoNobles voted for war; commoners voted for peaceThe declaration of the nobles (Wolf, p. 137)Commoners’ reply on agreement if the war were successful (Wolf, p. 137)Most likely, a mythical exchange, but this served as one part of legitimation\n26 Sociopolitical Organizations: General Typology Bands: Small, informal groupsTribes: Segmentary groups integrated by some unifying factorChiefdoms: Group organized under a chief in a ranked societyState: Centralized political system with monopoly over legitimized force and its use.\n27 States: Force as Prime Mover Defining CharacteristicsA centralized political systemWith power to coerceThe operating factor:Monopoly over the use ofLegitimate physical forceSupports the apparatus of the stateBureaucracy --Army and policeLaw and legal codes\n28 States: Derivative Features Administrative structurePublic services --Tax collectionResource allocation --Foreign affairsDelegation of forcePolice, all levels --Armed forceLawCivil (dispute resolution)Regulatory (trade, economy)Criminal (crime and punishment)\n29 Law: Cross-Cultural Comparison Codified law: Formally defines wrong and specifies remediesCustomary law: Informal sanctions or dispute resolutionRestitution or Restorative law: emphasizes dispute resolution, damage restitutionRetributive law: emphasizes punishment for crimes committed\n30 Case Studies: Restitution Nuer: Leopard-skin chiefFunction: mediate disputes;

{"question":"Looking at winter tourism in Austria - how do the traditional Perchten parades compare to modern Christmas attractions for bringing in visitors?","answer":"While the traditional Perchten parades continue in regions like Pongau with their beautiful and ugly masks, they have become just one part of Austria's broader Christmas tourism appeal. Modern Christmas attractions are more numerous and varied, including Christmas markets in cities like Vienna and Salzburg, holiday concerts, ice skating rinks, festive train rides like the Christkindlbahn in Innsbruck, and special events like the Ice Nativity Scene in Graz. Many ski resorts have actually incorporated the Perchten tradition into their wider holiday offerings, turning it into a tourist attraction alongside other winter activities, as evidenced by large ski resorts drawing crowds every winter for both traditional customs and modern holiday entertainment.","context":["This article may need to be rewritten to comply with Wikipedia's quality standards. (February 2015)\nPerchta or Berchta (English: Bertha ), also commonly known as Percht and other variations, was once known as a goddess in Alpine paganism in the Upper German and Austrian regions of the Alps. Her name may mean \"the bright one\" (Old High German beraht, bereht, from Proto-Germanic *brehtaz) and is probably related to the name Berchtentag, meaning the feast of the Epiphany. Eugen Mogk provides an alternative etymology, attributing the origin of the name Perchta to the Old High German verb pergan, meaning \"hidden\" or \"covered\".\nPerchta is often identified as stemming from the same Germanic goddess as Holda and other female figures of German folklore (see Frija-Frigg). According to Jacob Grimm and Lotte Motz, Perchta is Holda's southern cousin or equivalent, as they both share the role of \"guardian of the beasts\" and appear during the Twelve Days of Christmas, when they oversee spinning.\nGrimm says Perchta or Berchta was known \"precisely in those Upper German regions where Holda leaves off, in Swabia, in Alsace, in Switzerland, in Bavaria and Austria.\"\nAccording to Erika Timm, Perchta emerged from an amalgamation of Germanic and pre-Germanic, probably Celtic, traditions of the Alpine regions after the Migration Period in the Early Middle Ages.\nPerchta had many different names depending on the era and region: Grimm listed the names Perahta and Berchte as the main names (in his heading), followed by Berchta in Old High German, as well as Behrta and Frau Perchta. In Baden, Swabia, Switzerland and Slovenian regions, she was often called Frau Faste (the lady of the Ember days) or Pehta or 'Kvaternica', in Slovene. Elsewhere she was known as Posterli,Quatemberca and Fronfastenweiber.\nThe mother of the Franks emperor Charlemagne may have had a related albeit unwitted influence, as it did the Visigoth queen Brunhilda on her own, into its medieval folklore, Bertha or Berthrada was said to be of long and wide feet, in effect taller than her husband called precisely, Pippin the Short and may have been the reason why Charlemagne inherited from her his unusual height.\nIn southern Austria, in Carinthia among the Slovenes, a male form of Perchta was known as Quantembermann, in German, or Kvaternik, in Slovene (the man of the four Ember days). Grimm thought that her male counterpart or equivalent is Berchtold.\nRegional variations of the name include Berigl, Berchtlmuada, Perhta-Baba, Zlobna Pehta, Bechtrababa, Sampa, Stampa, Lutzl, Zamperin, Pudelfrau, Zampermuatta and Rauweib.\nIn some descriptions, Perchta has two forms; she may appear either as beautiful and white as snow like her name, or as elderly and haggard.\nIn many old descriptions, Perchta had one large foot, sometimes called a goose foot or swan foot. Grimm thought the strange foot symbolized her being a higher being who could shapeshift to animal form. He noticed that Bertha with a strange foot exists in many languages (Middle German \"Berhte mit dem fuoze\", French \"Berthe au grand pied\", Latin \"Berhta cum magno pede\", Italian \" Berta dai gran piè\", title of a medieval epic poem of italian area): \"It is apparently a swan maiden's foot, which as a mark of her higher nature she cannot lay aside...and at the same time the spinning-woman's splayfoot that worked the treadle\".\nIn the Tyrol she appears as little old woman with a very wrinkled face, bright lively eyes, and a long hooked nose; her hair is disheveled, her garments tattered and torn.\nInitially, Perchta was the upholder of cultural taboos, such as the prohibition against spinning on holidays.In the folklore of Bavaria and Austria, Perchta was said to roam the countryside at midwinter, and to enter homes during the twelve days between Christmas and Epiphany (especially on the Twelfth Night). She would know whether the children and young servants of the household had behaved well and worked hard all year. If they had, they might find a small silver coin the next day, in a shoe or pail. If they had not, she would slit their bellies open, remove their stomach and guts, and stuff the hole with straw and pebbles. She was particularly concerned to see that girls had spun the whole of their allotted portion of flax or wool during the year. She would also slit people's bellies open and stuff them with straw if they ate something on the night of her feast day, other than the traditional meal of fish and gruel.\nThe cult of Perchta, under which followers left food and drink for Fraw Percht and her followers in the hope of receiving wealth and abundance, was condemned in Bavaria in the Thesaurus pauperum (1468)[ citation needed ] and by Thomas Ebendorfer von Haselbach in De decem praeceptis (1439).\nLater canonical and church documents characterized Perchta as synonymous with other leading female spirits: Holda, Diana, Herodias, Richella and Abundia.\nGrimm thought Holda is her equivalent while the Weiße Frauen may derive directly from Berchta in her white form.\nThe word Perchten is plural for Perchta, and this has become the name of her entourage, as well as the name of animal masks worn in parades and festivals in the mountainous regions of Austria. In the 16th century, the Perchten took two forms: Some are beautiful and bright, known as the Schönperchten (\"beautiful Perchten\"). These come during the Twelve Nights and festivals to \"bring luck and wealth to the people.\" The other form is the Schiachperchten (\"ugly Perchten\") who have fangs, tusks and horse tails which are used to drive out demons and ghosts. Men dressed as the ugly Perchten during the 16th century and went from house to house driving out bad spirits.\nSometimes, der Teufel is viewed as the most schiach (\"ugly\") Percht and Frau Perchta as the most schön (\"beautiful\") Percht.\nIn Italy, Perchta is roughly equivalent with La Befana, who visits all the children of Italy on the night before 6 January to fill their socks with candy if they are well behaved or a lump of coal if they are not. [ citation needed ]\nAccording to Jacob Grimm (1882), Perchta was spoken of in Old High German in the 10th century as Frau Berchta and thought to be a white-robed goddess who oversaw spinning and weaving, like the myths of Holda. He believed she was the feminine equivalent of Berchtold, and was sometimes the leader of the Wild Hunt. However, John B. Smith disagrees and suggests that Perchta represents the personification of the feast of the Epiphany (Perchta's Day), and is therefore not pre-Christian.\nIn contemporary culture, Perchta is portrayed as a \"rewarder of the generous, and the punisher of the bad, particularly lying children\".\nToday in Austria, particularly Salzburg, where she is said to wander through Hohensalzburg Castle in the dead of night,the Perchten are still a traditional part of holidays and festivals (such as the Carnival Fastnacht). The wooden animal masks made for the festivals are today called Perchten.\nIn the Pongau region of Austria large processions of Schönperchten (\"beautiful Perchten\") and Schiachperchten (\"ugly Perchten\") are held every winter. Beautiful masks are said to encouraging financial windfalls, and the ugly masks are worn to drive away evil spirits.\nOther regional variations include the Tresterer in the Austrian Pinzgau region, the stilt dancers in the town of Unken, the Schnabelpercht or Schnabelperchten (\"trunked Percht\") in the Unterinntal region and the Glöcklerlaufen (\"bell-running\") in the Salzkammergut. A number of large ski-resorts have turned the tradition into a tourist attraction drawing large crowds every winter.\nHel is a legendary being in Norse mythology who is said to preside over a realm of the same name, where she receives a portion of the dead. Hel is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In addition, she is mentioned in poems recorded in Heimskringla and Egils saga that date from the 9th and 10th centuries, respectively. An episode in the Latin work Gesta Danorum, written in the 12th century by Saxo Grammaticus, is generally considered to refer to Hel, and Hel may appear on various Migration Period bracteates.\nA troll is a being in Scandinavian folklore, including Norse mythology. In Old Norse sources, beings described as trolls dwell in isolated rocks, mountains, or caves, live together in small family units, and are rarely helpful to human beings.\nBerchtesgaden is a municipality in the district Berchtesgadener Land, Bavaria, in southeastern Germany, near the border with Austria, 30 km (19 mi) south of Salzburg and 180 km (110 mi) southeast of Munich. It lies in the Berchtesgaden Alps, south of Berchtesgaden; the Berchtesgaden National Park stretches along three parallel valleys.\nThe Wild Hunt is a folklore motif that historically occurs in the folklore of various Northern European cultures. Wild Hunts typically involve a \"soul-raving\" chase led by a mythological figure escorted by a ghostly or supernatural group of hunters passing in wild pursuit. The leader of the hunt is often a named figure associated with Odin in Germanic legends, but may variously be a historical or legendary figure like Theodoric the Great, the Danish king Valdemar Atterdag, the Welsh psychopomp Gwyn ap Nudd, biblical figures such as Herod, Cain, Gabriel, or the Devil, or an unidentified lost soul or spirit either male or female. The hunters are generally the souls of the dead or ghostly dogs, sometimes fairies, Valkyries, or elves.\nĒostre is a West Germanic spring goddess. By way of the Germanic month bearing her name, she is the namesake of the festival of Easter in some languages. Ēostre is attested solely by Bede in his 8th-century work The Reckoning of Time, where Bede states that during Ēosturmōnaþ, pagan Anglo-Saxons had held feasts in Ēostre's honour, but that this tradition had died out by his time, replaced by the Christian Paschal month, a celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.\nThe companions of Saint Nicholas are a group of closely related figures who accompany Saint Nicholas throughout the territories formerly in the Holy Roman Empire or the countries that it influenced culturally. These characters act as a foil to the benevolent Christmas gift-bringer, threatening to thrash or abduct disobedient children. Jacob Grimm associated this character with the pre-Christian house spirit which could be benevolent or malicious, but whose mischievous side was emphasized after Christianization. The association of the Christmas gift-bringer with elves has parallels in English and Scandinavian folklore, and is ultimately and remotely connected to the Christmas elf in modern American folklore.\nMention of textiles in folklore is ancient, and its lost mythic lore probably accompanied the early spread of this art. Textiles have also been associated in several cultures with spiders in mythology.\nThe central and eastern Alps of Europe are rich in folklore traditions dating back to pre-Christian times, with surviving elements originating from Germanic, Gaulish (Gallo-Roman), Slavic (Carantanian) and Raetian culture.\nSwiss folklore describes a collection of local stories, celebrations, and customs of the alpine and sub-alpine peoples that occupy Switzerland. The country of Switzerland is made up of several distinct cultures including German, French, Italian, as well as the Romansh speaking population of Graubünden. Each group has its own unique folkloric tradition.\nGerman folklore is the folk tradition which has developed in Germany over a number of centuries.\n\"Frau Holle\" is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm in Children's and Household Tales in 1812. It is of Aarne-Thompson type 480.\nIn German folklore, the Weiße Frauen are elven-like spirits that may have derived from Germanic paganism in the form of legends of light elves. The Dutch Witte Wieven went at least as far back as the 7th century, and their mistranslation as White Women instead of the original Wise Women can be explained by the Dutch word wit also meaning white. They are described as beautiful and enchanted creatures who appear at noon and can be seen sitting in the sunshine brushing their hair or bathing in a brook. They may be guarding treasure or haunting castles. They entreat mortals to break their spell, but this is always unsuccessful. The mythology dates back at least to the Middle Ages and was known in the present-day area of Germany.\nIn Germanic paganism, Tamfana is a goddess. The destruction of a temple dedicated to the goddess is recorded by Roman senator Tacitus to have occurred during a massacre of the Germanic Marsi by forces led by Roman general Germanicus. Scholars have analyzed the name of the goddess and have advanced theories regarding her role in Germanic paganism.\nLotte Motz, born Lotte Edlis, was an Austrian-American scholar, obtaining a Ph.D. in German and philology, who published four books and many scholarly papers, primarily in the fields of Germanic mythology and folklore.\nA hag is a wizened old woman, or a kind of fairy or goddess having the appearance of such a woman, often found in folklore and children's tales such as \"Hansel and Gretel\". Hags are often seen as malevolent, but may also be one of the chosen forms of shapeshifting deities, such as The Morrígan or Badb, who are seen as neither wholly benevolent nor malevolent.\nErika Timm is a German linguist, the author of works that have made fundamental contributions to Yiddish historical linguistics and philology.\n*Frijjō (\"Frigg-Frija\") is the reconstructed name or epithet of a hypothetical Common Germanic love goddess, the most prominent female member of the *Ansiwiz (gods), and often identified as the spouse of the chief god, *Wōdanaz (Woden-Odin).\nKrampus is a horned, anthropomorphic figure in Alpine folklore who during the Christmas season, scares children who have misbehaved, assisting to Saint Nicholas, who rewards the well-behaved on 5 December at night with modest gifts and bad ones with birch rod only.\nGretel & Hansel is a 2020 dark fantasy horror film based on the German folklore tale \"Hansel and Gretel\" by the Brothers Grimm. The film is directed by Oz Perkins, and produced by Fred Berger, Brian Kavanaugh-Jones, and Dan Kagan, with a screenplay by Rob Hayes. Sophia Lillis and Sam Leakey portray the title characters, alongside Charles Babalola, Jessica De Gouw, and Alice Krige. The story follows Gretel and Hansel as they enter the dark woods in order to find work and food, and then stumble upon the home of a witch.","There are so many reasons to enjoy Christmas in Austria.

Through the Coastal Change Hazards Portal, the USGS provides web-based access to coastal-hazard information and products that can assist those working to protect resources, identify risks, and help prevent economic losses along the Nation’s shorelines.\n- Permafrost Carbon Network: It is estimated that there is twice as much soil carbon stored in the soils and permafrost of high latitude ecosystems as carbon currently contained in the atmosphere. In a warmer world, permafrost thawing and decomposition of previously frozen organic carbon is one of the more likely positive feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere. The primary objective of this network is to synthesize and link existing research about permafrost carbon and climate in a format that can be assimilated by biospheric and climate models.","It’s perhaps the best known and more worrisome of climate feedback loops: As the planet warms, permafrost—landscapes of frozen soil and rock—begins to thaw. And when it does, microbes consume organic matter, releasing CO2 and methane into the atmosphere, leading to more warming, more thawing, and even more carbon emissions.\nBut here’s something you’ve probably never heard of, and it’s something not even the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has really considered: thermokarst. That’s the land that gets ravaged whenever permafrost thaws rapidly. As the ice that holds the soil together disappears, hillsides collapse and massive sinkholes open up. Climate scientists have been working gradual permafrost thaw into their models—changes that run centimeters deep over decades or centuries. But abrupt permafrost thaw happens on the scale of meters over months or years. That shocks the surrounding landscape into releasing potentially even more carbon than would have if it thawed at a more leisurely pace.\nToday in the journal Nature Geoscience, researchers argue that without taking abrupt thaws into account, we’re underestimating the impact of permafrost thaw by 50 percent. “The amount of carbon coming off that very narrow amount of abrupt thaw in the landscape, that small area, is still large enough to double the climate consequences and the permafrost carbon feedback,” says study lead author Merritt Turetsky, of the University of Guelph and University of Colorado Boulder.\nLess than 20 percent of northern permafrost land is susceptible to this kind of rapid thaw. Some permafrost is simply frozen rock, or even sand. But the kind we’re worried about here contains a whole lot of water. “Where permafrost tends to be lake sediment or organic soils, the type of earth material that can hold a lot of water, these are like sponges on the landscape,” says Turetsky. “When you have thaw, we see really dynamic and rapid changes.”\nThat’s because frozen water takes up more space than liquid water. When permafrost thaws, it loses a good amount of its volume. Think of it like thawing ice cubes made of water and muck: If you defrost the tray, the greenery will sink to the bottom and settle. “That’s exactly what happens in these ecosystems when the permafrost has a lot of ice in it and it thaws,” says Turetsky. “Whatever was at the surface just slumps right down to the bottom. So you get these pits on the land, sometimes meters deep. They’re like sinkholes developing in the land.”\n“Essentially, we’re taking terra firma and making it terra soupy,” Turetsky adds.\nAs the earth turns to soup, the landscape begins to scar. The process is so rapid and so violent, Turetsky says, that sometimes when she returns to a site she’s monitoring to check her temperature and methane sensors, she’ll find they are gone. “When you come back in, it’s a lake and there’s three meters of water at the surface. You have to probably say goodbye to your equipment,” she says.\nWhen these lands thaw, they play host to a number of processes. As ice turns to liquid water, trees flood and die off. Thus more light reaches the soil, further accelerating thawing. This is in contrast to gradual thaw, when the plant community largely stays the same as the ice thaws. Defrosted soil at the surface gets thicker and thicker, but it doesn’t catastrophically collapse.\nIn addition, when you think of permafrost regions, you might think of featureless tundras, but most is actually boreal forest. These northern forests have recently seen an unprecedented number of wildfires. “Much of the boreal forest burns more and more often, and when the ecosystem burns, it can actually accelerate the permafrost thaw,” says David Olefeldt of University of Alberta, coauthor on the paper. Without cover from these trees to shade it, the soil warms ever more intensely.\nAbrupt warming also exacerbates emissions from permafrost. In a gradual thaw, the warming top layers of the soil open up to hungry microbes, which consume nutrients and give off CO2. “In the summer, permafrost—the top layer at least—thaws, and then cracks can build,” says Northern Arizona University biogeochemist and plant ecophysiologist Christina Schaedel, who collaborates with the authors of this new paper, but wasn’t involved in the work. In the fall it freezes back up, creating a cycle in which soil layers get mixed down to the bedrock, concentrating carbon at the bottom. “With abrupt thaw, you’re exposing deeper layers to much warmer temperatures, and deep layers in permafrost can contain very high amounts of carbon,” Schaedel says.\nThis can become particularly problematic from an emissions standpoint if the collapsed land forms a pond of water with low oxygen content, and with a layer of rich carbon at the bottom. The microbes that thrive in this kind of environment produce methane as a byproduct, a far more potent greenhouse gas than CO2.\nHere’s an important consideration: When permafrost melts abruptly, it doesn’t just release carbon and then retire. That ecosystem can heal and begin sequestering carbon again. If the land has thawed, then collapsed and become inundated with water, new trees can’t grow. Instead, that ecosystem is likely to become dominated by mosses and grass-like sedges. Because the plant material is waterlogged, decomposition actually slows as it forms peat—thick, mucky, layers of organic matter.\n“So this rapid post-thaw peat accumulation that happens is eventually how it recovers some of the carbon that was lost,” says USGS research geologist Miriam Jones, coauthor on the new paper. “But I will say that in the permafrost, carbon has accumulated over millennia. And so upon thaw, it’s rapidly lost within years to decades.”\nIt will take centuries or millennia, depending on the ecosystem, to sequester all that carbon again. And of course in the Arctic, which is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, the composition of vegetal species that make up some of its ecosystems are transforming, in turn changing how they sequester carbon.\nThe more closely scientists can parse what happens when permafrost thaws rapidly, the better they account for how these landscapes emit greenhouse gases—and eventually sequester some, too. The bad news is, the emissions could be the equivalent of an entire industrialized nation’s greenhouse output. The better news is, it won’t be as much as humanity’s global toll. “Even though these are hot spots of carbon release, it’s going to take decades for those hot spots to become large enough to seriously impact the climate system,” says Turetsky. “But this is still something we need to take seriously.”\nAnd it’s something that needs far more research. Any climate modeling comes with inherent uncertainties—there’s no way to perfectly represent such complex systems. The uncertainty here is projecting how much land might succumb to abrupt thawing, says University of Alaska Fairbanks permafrost geophysicist Vladimir Romanovsky, who wasn’t involved in the work. Scientists have only begun to study these rapid thaw events, which often happen at extremely small scales.\n“It’s very difficult in this particular case to use the past to predict the future,” says Romanovsky. “That’s understandable, and definitely there are some ways to try to narrow down this uncertainty. But that uncertainty will be there for forever, because of the limitation of all the models to predict this process in the future, in particular the entire area of permafrost existence.”\nWhat’s clear, though, is that ecosystems in the Arctic are literally in upheaval. And the faster we cut emissions, the less they will suffer.\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n- Mark Warner takes on Big Tech and Russian spies\n- Chris Evans goes to Washington\n- The fractured future of browser privacy\n- I thought my kids were dying.

{"question":"How do medical surveillance requirements for lead exposure in the workplace compare to environmental justice movement's goals for protecting vulnerable populations?","answer":"Medical surveillance for lead exposure requires blood testing before employment and at least every 12 months, particularly for workers involved in activities like removal of lead paint, recycling appliances, and manufacturing leaded glass. This surveillance is necessary because lead can cause serious health issues including kidney, brain, and nerve damage, as well as common effects like headaches, tiredness, and nausea. The environmental justice movement aligns with these protective measures by advocating for safe workplace environments and fair treatment of all people. It specifically focuses on addressing the inequitable distribution of environmental hazards among vulnerable populations and demands that all individuals have the right to a safe environment, including workplace protections regardless of race, color, national origin, or income.","context":["Lead, ionising radiation & asbestos medicals\nWhat we can provide\nWe work closely with a number of occupational health physicians (OHP) across the UK to provide a convenient, cost effective solution to monitoring the exposure of your employees to lead, asbestos & ionising radiation.

{"question":"As a compliance officer drafting new policies, what's the contrast between how the Stark Law and False Claims Act define 'knowing' violations when it comes to professional courtesy arrangements? Format as legal definitions.","answer":"The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, meaning no specific intent or knowledge is required for a violation to occur when providing professional courtesy inappropriately. In contrast, the False Claims Act defines 'knowing' violations more broadly to include: (1) actual knowledge, (2) deliberate ignorance of the truth/falsity of information, or (3) reckless disregard of the truth/falsity of information - and specifically states that no proof of specific intent to defraud is required.","context":["For over 200 years, professional courtesy has been a hallmark of physician practice, a symbol of collegiality among doctors. Historians describe its 18th century beginnings as physicians providing charity care for the families of their deceased colleagues—an early form of health insurance for doctors’ widows and children. Over the years, the concept of collegial care also became the preferred alternative to physicians treating themselves or their own family members. In fact, the American Medical Association’s (“AMA”) first code of medical ethics created an obligation among doctors to reciprocate medical care and to extend the courtesy to physician family members as well. Today, the AMA recognizes professional courtesy as a “long-standing tradition” but not an ethical requirement. The federal government’s commentary about “the provision of free or discounted health care items or services to a physician or his or her immediate family members or office staff,” however, is far more cautious than nostalgic.  The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General’s advice that physicians “consult with an attorney” before extending professional courtesy warns that certain arrangements for free or discounted medical care run afoul of fraud and abuse laws.\nBecause most physicians continue to extend professional courtesy in some way, it is important that they exercise caution when delivering services free of charge, at a reduced rate, or with waived insurance co-payment, as such honorable conduct might implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Laws, the False Claims Act, or the civil monetary penalties law, or violate the terms of health plan provider contracts. Specifically, the OIG considers how the recipients of professional courtesy are selected and how the professional courtesy is extended when determining if the arrangement is fraudulent.\n- The Anti-Kickback Statute\nIf recipients of a physician’s professional courtesy are selected in a manner that directly or indirectly takes into account their ability to affect past or future referrals, the federal Anti-kickback Statute may be implicated. The federal Anti-kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful solicitation, receipt, offer or payment of anything of value in exchange for or to induce a referral of business for which payment maybe made by a federally funded health care program (e.g. Medicare, Medicaid). It is unlawful for a physician to provide free services if done to induce Medicare beneficiaries to purchase items or services from them, or to induce physicians to refer Medicare beneficiaries. For example, if an orthopedic surgeon treats a pain management physician at no charge because he refers patients for his consultations or MRI services at the orthopedic surgeon’s office, then the free service could be considered a kickback, particularly when professional courtesy is not extended to a family practice physician.\nAnti-kickback violations are punishable by up to five years in prison, with the potential for additional criminal fines up to $25,000, and administrative civil money penalties reaching as much as $50,000. Additionally, the OIG may commence administrative proceedings to exclude anyone convicted of an Anti-kickback violation from participation in federal and state health care programs or impose civil monetary penalties for fraud, kickbacks, and other prohibited activities.\n- The Stark Law\nThe Stark Law is a strict liability, civil statute that prohibits the referral by a physician of Medicare patients, for items or services by a certain providers, when the physician (or his/her immediate family member) has a financial relationship with the provider, unless an exception is met. Importantly, the law defines a financial relationship broadly, as it includes not only an ownership interest or a compensation arrangement, but also any form of remuneration. The Stark Law has developed over three phases. Phase II created an exception for certain professional courtesy arrangements, which was severely narrowed by the Phase III. Originally, the professional courtesy exception allowed 11 categories of providers (designated health service or DHS entities) to provide free or discounted health care items to physicians and their family members if six conditions were met: (1) the courtesy was offered to all physicians on the entity’s bona fide medical staff or in the entity’s local community without regard to the volume or value of referrals or other business generated between the parties; (2) the items and services were of a type routinely provided by the entity; (3) the entity’s professional courtesy policy was in writing and approved in advance by the entity’s governing body; (4) the courtesy was not offered to any federal health program beneficiary unless there was a good faith showing of financial need; (5) if the courtesy included a full or partial waiver of any coinsurance obligation, the entity was to notify the insurer in writing; and (6) the arrangement did not violate the federal Anti-kickback Statute. Today, the limited professional courtesy exception is only available to DHS entities with bona fide medical staffs—hospitals and physician practices. Phase III’s changes also eliminated condition (5) of the exception outlined in Phase II. Thus, the Stark Law allows physician practices to extend professional courtesy to all physicians in their local community, and the physicians’ family members, for services they routinely provide, according to an approved written policy, if the patients are not members of the Medicare or Medicaid program, and the arrangement would not otherwise violate the Anti-kickback statute. By extending professional courtesy to all physicians in the community, a physician’s selection of the beneficiaries of its professional courtesy is inclusive and unrelated to the volume or value of referrals.\n- Health Plan Provider Agreement Violations\nAnother way physicians extend professional courtesy is by waiving the co-payment for other physicians and only collecting the insurance payment. The practice is commonly referred to as billing “insurance only.” The purpose of co-payments is to discourage medically unnecessary care by making patients conscious of the cost of their medical care because they reflect a portion of the cost of care. By waiving the co-payment, however, a physician’s bill reflects a reduced cost of care. Physicians should ensure that their policies on waiving co-payments are consistent with applicable law and with the requirements of their agreements with insurers. Just as Medicare considers a claim for $80 when the physician waived the $20 co-pay for a $100 service to be fraudulent—then the total bill would be $80 and Medicare should only be billed $64 (80% of $80)—many provider agreements prohibit “insurance only” claims, in the absence of financial hardship, such claims are considered a misrepresentation of the cost of care.\n- The False Claims Act\nThe AMA provides that “when a copayment is a barrier to needed care because of financial hardship, physicians should forgive or waive the copayment.” The federal government, however, has taken the position that physicians who routinely and consistently waive their fees through free or discounted care submit false claims because they misrepresent their actual charges to the government health care programs. In other words, if the service is routinely provided at a discounted rate then it would be false for the physician to bill Medicare more than others by submitting a claim for the full cost of care. The False Claims Act authorizes the government to impose treble damages, plus $5,500 to $ 11,000 in fines per claim, upon any one who knowingly submits a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the government.\nNot surprisingly, there is no precedent of the OIG or Department of Justice prosecuting a physician’s benevolent extension of professional courtesy but there are plenty of instances where arrangements for free or discounted care implicate fraud and abuse laws. In a time of heightened health care regulation it is as important as ever that physicians are cautious in considering to whom and how they extend discounts and fee-waivers so that they are not punished for seemingly good deeds.\nMolly Nicol Lewis is an Associate of McBrayer, McGinnis, Leslie & Kirkland, PLLC.

Anyone who has knowledge of fraud against the government can sue the person or business responsible for the fraud, recover the funds on behalf of the government, and keep a percentage of the recovery as a reward.\nBut what is a false claim?\nBelow, I’ll discuss what constitutes a false claim under the False Claims Act and the amount of damages a whistleblower may recover on behalf of the US government.\nWhat is the False Claims Act?\n31 USC § 3729 of the False Claims Act lays out what a false claim is and when a private citizen can bring a Qui Tam action on behalf of the government.\nWhat is a False Claim Under the False Claims Act?\nIf you have knowledge that someone has defrauded the federal government, you may have a potential Qui Tam lawsuit under the False Claims Act. But what type of fraudulent activity qualifies under the False Claims Act?\n31 USC § 3729(a)(1) says that a person is liable under the False Claims Act if they:\n(A) knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval;\n(B) knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim;\n(C) conspires to commit a violation of subparagraph (A), (B), (D), (E), (F), or (G);\n(D) has possession, custody, or control of property or money used, or to be used, by the Government and knowingly delivers, or causes to be delivered, less than all of that money or property;\n(E) is authorized to make or deliver a document certifying receipt of property used, or to be used, by the Government and, intending to defraud the Government, makes or delivers the receipt without completely knowing that the information on the receipt is true;\n(F) knowingly buys, or receives as a pledge of an obligation or debt, public property from an officer or employee of the Government, or a member of the Armed Forces, who lawfully may not sell or pledge property; or\n(G) knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the Government, or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the Government…\nTwo obvious defenses to a Qui Tam lawsuit under the False Claims Act are that the person did not knowingly make a false claim or that the person did not make a claim as defined by the Act – how does the False Claims Act define “knowingly” and “claim?”\nWhat Does “Knowingly” Mean in the False Claims Act?\nUnder 31 USC § 3729(b)’s definition of “knowingly,” it is not necessary to prove that a person had actual knowledge of the fraud, as long as they acted in “deliberate ignorance” or “reckless disregard” of the truth or falsity of the claim:\n(1) the terms “knowing” and “knowingly”—\n(A) mean that a person, with respect to information—\n(i) has actual knowledge of the information;\n(ii) acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information; or\n(iii) acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information…\nThe False Claims Act also does not require proof of a “specific intent to defraud.”\nWhat is a “Claim” in the False Claims Act?\nWhat types of “claims” fall under the False Claims Act? First, it includes any demand for payment presented to “an officer, employee, or agent of the United States:”\n(A) means any request or demand, whether under a contract or otherwise, for money or property and whether or not the United States has title to the money or property, that—\n(i) is presented to an officer, employee, or agent of the United States; or…\nBut it also applies to contractors where the US government has provided any portion of the money demanded or where the US government will ultimately pay the bill:\n(ii) is made to a contractor, grantee, or other recipient, if the money or property is to be spent or used on the Government’s behalf or to advance a Government program or interest, and if the United States Government—\n(I) provides or has provided any portion of the money or property requested or demanded; or\n(II) will reimburse such contractor, grantee, or other recipient for any portion of the money or property which is requested or demanded…\nWhat are the Damages that a False Claims Act Defendant Must Pay?\nYou’ve identified fraud committed against the US government, and you’re prepared to file a lawsuit to force the individual or company to reimburse the government and collect your reward, but what are the damages?\n31 USC § 3729(a)(1)(G) provides for a civil penalty as well as payment of three times the amount of damages caused by the fraud:\n…is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not less than $5,000 and not more than $10,000, as adjusted by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (28 U.S.C. 2461 note; Public Law 104–410 ), plus 3 times the amount of damages which the Government sustains because of the act of that person.\nThe defendant is also “liable to the United States Government for the costs of a civil action brought to recover any such penalty or damages.”\nWhen Can a False Claims Acts Defendant Pay Reduced Damages\nUnder 31 USC § 3729(a)(2), if a defendant cooperates with the government and provides all information about the fraud to the government “within 30 days after the date on which the defendant first obtained the information,” their liability can be reduced somewhat, but they will still be required to pay no less than two times the amount of damages caused by the fraud:\n(2) Reduced damages. —If the court finds that—\n(A) the person committing the violation of this subsection furnished officials of the United States responsible for investigating false claims violations with all information known to such person about the violation within 30 days after the date on which the defendant first obtained the information;\n(B) such person fully cooperated with any Government investigation of such violation; and\n(C) at the time such person furnished the United States with the information about the violation, no criminal prosecution, civil action, or administrative action had commenced under this title with respect to such violation, and the person did not have actual knowledge of the existence of an investigation into such violation,\nthe court may assess not less than 2 times the amount of damages which the Government sustains because of the act of that person.\nFederal Qui Tam and False Claims Act Lawyer in Columbia, SC\nFor more information, call us at (803) 331-3421 or send us an email to set up a consultation about your case."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5c214342-ac49-46bb-ba96-ebb6b41aef87>","<urn:uuid:1897d211-458b-4c13-8340-a8b00cd69168>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Compare diagnosis timeline between Crohn's and hereditary cancer. Need timeframes. What's faster?","answer":"Based on the documents, Crohn's disease typically has a longer diagnosis timeline compared to hereditary cancer. Crohn's disease diagnosis involves multiple sequential steps that \\\"may sometimes take long\\\" - requiring health history review, physical tests, laboratory tests on stool and blood, X-rays, barium tests, CT scans, colonoscopy, and potentially biopsy samples. In contrast, hereditary cancer diagnosis can be more direct through genetic counseling and testing, which primarily involves recording family history and a genetic test requiring just a blood draw or cheek cell sample that is sent to a laboratory for analysis. The genetic testing process has also become more efficient in recent years, with the ability to test multiple genes simultaneously through panel testing rather than testing one gene at a time.","context":["Crohn’s disease is a perennial illness characterized by inflammation of the gut, in most cases it affects the lower section of small intestines also known as ileum. The condition is named after Dr. Burrill B. Crohn who first identified it in 1932 alongside his colleagues. This ailment belongs to a certain group of conditions known as IBD or Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. Nevertheless, know that Crohn’s syndrome is different from ulcerative colitis though sometimes they exhibit similar symptoms. The latter only affects large intestines, unlike its counterpart may form on both the small bowel and other parts of gastrointestinal (GI) tract such as a patient’s oral cavity.\nThough symptoms vary from one patient to another and some are more prevalent than the rest, there are certain tell-tale signals you should look out for. By and large these symptoms depend on exactly where the disease is occurring inside the bowel and its level of severity. Moreover, patients can experience periods of intense symptoms followed by remission periods which can last for a few weeks or even years. Otherwise, some of the common indications include:\n- Rectal hemorrhage\n- Chronic diarrhea\n- Abdominal pain and cramps\n- Weight loss\n- Loss of normal menstruation cycle\n- Constipation and bowel obstruction\nOther conditions may develop depending on particular complications related to the disease. For instance, someone with fistula in the rectal system may experience pain and leakage discharge around this area. Similarly, severe inflammation on different parts of the gastrointestinal tract may cause other side effects such as bowel perforation, severe pain, fever and abdominal perforation just to mention a few. Among younger kids, Crohn’s disease may interfere with normal growth and development.\nIn severe cases, those suffering from this condition may experience tears in their bowel lining which is usually accompanied with intense pain. Especially during bowel evacuation. Inflammation of the fistula gland may also occur in females, this is a tubular loop which connects intestines to the bladder and vagina. It’s a severe condition that requires urgent medical attention. Even if you suspect to be suffering from this disorder, consult with a doctor first for proper diagnosis before taking any further steps.\nCauses of Crohn’s Disease\nStatistics show that approximately 700,000 Americans live with the illness. Both men and women can be affected at whichever stage in life, though it tends to be more prevalent in adolescents and young adults aged between 15 and 35yrs old. The exact causes of Crohn’s Disease aren’t yet well understood, though poor diet and stress are believed to aggravate it. Recent studies also point a finger to genetics, heredity and environmental factors as possible contributors. It’s also likely that abnormal immune responses, and bacteria in the intestines or bowel lining may cause uncontrolled swelling associated with the disease.\nGastrointestinal tube usually contains helpful bacteria that the immune system doesn’t attack. However, for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases such as this one, such microorganisms are mistaken for harmful invaders triggering the immune system to mount a response. Leucocyte or white blood cells move from the blood to small intestines, where they cause inflammation as a normal response for microbial infection. Nevertheless, the swelling doesn’t reduce thus leading to perforation, ulceration and condensing of intestinal walls.\nMoreover, if any of your relatives has the condition then chances are high that you may develop it as well. Scientific observations show that there’s a genetic predisposition to Crohn’s syndrome. Around 10%-20% of patients have a close relative who also suffers from the malady, it could be a sibling, child or even parents. The risk is even higher when both parents have IBD condition. Though it seems to affect Caucasian people more than others, in recent years an increasing number of African Americans are also catching the disease.\nThe environment that one lives in also plays a major role in contracting this disorder, it’s more common in developed states rather than developing countries, urban settings more than rural, and in northern climates more than southern areas.\nForms of Crohn’s Disease\nThere are various types of this disease that can be differentiated based on the symptoms they exhibit, some of them include:\nIleocolic artery forms part of the superior mesenteric system which supplies blood to the ileum terminus, it runs all the way to appendix, cecum and lower section of the ascending colon. Ileocolitis is the most common strain of this disorder affecting the aforementioned artery. Swelling affects both small intestines and lower tip of the colon. Tell-tale symptoms are diarrhea and cramping in the lower right abdomen, this may also be accompanied with some significant weight loss.\nIt’s characterized by sparse inflammations in the upper half section of small intestine, also known as jejunum. The symptoms of Jejunoileitis include moderate to severe abdominal aching after food intake, and diarrhea as well. In more severe cases or after extensive exposure, fistulas may develop.\nTesting and diagnosis\nSince the disease is characterized by multiple symptoms, several tests are required in order to make a resolute diagnosis. Only a qualified physician can perform the examination since Crohn’s Disease sometimes bears similar traits as bacterial infection. For a report to be given, doctors will first check into your health history and other relevant information so that other likely symptom causes can be excluded. This procedure may sometimes take long, but one should be patient and give the doctor enough time to make a proper assessment.\nShould you experience any of the symptoms mentioned above, consult with a medic as soon as possible before the situation gets worse. Remember to bring a record of your most pressing symptoms during this stage. The doctor shall conduct standard physical tests and interviews to learn more about your general health, family history, diet and environment amongst other important factors.\nEarly diagnostic steps may also include laboratory tests on stool and blood, including X-rays on the lower and upper gastrointestinal tract. Barium which is a chemical that assists doctors see more detailed aspects of the organ by increasing X-Ray image resolution can also be used. This way the physician can see just how severe the infection is, the technique may as well help in finding problems in the small intestines which cannot be easily detected by other methods.\nBarium fluid can either be administered through the mouth or placed inside the patient’s rectum, when given orally it’s called upper GI series testing and the latter is referred to as barium enema. This liquid will flow through one’s intestines and appear white on the X-ray if disease is present. Making it easier to view problematic areas and other related complications such as ulcers, narrowed intestinal walls and abnormal organ connections.\nAlso known as Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance scan, your physician may advise to go for this method and visualize certain portions of the intestine which aren’t readily captured by other techniques. Sometimes these tests may as well include having fluoroscopic x-ray, also referred to as enteroclysis or ethnographies.\nAnother alternative way of viewing the intestines for Crohn’s Disease infection is by inserting a small microchip camera, it will take live pictures of the bowel while making a transit. These photos are then transmitted to a screen where doctors can begin forming their diagnosis by observing the snapped images. The mini recorder is then ejected through normal bowel movement after serving its purpose. Nevertheless, specialized endoscopes for imaging the small intestines may sometimes be required for parts that are difficult to reach.\nColonoscopy is effective in not just looking for inflammations but pre-cancerous polyps in the colitis as well. It involves spraying a certain blue dye on a detection tool which is then placed at the rectum, if it changes color then that’s a clear indication that something is wrong. This technique is sometimes referred to as Chromoendoscopy. Patients may experience blue bowel movements shortly after undergoing the procedure, but this coloring is temporary and will soon go away.\nUpper endoscopy is the use of certified medical equipment to visually observe the inner chambers of your colon, using a small camcorder mounted on the edge of a light tube. This apparatus is inserted through the patient’s mouth, down to their esophagus, stomach and as far down as duodenum. To further supplement visual examinations, doctors may obtain a biopsy of affected areas by removing small pieces of tissue. These cells are then analyzed carefully to determine if infection is present. Advances in modern medical technology ensures that this technique is painless and less intrusive when administered by doctors, the entire procedure can be accomplished in a single outpatient visit.\nTreatment for Crohn’s Disease\nEven if the doctor has diagnosed you with this disease don’t despair as there’s still room for recovery. There are various treatment options that can be sought out depending on severity of the condition. However, there’s no standard remedy which works for all people. Each individual’s case is unique and treatment follows what the physician thinks is best for you. The cure can either involve medications, surgery or diet alterations.\nThey are intended to subdue the immune system’s unusual inflammatory action which is responsible for your symptoms. This doesn’t just offer relief from everyday symptoms like diarrhea, fever, and aching, but also allows the bowel tissues to heal much faster. Once these symptoms have been subdued, medicine would be used to lessen the frequency of future malady flare-ups. When taken appropriately these drugs can be helpful in remission of Crohn’s disease. Antibiotics can also be used in severe cases where fistulas have developed inside the intestinal tract. Some common brands include ampicillin and metronidazole.\nIt’s a unique class of medications for suppressing the body’s immune system to avoid recurrent inflammation. They are typically used in individuals for whom other types of medications have not worked. Nevertheless, once administered these drugs may sometimes take several months before significant improvements are felt.\nNutrition and Diet\nPaying close attention to what you eat can help avert the onset of this disorder. Similarly, for those who are already diagnosed with it maintaining a healthy meal plan can help reduce appetite, while at the same time meeting the body’s energy requirements. Some Crohn’s symptoms such as diarrhea can limit your body’s capacity to absorb essential minerals like carbohydrates, vitamins and protein. The only way to recover is by focusing on a diet rich in these ingredients.\nWhile your food should mainly be organic, the physician may at times recommend certain restrictions on dairy products particularly for those who are lactose-intolerant. The diet should remain flexible and have a range of food categories which promote healing. Most patients find soft desserts such as bananas more comforting on their bowels than the spicy high-fiber foods.\nMaintaining a Gluten-free diet\nEating gluten-free meals is also important when treating Crohn’s disease, some of the foods which contain this substance and should be avoided include wheat, rye, barley and oat products. They have a potent immunotoxin protein capable of increasing zonulin levels in the intestines, this compound is responsible for causing ruptures in the bowel which can worsen your situation. Moreover, studies show that this element tends to stay longer in patients with the disease than other healthy people.\nIt’s also been discovered that Gluten feeds the bacteria which causes this disorder, something that might result to a perforated gut which is painful. Injured intestines can’t properly break down polysaccharides, consequently the nutrients are absorbed by the microbes which grow and become even more prevalent than before. These are some of the reasons why patients are advised to avoid foods rich in gluten if they want to heal faster.\nAll the above treatment techniques can be used together in an eclectic manner to increase their effectiveness. Your healthcare giver will determine which remedies are best suited for you based on the case at hand.\nEven though proper drug administration and dieting can be helpful, studies show that at least two-thirds of Crohn’s patients will still need surgery at some point in life. The operation won’t cure this disease, but rather preserves parts of your gastrointestinal tract which have not been affected. It also becomes necessary in cases where symptoms have overcome the medications given.\nSurgery involves taking out diseased section of your small intestines, then the two adjacent healthy bowel sides are stitched together to form a single union. This process is scientifically called anastomosis. When done correctly it can eliminate symptoms for many years to come. Different types of surgeries can be performed based on the location of disease, and also severity of illness.","Hereditary cancer is caused by changes in certain genes. Genes are the instructions that our bodies use to grow and function, and this information is passed down from parents to children. According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 5 to 10 percent of cancer diagnoses are due to an inherited form of cancer. This means that 5 to 10 percent of people who receive a cancer diagnosis had a genetic factor that caused them to have a higher likelihood of developing the disease.\nThe most common hereditary cancers include:\n- Breast cancer\n- Ovarian cancer\n- Uterine cancer\n- Colon cancer\n- Pancreatic cancer\nGenetic counseling is the first step in the genetic testing process. In a counseling session, you and a genetic counselor will discuss your family history, personal history with disease, symptoms you may be experiencing and other factors to assess possible health risks.\n- Estimate your risks for certain diseases\n- Estimate the risk of an inherited cancer in your family\n- Discuss ways to screen for and prevent cancer based on your risks\n- Review the pros and cons of genetic lab testing\n- Decide if genetic testing is right for you, given your particular risks and concerns\nOur team will also provide you with treatment options and resources to support you through your journey.\nWhile we offer genetic counseling services for a wide variety of diseases and disorders, many people use our services to better understand their cancer risks. Through genetic counseling and testing services, we can help you assess your risk of inherited cancers and empower you to lower your risks or detect cancer at its earliest stages.\nOne in three people develop cancer at some point in their lives, so chances are you or someone in your family has been affected. It’s important to remember that while a family history of cancer doesn’t mean you’ll develop cancer yourself, it may increase your risk. Genetic counseling can help you determine if you’re at a higher risk and if preventive and screening steps are right for you.\nOur genetic counseling teams recognize the importance of giving you a clear picture of your risks for cancer and other genetic conditions. Below are a few locations close to you.\nIf you or a close relative, such as a parent, child, brother, sister, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, grandparent of grandchild, have any of the following risk factors, a referral to a genetic counseling clinic may be right for you.\nHereditary breast and ovarian cancer\n- Invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) diagnosed at or under age 50\n- Two or more blood-related individuals with breast cancer\n- Male breast cancer\n- Ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer at any age\n- Breast cancer and one or more other separate cancers\n- Breast cancer and large head circumference (57 cm or larger for women, 59 cm or larger for men) and/or mental retardation/autism\n- Breast cancer with Eastern European Jewish ancestry, or Hispanic/Latino ancestry from Southern Colorado or northern New Mexico\nCancers that accompany breast cancer in inherited syndromes include a second, new breast cancer; brain, thyroid, pancreatic and endometrial cancers; lymphoma/leukemia; and adrenal cortical or choroid plexus carcinomas.\nHereditary colorectal cancer\n- Colorectal OR uterine cancer diagnosed under age 60\n- Two or more separate colorectal cancers in the same person\n- Three or more blood-related individuals with colorectal or uterine cancer\n- Colorectal cancer or uterine cancer and a personal or family history of other cancers\n- Ten or more cumulative gastrointestinal adenomas or hyperplastic polyps\n- Hamartomas (non-cancerous growths), juvenile polyps or Peutz-Jeghers polyps\n- Pathology of the colorectal tumor shows microsatellite instability or evidence of a mismatch repair defect\nCancers/tumors that accompany colorectal cancer in inherited syndromes include uterine, ovarian, stomach, small intestine, pancreatic and urinary tract cancers, as well as brain tumors, sebaceous adenomas and keratoacanthomas.\nOther hereditary cancer syndromes\n- An identified inherited/genetic syndrome\n- An individual with bilateral or multiple primary cancers or brain tumors\n- An individual diagnosed with cancer at an unusually young age\n- Three or more blood-related family members with the same type of cancer\n- Rare cancers, such as medullary thyroid cancer, adrenocortical carcinoma, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma\nGenetic counseling is the first step toward genetic testing. Information gathered during genetic counseling helps determine if genetic testing would be helpful in your situation.\nGenetic counseling involves recording a detailed family history and using that information to estimate your risks, helping to determine if testing is right for you and which tests to perform. Genetic testing may require a blood draw or cell sample from inside your cheek that are then sent to a laboratory for analysis.\nSome of the common questions asked in genetic counseling sessions include:\n- Have your relatives had genetic testing?\n- Which relatives have had cancer?\n- How old were they when they developed cancer?\n- What type of cancer(s) did they have?\n- Where did the cancer start in their body?\nYour test results, family history information and evaluation notes will only be released to someone if you sign a form stating that our office can release your information to that individual or office.\nThe Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), and other laws help protect people who undergo genetic testing against health insurance discrimination and employment discrimination. .\nSome inherited gene changes cause several medical complications. Genetic counseling and testing may determine if you’re at risk for another type of medical complication or another type of cancer in the future.\nWe can then take a proactive approach to your health, considering ways to prevent your risk of developing other conditions. Many people with potentially hereditary conditions seek genetic counseling and testing to help their relatives. If you already have a condition, the results of your genetic evaluation will tell you if there’s reason for your relatives to be cautious as well.\nMost insurance companies will cover the cost of a genetic test if it will improve a person’s medical care and you have a reasonable chance of having a specific condition.\nAt Centura Health, we attempt to bill insurance for the cost of genetic counseling appointments and verify insurance coverage prior to a scheduled appointment.\nIndividuals whose insurance pays for genetic counseling will be responsible for any applicable co-pay. If you schedule a genetic counseling appointment, you should receive a call prior to your appointment to explain what your cost would be. (If you’d like to see if genetic counseling would be a covered benefit, contact your insurance company and ask if they cover the CPT code 96040.)\nBecause Medicare and some insurance companies are not yet paying for genetic counseling, Centura gives a discount to those who pay out of pocket for these services.. Depending on the length of the appointment, individuals who self-pay will be charged approximately $40 or $80. If you’re not able to make these payments, Centura may be able to help.\nGenetic testing for inherited cancer syndromes has advanced rapidly in the last few years. Expanded knowledge of genetics has also led to better insurance coverage and additional testing options that allow you to receive the testing needed to make informed choices about your health. Many former patients who pursued genetic testing previously have elected to undergo new testing that has provided new information. One such patient remarked after a cause of the cancer in her family was finally found, “My family has been looking for this explanation for 20 years.”\nIf you were seen for genetic counseling previously, even if you received normal test results, you may benefit from a follow-up appointment. If you declined genetic testing in the past because of cost, new options may allow you to receive testing at no or very little cost. If you already had genetic testing and the results were negative or uncertain, you may qualify for additional genetic testing. Personal and family history updates may also impact genetic testing options, as well as cancer risk estimates and screening options. We recommend contacting your genetic counselor every one to two years to update your family history and see if any additional genetic testing options are available to you.\nBefore 2012, genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes was often done one gene or one syndrome at a time. Since 2012, technology has improved to be able to test many different genes at once. We now call these tests “panels” since they analyze numerous genes of concern at one time. These panels have made genetic testing cheaper because now one test can be done instead of having to order multiple tests from different labs. Panels also allow us to test individuals for rare hereditary cancer syndromes that previously would not have been covered by insurance.\nBRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been the center of conversations surrounding hereditary breast cancer since the mid-1990s. BRCA1/2 testing that was done before 2012 didn’t always include comprehensive rearrangement testing (also called “BART”) so it’s very possible that individuals who received normal BRCA1/2 test results before 2012 could still have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation that was undetected at the time.\nOther hereditary breast cancer genes\nIn addition, many different genes have long been known to interact with BRCA1 and BRCA2. Studies have now shown that individuals with mutations in these other genes also have an increased cancer risk. Testing for these additional genes is now available.\nHereditary colorectal cancer/Lynch syndrome\nTesting for hereditary colorectal cancer has also seen great advances. The most frequently identified hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome is Lynch syndrome, which leads to an increased risk for colorectal, uterine and other cancers. Additional genes that cause Lynch syndrome have been identified and more comprehensive testing of these genes is now available. New causes of hereditary colorectal cancer also have been identified. Individuals who received Lynch syndrome testing in the past could still have a mutation that wasn’t known at the time, or they may have a mutation linked to another hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome that wasn’t tested.\nOther hereditary cancers\nFor people with other cancer types, we now have testing options that did not exist previously. For example, there are now panels available that check 19 genes for hereditary kidney cancer and 13 genes for hereditary pancreatic cancer.\nIn summary, genetic testing for inherited cancer syndromes has been significantly updated in recent years, and individuals may qualify for additional genetic testing even if they tested negative in the past."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3bcdb95b-b895-48a8-a10e-1e3dccc90d91>","<urn:uuid:aab09745-8252-4b55-b4a5-177fbba10098>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role do user input validation and administrative access controls play in preventing SQL injection attacks?","answer":"User input validation acts as a front-line defense by filtering and allowing only legitimate SQL statements through whitelist processes and context-specific filtering, such as allowing only email-appropriate characters in email fields. Administrative access controls complement this by enforcing least privilege principles, where users and processes are given minimal necessary database permissions. This dual approach is critical because even if a hacker compromises an account through SQL injection, their ability to cause damage is limited by restricted privileges. Additionally, maintaining strong passwords, running antivirus scans on administrator systems, and monitoring server logs for suspicious activities help ensure comprehensive protection against SQL injection vulnerabilities.","context":["As there may be multiple, independent hacks in place, even if you're able to find and fix one vulnerability, we recommend continuing to search for others. Start your investigation by reading about the top ways websites get hacked by spammers.\n- Shell/terminal administrator access to your site's servers -- web, database, files\n- Knowledge of shell/terminal commands\n- Ability to run two antivirus scanners\nWe'll cover several common ways a site can be compromised. Hopefully, one of these vulnerabilities will either apply to your site or will shed light on additional possibilities.\nPlease be aware that vulnerability scanners differ from antivirus scanners. Vulnerability scanners can be far more invasive and have greater potential to cause unwanted damage to your site. Please follow all directions, such as backing up your site, before running the scanner.\nPotential vulnerabilities to investigate include:\nVirus-infected administrator’s computer\nOn an administrator’s virus-infected computer, the hacker may have installed spyware to record the site admin’s keystrokes.\n- Check for viruses on administrator’s systems. We recommend running\nseveral reputable antivirus scanners, or AV scanners, on every computer\nused by an administrator to log in to the site. Since new malware infections\nare constantly being designed to evade scanners, this action isn't a\nfoolproof method of virus detection. Since AV scanners might report false\npositives, running several scanners can provide more data points to\ndetermining whether a vulnerability exists. Also consider scanning both your\nwebserver and all devices used to update or post to the site, just to be safe.\n- If the AV scanner detects spyware, a virus, trojan horse, or any suspicious program, investigate the site’s server logs to check for activity by the administrator who owns the infected computer.\n- Log files may have been altered by the hacker. If not, correlating the administrator’s username with suspicious commands in the log file is further evidence that a virus on an administrator’s system caused the site to be vulnerable.\nWeak or reused passwords\nCracking a weak password can be relatively easy for hackers, and it provides them direct access to your server. Strong passwords have a combination of letters and numbers, punctuation, no words or slang that might be found in a dictionary. Passwords should only be used for one application, not reused throughout the web. When passwords are reused, it only takes one security breach-on one application for a hacker to find the login-and-password then attempt to reuse it elsewhere.\n- In the server log, check for undesirable activity, such as multiple login attempts for an administrator or an administrator making unexpected commands. Make note of when the suspicious activity occurred because understanding when the hack first took place helps determine what backups may still be clean.\nCheck that your server(s) have installed the latest version of the operating system, content management system, blogging platform, applications, plugins, etc.\n- Research (perhaps through a web search) all installed software to determine if your version contains a security advisory. If so, the possibility that outdated software caused your site to be vulnerable is quite likely.\n- As a best practice, always aim to keep your servers' software up to date, regardless of whether outdated software resulted in vulnerability issues this time.\n4. Permissive coding practices, such as open redirects and SQL injections\nOpen redirects are coded with the intention for the URL structure to allow the addition of another URL so users can reach a useful file or webpage on the site. For example:\n- If your site is abused by open redirects, you likely noticed the message in Search Console provided example URLs that included open redirects to an undesirable destination.\n- To prevent open redirects in the future, check if \"allow open redirects\" is turned on by default in your software, whether your code can prohibit off-domain redirects, or if you can sign the redirect so that only those with properly hashed URLs and the cryptographic signature can be redirected.\nSQL injections occur when a hacker is able to add rogue commands to user input fields executed by your database. SQL injections update records in your database with unwanted spam or malware content, or they dump valuable data to output for the hacker. If your site uses a database, and especially if you were infected with the malware type SQL injection, it’s possible that your site was compromised by a SQL injection.\n- Login to the database server and look for suspicious content in the database, such as otherwise regular text fields that now show iframes or scripts.\n- For suspicious values, check that the user input is validated and properly escaped or perhaps strongly typed so they can't be executed as code. if user input isn't checked before database processing, SQL injection may be a root-cause vulnerability on your site.","How to Prevent SQL Injection\nSQL injection attacks are one of the top threats to the security of websites and web applications. In fact, the SQL injection threat has been number one on OWASP’s Top 10 list since it was publicly disclosed more than 10 years ago.\nSQL injection attacks have caused historic havoc. They have been used to breach the World Health Organization (WTO) database and steal data from internal staff, and also to attack U.S. government agencies, including the U.S. Army and NASA. SQL injection has also been used to steal the personal data of close to 157,000 TalkTalk customers and this is only the tip of the iceberg.\nIn the same way that SQL injection attacks are relatively straightforward and anyone with some SQL knowledge or access to tools could launch them, their prevention and protection strategies are also straightforward.\nIn this post, we’ll go through the process of an SQL injection, the types of SQL injections and why they are exploitable. We’ll also highlight the prevention and protection mechanisms for all types of SQL injections.\nThe SQL Injection: What Is It and How Does It Work?\nAn SQL (Structured Query Language) injection is a type of cyberattack that aims to substitute a legitimate website’s input, such as a username, password, or URL, with an SQL statement that injects code.\nHackers perform an SQL injection, by entering fake SQL statements into a website input form view bits and pieces of information or alter a database table. In other words, hackers use unauthorized SQL code to “piggyback” on an authorized path (an input form) to reach and interfere with a site’s SQL database.\nWhere Is the Vulnerability?\nA site with an SQL injection vulnerability has forms of entry, such as input application forms or URL strings, that are unable to differentiate between a user’s input and the native commands in the site’s code.\nText fields, such as the username or password areas on login pages that allows a user or hacker to interact with the backend SQL database are at risk.\nFor example, when a user inputs a username and password, the information is compared with the website’s database using SQL statements.\nAs shown in the screenshot below, a SELECT statement is the one used to select data from a database and return results to a result table. This statement could be exploited to steal data.\nRefer to the screenshot above. When someone types a username in the text input, the SELECT statement will search in the database’s table users by utilizing this input from the user which according to the example code above, relies on a variable (“ + txtUserId;).\nIf there is no protection or way to prevent a user from entering invalid inputs, the user could enter calculated SQL statements. For example, an unknown visitor could enter a “crafted” input in the username field, such as “105 OR 1=1”.\nWith this crafted input, the SQL statement would change, but still be valid.\nNormally, the variable (+ txtUserId, as stated above) would be replaced with a normal UserId, such as “Diego”.\nHowever, with this crafted input, something else happens. The invalid input “105 OR 1=1” was designed by the hacker to intentionally create a brand new query. For example, OR 1=1 means “always TRUE”. It makes the database return all row values from the Users table.\nAlthough calculated statements like these can be dangerous, there are far sneakier ways hackers can steal, gain control, and even destroy entire databases.\nFor example, by entering something like “or 1=1–” in the password field, a new SQL statement is created that could return all password values for a Users table.\nWhy Certain Types of SQL Injections Are Exploitable\nAlthough SQL injections are generally easy to execute, hackers tend to be really persistent, especially if they want to get something out of an SQL injection.\nSQL injections can be classified based on the server’s response and the channel extraction method. Based on the server’s response, an SQL injection can be either performed by error or blind (inferential), and based on the communication channel, an SQL injection can be either in-band or out-of-band.\nA. In-band Error-based SQL injection\nAn in-band SQL injection occurs when a hacker uses the same communication channel to launch the attack and collect results. In the in-band error-based SQL injection, the hacker attempts to find and exploit visible error results given by the database server, to retrieve information, such as table names and contents. This intention behind this type of SQLi attack is used to learn as much as possible about the structure of the database.\nAn error-based SQL injection is exploitable due to:\n- User-supplied data (input) is not filtered by the web application.\n- Dynamic SQL queries (non-parameterized calls).\nUnsanitized inputs can lead to error-based feedback that provide too many useful clues for the attacker.\nB. In-band UNION-based SQL injection\nAn in-band UNION-based SQL injection is another type of in-band SQL injection in which a hacker uses the same communication channel to attack and gather results. This SQLi is based on the UNION SQL operator, which extends the results provided by the original query. For example, it could combine the results of two (or more) SELECT statements into a single result.\nA UNION-based SQLi is exploitable due to:\n- User-supplied data (input) is not sanitized by the web application.\n- Dynamic SQL queries (non-parameterized calls).\nC. Blind Attacks (Inferential SQL injection)\nAs the name suggests, hackers who perform blind SQL injection attacks have no idea what is on the other end. The application or website is still vulnerable to SQL injection, but the HTTP response does not come with clues about the SQL query or database error. The hacker can launch this type of attack by blindly reconstructing the database structure with the response and behavior of the server. A blind SQL injection can be Boolean or Time-based.\nA blind SQLi is exploitable due to:\n- Lack of parameterized queries or prepared statements.\n- Dynamic SQL queries using their procedures.\nD. Out-of-Band (OOB) SQLi\nThis type of SQLi occurs when an attacker exploits two different channels, one for launching the attack and the other for collecting data. This attack uses an OOB channel, such as DNS or HTTP protocol to exfiltrate data.\nAn OOB SQLi is exploitable due to:\n- Lack of sanitized or validated inputs from web applications.\n- Lack of (or poor) network security measures that allow the listening database server to initiate outbound requests (HTTP or DNS) to the public.\n- The right permissions to run the necessary function that starts the outbound request.\nHow to Prevent an SQL Injection\nAn SQL injection is one of the easiest to perform and most effective forms of cyber attacks. On the other hand, it is also relatively easy to defend against an SQL injection. The best way to prevent an SQL injection attack is to separate data from queries and commands using prepared statements.\nHow to defend against an SQL injection\n- User Prepared Statements\n- Validate User Inputs\n- Enforce Least Privilege\n- Perform Penetration Testing\n- Set Up a a WAF (Web Application Firewall)\nA. Use Prepared Statements with Parameterized Queries\nPrepared statements guarantee that user inputs passed to SQL statements are safe. The idea is that a user’s input cannot directly influence the SQL commands that control and access an SQL database. The database will treat all inputs (including malicious SQL statements) as ordinary inputted data and not as commands.\nIn a prepared statement, the variables in a query are always separated from the rest of the query. In other words, when a developer defines the code for SQL queries (prepared statements) the user input and code are separated.\n- Parameterize stored procedures.\n- Avoid dynamic SQL or at least parameterize them.\n- Prepared statements also help escape to evade user-supplied inputs. Configure user inputs to a specific function to ensure that characters, such as the single quote (‘), are not passed along to an SQL query as instructions.\nB. Validate User Inputs\nAnother way to defend a website’s front line against SQL injections is to validate user inputs. With this method, whatever a user inputs to the web application, there is always a validation (filtering) process allowing/disallowing inputs.\nTo validate user inputs, identify and define the essential SQL statements. Establish an SQL statement whitelist that helps filter out all unvalidated statements and accepts valid inputs.\nAdditionally, user data input can also be defined by context. For example input fields can be filtered for email addresses by allowing only the characters used in the email, such as the @ symbol or phone number inputs, which can be filtered by only allowing numbers.\nC. Enforce Least Privilege\nAs a second line of defense, the level of access and user’s privileges to a database should be limited. It is important to restrict access rights to the specific users, accounts, or computer processes that need to perform a specific activity on the database. For example, if a website or application only needs to use SELECT statements for the database, there should not be any user privileges to use INSERT or DELETE.\nEnforcing the least privileged account strategy will help reduce the level of damage in case a user account gets compromised. If a hacker steals a user’s account information, they will also have limited access to the database.\nD. Perform Penetration Testing\nA great way to prevent an SQL injection is to know the website’s flaws and to perform regular assessments of the website’s defenses by auditing suspicious activities, user privileges, and using pen-testing tools.\nSQL injection hackers and even script kiddies are beginning to use automation for time-consuming and repetitive tasks. Examples are Havij, an automated SQL Injection tool, that helps penetration testers (or bad actors) to find and exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities. Another is SQLMap, an open-source penetration tool used to automatically scan, detect, and perform SQL injections and take control of databases.\nE. Set Up a WAF\nUse a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect web applications with access to databases. A WAF can filter out malicious traffic data by using a set of security rules to monitor and filter suspicious traffic behavior.\nCloudBric’s Cloud-Based Smart Web Application Protection (SWAP) is one of the most comprehensive WAF solutions against SQL injections, and other common threats. SWAP uses a patented logic (including pattern matching, semantics, and heuristic analysis) and a ruleset to automate attack detection and mitigation.\nSQL injections pose a great threat to web apps and sites. Hackers can steal, modify, and even destroy entire databases.\nThe best way to prevent an SQL injection is to parameterize statements. This ensures that all parameters (like inputs) that are passed into SQL statements are treated safely. Another way to defend against these threats is to validate or filter all user inputs.\nTo stay ahead of the game, we also recommend enforcing your user privileges and access rights, using an advanced WAF, and always pen-testing the website’s defenses."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5face86a-f02d-41f1-90f4-8216ed2cc96c>","<urn:uuid:744f28a5-65f6-4866-99a0-409456138607>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As an experienced gardener dealing with winter plant care, I'm curious - how do anti-desiccants work to protect plants, and what's the proper timing for moving citrus trees indoors? 🌿","answer":"Anti-desiccants work by reducing moisture loss from leaves and needles by protecting the pores, which is especially important for broadleaf evergreens that don't drop their leaves. They should be applied when temperatures begin dropping below 50°F, on a dry day with no precipitation expected within 24 hours. As for moving citrus trees indoors, this process should begin about a month before the first predicted frost. It requires a 4-week acclimation period: first two weeks, place the plant in direct sun during mornings and shade in afternoons, then keep it completely shaded for the following two weeks. Before bringing indoors, thoroughly spray the tree with a garden hose to remove pests and treat with insecticidal soap.","context":["You’ve removed late-autumn weeds, layered on the mulch, pruned appropriately, possibly even covered or wrapped your plants – so why do some still die in the winter, despite all your well-meaning efforts?\nMany plants die during winter because they dry out, or desiccate. As temperatures drop, the ground freezes and plant roots cannot take water from the soil, no matter how much snow may fall. This causes the plant to use stored water from the leaves and stems as part of the transpiration process, during which water exits the plant through the leaves. If the sun is shining or the wind is blowing, transpiration increases and more water exits the leaves. If no water is available and transpiration continues, the plant will soon die. Because evergreen plants do not drop their leaves, they are especially susceptible to this death.\nHow can you help your plants stay well-hydrated through the frozen drought of winter? The first step is to remember healthy plants in the summer survive the hardships of winter far better than sickly or stressed plants. Through the spring, summer and fall, you should always be on the lookout for signs of pests, diseases and damage, and take all necessary steps to keep your plants thriving.\nSecond, be sure to water well even when temperatures begin dropping below freezing. Later, if the ground thaws, water before the ground refreezes. Water slowly to provide a deep drink without waterlogging the roots, however, so they are not damaged by ice.\nThe third step is to use an anti-desiccant, also called an anti-transpirant, to reduce the moisture loss from the leaves and needles. Because broadleaf evergreens such as boxwood, aucuba, holly, rhododendron, many laurels, Japanese skimmia and leucothoe do not drop their leaves, they are especially vulnerable to winter death. Using a product such as Wilt-Pruf to reduce transpiration by protecting the pores will save many broadleaf evergreens.\nWhen using any horticultural product, be sure to check the label and follow all instructions properly. Some conifers such as cedar, cypress, juniper and pine may benefit from these products. However, be sure to read the instructions to prevent burning specific conifers. Also, do not use on “waxy” blue conifers, such as blue spruce, which already have an oily protective film on the nettles.\nHere are a few reminders to get the best protection from an anti-desiccant:\n- Plan to apply when day temperatures begin dropping below 50⁰ Fahrenheit. Apply when temperatures are above freezing on a dry day with no rain or snow anticipated within 24 hours. This allows the product to thoroughly dry. Spraying in freezing temperatures will cause plant damage.\n- Do not spray conifers until thoroughly dormant, generally in late winter. This prevents trapping moisture in the needles which could burst when frozen.\n- Generously apply to dry leaves and needles. Don’t forget the undersides. Spray from several angles to ensure complete coverage.\n- Because the anti-desiccant will break down in light and warmth, reapply in late winter on a dry day when temperatures are above freezing for at least 24 hours.\nBeyond Winter Drought\nOther than protecting your landscape evergreens from winter drought, there are other uses for anti-desiccants. Many gardeners use it to protect newly transplanted shrubs from drying winds and sunshine as they settle in. It also provides protection to tender bulbs going into storage. A quick spray in early winter protects rose canes and hydrangea stems. Spraying onto live or cut Christmas trees and carved pumpkins slows the drying process, making them last longer for greater holiday enjoyment.\nTo answer your questions, or to choose the best product for your landscape plants, come in to discuss anti-desiccants with one of our friendly and knowledgeable staff members. Together, we can reduce the number of plants you lose to the dryness of winter and keep your garden beautiful and healthy.","Citrus trees are a tough, durable lot that can take a touch of cool weather. While frost is not likely to kill a healthy, mature lemon tree it can certainly inflict damage when temperatures drop below 29 degrees Fahrenheit for longer than 30 minutes. Winter hardy to U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 8b through 11, citrus varieties vary in their tolerance to the cold. With the exception of the Meyer lemon (Citrus meyeri), lime and lemon trees are the most sensitive and least cold hardy citrus. With minimal effort, you can easily care for your lemon tree throughout the winter and protect it from seasonal damage.\nIndoor Lemon Trees\nAcclimate your outdoor container lemon tree to the environmental change before you move it inside for the winter. Do this about a month before the first predicted frost in your area. Leave the plant in direct sun during the mornings and move it to shade in the afternoons for two weeks. Then leave it completely shaded for two weeks.\nBlast the lemon tree with the garden hose to remove any unseen pests before bringing it inside for the winter. Spray the foliage and trunk thoroughly. Allow the plant to drip dry. Treat the lemon tree with insecticidal soap to pick off any bugs you may have missed. Aphids and scale are common indoor citrus pests. The soap will kill most pests on contact. Follow the packaging instructions.\nMove the lemon tree to the coolest room in your home. A temperature range between 55 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal. Provide as much bright natural sunlight as possible. Your lemon tree will perform best with at least eight hours of bright light daily. A partially heated sun room or bright south-facing window work well.\nPut a shallow container of pebbles under the lemon tree’s pot to give the plant the extra humidity it needs indoors, where the air is much dryer. Cover the pebbles partially with water. Do not allow the bottom of the pot to sit in water.\nWater your indoor lemon tree just enough to keep the root ball from completely drying out. Water thoroughly when the soil is dry 2 to 3 inches deep. Evenly moisten the surface soil, but do not allow it to become soggy or wet.\nFeed the tree’s foliage with a balanced liquid fertilizer with micronutrients diluted to half-strength once monthly throughout the winter. Spray the foliage liberally to coat all surfaces well. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations.\nWash the lemon tree’s leaf surfaces with a soft, damp cloth weekly. This will go a long way toward preventing pest infestations. Treat the plant periodically with insecticidal soap, if necessary, while it winters indoors. Consult the manufacturer’s recommendations for application frequency.\nUse clean, sharp shears to prune out dead or damaged limbs immediately after the last expected frost for your area. Trim out any branches that rub or cross over each other to open the canopy up slightly and allow for air circulation. Snip some tips off to shape the lemon tree to your taste. Indoor and backyard citrus trees require minimal pruning.\nOutdoor Lemon Trees\nPick ripe fruit from your outdoor in-ground lemon tree before frost hits. Temperatures below 30 degrees typically ruin most citrus fruits, with the exception of Lisbon and Eureka. These lemons have thicker protective rinds and can remain on the tree down to 28 degrees without sustaining damage.\nWater outdoor lemon trees during the winter to protect the roots from damage. Moist soil freezes but will not harm the roots. A healthy tree is better prepared to deal with cold conditions than a dry, water-stressed plant. Give young trees about 1 inch of water weekly November through February in the absence of rainfall. Supply more mature trees 1 to 2 inches weekly September through February if there is no precipitation.\nFeed the mature lemon tree a balanced citrus fertilizer with micronutrients if older foliage begins to lighten in color. Follow the packaging instructions. Do not fertilize the tree as long as leaves remain bright medium-green. Do not feed outdoor lemon trees under 2 years old during the winter months. Young plants are more susceptible to cold damage from foliage flushes than older specimens are.\nWrap the lemon tree’s trunk in several layers of cardboard to insulate it against frost. Cover the trunk from just below the main limbs to the ground. Secure the cardboard with duct tape. Leave it in place until the last frost in your region.\nString small outdoor holiday lights throughout the lemon tree’s branches to help warm them before frost hits.\nWatch for aphids and scale, which may attack your lemon tree’s foliage during the winter. Knock them off with a strong spray from the garden hose. Treat the tree with insecticidal soap as needed. Follow the packaging instructions for repeat applications.\nPut off severe pruning until after the last predicted frost for your area. Do not be tempted to clip winter-damaged vegetation during the winter. Plan to prune in early spring, just after new growth emerges. You will be able assess frost damage and what needs to be pruned off more accurately following spring flush.\nYour Planting Articles\nThings You Will Need\n- Garden hose\n- Insecticidal soap\n- Shallow container\n- Balanced liquid fertilizer with micronutrients\n- Soft cloth\n- Clean, sharp shears\n- Balanced citrus fertilizer with micronutrients\n- Duct tape\n- Outdoor holiday lights\n- If you have a sudden abundance of lemons on hand, squeeze and freeze the juice. Freeze some of it in ice trays to create tiny individual servings of the delicious juice for later use.\n- Acclimate your lemon tree to the spring outdoor move gradually over a four-week period. Bring it in at night throughout the transition. Move it to a shady spot during the day for two weeks. Let it spend the following two weeks in full sun during the morning and in the shade during the hot hours.

{"question":"I'm implementing kinase activity assays in my lab. What are the specific FRET-pairs used in LanthaScreen Assays? Please list them.","answer":"LanthaScreen Assays use two sets of FRET-pairs: 1) Terbium/Fluorescein (or GFP) and 2) Europium/AlexaFluor 647.","context":["LanthaScreen Technology Overview\nTime Resolved-Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) is a preferred fluorescent assay formats in drug discovery laboratories. TR-FRET assays are less susceptible to compound interference than other assay formats and may be applied to multiple target classes. To support this technology focus, Invitrogen has developed LanthaScreen kinase activity assays. Invitrogen uses two sets of FRET-pairs in developing our LanthaScreen Assays: Terbium/Fluorescein (or GFP) and Europium/AlexaFluor 647.\nThe LanthaScreen kinase activity assay format is based on the use of a long-lifetime terbium or europium chelate as the donor species and fluorescein as the acceptor species. When terbium (or europium) and fluorescein (or AlexaFluor 647) labeled molecules are brought into proximity, energy transfer takes place causing an increase in acceptor fluorescence and a decrease in donor fluorescence. These fluorescent signals can be read in a time-resolved manner to reduce assay interference and increase data quality.\nThe time-resolved spectra above illustrate energy transfer occurring when terbium and fluorescein are brought into proximity via biomolecular interactions. The TR-FRET value is determined as a ratio of the FRET-specific signal measured with a 520 nm filter to that of the signal measured with a 495 nm filter, which is specific to terbium. The inset shows the time-resolved spectra in the absence of energy transfer.\nOvercome compound interference using LanthaScreen Assays\nTR-FRET assays offer advantages over fluorescent polarization (FP) assays when background fluorescence is a problem. In FP assays, background fluorescence due to fluorescent library compounds is often depolarized. Background signal due to scattered light, like that from precipitated compounds, is often polarized. Either phenomenon can lead to a false positive or false negative result, depending on the assay configuration. Because the donor species used in a TR-FRET assay has a fluorescent lifetime that is many orders of magnitude longer than background fluorescence or scattered light, energy transfer can be measured after the interfering signal has completely decayed. Additionally, unlike FP assays, TR-FRET assays can be formatted using limiting receptor and excess tracer concentrations, driving potential cost savings. Our LanthaScreen assays are resistant to interference from color quenchers, light scatterants, and fluorescent compounds.\nLanthaScreen Tb exploits Terbium as the donor chemistry\nMany TR-FRET assays use europium as the ‘long lifetime label’ doner paired with various far-red acceptors (including allophycocyanin (APC)). Due to the large molecular mass of APC (>100 KD) it has typically been used as a streptavidin conjugate, to in-directly couple to the biotinylated substrate in a trimolecular FRET complex. In contrast, LanthaScreen Tb utilizes terbium as the long lifetime label, enabling direct coupling to fluorescein as the acceptor species. This has the immediate advantage of being able to overcome several issues common to use of APC as the acceptor:\n- Simplify assay optimization. Since the donor-acceptor pair in a terbium-based TR-FRET assay does not require a biotin-avidin mediated interaction, three-compound matricies are not required to determine optimal reagent concentrations.\n- Avoid problems due to steric bulk associated with the large streptavidin-APC reagents including long incubation times to reach equilibrium.\n- Reduce assay cost by replacing streptavidin-APC with fluorescein (as well as remove lot-to-lot variations in streptavidin-APC).\nUse of LanthaScreen Tb also enables the use of GFP as the acceptor molecule, which allows for:\n- Development of protein substrates expressed as GFP-fusion proteins.\n- Development of cell lines expressing GFP-fusions for detection of phosphorylation which has occurred in a live-cell context via TR-FRET.\nIf a traditional Europium/Far Red FRET pair is preferred, Invitrogen offers all of our peptide-based substrates and matched antibodies with this alternative dye pair.
