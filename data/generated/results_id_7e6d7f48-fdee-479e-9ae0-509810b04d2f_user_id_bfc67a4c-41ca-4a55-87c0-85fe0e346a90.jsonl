{"question":"在厨房设计中，what's the key difference between open-concept kitchen layouts 和 wheelchair-accessible kitchen designs 在空间布局方面?","answer":"Open-concept floor plans focus on general accessibility and proximity to dining areas, while wheelchair-accessible kitchen designs require specific measurements - countertops positioned at 32 inches or lower height and open spaces underneath sinks and cooktops to allow wheelchairs to pull under for easy access and maneuverability.","context":["As we grow up, grow older or welcome new people into our homes, our needs as homeowners can change. A house that is designed, built or renovated according to the principles of universal design can help your home keep pace with changes in your family’s needs….and create a safer and more accessible environment for anyone who lives or visits there, regardless of their age or physical ability.\nTo help you make sure your is accessible to everyone, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) offers the following tips on what you should consider when creating or renovating your living space:\nIf you’re designing a new home or planning significant renovations, open-concept floor plans are generally more accessible than floor plans with smaller enclosed rooms.\nConsideration should also be given to the location of each room. For example, it’s a good idea to keep the kitchen close to the dining area, and noisy spaces (such as a TV or recreation room) away from quiet spaces (such as bedrooms).\nTo make your home easier to access by people with mobility impairments, install a zerostep entry and make at least one half-bathroom accessible to someone in a wheelchair. You should also consider whether you need doors in all rooms and, where they are needed, and what type they should be. All main interior doors should have an opening width of at least 810 mm (32 inches).\nIf someone in a wheelchair, walker or scooter lives in or regularly visits your home, your hallways should be at least 1220 mm (48 inches) wide, with a turn-around space at all entrance areas, foyers and at the ends of hallways. Ideally, a path at least 915 mm (36 inches) wide should be provided into and through all living spaces.\nWhen planning shelving or storage units, consider the different reaching abilities of your family members, as well as how those abilities might change over time. Adjustable shelves can always be changed as needed.\nLighting can also contribute to both the ambiance and safety of your home. To enhance safety, the lighting should be bright and consistent, especially along hallways and stairs. Permanent night-lights next to bedrooms and bathrooms can also be a good idea.\nThe choice of materials and finishes in your home will depend on your taste, budget and personal preferences. But remember that these choices may affect the usability of your home. For example, contrasting colours and textures in wall may help people with low vision identify primary routes and functional areas.\nWhen buying furniture, choose pieces that are sturdy and stable. If someone in your family has difficulty getting up from a seated position, consider providing at least one chair with a firm cushion, stable arm rests and a seat height of at least 450 mm (18 inches).\nTo improve the acoustic quality of a room and reduce background noises for anyone who is hearing-impaired, you can add “soft” elements to the room such as carpets, drapes, upholstered furniture and acoustic ceiling tiles. For people who are visually-impaired, “hard” surfaces such as ceramic flooring or metal paneling can help enhance reflected sounds and assist with orientation needs, make a living area more “acoustically alive”.\nCanada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) is the Government of Canada’s national housing agency.

Every square foot in the home counts. If you are designing the home, you want to make sure that interior and outside spaces can cater for a person with mobility restrictions. A building site that has even terrain will facilitate enjoyment and safety of the wheelchair user when accessing the backyard, gardens, and other outdoor spaces. In the design work of the home, there are critical areas that you should focus on particularly those that are most accessed by a wheelchair user.\nA barrier-free home needs to have doors that offer maximum convenience and allows the wheelchair to pass through and turn around without ease. A 3 feet wide doorway can accommodate most wheelchairs. In areas where there is frequent traffic, for example, from the kitchen to the dining room, you need to have extra wide passageway that is 4 feet. Again, no need to have a door in the wider passageways to allow the wheelchair to easily maneuver the space. Using pocket doors saves valuable space that makes the wheelchair move around easily.\nA bathrooms is an important space in the home and it should be designed to offer sufficient space for the wheelchair. Having a wall-hung countertop that has a height of about 30 inches can help the chair user easily access it. Medicine cabinets, soap dishes, and toothbrush holders need to be fitted at height and locations convenient and functional for wheelchair users. Many wheelchair users opt for roll-in showers to allow speed and handiness when bathing. The dimensions for the roll-in shower can be about 4 feet wide and 5 feet long. Handheld showers may be an alternative to having low positioned shower arms. It is important that you avoid rugs and carpets in the bathroom floor.\nA wheelchair user that is involved with food preparation and dishwashing requires some basic kitchen space features to ensure proper functionality and movement. The countertops can be positioned at a height of about 32 inches or less. The space underneath the cooktop should be open to allow the wheelchair pull under. The sink areas also needs to be open underneath so that the chair will easily roll under to allow the individual to reach water controls, wash dishes, and access the countertop.\nInstalling a firm, level floor allows easy wheelchair maneuverability. You can have floors made of materials like hardwood, conventional tiles, or vinyl coverings because these offer grip to the chair’s wheels and reduce skidding. Carpets can be avoided, however, if they have to be used, they need to be tightly woven and without a foam layer underneath to ensure easy wheeling from one area to another.\nThese are some of the locations and spaces in the home that you need to focus on when designing the home to ensure easy accessibility by people who use wheelchairs. The positions and locations, especially regarding the heights where accessories and fixtures are mounted will also go a long way determining how convenient, easy, and functional the home is to people with mobility problems."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e1b01c98-05fc-44d3-9ccb-3518dd0b9690>","<urn:uuid:59466e58-96bf-4662-8a0b-85e0a0ee088b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a data visualization specialist, I'm curious about color usage in charts. What are the best practices for using color in data visualization, and how does this relate to web accessibility standards?","answer":"Color in data visualization works best as a simplification tool for grouping data points into categories or gradations, but should be used sparingly with only a few colors at once. It shouldn't be used to indicate specific values since people struggle to interpret numeric figures from color. For web accessibility, WCAG recommends a luminance difference of 3:1 or greater between text and surrounding colors. It's important to consider color blindness - about 15% of the world's population has some form of disability, so designs should be tested for how they appear to those with different types of color blindness. Tools like contrast ratio calculators can help ensure proper visibility while maintaining accessibility standards.","context":["This is part of a series of posts from Typekit’s resident data analyst, Mike Sall. In this installment, Mike shares best practices for designing data.\nA central part of analyzing data is thinking about how we need to look at the numbers to understand them. Data visualization is powerful because it can condense a lot of complicated information into a small space and so answer important questions. But this can only happen when the design allows those answers to show through.\nThe variety of charts out there may seem endless, but they really boil down to six core visual elements: grouping, size, position, angle, color, and annotation. When we visualize data, these elements are our building blocks. In this post, I’ll step through each of these visual elements and show how we can use them to design thoughtful visualizations of our data.\nThe most basic element we have in data visualization is grouping: how we aggregate all the underlying data into individual data points. This might sound obvious because we often go through this process without thinking about it. If we want to show quarterly revenues, for example, then clearly our data points are the revenue totals for each quarter. But why not monthly, or weekly, or daily, or even hourly?\nLet’s say we’re charting user sign-ups and need to decide between daily and weekly granularity. If we’re trying to see whether we’ve improved over the last few months, then the fact that sign-ups naturally dip every weekend doesn’t matter; in this case, a weekly rather than daily grouping will help us more easily compare one week to the next and observe the overall trend. But if we announced a major feature on Tuesday and want to see how that affected sign-ups, then a weekly grouping isn’t going to help. We need to see sign-ups by day or perhaps even by hour to understand what effect the announcement had.\nAt the most basic level, the data points are the things we can distinguish in a chart, so they should represent the differences that actually interest us. By reducing them to the minimal granularity we need, we can ensure the design will focus on the differences we care about while filtering out the ones we don’t.\nOnce we have the specific data points we want to show, the next visual element we can use is size. Size simply refers to the amount of space a data point takes up. For example, to represent larger values, we can make the bars taller in a bar chart or the bubbles bigger in a bubble chart. When we make these distinctions, what we’re really doing is increasing the amount of visual mass a data point has, giving it more pixels or ink.\nThe visual element of size excels at representing quantities of stuff: people, dollars, orders, clicks, tweets, and so on. This compares with metrics that aren’t quantities, such as inflation rates, miles-per-hour, clickthrough percents, and other rates and calculated values; often, position is better for these kinds of values. But for quantities, we usually want to compare how much more or less stuff each point represents, and size shows these proportions.\nTo correctly see the differences, though, we have to be careful to maintain true proportions. If we were to change the y-axis of a bar chart so the bottom of every bar began at 100 instead of 0, then suddenly we’d be interfering with the proportion: a bar taking up twice as much space would no longer represent twice as much stuff. Similarly, if we’re using circles to represent size, we can’t just double the width to represent double the value since that would actually quadruple the circle’s area. Instead, we have to make sure the relative sizes of the data points preserve the true proportions of the values they represent. Only then can we accurately compare them.\nAt this point, we have determined which data points we want to show and how big or small they need to be. The next step is to decide where they go. This is our third visual element — position — and we can use it in different ways. In a bar chart, we can put the bars in chronological order to represent time. Or, in a scatter plot, we can place the dots at certain horizontal and vertical distances from the axes. By putting data points in specific places, the distance between them is what matters: if two data points are near each other, we know they are similar in some way, such as occurring at around the same time or representing comparable values.\nWhereas size helps us observe proportions, position helps us observe proximities. We can easily see clusters of data points, or find the ones that sit closest to the axis, or spot the outliers. Because position helps us understand these relationships, it works best for representing distances, time, and calculations such as percentages and rate-per values. With more abstract or sequential values like these, position makes it easier for us to quickly see the landscape of values and relate the data points to each other.\nOf course, sometimes the lines are blurry. Let’s say we wanted to compare a bunch of prices. Technically, we could think of that as a quantity: the quantity of dollars spent on each product. But we could also think of prices as a rate-per value: the price per product. Both size and position seem applicable here. To help us choose, we should consider our goals for the analysis. If we’re trying to understand how much more expensive certain products are than others — that is, to examine those proportions — then using size probably makes the most sense. But if we want to quickly point out which products are the most expensive or see which ones have the most similar prices, than position will help us better see those relationships. When there doesn’t seem to be an obvious answer, we should always refer back to the analytical questions we’re asking.\nSo now we have our separate data points of specific sizes, and we’ve decided where to put them. The next thing we can do is connect them — literally, draw lines from one to the next. Like grouping, this is something we often do without thinking about it. A line chart, for example, is simply connecting the dots of a scatterplot, and an area chart is connecting the bars of a bar graph.\nWhen we connect data points like this, we’re not actually showing more information about the data points themselves but rather revealing the changes between them. We’re producing an angle. Angles are the fourth visual element at our disposal, and we can use them to see shifts and trends. But while they help show how something changes, they can also hide the individual values, making it more difficult to see where one point ends and another begins. So they come with a sacrifice: we should only use angles when we care more about overall trends than specific values.\nA good example of this is stock price. When we plot a stock’s price over time, we often connect the dots to show a line graph. That’s because we care more about a stock’s return — how much the price has risen or fallen over time — than its specific price at any given moment.\nSometimes, though, it’s more difficult to decide whether or not angles are appropriate. For example, if we are graphing temperature over time, our visualization might differ depending on our objectives. If we wanted to examine global warming, then we would care more about the overall trend, so we would connect the data points to produce angles. But if we wanted to see what the average temperature was each month over the past year, then angles wouldn’t make sense: in this case, we care more about examining the individual values. As with the question of using size versus position, we have to think carefully about whether angles are useful for the questions we’re asking. Just because we can make an angle doesn’t mean we should.\nAfter we’ve determined size, position, and angle, we have one more visual element we can use to represent data: color. Common uses of color include the blue versus red regions of an election results map or the separately colored categories of a stacked area chart. The nice thing about color is that, unlike size and position, we don’t have to make any extra room in the chart to accommodate different values. It’s an easy way to provide additional information without moving the data points around.\nAt the same time, though, we are limited by how well we can perceive differences. It’s difficult for us to interpret numeric figures from color — when we see a darker blue, we don’t think, “Oh, that’s about 20% darker.” Plus, we should always be cognizant of potential color blindness; the whole point of data visualization is, after all, to make information more universally readable.\nGiven these limitations, color works best as a tool for simplification, to help group data points into categories or gradations. When we see data points of the same color, we visually merge them together, allowing us to see broader differences. A choropleth map, for example, uses different colors and shades to represent different values on a map, helping us visually group geographic areas. In the below chart of US unemployment rates by county, the use of color groups granular data points into larger regions that are easier to digest, such as the lighter area in the Midwest.\nBut we walk a fine line when we use color, and we should always be aware of the limitations. When we use color to represent gradation, such as in the choropleth map, we do so at the expense of interpreting specific values. So, while color is helpful, we need to use it sparingly — only a few colors at once, and as a grouping mechanism rather than a way to indicate specific values.\nLastly, any information on a chart that is not itself data is annotation. Annotation is what helps us understand the data, and it can mean anything that serves this purpose: axes, grid lines, labels, titles, even comment blurbs that help point out specific things.\nGenerally, we want to keep annotation to a minimum. The point of a visualization is the data, and we should provide only as much annotation as necessary to understand it. If we have vertical grid lines for each week, can we do monthly instead? Or yearly? Or, for that matter, do we really need the grid lines at all? Perhaps just a couple value labels along the axis can do the trick. Or, to really simplify, maybe the whole point of the visualization is to show what happened on a particular date, so the only annotation we need is a single label.\nOr maybe we really do need all those grid lines. This isn’t to say that the standard titles, labels, and grid lines we’re used to seeing are bad. Often they are necessary — they have become standard for a reason. We just need to be deliberate about the decisions we’re making, to make sure we’re using annotation on purpose rather than by default. Because ultimately, the less annotation we have, the more we can focus on the data itself.\nPutting it all together\nOf course, the most frustrating phrase that can come at the end of all this is: it depends. And it does. The rules aren’t airtight. Sometimes we should use size instead of position, sometimes not. Sometimes we need an angle, sometimes we don’t.\nBut the key is that it always depends on the questions we’re asking. That’s why we can’t just run some calculations and plop the results into the first chart we find. When we’re crafting a chart, we’re also examining what the numbers mean. These guidelines give us a place to start, but we must always remember that we visualize data to answer questions. Keep those questions in mind and the design will follow.","When you consider that roughly 15% of the world’s population (more than 1 billion people) have some form of disability, the importance of accessibility in web design seems pretty obvious. But if those involved in the website’s creation are not directly affected by a disability, accessibility can sometimes be an afterthought.\nWhen considering disabilities and web design, it’s also important to think beyond visual impairments. To learn more about the variety of accessibility issues faced online by those with disabilities, this website is quite illuminating.\nFortunately for web developers, a large amount of accessibility functionality is covered by standard website development practices. But making a site clearer and easier to understand doesn’t only benefit those with accessibility needs; designing with disabilities in mind has the added benefit of improving a search engine’s ability to understand a given website, which also assists in SEO.\nHowever, it is not enough to simply follow SEO and web development best practices. It’s vital that designers go the extra mile toward better accessibility.\nIf you want to start with the basics of accessibility, the best place to start is the WCAG, or the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, created by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium. It’s a bit of a dry read, but a helpful starting point nonetheless. The full specs of WCAG 2.0 can be found here.\nThe WCAG 2.0 Checklist is also an excellent resource for breaking down the sections into bite-size references before digging deeper into the information-containing tips. The Accessibility Cheatsheet is a little lighter on details, but also a great resource containing references, examples, and links per section.\nGetting more specific about web accessibility, contrasting colours are essential for those with visual disabilities because they help with navigation. WCAG recommends a luminance difference of 3:1 or greater of the text and the colour surrounding it. Here’s a great page demoing how various link colours may look to those with types of colour blindness. This helpful contrast ratio tool is also great for coming up with colour contrasts and testing their ratios. However, as mentioned above, it’s important to factor in more than just visual impairment when measuring accessibility. The following tools are great bookmarklets for auditing various aspects of a site:\n- Tota11y bookmarklet adds an icon to the bottom left of your screen when activated. From there, you can view information on headings, colour contrast, alt-text and more. There is also an experimental screen reader simulation to see how one might parse your website.\n- css bookmarklet will scan your current page and wrap all elements that may need to be reviewed and have their accessibility functionality updated. More information about each specific notification can be found on their website.\nBut what if your website is closer to a web app in functionality than a website? In that case, WAI-ARIA should be top of mind when developing it as it helps add accessibility functionality to non-standard websites that act more like applications.\nLastly, these “dos and don’ts” designing for accessibility posters can be great reminders about keeping different accessibility requirements in mind when designing.\nIf you’ve followed along this far, that’s awesome — the first step to improving web accessibility is actually caring about it! Being aware of the needs of others and keeping that in focus while designing is the best thing you can do. It’s an evolving process of tweaks, tests, and self-improvement, but keep working on it. There’s about a billion people in the world that would thank you for it."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:05e710c2-5c07-4e71-924a-e55520393e90>","<urn:uuid:55d3b9b2-936f-4dbe-967a-f01612f63adb>"],"error":null}

{"question":"I've noticed both ravens and Arctic wolves are highly social creatures. What principales similitudes y diferencias existen between their pack/group behaviors and social structures?","answer":"Both species exhibit complex social structures but with distinct characteristics. Ravens form social bonds and cooperate around food sources, particularly with wolves. Meanwhile, Arctic wolves live in packs of 5-8 individuals (occasionally up to 20), led by an alpha male and female. The wolf packs are typically extended families composed of a breeding pair and their pups, with all members cooperatively hunting and caring for young. Both species use sophisticated communication methods - wolves communicate through signs, smell, behaviors, and howling to coordinate with their pack and interact with other packs, while ravens demonstrate complex social behaviors around food sharing and can vocalize to warn of danger. One key difference is that while wolf packs have strict hierarchies where typically only alpha members breed, ravens don't appear to have such rigid social structures.","context":["|The Mind of the Raven|\n|Investigations and Adventures with Wolf-Birds|\nby Bernd Heinrich\nPosted: June 16, 2000\nBackyard Biologist Tests Raven IQ\nSince prehistoric times, ravens have been revered and reviled. Poets wrote about them, native people worshipped them and European settlers attempted to eradicate them.\nThey were kept in the Tower of London because their vocalizations were thought to warn of approaching danger. Odin, the ruler of the Norse gods, kept two wolves at his side and a raven on each shoulder. The Vikings eagerly welcomed ravens as an omen of victory. The Inuit believe ravens help them hunt caribou, polar bears and seals by dipping their wings in the right direction.\nThen there's their downright peculiar behavior: reports of ravens hanging from their feet, sliding in snow, flying upside down, rolling in mid-flight, tugging at wolves' tails and defending their nests with rocks.\nIn \"Mind of the Raven: Investigations and Adventures with Wolf-Birds,\" biologist and raven fanatic Bernd Heinrich sets out to investigate the motives for these odd behaviors by attempting to separate what is pre-programmed, what is learned, and what is insightan indication of intelligence.\nHeinrich has studied ravens for 16 years, but his history with the birds dates further back. As a boy in post-World War II Germany he kept a pet crow, and as a graduate student at UCLA in the 1960s he housed two tame ravens in his Westwood apartment. He wanted to study them but was advised (jokingly) never to study an animal smarter than himself.\nInstead he studied protozoa, moving on to caterpillars and later bees. His book \"Bumblebee Economics\" is considered a scientific classic. Heinrich is a professor at the University of Vermont but does most of his raven-watching near his hand-built cabin in Maine. In 1994, he published \"Ravens in Winter,\" his first attempt to \"make sense\" of ravens.\nThe common raven, Corvus corax, is the world's largest crowfour times heavier than the American Crow. No other bird in the world has a wider distribution or shows more adaptability. They occupy an extraordinary geographical and ecological range, from the Arctic Circle to the mountains of Central America.\nWhile most of us couldn't tell one raven from anotherbig, black, noisy, looks like a crow, right?Heinrich believes no two are alike. Ravens, like humans, are not \"pre-wired\" (like, say, ants or bees). Their behavior is spontaneous and evolving as they solve life's problems. \"I have often been startled by their enigmatic and seemingly contradictory responses. But the poetry of biology resides hidden in opposing tensions, and the often arduous fun comes from trying to reveal it,\" Heinrich writes.\nAnd fun he does have. Heinrich, a seasoned marathon runner, climbed two large pine trees in a windstorm to retrieve four baby ravens, which he is raising in his backyard in Maine.\nHe derived an idea to test their intelligence from a copy of \"Ranger Rick\" magazine, a present to his then young son, Stuart. In the magazine, a short article described the clever things you can watch birds do, like pulling up food suspended by a string. Heinrich theorized that if a rare raven could figure out how to pull up fooda 10-consecutive-step processwithout a lengthy trial-and-error period, that it might indicate intelligence. \"That is, insight might precede or accompany learning to produce the same behavior.\"\nThis simple experiment allowed Heinrich to reduce the possibilities of random chance and of genetic programming that would have coded this very specific unnatural behavior. Since his ravens were raised in captivity, Heinrich was assured they had no prior experience and so could not have learned the behavior.\nIf they could solve the problem, it would prove insight. Well, the ravens aced the test. Not only did the first raven perform the entire sequence with nary a fumble, he dropped the meat when chased off by Heinrich instead of trying to fly away with it. \"The significance of the remarkable behavior of not flying off (with the meat) was that it was a new behavior that was acquired without any learning trials. They acted as though they had already done the trials. The simplest hypothesis is that they hadin their heads.\"\nHeinrich does not restrict his detective work to his backyard. He flew to Oberhausen, Germany, in response to a letter he received from a medical doctor who regularly allows his raven, Jakob, to roam 'free' in his apartment. \"(This) was an opportunity I could not pass up . . . I wondered how fast a raven would disassemble an apartment . . . three minutes, maybe five.\"\nIf it is true, as some speculate, that the capacity of an animal to cause damage is proportional to its intelligence, then ravens are geniuses. To his surprise, Jakob destroys only junk mail and has left the doctor's museum-like apartment intact.\nJakob eats what the family eats, watches television with them (Jakob finds a raccoon on the screen very upsetting), bathes regularly and demands caresses every night.\nHeinrich watched Jakob, asked questions and took notes. At one point, Jakob insisted, with a \"mighty heave\" into Heinrich's thigh, that he hand over his pen. Heinrich, ever agreeable to a raven's demands, complied.\nHeinrich speculates that Jakob does not destroy the apartment because he had remained in his cage for his first two months there. During that time, he had seen most of the apartment and his interest in its contents had faded. It was only new things, like the pen, that interested him. \"The corvid line of birds all share this capacity of curiosity. It is their trademark. One wonders if it is the key that has allowed them to flourish and diversify.\"\nWolves may have also had a hand in their survival. During a trip to Yellowstone National Park, Heinrich observes that ravens arrive at all wolf kills and immediately begin feeding. However, they avoid carcasses where wolves are absent.\nThough confusing behaviorwhy wouldn't ravens take advantage of an easy food source?it fits a pattern Heinrich had observed before; that ravens invariably choose to be with the wolves. \"Maybe (ravens) had evolved with wolves in a mutualism that is millions of years old, so that they have innate behaviors that link them to wolves, making them uncomfortable without their presence.\"\nRavens need wolves for several reasons: they rely on wolves to kill, to open carcasses (ravens are incapable of tearing open a carcass) and to possibly overcome their innate shyness of large food. Wolves also need ravens. Ravens have been reported to alert wolves to potential food sources and to danger.\nWolf watchers have historically taken ravens and wolves for granted, \"so much is taken for granted that further comment, or data, have seemed superfluous,\" Heinrich writes. Heinrich successfully convinced Yellowstone biologists to include studies of ravens with their studies of wolves. As the book went to press, initial surveys indicated ravens always showed up at wolf kills and fed with the wolves within minutes. In the twenty-five cases where provided meat was unattended by wolves no ravens fed within the hour of observation.\nObviously there is much left to learn about ravens. \"Mind of the Raven,\" beautifully designed, is a great start. Each chapter begins with a black-and-white photo, one of which includes a picture of Heinrich's son as a baby surrounded by Heinrich's last batch of raven babies. His sketchesmuch more sophisticated than sketches from \"Raven in Winter\"are included within each chapter. At times his writing rambles, but for the most part, his enthusiasm is so grand that even the disinterested can't help hoping Heinrich will continue unearthing clues to the mystery named Corvus corax.","The Arctic Wolf is well known as the white wolf that is not afraid of humans. It is an amazing animal with adaptations that enable it to survive in the extreme weather of the Arctic regions. We have gathered a complete set of Arctic Wolf Facts For Kids that will help you in learning All About Arctic Wolves. You are going to learn about its scientific name, classification, appearance, physical description, lifespan, eyes, species, diet, hunting, habitat, range, climate, adaptations, behavior, sense of smell, wolf pack, life cycle, reproduction, baby, endangerment, population, predator, role in the ecosystem and many other interesting and fun facts about Arctic Wolves.\nArctic Wolf Facts For Kids\nWhat Is Arctic Wolf\n- Arctic wolf is a medium-sized subspecies of grey wolf indigenous to the Arctic regions of North America and Greenland.\n- It is also known as the polar wolf or white wolf.\n- Arctic wolf is distinguishable from the northwestern wolf due to its smaller size, whiter fur, larger carnassial teeth, and narrow cranium (braincase).\n- Like their southern relatives, Arctic wolves have an isolated habitat range and are not threatened due to habitat destruction or hunting.\n- The skull size of the Arctic wolf progressively reduced since 1930, which is possibly the result of the wolf-dog hybridization.\nArctic Wolf Scientific Name\n- The scientific name of the Arctic wolf is Canis lupus arctos.\nArctic Wolf Classification\n- The following is the scientific classification or taxonomy of Arctic wolf:\n|Sub-species||Canis lupus arctos|\nArctic Wolf Appearance\n- An Arctic wolf has a medium body size with 3.2 to 5.9 feet head-to-tail length.\n- It has a white coat color that resembles the snow.\n- It has two coats; a waterproof inner coat that keeps its body dry and a thick, furry outer coat that keeps its body warm.\n- It has a narrow skull, a short muzzle, and small ears.\n- An Arctic wolf has strong jaws. It has 42 sharp teeth specially designed for tearing flesh and crushing bones.\n- Arctic wolves have short legs and thickly padded paws, which allows them to walk easily on the snow and frozen grounds.\nArctic Wolf Physical Description – Arctic Wolf Characteristics\nArctic Wolf Size\n- Arctic wolves have body sizes from 3.2 to 5.9 feet (0.9 to 1.8 meters).\n- They have sexual dimorphism and male individuals are usually bigger than females.\nArctic Wolf Weight\n- The bodyweight of Arctic wolves ranges from 31.7 to 79.3 kg (70 to 175 pounds).\nArctic Wolf Height\n- The average standing height of Arctic wolves from head to toe is about 3 feet (0.9 meters).\n- At the shoulder region, their height may vary from 2 to 2.5 feet (0.6 to 0.7 meters).\nArctic Wolf Length\n- The body length (head to tail) of Arctic wolves ranges from 3.2 to 5.9 feet (0.9 to 1.8 meters).\nArctic Wolf Lifespan\n- The lifespan of Arctic wolves in the wild is about 7 to 10 years.\n- In captivity, they live longer for more than 18 years due to the proper availability of food and protection from natural hazards.\nArctic Wolf Eyes\n- Arctic wolves have blue color eyes at birth.\n- When they grow, the color of their eyes changes to yellow-golden or orange.\n- Adult full-grown individuals usually have golden-brown eyes.\nArctic Wolf Species\n- Arctic wolf belongs to the species of grey wolf (Canis lupus).\nWhat Do Arctic Wolves Eat – Arctic Wolf Diet\n- The Arctic wolf is a carnivore in nature and eats the flesh of other animals as its primary diet.\n- They usually hunt musk oxen and Arctic hare. However, they also eat caribou, moose, Arctic fox, lemmings, birds, seals, and beetles.\n- They are opportunistic and also sometimes scavenge on garbage and carrion.\n- Studies show that muskoxen are their primary prey. Because in the presence of abundant muskoxen, Arctic wolves have a higher reproduction rate as compared to the higher availability of Arctic hares.\n- Another study suggests that the consumption of the two species (muskoxen and Arctic hares) depends on the year and season and it is uncertain how much Arctic wolf relies on the two species.\n- Arctic wolves hunt in packs usually to prey on muskoxen or caribou.\n- The packs are also known for killing cubs of the polar bear.\n- During the winter, they will follow migrating caribou for a large distance.\n- In one meal, an Arctic wolf can eat about 9 kg (20 pounds) of meat.\n- Large hunts usually last for a few days. Between the meals, all members of the pack take turns to guard carcass against scavengers.\nWhat Do Arctic Wolves Hunt – Arctic Wolf Prey\n- The most common prey of Arctic wolves are:\n- Arctic hares\n- However, they also hunt other animal species like:\nWhere Do Arctic Wolves Live – Arctic Wolf Habitat\n- Arctic wolves are native to the Arctic region of North America and Greenland.\n- They spent their whole lives in the Arctic tundra biome.\n- A pack of Arctic wolves has a very large territory of about 1,000 square miles (2,500 square kilometers). The size of their territories depends on the availability of food.\n- Arctic wolves use caves or outcrops to take shelter, as it is difficult to dig the frozen snowy ground to create a den.\n- Many of the Arctic wolf populations live close to the sea to feed on seabirds and seals.\nArctic Wolf Habitat Map\nArctic Wolf Range- Arctic Wolf Location\n- The habitat range of the Arctic wolves occurs above the latitudes of 67° North.\n- The location of their habitat is:\n- Northern parts of Alaska in the United States\n- Queen Elizabeth Islands (from Melville Island to Ellesmere Island) in Northern Canada\nArctic Wolf Climate\n- Arctic wolf is one of the few mammals that tolerate extremely harsh conditions.\n- The climate of their habitat region is extremely cold throughout the air.\n- The temperature range in the region is widespread. The month of January is the coldest month of the year, in which the temperature lowers to an average of about -38℃ (-36.4 ℉). The warmest month is July, in which the average highest temperature is about 10℃ (50 ℉).\n- The daylight in their habitat also fluctuates highly with the season. Days in the winter are dark and without sunlight while the sun does not set in the summer days.\n- Most of their habitat region is covered with snow throughout the year.\n- The average precipitation is 250mm per year.\nWhat Other Animals Live With The Arctic Wolf\n- The following are some of the other animals that share the Arctic wolf’s habitat:\n- Arctic hares\n- Arctic fox\n- Many species of birds (such as Arctic tern, snow goose, and ptarmigan)\n- Lemmings and various other types of rodents\nArctic Wolf Adaptations\nThe following are the major structural and physiological adaptations of Arctic Wolves, which helps them to survive in the harsh Arctic climate:\nShort Muzzle and Ears\n- Arctic wolves have short muzzles and small ears as compared to other subspecies of grey wolves.\n- This feature reduces the surface area to volume ratio and prevents excessive heat loss through the mouth and ears.\nCoat Color and Thick Fur\n- Arctic wolves have white or light grey coat colors, which provides them with excellent camouflage.\n- They also have a double layer of fur; an inner layer of fine and soft hair and an outer layer of thick long hair.\n- The inner layer keeps their body insulated while the outer layer is waterproof and keeps them dry and warm.\n- Their fur grows denser during the cold season to provide extra insulation.\n- The paw structure of Arctic wolves is also well-adapted to their habitat.\n- Their paws have a covering of fur, which acts like snow shows.\n- The fur on their paws provides insulation as well as a strong grip when they walk on the snow and frozen slippery surfaces.\nCountercurrent Heat Exchange System\n- Arctic wolves have a special blood circulation mechanism in their paws that reduces heat loss, as their paws have direct contact with the cold snowy surface.\n- In this mechanism, the blood coming to the paws is used to heat the blood that is leaving.\n- In such a way, excessive heat loss is prevented while the paws are also saved from extreme coldness.\n- Such a mechanism is also found in the feet of penguins and the legs of Arctic foxes.\nThick Layer of Body Fat\n- Arctic wolves have a thick layer of body fat beneath their skin.\n- It provides insulation and also serves as a food reservoir in case of food scarcity.\nArctic Wolf Sense Of Smell\n- Wolves have about 100 times a greater sense of smell than humans. The smell receptive region in a wolf’s nose is about 14 times greater than a human nose.\n- Like other wolves, Arctic wolves also have a keen sense of smell.\n- Their scent recognition level is extremely higher, which they use for hunting potential prey.\nArctic Wolf Behavior\n- Arctic wolves are social and live in groups known as packs. The number of individuals in a pack varies from five to eight.\n- Arctic wolves have very large territories. A pack may have a territory of about 2,500 square kilometers (1,000 square miles) or more. Their territory’s size depends on the availability of food.\n- They communicate through signs, smell, behaviors, and sounds. They howl to communicate with other packs. A pack of Arctic wolves can compare its size with other packs by hearing the howling of other packs. Small packs move to another region to find food upon hearing the howls of bigger packs. In such a way, they avoid fighting with other packs.\n- Arctic wolves are unafraid of humans. In some regions, they can be persuaded to approach humans cautiously and curiously. This behavior is believed to be due to their very rare encounter with humans.\n- Arctic wolves migrate during the wintertime to avoid the complete darkness of their habitat. The 24 hours darkness of their habitat makes it hard to study their movement. So very little is known about their migration.\nArctic Wolf Pack\n- The group of Arctic wolves is known as a pack.\n- A pack has 5 to 8 individuals.\n- Every pack has a dominant male and female known as alpha male and female. They are the leaders of the pack.\n- Sometimes, a pack’s size reaches up to 20 individuals, however, it is uncommon.\n- Most of the packs are extended families and composed of a breeding pair and their pups.\n- A pack cooperatively hunts large animals.\n- All the pack members take care of the pups and protect them from predators and other threats.\n- Individuals of a pack use scent and urine to mark its territory’s borders.\nArctic Wolf Life Cycle\n- The life cycle of Arctic wolves starts when they attain sexual maturity at the age of 2 to 3 years.\n- A mature Arctic wolf leaves its birth pack and establishes its territory along with its mate or either stays within its birth pack.\n- If the size of its birth pack is large, it would have the opportunity of breeding. As in small packs, only the alpha members can reproduce.\n- Upon mating, a litter of 2 to 3 pups is born after a gestation period of 63 days.\n- The lifespan of Arctic wolves is 7 to 10 years in the wild and more than 18 years in captivity.\nArctic Wolf Reproduction\n- Alpha male and female breeds only in the pack of Arctic wolves. However, other mates also breed in large-sized packs.\n- They are known to remain with only one mate.\n- The breeding season of Arctic wolves is from January to March, in which the pairs mate.\n- After a gestation period of about 63 days, the females give birth to a litter of 2 to 3 pups.\n- Arctic wolves use outcrops, caves, or even shallow depressions as a den where the females give birth, as digging the frozen floor is so difficult for them. However, if the frozen snow is not too hard, they will dig a den.\n- The birth of pups occurs in late May to early June.\n- The pups stay with their mother for about 2 years.\nFemale Arctic Wolf\n- As Arctic wolves have sexual dimorphism, the females have a smaller size than males.\n- Female Arctic wolves reproduce, feed the pups with their milk, and take care of them until they become completely mature.\nArctic Wolf Babies – Baby Arctic Wolf – Arctic Wolf Pups\n- The babies of Arctic wolves are known as pups or whelps.\n- They are born after a gestation period of about 63 days.\n- At birth, the pup weighs about 2 to 3 pounds and has dark fur.\n- They are blind and deaf at birth and become able to see and hear after 12 to 14 days.\n- The pups have blue color eyes that become orange or yellow-golden when they are between 2 to 4 months old.\n- As an Arctic wolf is a mammal, the mother feeds the newborns with her milk.\n- After a few weeks, mothers bring small pieces of chewed food to the pups and they start nibbling it.\n- The pups stay in their birth den or cave for about 1.5 months along with their mother.\n- After 1.5 months, they start to join the pack in their activities and learn skills to survive.\n- The pups become full-grown at the age of about 8 months.\n- They stay with their mother for about 2 years.\n- Pups attain sexual maturity at the age of 2 to 3 years.\n- The pups stay generally with the same pack for many years.\nAre Arctic Wolves Endangered – Why Are Arctic Wolves Endangered\n- No, Arctic wolves are not endangered.\n- Due to their isolated habitat, they are not even threatened by hunting or habitat loss.\n- Climate change is the greatest threat to their survival. Extreme variations in the weather cause food scarcity for muskoxen and Arctic hares. It causes a decline in the populations of these species and so, in turn, leads to the reduction of the traditional food supply of the Arctic wolves.\nArctic Wolf Conservation Status\n- The conservation status of the Arctic wolf on the IUCN Red List as Least Concern.\nArctic Wolf Population\n- According to the Cool Antarctica Resources, the total population of Arctic wolves is estimated at 200,000 individuals.\nArctic Wolf Role In The Ecosystem\n- Like other wolves, Arctic wolves also play a vital role to maintain the health, structure, and balance of the ecosystem.\n- They keep the population of prey species in control.\n- Their presence affects the behavior and population of their prey and changes their foraging patterns.\n- In turn, it affects the plants and animal communities and often causes changes in the landscape.\n- That is why wolves are described as the keystone species.\nArctic Wolf Predators\n- Arctic wolf is itself the apex predator of its habitat.\n- The polar bear is the only natural predator of the Arctic wolf.\nArctic Wolf Interesting Facts – Fun Facts About Arctic Wolves\n- Arctic wolf is one of the rare examples of animal species that are relatively not threatened by humans. Due to the isolated habitat range, Arctic wolves are not disturbed by urbanization or habitat destruction.\n- An Arctic wolf has a special countercurrent heat exchange system in its feet, which prevents its feet from freezing while walking on the snow.\n- Arctic wolves are born with blue eyes that become brown or golden-brown when they are growing old.\n- Arctic wolves are fast and can run at the speed of 40 miles per hour when chasing prey.\n- Youngsters of the Arctic wolves eat partially digested food that their mother and other members of the pack regurgitate after hunting.\n- In a pack, only the highest-ranking members are allowed to reproduce. They are known as the Alpha male and females.\n- Like other wolves, packs of the Arctic wolves communicate through howling. They can compare the size of their pack with other packs’ sizes by hearing howlings.\n- Arctic wolves usually avoid conflicts with other packs and small packs simply move to other regions to find food."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0040b4db-1d6b-4df9-a2fa-c661f5649a1f>","<urn:uuid:7896e363-13ff-4314-aa6a-80a2f053c887>"],"error":null}

The word is Greek but it was a common Roman genre in which the floor of the triclinium, or dining room, would be decorated with food scraps seemingly cast onto the ground from the very dining tables at which guests would be seated. The realistically modelled debris included fish bones, snails, shrimp heads, fruit rinds, nutshells, and the occasional vermin.\nThe fascinating room scene at top is believed to be from a 5th century dining room floor. It shows an actual dinner in progress with an asaroton floor design in the room—OR does it show a dinner with a very messy bunch of people who have actually thrown their food on the floor? Its quite a \"meta\" take on the style.\nThe first explanation of the asaroton comes from Pliny (c.77-79 AD) describing a notable work in Pergamon, probably from the 2nd century BC:\nThe most famous in that genre was Sosos who laid at Pergamon what is called the asarotos oikos or unswept room, because on the pavement were represented the débris of a meal, and those things which are normally swept away, as if they had been left there, made of small tesserae of many colours. - Pliny, Natural HistorySo from the 2nd century BC they were still doing the unswept thing in the 5th century AD.

Molossian shepherds of Epirus in the mountains of northwestern Greece were renowned for vicious hounds which were used to guard their flocks and for hunting. The Molossus is considered to be the ancestor of today's Mastiff-type dogs and ostensibly contributed to the development of powerful modern breeds such as the St. Bernard, Great Pyrenees, Rottweiler, Great Dane, Newfoundland, and Bernese Mountain Dog...

Quinoa has the advantage of being plant-based and containing fiber, while eggs provide unique nutrients like choline and Vitamin D in their yolks.","context":["Ever wonder, “Are eggs healthy?”. You probably have. Especially, after seeing a recent headlines like this one from CNN: “Three or more eggs a week increase your risk of heart disease and early death, study says”.\nWhat CNN got wrong about eggs and heart disease\nA headline like that – “Three or more eggs a week increase your risk of heart disease and early death, study says“ – is enough to get people to shun eggs…without even reading the whole article!\nThe headline, although clickable, is misleading. The type of study mentioned in the article is unable to show cause and effect (which the headline suggests). It can only show an association. Plus, a solid body of research has debunked the “does dietary cholesterol raise blood cholesterol? question.\nDo eggs raise your cholesterol?\nYes, eggs contain dietary cholesterol. But no, they won’t significantly impact your blood cholesterol as is commonly believed.\nIt’s sort of like saying eating fat will make you fat. Which we also know, is not the case. (See: keto)\nWhat will significantly impact your cholesterol – and make you fat for that matter – is sugar and refined carbohydrates like bread, cereal, and pasta.\nThe egg study mentioned in the CNN article\nThe study that served as the basis of the CNN headline was recently published in JAMA. Researchers pooled results of 6 previous observational cohort studies involving a total of 29 thousand people. Participants recalled from memory what they ate over a period of 17.5 years on average. Any cardiac events, such as stroke or heart attack were also recorded.\nBased on their observations, the researchers stated: “Among US adults, higher consumption of dietary cholesterol or eggs was significantly associated with higher risk of incident CVD and all-cause mortality in a dose-response manner.”\nSpecifically, they found that consuming an additional 300 milligrams of dietary cholesterol per day was associated with a 3.2% higher risk of heart disease and a 4.4% higher risk of early death. Each additional half an egg consumed per day was associated with a 1.1% higher risk of cardiovascular disease and 1.9% higher risk of early death due to any cause.\nWhich, at best, is modest to begin with. But, seeing as heart disease is the number one cause of death not just in the US but globally, it’s important to explore further.\nRegardless, do you see, though, how the consumer media changed what the researchers said? The researchers said that egg consumption was “associated with” increased risk of heart disease. The media reported that egg consumption “causes” increased risk of heart disease.\nCohort studies can only offer clues about the causes of disease, rather than definitive proof of links between risk factors and health – which the headline would lead you to believe.\nWhat were those people eating with their eggs? Sauteed spinach and avocado? Or, white bread and butter?\nWhat were they eating the rest of the day? A Standard American Diet? Or, a Pegan Diet?\nDietary cholesterol VS. blood cholesterol\nHigh blood cholesterol levels are a known risk factor for heart disease.\nFor decades, nutrition guidelines have stated that dietary cholesterol in foods raises blood cholesterol and therefore increases the risk of heart disease.\nHowever, current research debunks this outdated hypothesis…and current USDA nutrition guidelines have been revised to reflect this new understanding of the association between dietary cholesterol and blood cholesterol.\nWhat is Cholesterol?\nCholesterol is a waxy substance that occurs naturally in the body. Perhaps surprisingly, it isn’t something “bad” that we want to eliminate completely.\nIn fact, your body needs cholesterol to make hormones and Vitamin D, and perform various other important functions. Cholesterol contributes to the membrane structure of every cell in your body.\nSo where do you get cholesterol? Your body makes it!\nYes, your body makes all the cholesterol it needs, but it also absorbs a relatively small amount from certain food such as eggs, meat, and full-fat dairy products.\nThe body tightly regulates the amount of cholesterol in the blood: when you increase the amount of cholesterol you eat your body makes less. When you eat less cholesterol, your body makes more. (1, 2)\nResearch debunking eggs as cause of increased cholesterol\nIn 1999, a study published in JAMA by Harvard researchers that tracked more than 37,000 adult men and 80,000 adult women for a period of 14 years, found that eating an egg a day was unlikely to have an impact on heart disease or stroke for non-diabetics.\nMany subsequent studies have reached similar conclusions. A meta-analysis published in 2016 found that there was no clear link between egg consumption and the risk of heart disease. In fact, they concluded that eating up to an egg a day may decrease the risk of stroke by about 12%. (7).\nThe connection between sugar & heart disease\nIf eggs and cholesterol don’t increase the risk of heart disease, what does?\nA rigorously done study published in JAMA in 2014 shows that those with the highest sugar intake nearly tripled their risk of heart attacks compared to those with the lowest intakes. TRIPLED! That’s nearly 300% not the 3.2% percent risk cited in the study in the CNN article on the association between eggs and heart disease.\nIn 2000, a study published by Harvard researchers found that women who consumed diets with a high glycemic load (generally made up heavily of refined carbohydrates and sugar which spike blood sugar) had an increased coronary heart disease risk. Those who consumed diets with the highest glycemic load increased their risk more than 200% during 10 years of follow-up.\nIn fact, starting in the 1960s the sugar industry paid scientists to play down the link between sugar and heart disease and instead shift the blame to saturated fat, as this landmark expose in The New York Times discovered, and I wrote about in The Real Food Grocery Guide.\nEggs don’t cause heart attacks. Sugar does.\nAre eggs a healthy part of the diet?\nYes, eggs are a healthy part of the diet for many people, and serve as a good source of protein and nutrients.\nThey are a common allergen , though, so they’re not for everyone. People who want to avoid eggs include those with auto-immune disease, leaky gut, or an allergy to them.\nWhat is the healthiest way to cook and eat eggs?\n- The healthiest way to cook and eat eggs is to eat the whole egg, yolk and all. That is where the bulk of the nutrition is.\n- Cook them in olive oil or another healthy fat, such as unrefined coconut oil or avocado oil.\n- Always choose organic and pasture-raised or free-range eggs to ensure you’re getting the most nutritious eggs. You can probably find them at a local farmer’s market, or of course, any health food store, and even many mainstream grocers. If you’re confused about the dozens of labels on eggs (vegetarian, omega-3 enriched, etc.) learn more in The Real Food Grocery Guide.\n- Serve with a generous portion of veggies and plant-based fats (such as avocado) instead of sides, like bacon, sausage, white toast, and butter.\n- Try this Superfood Scramble recipe. Essentially, you scramble 2 eggs with a copious amount of veggies, along with a blend of flavorful spices and herbs for a delicious, complete one-pan meal.\nWhat nutrients do eggs contain?\nEggs are a good source of choline, B vitamins, including B12, and Vitamin D but the nutrients are primarily found in the yolk, not the white.\n- Vitamin D is critical for bone health and immune function.\n- Choline is essential for normal functioning of all cells, but is particularly important during pregnancy to support healthy brain development of the fetus.\n- B-Vitamins impact your energy levels, brain function, and cell metabolism. They support cell health and the immune system.\n- Lutein and zeaxanthin are two antioxidants that are believed to reduce the risk of developing cataracts and slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration.\nEggs contain about 6g of protein each.","Health: Top Vegetarian Protein Sources\nHigh-protein ... meat-free\nProtein is a key nutrient for growing and maintaining muscle and keeping skin and hair strong and healthy. It also helps keep you full. These vegetarian foods make it easy to get your protein fill – whether you’re vegan or vegetarian or just want to eat less meat and more plants.\n1. Greek yogurt\nWith a whopping 23 grams of protein per cup, Greek yogurt is delicious in smoothies, layered with fruit and granola as a parfait, or as a sour cream substitute in tacos or dips. Bonus: It delivers calcium and gut-healthy probiotics, as well. Choose plain yogurt over flavored varieties to avoid extra sugar.\nLentils are a protein powerhouse. An excellent vegan protein, 1/2 cup of cooked lentils provides at least 8 grams of fiber. Fiber is good for your heart, helps keep you full and can help keep your weight in check.\n3. Chia seeds\nThese little seeds are nutrient dense. They deliver protein, fiber and omega-3 fats. You can blend them into smoothies, make chia-seed jam and bake with them. One tablespoon of chia seeds contains 3 grams of protein.\nQuinoa is unique among plant proteins because it contains all nine essential amino acids – making it a complete protein. In addition to 8 grams of protein, a cup of cooked quinoa also contains 5 grams of fiber. Quinoa is rich in magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, zinc, iron, thiamine and folate. It’s also gluten-free.\n5. Cottage cheese\nCottage cheese is making a comeback, with 14 grams of protein per 1/2 cup. Try it as a savory dip or sweeten it with fruit. Cottage cheese is a little higher in sodium than Greek yogurt, so keep that in mind if you’re watching your salt intake.\nLike lentils, beans such as chickpeas and black beans deliver fiber (a nutrient most of us don’t get enough of). They’re also an inexpensive and easy way to add protein (8 grams per 1/2 cup) to dips, tacos, salads and soups.\nEdamame are green soybeans. You’ll find them at sushi restaurants and in the freezer section at most grocery stores. Buy them shelled and frozen, and thaw them before adding to salads, stir-fries and grain bowls. They contain 5 grams of protein per 1/4 cup (shelled).\n8. Green peas\nMost people don’t think of peas as a protein source, but they are, with 8 grams of protein per cup. Green peas are delicious as a side dish or added to soups or salads.\n9. Peanut butter\nPeanuts are full of fiber, fat and protein (7 grams per 2 tablespoons). That winning combination helps keep you full. Try peanut butter on toast, blended into smoothies or in a peanut sauce for savory dishes.\nLike peanuts, almonds offer the super-filling trifecta of fat, fiber and protein (6 grams per ounce). They’re a great vegetarian option to keep hunger at bay. Try them as almond butter, grab a handful for a snack or sprinkle them on salads for a protein boost.\nEggs once had a bad reputation because they’re high in cholesterol (but, it turns out, eating cholesterol doesn’t raise your cholesterol). Each large egg packs 6 grams of protein. You don’t need to opt for just the whites – the yolks are also nutrient-rich, delivering protein, vitamins and antioxidants.\nEatingWell is a magazine and website devoted to healthy eating as a way of life.

{"question":"What are the unique characteristics of Martian gullies, and which Earth locations share similar environmental conditions for studying potential Mars colonization?","answer":"Martian gullies exhibit diverse morphologies, including deeply incised features with wide alcoves and smaller ones with tiny channels. Many channels appear to start along fine layers in crater walls, suggesting water emergence from underground sources. Regarding Earth analogues, several locations share Mars-like conditions. The Atacama Desert in Chile, being extremely dry with decades between rainfalls, contains microbial life that suggests similar possibilities on Mars. The Dry Valleys in Antarctica, subjected to cold permafrost, closely resemble Mars' northern regions and contain bacteria surviving in freezing conditions. Devon Island, with its 14-mile Haughton Crater, provides a cold, dry, and dusty environment similar to Martian craters, making it valuable for testing Mars exploration technologies.","context":["Gullies and Arcuate Ridges\nThis image shows gullies and arcuate ridges in a crater in the southern hemisphere of Mars. Arcuate ridges and gullies are found together at many places on Mars, which has led some researchers to suggest that their coexistence may be a result of a single process.\nConversely, there are many locations on Mars where gullies and arcuate ridges are found alone, causing the debate about the relationship, or lack thereof, between their origins to continue. The bright regions in this image are frost, probably water frost, that is deposited and removed seasonally.\nThe arcuate ridges are the wavy features on the crater floor. They appear to parallel the alcove heads (upslope end) of the gullies. Arcuate ridges resemble protalus ramparts that are found on Earth. Protalus ramparts form at the bottom of snow-covered slopes when rock debris becomes separated from the slope face and accumulates downslope.\nThere is a mantled unit that covers the majority of the mid-latitudes of Mars that is thought to be ice-rich. This mantled unit drapes over topography and likely contains large amounts of dust, creating a dusty \"snowpack.\" It is unknown how arcuate ridges form on Mars, but they are thought to be a result of mass wasting of ice-rich materials, possibly sections of the mantled unit.\nThe gullies seen in this image exhibit a range of morphologies. The large gully in the center of the image is deeply incised with a wide alcove. The gullies on the west (left) rim of the crater have small alcoves and tiny channels. Many of the channels appear to start at one of the fine layers that can be seen along this wall (see subimage, ~ 800 meters across). It is possible that water came from underground along these layers to form the gullies. The gully on the far left of the image extends all the way to the top of the slope. It is likely that the water that fed this gully came from one of the layers and then the slope experienced headward (upslope) erosion and collapse to extend the alcove to the crater rim.\nThe alternating stripes on the left side of the image are camera artifacts, not Martian features.\nImage PSP_001816_1410 was taken by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft on 15-Dec-2006. The complete image is centered at -38.7 degrees latitude, 194.0 degrees East longitude. The range to the target site was 253.5 km (158.4 miles). At this distance the image scale is 25.4 cm/pixel (with 1 x 1 binning) so objects ~76 cm across are resolved. The image shown here has been map-projected to 25 cm/pixel and north is up. The image was taken at a local Mars time of 03:44 PM and the scene is illuminated from the west with a solar incidence angle of 73 degrees, thus the sun was about 17 degrees above the horizon. At a solar longitude of 151.0 degrees, the season on Mars is Northern Summer.","Will humans ever be able to live on Mars? That’s the big question that a lot of people wonder about. Nicknamed the Red Planet because of its bright rust color, it is the fourth planet from the sun and Earth’s neighbor.\nDespite being much colder than Earth with an average temperature of around -80 degrees Fahrenheit, there are many other obstacles in the way of humans colonizing there right now, such as the fact that there isn’t any oxygen to breathe. Scientists, however, are searching for new ways to make it possible for humans to eventually move to Mars, such as potentially heating up the planet to create an atmosphere in which people can breathe in oxygen.\nThe progress that scientists are making is amazing and it may be very possible for humans to inhabit our planetary neighbor in the not-so-distant future. Having locations on Earth that are similar to the conditions on the Red Planet are extremely helpful for researchers… like these six Mars-like locations right here on our planet.\nLake Vostok, Antarctica\nLake Vostok, Antarctica is one of the biggest subglacial lakes on Earth. The lake, which is located near the South Pole in East Antarctica, is 143 miles long, 31 miles wide, and over 2,600 feet deep. It is buried beneath more than two miles of ice and is located close to Russia’s Vostok research station. It is estimated that the lake has been covered with ice for at least 15 million years, with no access to light, and is sealed from the atmosphere which makes it one of the most extreme environments on the planet.\nA Russian geographer/pilot first noticed the buried lake in the 1960s when he spotted from the air a smooth patch of ice on top of it. In 1996, British and Russian researchers then confirmed that there was indeed a lake buried there. Despite the age of the lake being unknown, scientists believe it is only thousands of years old.\nAlthough the location has an average temperature of around minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit, the lake itself is believed to be around 27 degrees Fahrenheit because of the huge weight of the ice on top. Scientists also believe that the freshwater lake could have creatures living in the darkness and the extreme cold. In fact, they did find that the lake contains microbes and multi-cellular organisms. And this gives hope that life can be found in the similarly extreme environment of Mars.\nDry Valleys, Antarctica\nThe Dry Valleys are a row of valleys located west of McMurdo Sound in Antarctica. The valleys, which are subjected to cold permafrost, are said to be the closest terrestrial environment similar to the very north of Mars. Researchers have found bacteria that live in freezing temperatures where the water has turned to ice and where nutrients are scarce. Oligotrophs are slow-growing organisms that live in environments where nutrients are hard to find and they could help scientists figure out how life could possibly exist on Mars.\nResearchers believe that Mars’ polar north may have supported life at one time because it received a lot more sunlight millions of years ago, which means the possibility of water and, of course, life. So researchers began drilling at this location in Antarctica to decide which machinery would be best to use on the northern locations of Mars. Scientists have found a patch of soil covering a layer of ice at the polar north of the Red Planet, and the environment is very similar at Dry Valleys, so that’s why this drilling research is being conducted there.\nAtacama Desert, Chile\nThe Atacama Desert in Chile is a plateau approximately 1,000 kilometers long and is so extremely dry that it’s one of the most Mars-like locations on the planet. In fact, it can take decades of time between rainfalls, which ranks it among the driest locations on Earth. That is why, in 2004, scientists that were NASA-funded spent four weeks in the desert doing research on how life could possibly survive on Mars. And what they found is definitely mind-blowing.\nIn the dry core of the desert, scientists have found microbial life. And if they can find it on an immensely dry location like the Atacama Desert, where many people believe that nothing is able to survive, there’s a very real possibility that they could also find life on Mars. A planetary scientist from Washington State University was quoted saying “If life can persist in Earth’s driest environment, there is a good chance it could be hanging in there on Mars in a similar fashion.”\nPico de Orizaba, Mexico\nPico de Orizaba is a volcano located in south-central Mexico. It rises on the south edge of the Mexican Plateau and is located about 60 miles east of Puebla. The volcano, which has been dormant since 1687, is the third highest peak in North America, registering at 18,406 feet tall.\nOne big question in regards to the possible colonization on Mars is how would humans make it habitable? That is why scientists are so interested in Pico de Orizaba. It has one of Earth’s highest tree line elevations at over 13,000 feet and researchers are using this location to try to figure out how they could begin life on Mars.\nScientists believe that if they could warm up the Red Planet by using heat-trapping gases, raising the air pressure, and beginning photosynthesis, that they could possibly create and maintain an atmosphere that would support humans and other life forms that need oxygen to breathe. If they could use these gases to heat Mars to 41 degrees Fahrenheit, that would equal the temperature of the tree line on the Pico de Orizaba volcano.\nDeath Valley, California\nScientists have done extensive research and testing for decades at Death Valley because of the location’s ancient rock layers. Even NASA’s Curiosity was tested there to see how it would handle to harsh terrain on Mars. Death Valley is located in the southeast of California and is the lowest, driest, and hottest part of North America. The valley is approximately 140 miles long by 5 to 15 miles wide. Although the valley is excessively hotter than Mars, the harsh rocky terrain is said to be quite similar.\nSince 2012, Death Valley holds a yearly event called MarsFest where engineers and scientists discuss with the public the similar relationship between that location and Mars. People can visit Mars Hill, which is covered with volcanic rubble and rocks, as well as take a walk to the Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, the Ubehebe Crater volcanic field, and the Little Hebe Crater.\nDevon Island is the largest uninhabited island on the planet. Of all the islands on Earth – habited and uninhabited – it is the 27th largest. It is part of an archipelago (a group of islands) called the Parry Islands in Nunavut, Canada. It is located in the Arctic Ocean, south of Ellesmere Island and west of Baffin Bay. Devon Island is approximately 320 miles long and 80-100 miles wide with an area of just over 21,000 square miles.\nThe island, which was discovered in 1616 by William Baffin, has a huge 14-mile wide crater called the “Haughton Crater.” It is estimated that the crater was created around 39 million years ago when a comet two kilometers in diameter hit the area. Described as a polar desert, the impact zone is cold, dry, windy and dusty which makes it quite similar to the many craters on Mars, especially with all the loose rock in this earthly crater. Although Devon Island has an average temperature of 1 degree Fahrenheit and Mars averages -76 degrees Fahrenheit weather, the island is one of the closest comparisons to our planetary neighbor.\nPascal Lee is a planetary scientist at the SETI Institute and is leading the NASA Haughton-Mars Project (HMP) where the Haughton Crater is being used for research of new technologies and strategies which will hopefully help prepare humans and robots for the exploration of the Red Planet. Every summer since 1997, Lee has led missions to the isolated island where they have tested many things that will help them for a trip to Mars, such as spacesuits and robots, as well as drills."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:aad0bf06-cb90-4d47-bbfc-05ca286894d0>","<urn:uuid:233b530a-9e98-468e-a8fb-75ad6a1ed0e3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do companies in monopolistic competition determine their pricing strategies, and what external market forces influence these decisions?","answer":"In monopolistic competition, companies determine prices where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, with prices set above marginal cost, allowing for a mark-up. In the short run, companies can make economic profits, but these diminish in the long run as new competitors enter. The pricing decisions are influenced by Porter's five competitive forces: existing competitor actions, customer bargaining power (especially when customers can easily switch providers), supplier bargaining power (which affects input costs and profit margins), substitute products (which give consumers price alternatives), and new market entrants (who can introduce lower pricing strategies).","context":["Monopolistic competition is a type of market structure where many companies are present in an industry, and they produce similar but differentiated products. None of the companies enjoy a monopoly, and each company operates independently without regard to the actions of other companies. The market structure is a form of imperfect competition.\nThe characteristics of monopolistic competition include the following:\nThe presence of many companies\nEach company produces similar but differentiated products\nCompanies compete based on product quality, price, and how the product is marketed\nCompanies in a monopolistic competition make economic profits in the short run, but in the long run, they make zero economic profit. The latter is also a result of the freedom of entry and exit in the industry. Economic profits that exist in the short run attract new entries, which eventually lead to increased competition, lower prices, and high output.\nSuch a scenario inevitably eliminates economic profit and gradually leads to economic losses in the short run. The freedom to exit due to continued economic losses leads to an increase in prices and profits, which eliminates economic losses.\nIn addition, companies in a monopolistic market structure are productively and allocatively inefficient as they operate with existing excess capacity. Because of the large number of companies, each player keeps a small market share and is unable to influence the product price. Therefore, collusion between companies is impossible.\nIn addition, monopolistic competition thrives on innovation and variety. Companies must continuously invest in product development and advertising and increase the variety of their products to appeal to their target markets. Competition with other companies is thus based on quality, price, and marketing.\nQuality entails product design and service. Companies able to increase the quality of their products are, therefore, able to charge a higher price and vice versa. Marketing refers to different types of advertising and packaging that can be used on the product to increase awareness and appeal.\nIndustries Exhibiting Features of Monopolistic Competition\nExamples of industries in monopolistic competition include the following:\nClothing and apparel\nShort-Run Decisions on Output and Price\nThe short-run equilibrium under monopolistic competition is illustrated in the diagram below:\nProfits are maximized where marginal revenue (MR) is equal to marginal cost (MC). The point determines the company’s equilibrium output. The price is determined at a point where the imaginary line from the equilibrium output passes through the point of intersection of the MR, and MC curves and meets the average revenue (AR) curve, which is also the demand curve.\nTotal profit is represented by the cyan-colored rectangle in the diagram above. It is determined by the equilibrium output multiplied by the difference between AR and the average total cost (ATC). Companies in monopolistic competition determine their price and output decisions in the short run, just like companies in a monopoly.\nCompanies in monopolistic competition can also incur economic losses in the short run, as illustrated below. They still produce equilibrium output at a point where MR equals MC in which losses are minimized. The cyan-colored rectangle shows the economic loss incurred.\nLong-Run Decisions on Output and Price\nIn the long run, companies in monopolistic competition still produce at a level where marginal cost and marginal revenue are equal. However, the demand curve will have shifted to the left due to other companies entering the market. The shift in the demand curve is a result of reduced demand for an individual company’s products due to increased competition.\nSuch action reduces economic profits, depending on the magnitude of the entry of new players. Individual companies will no longer be able to sell their products at above-average cost.\nCompanies in monopolistic competition will earn zero economic profit in the long run. At this stage, there is no incentive for new entrants in the industry.\nMonopolistic Competition vs. Perfect Competition\nCompanies in monopolistic competition produce differentiated products and compete mainly on non-price competition. The demand curves in individual companies for monopolistic competition are downward sloping, whereas perfect competition demonstrates a perfectly elastic demand schedule.\nHowever, there are two other principal differences worth mentioning – excess capacity and mark-up. Companies in monopolistic competition operate with excess capacity, as they do not produce at an efficient scale, i.e., at the lowest ATC. Production at the lowest possible cost is only completed by companies in perfect competition.\nMark-up is the difference between price and marginal cost. There is no mark-up in a perfect competition structure because the price is equal to marginal cost. However, monopolistic competition comes with a product mark-up, as the price is always greater than the marginal cost.\nInefficiencies in Monopolistic Competition\nThe equilibrium output at the profit maximization level (MR = MC) for monopolistic competition means consumers pay more since the price is greater than marginal revenue.\nAs indicated above, monopolistic competitive companies operate with excess capacity. They do not operate at the minimum ATC in the long run. Production capacity is not at full capacity, resulting in idle resources.\nMonopolistic competitive companies waste resources on selling costs, i.e., advertising and marketing to promote their products. Such costs can be utilized in production to reduce production costs and possibly lower product prices.\nSince companies do not operate at excess capacity, it leads to unemployment and social despondency in society.\nInefficient companies continue to exist under monopolistic competition, as opposed to exiting, which is associated with companies under perfect competition.\nAnother scope of inefficiency for monopolistic competitive markets stems from the fact that the marginal cost is less than the price in the long run.\nMonopolistic competitive market structures are also allocatively inefficient. Their prices are higher than the marginal cost.\nLimitations of Monopolistic Competition Market Structure\nCompanies with superior brands and high-quality products will consistently make economic profits in the real world.\nCompanies entering the market will take a long time to catch up, and their products will not match those of the established companies for their products to be considered close substitutes. New companies are likely to face barriers to entry because of strong brand differentiation and brand loyalty.\nThank you for reading CFI’s guide to Monopolistic Competition.

Porter argues that factors affecting competition are largely similar regardless of the industry. His five forces that shape competition include competition among existing competitors, bargaining power of customers, bargaining power of suppliers, threat of substitute products and threat of new entrants.\nCompetition among Existing Competitors\nEstablished companies have competitive advantages such as loyal customers, premier locations, good supply chains and a better understanding of the market. New companies may find it difficult dealing with already-established competitors, since they need to convince their customers to switch providers. To overcome this hurdle, some firms get information about rivals from customers, suppliers and employees, and study the specific products and services they sell. They then use this to develop strategies to overcome the competition.\nBargaining Power of Customers\nCustomers’ bargaining power greatly influences a company’s competitive strategy. Buyers have the power to demand lower prices in a system where their number is relatively small compared to that of sellers. In such cases, when a customer becomes dissatisfied with the quality of service or pricing in a certain store, he can easily switch to rivals. On the other hand, if your business is the lone provider of a product or service, the customer has little bargaining power and you can be more aggressive in your pricing strategy.\nBargaining Power of Suppliers\nSuppliers provide the inputs or raw materials for business. Their bargaining power has a direct impact on the company’s profit margins, as the price at which they sell inputs to business will determine the selling prices of the finished products. Suppliers have a high bargaining power in cases where they are few, there are no substitutes for supplies or when there is no unity between buying companies. If there are two suppliers for a specific good your business needs, for example, and one goes out of business, the other supplier has the power to raise prices, which will impact your ability to keep your cost structure intact.\nThreat of Substitute Products\nSubstitute products give consumers the opportunity to choose alternatives based on price or quality. This increases competition, since a consumer can easily forgo buying a particular product in place of another. For instance, a consumer may buy almond butter in place of peanut butter because of the former’s apparent health benefits. For a business to maintain superiority over rivals, it needs to invest more in developing brand loyalty based on consumers’ preferences to stand out from other products in its category.\nThreat of New Entrants\nIf an industry has low barriers to entry, a business faces the risk of competition from new entrants. New entrants can introduce tactics like lower pricing and aggressive marketing strategies in an effort to attract customers. New companies also can offer suppliers better prices and terms so that they increase competition with existing players. High entry barriers, such as customer loyalty, limited distribution channels and shortage of key resources, may limit this competitive danger.\n- Jupiterimages/Creatas/Getty Images"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6bcb4529-fae8-4ffe-a312-a56845a694ef>","<urn:uuid:6d04fa3c-354c-4b40-b996-81f9f5bf4e3e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As someone tracking global environmental policies, I'm curious about the difference between Brazil's approach to climate-related health risks and China's strategy for addressing air pollution. What have these countries implemented?","answer":"Brazil has primarily focused on studying and documenting the health impacts of temperature variability, with research covering 1,814 cities from 2000-2015 to understand its effects on cardiac hospitalizations. In contrast, China has implemented multiple direct intervention policies: they've restricted car purchases through license plate lotteries (projected to reduce automobiles by 10% by 2020), removed 5 million highly polluting vehicles, mandated flue gas desulphurization technology for coal plants, and relocated 53 heavily polluting companies away from cities. China has also significantly increased air quality monitoring and public data availability, allowing citizens to track real-time air quality in their areas.","context":["Temperature variability and hospitalization for cardiac arrhythmia in Brazil: A nationwide case-crossover study during 2000–2015\nMetadataShow full item record\n© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Background: There is growing recognition of a potential role for environmental and climatic factors in influencing cardiovascular risk. It has been speculated that temperature variability (TV) is a risk factor for cardiac arrhythmia but evidence is limited. Objective: To quantify the geographic and demographic variations in the association between TV and hospitalization for cardiac arrhythmia in Brazil during 2000–2015. Methods: Data on hospitalization for arrhythmia and weather conditions were collected from 1,814 cities. TV was calculated as the standard deviation of daily maximum and minimum temperatures during exposure days. A time-stratified case-crossover approach was applied to examine the city-specific association between TV and hospitalization for arrhythmia. City-specific estimates were pooled at the national and regional levels using a random-effect meta-analysis. Stratified analyses were conducted by sex, three age-groups (0–64, 65–74 and =75 years), and three arrhythmia subtypes (paroxysmal tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and flutter, and other arrhythmias). Results: There were 447,667 arrhythmia-related hospitalizations during 2000–2015. The odds ratio of hospitalization per 1 °C increase in TV peaked on 0–1 days’ exposure [1.012 (95% confidence interval: 1.010–1.015)]. There were no substantial differences in effect estimates of TV0-1 by region, age or sex, except for the non-significant association observed in the north. However, women were more affected by prolonged TV exposure than men. For the three arrhythmias subtypes, only paroxysmal tachycardia and other arrhythmias were sensitive to TV. Assuming a causal relationship, 35,813 (95%CI: 18,302-51,665) cases were attributable to TV0-1 in Brazil during 2000–2015, accounting for 8.0% (95%CI: 4.1–11.5%) of hospitalizations for cardiac arrhythmia. Conclusions: At a population-level exposure to TV was associated with increased risk of arrhythmia-related hospitalization in Brazil, with the relationship equally distributed across most residents but varied by arrhythmia subtypes. Our findings add to the accumulating evidence-base that climatic factors can influence cardiovascular outcomes in populations.\nShowing items related by title, author, creator and subject.\nGeographic, Demographic, and Temporal Variations in the Association between Heat Exposure and Hospitalization in Brazil: A Nationwide Study between 2000 and 2015Zhao, Q.; Li, S.; Coelho, M.; Saldiva, P.; Hu, K.; Arblaster, J.; Nicholls, N.; Huxley, Rachel; Abramson, M.; Guo, Y.

Also, what kind of business opportunities is this creating? A comprehensive look.\nIf you live in China, chances are the one thing you’d be most concerned about is the level of PM2.5 in the air. PM2.5, or particulate matter of a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less, reduces life expectancy drastically because of its ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and cause health problems. The World Health Organization’s recommended standard for PM 2.5 is 25 micrograms per cubic meter within a 24-hour period of time, and 10 micrograms per cubic meter aunually. Yet China’s cities routinely cross the recommended levels. Beijing, for instance, hit a PM2.5 level of 600 micrograms per cubic meter and “may even have hit 900” in January 2013. In 2013, the PM2.5 reading averaged 89.5 micrograms per cubic meter.\nGiven this backdrop, it is not surprising to see that out of 20 cities with the worst air quality globally, 16 are in China. Every year, 1.2 million people in China die of air pollution-related diseases. China’s pollution problems routinely makes headlines in newspapers around the world.\nYet what people may not know is that the air quality is actually getting better. In Beijing, the level of the worst pollutants was cut by one-third during the last decade and that of sulphur dioxide alone was cut by nearly 70%, says Anthony Liu, Visiting Assistant Professor of Economics at CKGSB. In this interview, Liu, who researches environmental economics, talks about the impact of air pollution in China and how the country is addressing it at a policy level.\nQ. Who is tackling these pollution issues and how are they doing so?\nA. To look at solutions, you have to understand the sources. The three top contributors are cars, coal, and industry. Heavy industry, which is extremely polluting, can be a big contributor to air pollution, and there are smaller ones as well. Construction, trash burning, or even barbecue can be a big contributor to air pollution.\nIn each of these areas the Chinese government has moved substantially in trying to cut them. In cars for example, a number of cities in China have recently implemented car restrictions, by which before people could purchase a car, they have to first win the right to do so. They either have to enter an auction, where they purchase a license plate, or they have to win a lottery. My own research suggests that in Beijing, the car lottery will cut the number of automobiles by 10% by 2020. So, this will cause substantial decreases in the number of cars over the next decades. Also, the Chinese government has worked to remove five million of the worst polluting vehicles from roadways–330,000 in Beijing alone. Because it is removing many of the most polluting [vehicles] we should see improvements in pollution, at least the forms of pollution emitted from cars.\nThe second form of pollution is coal. The Chinese government recently mandated flue gas desulphurization, a technology which removes the worst of sulphur dioxide from coal plant emissions. It allows the release from generating electricity to be much cleaner. We’ve seen sharp improvements around the country in sulphur dioxide, which leads to decreased acid rain, decreased damage to people’s health.\nThe third area is heavy industry. Here I think the best solution has just been to remove heavy industry from the city, from areas where people live. In [a way] this makes perfect [sense]. Beijing recently ordered 53 heavily polluting companies to move out of the city.\nQ. What do you see as a consequence that the public isn’t aware of about this PM2.5 issue?\nA. One of the most exciting and important developments in the past few years has been the increased amount of information that has been available to people. The Chinese government has exponentially increased the number of air monitors and the frequency with which these air monitors release data. As a result, the average Chinese citizen can now, for the first time, see the air quality in their area in real time. The increased amount of information has really improved the level of engagement of common citizens because people can adjust their plans in accordance with whether the air quality will be good or bad. That has really improved people’s quality of life with regard to air pollution.\nQ. How does PM2.5 affect international relations between China and the regional countries?\nA. Air pollution in China has a heavy toll on its neighbors. Countries like South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines, all receive heavy doses of China’s air pollution. One study looked at pollution in California found that a quarter of one type of pollutant could be attributed to a kind of pollutant that only occurred in China. So, even across the Pacific Ocean, air pollution could reach all the way to the US.\nAs a result, China’s relationships with its neighbors are certainly negatively affected. That’s not to say there aren’t opportunities. China’s environmental problems have created major opportunities for it to engage [in] and gain international prestige.\nFor example, China is currently the number one emitter of greenhouse gas. Obama recently initiated a 30% cut in the emissions from power plants in the US, and China followed the next day with its own announcement that by 2016 it would begin to cap its own emissions of carbon dioxide. Because China’s emissions are growing the fastest, this was regarded as a major change in the climate change negotiations. So there are major opportunities just by the virtue of China’s status as number one emitter of greenhouse gas, the number one polluter.\nQ. Is there a business opportunity for foreign corporations from PM2.5 emissions and problems?\nA. When I think about business opportunities in the area of environmental quality I think of two major issues: willingness to pay for a product or service that can improve environmental quality and who is best positioned to capture this value. For both of these questions, the answer is very clearly yes.\nFor air quality, people have demonstrated a willingness to shell [out] large quantities of money for personal protection, for air masks, for in-room air purifiers, for devices that can shelter them from air pollution problems. This ties in well with the second issue, which is which companies are best positioned to benefit. International companies are currently better positioned to capture the value from environmental goods, because the number one issue in capturing environmental value is trust. International brands have an advantage because they are frankly regarded with some more trust than many domestic brands.\nSince there is higher trust with international brands, companies like Johnson & Johnson, GE and Siemens are potentially very well positioned to capture portions of the market for environmental services. If they move into markets that improve people’s health and offer a benefit that people can’t find from domestic markets, there will be huge business opportunities for those companies.\nQ. What are some of the unexpected businesses which are going to thrive under this PM2.5 situation?\nA. There are some companies that are directly positioned to benefit and some indirectly positioned. For air purifiers I’m thinking of the segment more broadly, from small air purifiers that can clean out a room to large ones in an apartment building or an office space. There is very clear space for those types of firms, but there are many kinds of companies that are going to indirectly benefit from air quality problems, [such as] natural gas companies. Even though China has massive natural resources, it cannot burn coal recklessly. It is going to move away from coal towards natural gas, the other major cost effective source for electricity generation. So I expect companies in natural gas to do very well and companies in nuclear power and in alternative energy as well.\nOn the consumer side, I think that vacation planning is going to be a big industry. As people consider vacation destinations, they think about going to islands, to areas with cleaner air. Many of these already advertise how clean they [are] compared to many major cities, so I think this will be an increasing attraction for people who want to get away from the city.\nAnother area that I think will be significantly affected by air quality is real estate. Real estate and property in cities that are cleaner are going to do better as people take in the environmental amenities of those areas."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:22105d82-7856-484d-96ba-757d17d9b2e6>","<urn:uuid:bc5b8e77-7702-45c3-b5fb-1ac1e97d831f>"],"error":null}
