{"question":"How do contaminants affect indoor air quality, and what are the recommended solutions for removal?","answer":"Contaminants affecting indoor air quality include carbon dioxide from human metabolism, carbon monoxide from smoking and incomplete combustion, volatile organic compounds from building materials, and pollutants from combustion sources like oil, gas, and kerosene. Solutions for contaminant removal include improving ventilation through natural or mechanical methods, maintaining humidity levels below 50%, proper venting of fuel-burning appliances, storing chemicals outside the building, and using natural cleaning products. The effectiveness of contaminant removal can be measured through metrics like Contaminant Removal Effectiveness (CRE) and Air Change Efficiency (ACE), which help assess the ventilation system's performance in removing existing contaminants.","context":["In the early days of construction, wind tunnel tests were the standard method for investigating the indoor air quality (IAQ) of industrial and commercial buildings, hospitals or laboratories. With the advent of computer-aided engineering (CAE), advanced tools—particularly CFD—have become the principal method to quickly and effectively resolve these issues. CFD now plays an important role in accurately simulating the indoor airflow, helping building design engineers to improve the indoor air quality without compromising on low energy consumption.\nIn various heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, CFD can be used to determine which parameters will have the largest impact in relation to improving the IAQ, or indoor air quality, and living conditions. These parameters can include the thermal and ventilation analysis of the indoor systems. CFD facilitates the accurate simulation of various indoor models simply by changing the location of the heating or air conditioning units and diffuser types. This virtual design phase allows optimal conditions to be identified for a thermally comfortable, healthy, and energy efficient building before it gets to the construction phase. This reduces the cost and time required for the experimental testing, resulting in a more efficient design process and smarter decisions. \nSources of Contaminant Dispersion Affecting Indoor Air Quality (IAQ)\nThere are many sources of contaminant dispersion which can directly affect the IAQ. CFD simulations play a vital role in reducing the dispersion of contaminants in the indoor environment. The main sources are:\nThere are several contaminant sources that should be considered when analyzing the targeted zone. The common sources are :\nCarbon dioxide (exhaled by-product of all mammalian metabolism)\nCarbon monoxide (tobacco smoking, incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, and improperly ventilated heating or cooking appliances)\nVolatile organic compounds (VOC’s) (organic species from building material and finishes to cleaning agents and solvents)\nThe main heat sources or sinks in rooms include the following :\nTransmission of heat by conduction through solid surfaces such as walls, ceiling, and floors\nRadiation between solid surfaces within the room\nSolar radiation through glazing\nSensible and latent heat gains from occupants\nHeat gains from equipment, e.g., computers and lights\nInfiltration or air leakage\nWind and Infiltration\nSmall cracks around windows, walls or doors, can allow the air to leak, allowing infiltration into and out of the indoor space. This infiltration can have a drastic effect on heat loss, especially in the winter. These air leaks impact the flow pattern in the indoor space which in turn affects the contamination dispersion and overall IAQ.\nContaminant dispersion and indoor air quality are also affected by movement, for example:\nMovement of people\nDoor swing pumping\nAs the characteristic Reynolds number of the flow increases, the flow does not remain streamline. Small fluctuations become amplified, creating unstable flow and finally becoming turbulent. In this situation, high mixing takes place, which enhances the dispersion effect of the contaminant.\nThe difference in humidity levels leads to the change in density of the air. This, in turn, creates a significant buoyancy effect. As a result of this buoyancy, the circulation of the air inside can become more powerful, thus increasing the contaminant dispersion level and impacting the indoor air quality.\nDownload this case study for free to learn how the SimScale CFD platform was used to investigate a ducting system and optimize its performance.\nThere are several techniques to characterize the contaminant distribution. These techniques are taken into account when measuring the IAQ. The most commonly used ones are discussed below:\nContaminant Removal Effectiveness (CRE)\nContaminant removal effectiveness (CRE) can be used to assess the effectiveness of the ventilation system for an occupied zone. This parameter measures the effectiveness of the installed system in a particular zone to remove the existing contaminants. The formulation of CRE comes from the mean contaminant concentration at the supply and exhaust openings and the breathing zone :\nWhere Ceand Cs are the contaminant concentrations at exhaust and source respectively, and Cbzis the contaminant concentration in the breathing zone (the mean value of occupied zone). The breathing zone is defined in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1 – 2004 . The units of contaminant concentration are kg/m³, i.e., the mass of contaminant per unit volume of air. Sometimes contaminant concentration can also be represented by molar concentration, mass fraction, mole fraction, and parts per million (ppm).\nCRE and CFD\nThere are several applications that can help optimize the flow conditions in order to maximize the contaminant removal efficiency ind improve indoor air quality. These applications are important to understand when considering contaminant removal effectiveness (CRE). Two of the examples show the CFD application is reducing the contaminant concentration in a hospital operating room  and a home kitchen .\nThe figure on the left shows a hospital operating room where there are three operators and a patient. A light over a patient was also considered in this environment. The placement of the supply and exhaust was such that both are kept at a similar distance from the roof and floor respectively .\nThe main contaminant generator here is the patient. The study was performed to minimize the contaminant concentration in the operating room. The results below show a) contaminant concentration, b) temperature distribution, and c) relative humidity in the room .\nWithin the areas of high and low temperature and humidity respectively, it can be observed that the value of contaminant concentration is high, for example, between the patient and the light and above the light. One can, therefore, resolve this problem by installing an extra exhaust just above the light in order to efficiently remove the contaminants.\nFor the other application, the contaminant concentration in a home kitchen was studied. Here, the main source was the heated stove. The model used is shown in the figure on the left.\nThe two cases were simulated to study the CRE of the undertaken model: balanced flow—same left and right inlet volume flow rates; imbalanced flow—left volume flow rate as one-third of the right one. The results reveal an interesting contrast. A high concentration can be seen in the balanced case compared to the imbalanced one. This means that a considerably larger amount of contaminant escapes from the upper hood .\nLocal Mean Age of the Air (LMA):\nLocal mean age of the air (LMA) can be used to evaluate the efficiency of the ventilation system in relation to changing the old air to new. Thus, the lesser the age of air, the better the indoor air quality. The exact definition of the local mean age of the air can be expressed as  “the average time it takes for air to travel from the inlet to any point P in the room.” Using the decay method, the local mean age of the air can be calculated from :\nWhere Cp(t) is the concentration of the contaminants at point p at time t, and C0 is the initial uniform concentration. Under fully mixed conditions, the local mean age of the year equals nominal time constant everywhere:\nWhere V and q are the volume of the room and volume flow rate respectively.\nFor CFD simulations, the LMA is calculated as a separate transport equation whose generic form looks like this:\nWhere Г is diffusivity, which includes a molecular and turbulent contribution. Fluid particles entering the flow domain are typically assigned an initial age of zero, and the source term increases the age every second that fluid spends inside the domain.\nLocal Mean Age (LMA) of the air can help to make sure that the availability of the fresh air in a domain is consistent. CFD allows the entire study to be done on a virtual model before the ventilation system is designed. One of the examples  shows the use of CFD for measuring the contaminant concentration in an office room in order to monitor the LMA.\nFour cases were tested:\nCase 1: both door and window closed\nCase 2: closed door and opened window\nCase 3: opened door and closed window\nCase 4: both door and window opened\nThe office model used is shown in the figure on the right.\nThe results in the table below clearly illustrate the effect that opening both door and window can have on the mean age of the air.\nSimilarly, in one of the studies, three different conceptual designs of the natural personalized ventilation (NPV) for a hospital room were proposed ; these are shown in the figure below.\nCFD simulations were carried out on all three designs to identify the optimal solution. The figures below reveal that the age of the air in design a is confined to a small packet area and above the large duct, whereas for design b, it is mostly near the ceiling over a larger area.\nThe most noticeable difference is the age of the air at bed level, which is nearly 305 s in the case of design a compared to design b, which has the value of 353 s. In this instance, designs a and b are identified as good choices.\nAir Change Efficiency (ACE):\nAnother important parameter in monitoring the air change efficiency is air change efficiency (ACE). It is used to measure the effectiveness of the ventilation system in replacing the fresh air with old air. It is simply the ratio of the age of the air when it is completely mixed with the average time of replacement in the room :\nWhere Ce(t) is the concentration inside the exhaust duct. The benefit of ACE is that the values can be compared to different rooms since they are normalized. 100%, 50%, and less than 50% all indicate a piston flow, fully mixed condition, and short-circuiting respectively.\nSimScale’s CEO David Heiny tests the capabilities of the platform to solve a real-life engineering problem. Fill in the form and watch this free webinar to learn more!\nThe same example that was discussed in the section “contaminant removal effectiveness (CRE)” also shows the air change effectiveness (ACE) in a home kitchen . The results below depict a very slight change of ACE and thus points to the fact that, in this case, CRE should be considered rather than ACE.\nIf you want to experiment with CFD and learn more about how to improve the IAQ, SimScale has a 14-days free trial that you can use to test the platform with.

International Journal of Ventilation 10.3 (2011): 263-275","Indoor Air Quality, also known as IAQ, refers to the quality of the air within a building.\nIAQ is an important, and often overlooked, area of building improvement.\nThe effects of improved IAQ are immediate for those who work and do business in your building.\nConversely, existing health issues can be exacerbated by poor IAQ, since poor indoor air quality can damage weakened immune systems.\nSome immediate effects are irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, headaches, dizziness and fatigue.\nLong-term health issues can include respiratory diseases, heart disease and cancer.\nBreathing low-quality air can aggravate the conditions of asthma and allergy sufferers, leading to more time off of work due to illness.\nAccording to the American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology, approximately 7.8 percent of American adults have hay fever, otherwise known as allergic rhinitis.\nHay fever causes cold-like symptoms, such as runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure and is caused by an allergic response to pollen, dust mites or pet dander.\nAsthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that occurs when the airways react to a variety of stimuli.\nApproximately 18 million adults live with asthma.\nIt can be life-threatening when not properly managed, and annually, approximately 3,000 people die from asthma-related issues.\nAsthma triggers include: Respiratory infections and colds; cigarette smoke; allergic reactions to pollen, mold, animal dander, feathers, dust, food and cockroaches; indoor and outdoor air pollutants; exercise; excitement; and stress.\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), air quality can be improved by smoke-free air laws, improving ventilation and air purification in older buildings and reducing or eliminating known triggers.\nTriggers contributing to poor air quality include: Combustion sources, like oil, gas, kerosene, coal, wood and tobacco; building materials, like asbestos insulation and new carpet and paint; cleaning and maintenance products; plug-in/portable humidifiers; outdoor sources, such as radon, pesticides and outdoor air pollution; and poor ventilation.\nGetting a handle on the sources of contaminants affecting your building's IAQ is the first step.\nHere are some tips to improve your building’s indoor air quality and the health of your employees:\nSmoke outside and away from doorways.\nThe harmful chemicals in cigarettes can linger in the air, affecting other people in the building.\nTake cleaning to the next level.\nEliminating harmful mold and mildew in bathrooms and basements is essential.\nUse all-natural cleaning products whenever possible to cut down on further contaminating the building.\nRepair all standing water issues and keep your building’s humidity under 50 percent.\nAny higher and you risk creating an environment where harmful bacteria, mold and mildew can thrive.\nProperly vent all fuel-burning appliances.\nThis includes appliances like gas stoves, water heaters and fireplaces.\nDon't store chemicals, paints or solvents within the building.\nKeep them in a garage or storage area if at all possible.\nEvaluate air fresheners.\nAir-freshening devices may make your air smell nice, but they do so with a mix of chemicals that can be toxic.\nThe next level to improve IAQ is to incorporate more permanent technology to clean and purify the air.\nA licensed contractor can evaluate and assess IAQ issues and make suggestions based on your building’s specific needs.\nHere are some steps a contractor may take.\nImprove ventilation in the facility.\nThere are two ways to accomplish this: Via natural methods, like opening windows to allow for natural air flow through the building, or mechanical methods, like utilizing industrial fans to move the air.\nBy improving air flow, IAQ issues stemming from foul odors, allergens and combustion and building materials can be reduced or eliminated.\nUtilize an ozone generator, once the area is vacated.\nOzone has the ability to completely destroy the molecules found in bacteria, mold and mildew.\nThis method allows for a deep clean by permeating small cracks in the walls, therefore eliminating any issues from within the building's own structure.\nLow levels of ozone are also effective and safe.\nThe use of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyls is the latest technology available.\nIt is extremely effective and has no adverse side effects.\nThis type of technology can be installed directly in the building’s existing HVAC system and allows for continuous cleaning of the air and surfaces, even reducing dust, allergens, mildew and bacteria by up to 99 percent.\nThis method can improve the health of everyone in the building, particularly those who suffer from allergies, asthma and other respiratory illnesses.\nIt also can cut down on the spread of the common cold and flu, since the technology cleans each surface in the environment, including bathrooms and kitchens.\nNo matter how big or small, making steps towards improving your building's indoor air quality will help everyone breathe easier."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1798eeb3-bf6f-4ec2-9b83-dda8f383125f>","<urn:uuid:2094a19b-70fd-4d21-8976-c4a063c20187>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What makes Socorro Island unique for whale watching?","answer":"Socorro Island is unique as it serves as a breeding ground for Humpback Whales, with thousands making their journey through these waters from January to April, giving divers an opportunity to see them underwater. The area is only accessible via liveaboard and is protected from human life, making it an ideal habitat for these majestic mammals along with other marine species like Bottlenose Dolphins and seven different species of sharks.","context":["Beautiful beaches, tacos and tequila, mariachis, and ancient civilisations are some of the things Mexico is best known for. But did you know that this Latin American country is also a goldmine for divers looking to find rare species underwater? With six natural UNESCO World Heritage Sites and a strategic location for marine activity, here’s our pick of the 7 best diving destinations in Mexico.\nDiving Destinations in Mexico\nYou may already be familiar with these natural wonders if you’ve been planning your trip to Riviera Maya, but do you know just how unique they are? Cenotes are deep water cavern-like sinkholes, with a surface opening created by natural collapse. They are filled only with rainwater and underground rivers, so their constant water temperature makes diving here possible all year long.\nUnlike the rest of the dive sites on this list, Cenotes are not go-to locations when searching for fauna diversity. Instead, you will find geological formations worthy of bringing your GoPro for this one-of-a-kind experience. Still waters, prehistoric fossils, and almost holy-looking lighting shooting in from above might make you feel like time has stopped while you explore these sites.\n2. Cabo Pulmo National Park\nDescribed by Dr. Sylvia Earle as a conservation model to the world, Cabo Pulmo became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005 due to an amazing turnaround from the neglect and pollution that the area was under before the 1980s. The local community, seeing their loss, forced government action that has now achieved the largest increase in biomass known in any protected area in the world.\nHome to over 6,000 marine species and one of the only three living coral reefs in North America, Cabo Pulmo is an incredible diving destination that hosts both large fish and macro life for those seeking to make it a photography adventure.\nThe best season to visit is August to November. This is when the waters are warmer and large schools of Groupers join Jackfish tornados for mesmerising underwater moments. Turtle and Shark sightings are also common, and you might catch Mobula Rays roaming those areas as well.\n3. Cabo San Lucas UNESCO Marine Park\nLocated where the Pacific Ocean meets the Sea of Cortez, Cabo San Lucas was named “The World’s Aquarium” by none other than Jacques Cousteau.\nEels, Nudibranchs, Stingrays, schools of Grunts and Jackfish, Seahorses, Lobsters,\nAngelfish, and Sea Lions are some of the regularly spotted species inhabiting these extraordinary waters. During the late autumn and spring seasons, Cabo San Lucas becomes the courting and breeding ground for Mobula Rays, a spectacle of flipping and splashing that has not been witnessed anywhere else in the world.\nCabo, as it’s popularly known, is also special for its sand falls. This is a tectonic phenomenon only present in a handful of places on the planet. Sand falls literally look like underwater cascades, so you might feel like you’re living in a Stranger Things episode while diving here. As cool as it gets, right?\nAdventurous diver tip: if you’re a big pelagic fan, you might not want to miss out on Gordo Banks. Just outside Los Cabos, this dive site is famous for its schools of Hammerhead Sharks. You can also expect the occasional sightings of the area’s big guys: Mako Sharks, Tuna, Manta Rays, and even Whales.\n4. Isla Guadalupe\nIsla Guadalupe is a small volcanic island situated 240km off the coast of Baja California. It’s also one of the only four places on the planet where Great White Sharks can be (safely!) seen by humans.\nFamous for being the top destination for Great White encounters, with visibility often going up to 45 meters. This cage diving experience is a must for true Shark lovers who want to finally meet up close with one of the ocean’s top predators.\nThis remote location is only accessible via liveaboard and for three months a year (August to October). The good news? You don’t need to be a scuba diver to see these bad boys, so it can easily turn into a family trip while on holidays!\nCozumel is one of the all-time classics when it comes to diving in Mexico. With easy access from Playa del Carmen, it’s a very laid-back destination where you can enjoy resting at beautiful beach resorts in between dives.\nWhat made Cozumel so popular is still very much alive to this day. Beautiful corals and a variety of species give life to its wonderful marine ecosystem, and they can be enjoyed by divers of all levels.\nDrift dives, wall dives and reef dives will keep you entertained during the whole trip, with Eagle Rays, Nurse Sharks and lots of tropical fish making an appearance in your underwater photos. Beware though: divers have reported feeling like they’re in a National Geographic film.\nThe best time to visit? All year round! Cozumel’s water temperature and visibility maintain great conditions throughout the year, so it’s an easy destination for impromptu getaways.\n6. Banco Chinchorro\nOne of the best places to dive in the whole Northern Hemisphere is this Biosphere Reserve. Banco Chinchorro is the biggest atoll in Mexico, and it’s actually home to numerous dive sites. Its west side is suitable for all levels, with colorful reefs protected from the open ocean. Its east side is packed with over 200 wreck sites, some of which are inaccessible even for seasoned divers due to heavy surf conditions.\nWith year-long great diving possibilities, you can visit Banco Chinchorro to encounter Hawksbill, Green and Loggerhead Turtles, Barracudas, Eagle Rays, Nurse Sharks, Reef Sharks, Green Morey Eels, Jackfish, Blue and Midnight Parrotfish, and different species of Groupers.\nLife is plentiful in this unspoiled reserve, and shipwrecks are home to numerous smaller species and gorgeous setups. Yet one of its main attractions continues to be swimming with Crocodiles! Although this isn’t precisely diving, people visit Banco Chinchorro as one of the few places in the world to encounter the American Crocodile. So, if you’re the fearless kind, don’t miss out on an experience to remember…\n7. Socorro Island & the Revillagigedos\nA pelagic lover’s paradise, Socorro Island is a hub for marine life in the Pacific Ocean. Offshore and protected from human life (only accessible via liveaboard), it attracts some of the most sought-after animals in the diving world, including the Humpback Whale.\nBottlenose Dolphins are friendly enough to approach divers, and Sharks from seven different species populate these waters, including the biggest fish in the sea. The Whale Shark. Hammerheads, Whitetips, Silvertips and Galapagos Sharks regularly join Manta Rays and large schools of fish. It makes diving in Socorro simply unforgettable.\nBut what makes Socorro truly unique is being the breeding ground for Humpback Whales. Thousands of them make their journey through these waters from January to April. So it give divers a great chance to see them thrive underwater.

{"question":"How did Buddha and Socrates differ in their views on questioning as a teaching method?","answer":"While both used questioning methods, they had different approaches. The Buddha used questions as a teaching tool in various ways, including leading his audience to wisdom through questions (as seen in the Anatta-lakkhana Sutta) and responding to questions in four different ways: categorically, with distinctions, with counter-questions, or by setting them aside. In contrast, in Xenophon's dialogue, when Socrates suggested that questioning itself might be a form of teaching, his interlocutor Ischomachus explicitly denied this, insisting instead that some knowledge (like farming) was simply something everyone already knew.","context":["Is it just that we share our knowledge with others and then they interpret it as per their own individuality and spot benefit? Do Buddhas ask questions of other humans as well?\nAsking questions is interesting in Buddhism; the Buddha had his own version of the Socratic method, and many of the discourses are comprised of back and the Buddha asking questions in order to lead his audience to their own wisdom.\nSee, for example, the Anatta-lakkhana Sutta, the Buddha's second discourse:\n\"Bhikkhus, how do you conceive it: is form permanent or impermanent?\" — \"Impermanent, venerable Sir.\" — \"Now is what is impermanent painful or pleasant?\" — \"Painful, venerable Sir.\" — \"Now is what is impermanent, what is painful since subject to change, fit to be regarded thus: 'This is mine, this is I, this is my self'\"? — \"No, venerable sir.\"\nOther discourses are more traditional, wherein the Buddha is asked a question and responds in one of various ways. The Buddha himself said he responded to questions in one of four ways:\n“Bhikkhus, there are these four ways of answering questions. What four? (1) There is a question to be answered categorically; (2) there is a question to be answered after making a distinction; (3) there is a question to be answered with a counter-question; and (4) there is a question to be set aside. These are the four ways of answering questions.”\n-- AN 4.42 (Bodhi, trans)\nYet other teachings show the Buddha using questions out of compassion, to bring up a topic that his students are disinclined to bring to his attention out of consideration for his welfare. As the commentary explains:\njānantāpi tathāgatā pucchanti, jānantāpi na pucchanti; kālaṃ viditvā pucchanti, kālaṃ viditvā na pucchanti; atthasaṃhitaṃ tathāgatā pucchanti, no anatthasaṃhitaṃ. anatthasaṃhite setughāto tathāgatānaṃ. dvīhi ākārehi buddhā bhagavanto bhikkhū paṭipucchanti — dhammaṃ vā desessāma, sāvakānaṃ vā sikkhāpadaṃ paññapessāmāti\nSometimes, knowing, the Tathāgata asks, and sometimes, knowing, he doesn't ask. Knowing the time, he asks; knowing the time, he doesn't ask. He asks what is connected with benefit, not what is not connected with benefit; for the Tathāgata has destroyed the bridge in regards to what is not connected with benefit. With two intentions the Buddha, the Bhagava, asks questions back to Bhikkhus: \"We will discourse on the dhamma, or we will establish training rules for our disciples.\"\n-- Pārājika, verañjakaṇḍa\nTo this end, we can see that the Buddha himself gave some significance to asking and answering questions.\nAs to the purpose of questions, it is most obviously related to the way in which we acquire information, and how information informs our behaviour. Since asking questions can lead to hearing useful things, to broadening one's perspective, to reminding one of what one has forgotten, to helping one discard wrong views, and to many other good things as well, it seems obvious that questions should be asked and answered.\nI can't think of a specific reference for the above paragraph, though, except to say that a read through of the Buddha's forty-five years of teaching should give a good idea of how questions are effective in helping us progress on the path. The only specific teaching on benefits of questions I can think of off the top of my head is:\n“Here, student, some man or woman does not visit a recluse or a brahmin and ask: ‘Venerable sir, what is wholesome? What is unwholesome? What is blameable? What is blameless? What should be cultivated? What should not be cultivated? What kind of action will lead to my harm and suffering for a long time? What kind of action will lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time?’ Because of performing and undertaking such action…he reappears in a state of deprivation…But if instead he comes back to the human state, then wherever he is reborn he is stupid. This is the way, student, that leads to stupidity, namely, one does not visit a recluse or brahmin and ask such questions.\n“But here, student, some man or woman visits a recluse or a brahmin and asks: ‘Venerable sir, what is wholesome?…What kind of action will lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time?’ Because of performing and undertaking such action…he reappears in a happy destination…But if instead he comes back to the human state, then wherever he is reborn he is wise. This is the way, student, that leads to wisdom, namely, one visits a recluse or brahmin and asks such questions.\n-- MN 135 (Bodhi, trans)\nSo, there you have it. Asking questions leads to wisdom.\nAs with all sorts of learning, it is important not to mistake asking questions with actual meditation and empirical realization of the truth. On the other hand, asking questions certainly has greater benefit that simply producing theoretical knowledge; it can challenge and encourage and be quite beneficial as a means of producing wholesome mind states.\nWe ask a question when we do not know. To some questions the answer is definite and there is no other interpretation and it accords with the Buddha's dhamma.\nTo other questions of morality/ethic (sila) then it is relative to the person. Buddhist monks keep the 227 rule; 8 preceptors, the 8 precepts; and ordinary people, 5 precepts.\nEven within the first precept of \"abstaining from killing\" we practice according to our ability...do we kill mosquitoes that spread malaria, etc..\nThe Buddha knows so he only asks questions so he may show the error of other peoples answer inorder to teach. That is one of his many teaching methods.","A great deal hinges on how one approaches the interpretation of the work. The dialogue is often read in a fairly straightforward way as just Xenophon putting his own idea of good advice for estate-management in Socrates' mouth. There are good reasons to question this, however. Some of Socrates' statements are highly exaggerated, and Ischomachus at several points makes clear that he thinks Socrates is cracking jokes. In addition, Socrates and Ischomachus do not agree on the value of questioning for education. It is also the case that while some of the opening discussion finds echoes in the later discussion, there are discrepancies in how wealth is treated. It would be unreasonable to expect Plato's multi-leveled ironies in Xenophon, but recognizing this is a far cry from expecting Xenophon to be unable to write irony at all, which is the impression you get from many commentators on the dialogue.\nYou can read a translation of Xenophon's Oeconomicus online in English at the Perseus Project.\nThe dialogue has an introductory dialogue, between Socrates and Critobulus, at the end of which Socrates begins narrating a dialogue he had previously had with Ischomachus.\nCritobulus is an appropriate interlocutor for the dialogue because his father, Socrates' friend Crito, was a farmer who became moderately wealthy through good management of his estate.\nThere are quite a few scattered references to Ischomachus, but it is difficult to get a coherent picture out of it. He is a wealthy landowner. Other sources seem to indicate that his wealth did not last. There also seems to have been some sort of scandal involved with his wife, at least as indicated by a surviving speech against Callias by Andocides. Ischomachus's daughter seems to have married the wealthy Callias, who may have been trying to shore up his wealth, which was being drained by the Peloponnesian War. When Ischomachus died, Callias seems to have become the guardian of Chrysilla, Ischomachus's wife (women were treated as minorities in ancient Athens). The daughter seems to have tried to kill herself and then run away; Callias divorced her, and then married Chrysilla. If any of this is the case, and Xenophon was aware of any of it, then much of Ischomachus's role in the dialogue must be at least partly ironic.\nIn addition, Xenophon claims at the beginning that he was a witness to the conversation between Socrates and Critobulus, although he doesn't contribute; as with the similar claim at the beginning of his Symposium, this is one of the anachronisms of the dialogue -- other elements indicate that this conversation takes place after Xenophon's Persian expedition and exile from Athens. In addition, there are anonymous others who are listening to the discussion.\nThe Plot and The Thought\nXenophon remarks as a matter of introduction that he once heard Socrates discussing oikonomia, the Socrates opens the dialogue itself by asking Critobulus if oikonomia is a kind of knowledge (episteme) the way medicine and the like are. Critobolus says he thinks it is, and they discuss what it means to have something as property, with Socrates arguing that nothing is genuinely property unless it is beneficial and useful. After a brief discussion of actual management, they talk about Critobulus's wife, with Socrates saying that the wife is often as important as the husband to the successful functioning of the estate. Socrates addresses the question of what crafts need to be considered in oikonomia by taking the Great King of Persia as a model. He then argues that farming (georgia) has many advantages for both the individual and society, including teaching justice (5.12). Critobulus repeatedly asks, however, for an explanation of that fact that results from farming are so very different, with one person working very hard and getting very little while another works relatively little and gains a lot. To this end, Socrates relates a conversation he had with Ischomachus. It is surely significant that the narrative with Ischomachus is not introduced for the general purpose of discussing estate-management but for discussing specifically \"why some farm in such a way that their farming gains them all they need and more, while the result of others' labour is that their farming fails to make a profit\" (6.11).\nSocrates had been investigating the beautiful/noble/splendid (kalos) and good (agathos), finding good artisans and examining their beautiful products, but he really wanted to find someone who merited that greatest of Greek compliments, kalos kagathos, beautiful and good. At first he tried looking for those who were beautiful, and then seeing if he could find any goodness in them, but this failed; all he learned is that many who are beautiful have corrupt minds. So he tried a different strategy, this time looking for people who had the reputation of being beautiful and good. The name Ischomachus came up, so Socrates set out to find him. This he did in the agora, where he was sitting at the Stoa of Zeus Eleutherios, and Socrates expressed surprise that he wasn't doing anything, since Ischomachus seemed to be a very busy person. Ischomachus replies that he usually is, but today he is waiting to meet some people from out of town.\nSocrates asks him what he normally does when he isn't waiting for foreigners, noting that he asks because he wants to understand why Ischomachus has the reputation for being beautiful and good. Ischomachus is pleased at the remark, butwryly remarks that when the state calls on him to pay for liturgies or new warships, they always just summon him as 'Ischomachus', not as 'Kalos Kagathos'. He notes that he rarely spends time indoors, because his wife is perfectly capable of managing the house (oikos). They then discuss Ischomachus's wife for several sections.\nSocrates eventually asks what Ischomachus himself does, noting again that he wants to know what it is that gives Ischomachus the reputation of being beautiful and good. Ischomachus replies that he will be happy to do so, in order that Socrates can tell him if he is doing anything wrong. Socrates responds in turn that it would probably be inappropriate for him to tell a beautiful and good man what he was doing wrong, since he himself has a reputation for being a chatterer with his head in the clouds (a clear allusion to the representation of Socrates in Aristophanes' The Clouds) and a beggar. But he does take comfort in the fact that, when people were discussing how excellent a horse was, he asked the groom if the horse had any money, and the groom (no doubt thinking him crazy) replied that horses have no money; it means that his lack of money will not prevent him from becoming a good man.\nIschomachus replies that he prays to the goods for wealth, and here we have a clear indication of a difference of view between Socrates and Ischomachus -- Socrates is distinctly skeptical of the idea that having much property is a good thing, and says that he'd really rather hear first about how Ischomachus stays healthy and survives in battle. Ischomachus insists that they are related, and describes his training regime. When Socrates expresses amazement at how much he is able to do in order to get the reputation of being beautiful and good, Ischomachus responds that he often gets attacked by sycophants (i.e., people who make a living out of suing other people). Socrates asks what he does to make sure he can hold his own in argument, and Ischomachus notes that he practices with his servants and his wife, who often beats him in argument.\nSocrates says he is impressed that Ischomachus is keeping such a time-wasting promise, given that he has all the property to take care of, but Ischomachus replies that he isn't neglecting his property, because he has a foreman. They talk about the training of foremen, in which responsibility (epimeleia) plays a significant part, and then Socrates asks the general question of whether it is possible to train someone in responsibility without being responsible himself. Ischomachus replies that it is not, and they continue discussing the training of a foreman.\nSince knowledge of tillage is an essential part of what a foreman must know, they discuss the difficulty of teaching this, with Ischomachus insisting that it is very easy to learn and that Socrates almost certainly knows most of it already. Ischomachus questions Socrates, and Socrates ends up giving the right answers. This leads to another clear indication of difference of view between Socrates and Ischomachus. Socrates uses his own case as an opportunity to ask Ischomachus if this might not show that questioning is itself a kind of teaching (19.15):\nIs questioning an educational process, Ischomachus? I'm asking because I've just understood your method of questioning me. You take me through points that I know, you show me that these points are no different from points I'd been thinking I didn't know, and thus you convince me, I think, that I do know the latter points too.\nIschomachus, however, denies this, and insists that it is just the case that farming is something everyone already knows. This, I think, is one of the keys to interpreting the dialogue, and it is perhaps the most important of several parallels between Critobulus and Ischomachus: neither of them is fully understanding what Socrates is doing when he is questioning them. Critobulus keeps interrupting the course of Socrates' questioning in order to try to get Socrates to give him answers about the things he wishes to know, and Ischomachus is completely unable to consider any possibility that he himself might learn from being questioned.\nIt is at this point that the discussion finally turns to the question Critobulus had asked originally, which had started Socrates' narration of the discussion with Ischomachus: if farming is so easy to learn, why do farmers get such very different results? Ischomachus says that the differences arise not from the fact that people don't have the knowledge but from the fact that they don't put it into practice through hard work. He gives as an example hard work in farming the scheme developed by his father, which he has continued. The way to make money in farming is to buy neglected farms, fix them up, and sell them for a profit; Ischomachus loved farming so much that he did that all the time. While Socrates doesn't come out and say so, it is clear that he sees the irony in this -- Ischomachus really makes money not out of farming but out of selling farms -- and doesn't entirely like it; he compares it, apparently sarcastically, to the unscrupulous acts of Athenian traders who 'love grain' so much that instead of selling it to grain-poor Athens, they make fortunes selling it in whatever foreign market that will deliver the highest price. Obviously such people do not really love the grain at all; and the negative implication for Ischomachus is very clear. But Ischomachus takes Socrates to be joking, and replies that it makes perfect sense to say that someone has a love of building houses even if he sells all the houses he builds in order to build others. Socrates replies -- again, apparently sarcastically -- that he very much believes Ischomachus when he says that \"everyone is naturally inclined to love the things which they think will profit them\" (20.24).\nThe dialogue ends with a long speech of Ischomachus on how he will concede one thing to Socrates, namely, that it also involves authority, which is common to many other things, which depends on the gods. It is difficult to know exactly how to interpret this. The basic idea seems very Xenophontic: Xenophon tends to emphasize both the importance of hard work and the value understanding how to exercise authority. On the other hand, Socrates' goal in discussing these matters with Ischomachus was to find out why he had the reputation of being beautiful and good. And all that we've learned about Ischomachus is that he seems to do well because other people do the work for him. His wife does all the domestic work. His foreman seems to do all the practical farming work. It's sometimes hard not to take his insistence that everyone already knows what is involved in agriculture as a sign that he doesn't actually know much about the subject, and just thinks he already does. He doesn't even make his major profit off of the produce of farming but instead off of real estate sales. So we seem to have the implicit conclusion that Ischomachus is not kalos kagathos, and that his reputation arises mostly from the work of others. This suggests that Socrates' narrative is quite ironic even in its own terms. If that is the case, there is certainly more going on here than is generally discussed in commentary on the dialogue.\nThere's no need to think that everything Ischomachus says is wrong or absurd; as the narrative is quite long, Socrates can obviously be using it to try to make many different points to Critobulus, by simply giving him a different vantage point on the questions he has been asking. But I don't see how one can not see the obvious ironies here. Setting aside the apparent irony of what we seem to know about Ischomachus from other sources -- which in a dialogue by Plato would be taken immediately as an indicator of irony in the dialogue -- Ischomachus and Socrates clearly diverge at several points, including the especially important question of whether questioning is a kind of teaching. Moreover, Ischomachus repeatedly fails to give any clear idea of what he does, despite being asked the question explicitly twice -- instead we spend practically all the time talking about what Ischomachus's wife and servants do. What little we get about Ischomachus's work itself (11.14-18) consists of Ischomachus rising early, walking out to his farm if he doesn't have business in Athens (as he does this day, sitting in the agora for long periods of time waiting to meet people), looking around the farm where his servants are already doing the work, supervising any changes he thinks should be made, then training with his horse, and finally walking and running back to Athens, all the while making sure that he eats regular meals. The man can't be doing more than an hour or two of work a day. And to crown it all, I don't see why anyone would not take the revelation in the penultimate section about how Ischomachus actually makes his money as anything else but a sign that we shouldn't take him with complete seriousness.\n* The dialogue starts so abruptly that it is commonly thought that it began as an additional section of the Memorabilia that grew big enough to stand alone.\n* The description of the Great King's estate management is very Xenophontic; Xenophon, of course, saw Persia firsthand in his expedition with Cyrus the Younger and also wrote a highly idealized historical fiction about the education of Cyrus the Great. Xenophon signals that this is his own idea of how Socrates might handle the topic by having Socrates describe the behavior of Cyrus the Younger and remark that, if he had lived, he would have been a great ruler -- very Xenophon, that. There are also verbal parallels in the description of Cyrus's death with Xenophons account of the same thing in Anabasis 1.9.31.\n* A feature of Athenian life that comes up quite often in this dialogue is the peculiarity of the Athenian taxation system. When the Athenians needed to fund some extraordinary and expensive item best not drawn from its regular treasury, like a religious festival or new warships, they would summon a rich citizen and make them pay for it. The expectation was that the wealthy citizen would do this as a part of his civic responsibilities. (This, incidentally, is one of the things Aristotle has in mind when he talks about the virtue of magnificence.)\n* An element of Greek marriage practice that plays an important role in the dialogue is that wives were often taken when they are very young. It is not actually surprising that Critobulus has very little to say to his wife. As Ischomachus notes, his wife was fifteen when he married her, and Critobulus's may be even younger. A considerable part of what Socrates seems to be doing with the Ischomachus narration is trying to show Critobulus that he is really serious in saying, at the end of section 3, \"My opinion is that when a wife is a good partner in the house, her contribution is just as beneficial as her husband's.\" Note, too, Socrates remark at the beginning of section 10 that if Ischomachus's account is right, his wife's mind is as good as a man's.\nQuotations are from Xenophon, Conversations of Socrates, Waterfield, tr.

{"question":"What are the key differences between the trapezius stretch technique described for seniors and the soleus muscle stretch for shin splints treatment?","answer":"The trapezius stretch for seniors is performed seated, turning the chin to one side and toward the chest, using hand assistance to pull the head down, while the soleus stretch for shin splints is performed standing facing a wall with a bent knee position keeping the heel on the floor. The trapezius stretch targets the neck and upper body area with a 30-second hold and 4 repetitions, whereas the soleus stretch focuses on the lower calf area with a 30-second hold and 3 repetitions.","context":["Stretching tends to be the most overlooked and neglected among seniors, yet nothing is more vital to keeping an aging body limber and injury free. Here’s what you should know along with some tip and resources to help you regain some flexibility.\nAccording to a study reported in 2013-14, to determine differences in physical activity level and functional fitness between young elderly (60-69 years) and old elderly (70-80 years) people with the hypothesis that an age-related decline would be found. Aging has a huge role to play in activity decline process. These differences between young and old elderly people were found to be due to the reduction of muscle strength in both upper and lower limbs and changes in body-fat percentage, flexibility, agility, and endurance.\nIf elderly individuals do not take part in physically active lifestyles, they expose themselves to the risk of their muscle mass and joint motion reducing by 40% and 10%-40%, depending on body part, respectively, while loss of muscle strength (~30%) is related to a decrease in muscle mass.\n- Muscle mass and strength tend to reduce by 30%-50% between the ages of 30 and 80 years, with the main cause the reduction in the number of muscle fibers and atrophy of type II muscle fiber. Furthermore, losses in muscular strength occur at an approximate rate of 12%-14% per decade after age 50 years. However, resistance training is generally thought to be a promising intervention for reversing the loss of muscle function and deterioration of muscle structure associated with the aging process. Muscular function is not the only deterioration associated with the aging process if PA is not maintained.\n- Significant decrease in aerobic capacity have been found after the age of 40 years, such that at the age of 65 years it has approximately 30% less capacity. This means that the capacity for elderly people to undertake aerobic activities such as walking and running is adversely affected by advancing age, due to the decline in maximal oxygen uptake of about 0.5%-1.0% per year.\n- Studies have also shown that the number of falls increases by 35%-40% after 60 years of age,which is a consequence of reduced muscle strength, balance, and flexibility.\nStretching exercises should focus on the muscles in your calves, front and back thighs, hips, lower and upper back, chest, shoulders and neck. If you’ve had hip or back surgery, you should talk to your doctor before doing lower-back flexibility exercises.\nSeated Trapezius Stretch\n- Turn your chin to the right and toward your chest..\n- Place your right hand over the top of your head, and gently pull your head down toward the right. You will feel a stretch in your left trapezius, and if you touch the left side of your neck with your left hand, you will feel the tight muscle being stretched. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds, and then relax. Repeat this stretch four times, remembering to breathe.\n- Switch chin direction to the left. Place your left hand over the top of your head, and gently pull down to stretch your right side.\n- Stand with your feet shoulder width apart.\n- Raise your right arm up to shoulder height, and move it across the front of your body.\n- With your left arm, pull the right arm as close to your chest as possible, and hold it for 30 seconds. You should feel the stretch across the back of your shoulder. Repeat this four times, then switch to the left side.\n- With your feet shoulder width apart, raise your right arm straight up and over your head.\n- Bend your elbow so that your right hand is reaching for your left shoulder.\n- Use your left hand to press back on your right elbow.

In some cases strengthening exercises may be beneficial but initially stretching exercises only should be done.\nStretches for shin splints\nIn many cases the calf muscles which consist of the larger gastrocnemius muscle and the lower soleus muscle are tight. Regular shin splints stretching exercises below combined with sports massage can release tension in these muscles helping to cure and prevent shin splints\nGastrocnemius muscle stretch\nOne of the most important shin splints exercises - to stretch the larger of the calf muscles lean against a wall with the back leg straight keeping the heel pushed into the floor. A stretch should be felt at the back of the lower leg. If a stretch cannot be felt then move the heel further back. Hold for 20 seconds then relax and repeat 3 times. If the athlete has particularly flexible calf muscles then a more advanced version of the calf stretch can be done on a step.\nPlay calf stretching exercises video.\nSoleus muscle stretch\nTo to stretch this muscle the knee must be bent to relax the overlying Gastrocnemius. The patient should stand facing a wall with the foot of the calf to be stretched at the back. The knee of the back leg should be bent towards the wall, keeping the heel on the floor. A stretch should be felt in the lower part of the back of the calf. hold this position for 30 seconds and repeat 3 times. A more advanced version of this stretching exercise is to place the forefoot or the front leg on the wall keeping the heel on the floor and gently push the front knee towards the wall.\nPlay soleus muscle stretching video.\nSeated shin stretches\nStretches for shin splints also involve stretching the muscles on the front of the lower leg can be difficult to achieve. It is probably more important to stretch the muscles at the back of the lower leg. The athlete kneels down sitting on their heels. Gently push down on the heels to stretch the front of the leg. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds and repeat 3 times. To increase the stretch do one leg at a time and lift up the knee of the stretching leg.\nPlay shin stretching exercise video.\nStrengthening exercises for shin splints\nStrengthening the muscles of the lower leg can begin after the initial painful, inflamed phase has passed. Strengthening should be a gradual process and exercises should always be pain free. The emphasis should be on stretching exercises and build up the load on the lower leg through exercises or running gradually.\nToe raises are a good starting point when looking to strengthen the shin muscles. Start with only a few repetitions and gradually increase the numbers. The patient should be sat with both feet flat on the floor. Keeping the heel on the ground, the patient should lift the rest of the foot up as high as possible. Hold for a couple of seconds before slowly returning the foot back to the floor Repeat 10-20 times and increase to performing 2-3 sets. Less is more with this exercise, doing too much too soon can make symptoms worse.\nPlay toe raise exercise video.\nCalf raise exercise\nTo strengthen all of the lower leg muscles, perform calf raises. These can initially be performed both legs together before being progressed to single leg only. Stand with the feet shoulder width apart and knees straight holding onto a wall or similar for balance. Lift the heels off the floor as high as possible and slowly return to the floor. This can be progressed even further by standing on a step with the heel off the back and lower the heel down past the level of the step.\nPlay calf raise exercise video.\nDorsiflexion is the ankle movement where the toes are pointed towards the ceiling. To progress in strengthening the shin muscles resistance can be used in the form of either pressure from a partner or a resistance band. The patient sits on the floor with the resistance band looped around the toes and held at a fixed point on the floor in front. They then dorsi flex the ankle against the resistance of the band.\nPlay resisted dorsi flexion exercise video.\nHeel and toe walking\nThe patient walks with exaggerated ankle movements from the heel raising up high on the toes. A variation of this is to walk the length of a room either on the toes or on the heels will help to strengthen the calf and shin muscles respectively. Make sure you do this slowly and under complete control.\nPlay heel to walking exercise video."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:69514527-f3d3-47b9-ac54-92cde1c496a4>","<urn:uuid:1b35d27d-b055-44fe-af3f-09d1910f3cf6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a researcher studying mythology and volcanic activity, I'm curious about the connection between Maori gods and natural features. Can you explain how the name Tawhaki is used both for a volcano on Io and a penguin species in New Zealand, and what mythological significance it carries?","answer":"Tawhaki appears in both contexts with interesting mythological connections. Tawhaki Patera, a volcano on Jupiter's moon Io, was formally named by the International Astronomical Union in 2000 after the Māori lightning god Tāwhaki. In New Zealand, the Fiordland penguin is called tawaki by the Maori, also named after the same god. According to Maori mythology, Tawaki was a god who walked Earth in human form and revealed his divine nature when he 'clothed himself in lightning' on a hill. The penguin's yellow crest is thought to possibly represent this lightning connection. Additionally, in Maori myth, the god Tawaki was associated with flooding, as he caused a flood by cracking the crystal floor of Heaven and releasing sky waters.","context":["Tawhaki Patera is an active volcano on Jupiter's moon Io. It is located on Io's leading hemisphere at Coordinates:  within the equatorial plains of western Media Regio. Tawhaki is an Ionian patera, a type of volcanic crater similar to a caldera, 49.8 kilometers (30.9 mi) wide and 550 meters (1,800 ft) deep.\nTawhaki Patera was first seen as a dark spot in low-resolution Voyager 1 in March 1979. However, volcanic activity was not observed at Tawhaki until September 1997 when a bright thermal hotspot was observed at near-infrared wavelengths while Io was in the shadow of Jupiter by the camera on the Galileo spacecraft. Tawhaki would also be observed as a hotspot while Io was in eclipse in November 1997 during Galileo's eleventh orbit. The high temperature period of the eruption at Tawhaki ceased by May 1998. It is uncertain whether this delay is due to real changes in activity at Tawhaki or the poor resolution of the Voyager data and Galileo data from the Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS).\nTawhaki Patera is one of several volcanoes suspected of being responsible for the August 2, 1999 9908A outburst eruption, one of the most energetic observed on Io. However, the low-resolution of the ground-based observation precludes a definitive identification of the source volcano of the eruption beyond that it was located in northwestern Media Regio on Io's leading hemisphere. The NIMS instrument did detect a thermal hotspot between one and five micrometres at Tawhaki during Galileo's 21st orbit in July 1999, a month prior to the eruption. The southern half of Tawhaki Patera was observed by Galileo at 260 meters per pixel during an encounter with Io on November 26, 1999, providing the highest resolution image of this volcano. This along with a color observation taken in July 1999, showed that the floor of Tawhaki contained some of the darkest material in the area, suggesting the cooled lava at Tawhaki is very young, consistent with the activity seen during the Galileo mission. A lava channel, later named Tawhaki Vallis was also found to the southeast. The channel maybe related to earlier activity at Tawhaki Patera, but the images of the region cut off the northern half of the volcano and channel, preventing a relationship between the two volcanic features to be established. In August 2001, NIMS once again observed a low level of activity at Tawhaki Patera.\nThe volcano was formally named Tawhaki Patera by the International Astronomical Union in 2000 after the Māori lightning god, Tāwhaki. The Galileo imaging team suggested the name Hine-i-tapeka Patera, but Tawhaki Patera was chosen instead.\n- Blue, Jennifer. \"Tawhaki Patera\". Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature.

New Zealand Maori call it tawaki or sometimes pokotiwha. While the latter term translates to “gleaming head” owing to its conspicuous yellow crest, tawaki has a considerably more mythical ring to it.\nThe Maori names for most New Zealand bird species reflect their respective calls – such as kiwi, kea, kaka. While this is also true for the two other penguin species inhabiting the New Zealand mainland – the Yellow-eyed penguin or hoiho and the Little Penguin or kororā – the term tawaki originates from ancient legends.\nIn Maori mythology, Tawaki was a god that walked the earth in human form. Why Maori would name a small – it stands a mere 55cm tall – and rather cuddly penguin after a god may have many reasons. Legend has it that Tawaki’s fellow human beings did not realise he was a god until “he ascended a lofty hill, threw aside his vile garments and clothed himself in lightning“. Thinking about it one could certainly argue that the yellow crest makes for a convincing lightning costume.\nIt could also be that the notorious heavy rainfalls of the West Coast and Fiordland might have something to do with the naming: “In Maori myth, the god Tawaki caused the flood when he cracked the crystal floor of Heaven and sent the sky waters cascading downward.“\nTawaki inhabit the southwestern coast lines of New Zealand’s South Island as well as Stewart, Codfish and Solander Island in the South. The northernmost breeding colony is located at Heretaniwha Point at the western end of Bruce Bay in the central West Coast, while the last breeding pairs occupy nest sites around Port Pegasus at the southern tip of Stewart Island. The two extremes of the tawaki breeding range seperate less than 500km. However, the true coastline length tawaki have available for breeding is somewhere in the region of 1,500-2,000 km owing to the vast and deep fiord systems that riddle the aptly named Fiordland National Park.\nUnlike all other crested penguin species that breed in well-defined colonies with up to several thousand nests crammed into rather constrained areas, tawaki have evolved to be very secretive birds. Their nests are located in caves, rock crevasses, under tree logs and roots or almost impenetrable vegetation. This, combined with the fact that most of the areas they inhabit are very hard to reach, explains why we still know very little about the species.\nTawaki is presumed to be one of the rarest penguin species with current estimates of their population ranging between 2,500 and 3,000 breeding pairs; the population is suspected to undergo a continuos decline. However, the species’ preference to breed in extremly rugged and inaccessible terrain makes population counts a daunting task and more of a guesswork than a reliable assessment. So there could be more. But there could also be less.\nIn comparison to other penguin species, we know very little about tawaki. Only a handful of studies have been conducted in the past 40 years, the most comprehensive of which was carried out in the early 1970s. Most of what we know is limited to the birds’ breeding biology, their nesting behaviour and the threats they are facing.\nWell, there is a whole bunch of different threats that tawaki have to live with. Let’s start with the threat we know the most about: terrestrial predators.It is important to know that New Zealand is an island country that for millenia was dominated by birds. The only mammal that ever made it here were bats. This changed dramatically a few hundred years ago.\nWhen the Maori arrived in New Zealand, they became the biggest threat as they took tawaki for food; the species cryptic breeding behaviour might be a direct result of this. However, it was with the arrival of the pākehā – the white man – that it really turned southwards for tawaki. In the 1800s the European settlers brought with them a considerable array of four-legged beasts some of them as pets (cats & dogs), some of them to breed for their fur (stoats and possums), and some by accident (mice, rats). All of these sooner or later started to roam the land and migrate to the remotest areas of the New Zealand mainland, preying upon endemic bird species many of which had lost their ability to fly, like the Kiwi and Kakapo. And penguins.\nSaying this, the fact that Kakapo is quasi-extinct as a result of stoat predation while there still are penguins, shows that the latter must certainly be more resilient. The fact that penguins can be quite pesky when attacked probably works in their favour. But regardless it is quite clear that New Zealand birds would be better off without any terrestrial predators. What’s more, unlike the terrestrial birds that “only” have to deal with land-based threats, penguins have to cope with threats while out at sea.\nAnd these sea-based threats might be an euqally big, if not bigger problem for tawaki.\nFisheries bycatch – set nets\nThe industrialisation of fisheries in the 20th century brought with it an ever increasing amount of fishing gear in the water. Particularly, fisheries involving nets have become a substantial threat to seabirds. And in New Zealand, one particular type of fisheries starts to emerge as one of the worst things that can happen to penguins – set netting. Set nets consist of a single, stationary net wall that floats upright in the water column. Set nets can be brought out just below the surface, in mid-water or close to the seafloor. And while their main purpose is to catch fish, they are a lethal threat to any marine animal that gets entangled in them and more often than not drowns. Bycatch of marine mammals and seabirds in set nets is a serious problem in New Zealand and it is known that it causes significant mortality in Yellow-eyed penguins.\nTo which degree set netting impacts on tawaki we don’t know. On one hand, the observer programmes of this fisheries does not deliver reliable estimates of bycatch rates in the regions where penguins are affected. On the other hand, we don’t know anything about the foraging behaviour of tawaki, i.e. if their foraging grounds overlap with set netting regions, whether their diving behaviour makes them likely to end up in set nets.\nIn recent years, New Zealand policy makers have turned towards a more liberal approach to mining operations. This comes in several facets which potentially impact tawaki. On one hand, terrestrial mining interests along the West Coast are substantial. On the oher hand, oil exploration in New Zealand waters has become a hot topic and, again, the West Coast is an area of considerable interest.\nAll this means that tawaki might have to cope with run-off pollution from terrestrial mining operations as well as potential oil spills. But again, we have no clear information whether tawaki forage in current or future “pollution danger zones”.\nThe world’s oceans are getting warmer. This brings with it substantial change in marine ecosystems and decreasing oceanic productivity. Obviously these changes are likely to affect top marine predators such as tawaki. Yet, it does not need to be all doom and gloom. Despite the reasonably limited range of tawaki, the species inhabits immensly diverse marine habitats (more on that on the Project page). This might be an indication that tawaki are adaptable and able to adjust to new situations.\nHowever, this does not mean that everything is indeed peachy.\nFirst of all, we have no idea whether there is actually any truth to the idea that tawaki can somehow cope with ocean warming. And even if tawaki are super-flexible and can adapt to change, everything has its limit… and the more we know about such limits the more we can do to mitigate reaching this limit.\nAs mentioned before, we know very little about tawaki. And most of what we know about the species covers the terrestrial part of their biology. Yet as a penguin, tawaki spend most of their time at sea – and as such will be vulnerable to the multitude of sea-based threats like the ones discussed above but also threats we have no idea that they exist.\nThis is why the Tawaki Project sets out to find out what tawaki do while at sea, what affects them when they are in the water and how this impacts on their population in the long run."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bcf67721-6958-4fa1-944d-edfe84e4104b>","<urn:uuid:163ecb50-9577-43c5-ba11-842e725fcb90>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm researching laryngeal cancer treatments: what are the surgical options available, and what's the role of the healthcare team in treatment?","answer":"Surgical options for laryngeal cancer vary depending on the stage. For early laryngeal cancer, surgery aims to preserve the larynx's major functions like speaking and swallowing. In advanced cases, a complete laryngectomy (removal of the larynx) is often performed. Treatment involves a multidisciplinary healthcare team including head and neck surgeons, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, dentists, speech-language pathologists, registered dietitians, and social workers. These specialists work together to provide comprehensive care, from surgical procedures to rehabilitation. Some advanced surgical options include minimally invasive surgeries, robotic-assisted approaches, and head and neck reconstruction surgeries that can rebuild the tongue, throat, or jaw and restore voice after larynx surgery.","context":["Cancers that start in the throat (oropharynx and hypopharynx), voice box (larynx), nasal cavity, salivary glands, or oral cavity (lip, mouth, and tongue) are referred to as head and neck cancers.\nMedStar Washington Hospital Center is one of the largest treatment centers for head and neck cancers in the area, with particular expertise in salivary gland tumors and cancer tied to the human papillomavirus (HPV). Our nationally recognized specialists work closely together, meeting in a multidisciplinary tumor board conference to discuss new cases and make the best recommendations.\nOur head and neck specialists regularly treat complex diseases. When caught early, head and neck cancer is highly curable, often with surgery, radiation, or a combination of the two. With early medical treatment, patient outcomes are dramatically improved and disabilities are far less problematic. When larynx (voice box) cancer is treated in its earlier stages, cure rates are as high as 90 percent.\nWorking as a team, our cancer specialists provide a full range of therapies. They develop coordinated care plans based on your individual condition and needs — one that not only treats the cancer but also limits the impact on your appearance and your ability to swallow, breathe, eat and talk.\nWhen it comes to the latest tools and techniques to treat cancer, we adopt only those that deliver better care, results and outcomes. We are proud to offer:\n- Minimally invasive surgeries, including robotic-assisted approaches which can potentially avoid the need for radiation treatment, and may improve swallowing outcomes\n- Gamma Knife and Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), radiation treatments that can offer focused treatment while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue\n- Nerve monitoring, to protect key functions during surgery\n- Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS)\nOur head and neck cancer experts are focused on your quality of life. While treating cancer is our goal, we also work to limit the impact of therapy on your breathing, eating, swallowing and talking. We do this by including speech and language therapists in our management to prevent problems when possible and plan for any potential rehabilitation right away. Nutritionists specializing in oncology can also assist with dietary needs during the treatment course to help you maintain strength during treatment.\nHead and neck reconstruction surgeries, including the ability to rebuild the tongue, throat, or jaw and restore the voice after larynx surgery, are performed by our highly skilled and experienced oncology specialists.\nHead and Neck Cancer Symptoms\nSymptoms of head and neck cancers may include:\n- Lump or a sore that does not heal\n- Sore throat that does not go away\n- Difficulty swallowing\n- Change or hoarseness in the voice\nSymptoms that may affect specific areas of the head and neck include the following:\nNon-healing ulcers, swelling, spasm of the jaw muscles and pain, including pain in one ear, a white or red patch on the gums, the tongue, or the lining of the mouth, a swelling of the jaw that causes dentures to fit poorly or become uncomfortable, and unusual bleeding or pain in the mouth.\nNose and Sinus Cancer\nDischarge from the nose, persistent congestion, facial pain and double vision, sinuses that are blocked and do not clear, chronic sinus infections that do not respond to treatment with antibiotics, bleeding through the nose, frequent headaches, swelling or other trouble with the eyes, pain in the upper teeth, or problems with dentures.\nUpper Throat and Soft Palate\nSore throat, jaw spasm, pain in the ear, spitting up blood and pain and difficulty swallowing (onset of symptoms may occur later in disease), trouble breathing or speaking, pain when swallowing, pain in the neck or the throat that does not go away, frequent headaches.\nCoughing, hoarse voice, and difficulty breathing\nSwelling under the chin or around the jawbone, numbness or paralysis of the muscles in the face, or pain in the face, the chin, or the neck that does not go away\nHead and Neck Cancer Risks\nAlcohol and tobacco use, including smokeless tobacco, are the top two risk factors for head and neck cancers. The majority of head and neck cancers are caused by tobacco and alcohol use.\nInfection with cancer-causing types of human papillomavirus (HPV), especially HPV-16, is a risk factor for some types of head and neck cancers, particularly oropharyngeal cancers that involve the tonsils or the base of the tongue.\nOther risk factors for cancers of the head and neck include the following:\n- Paan (betel quid): Immigrants from Southeast Asia who use paan (betel quid) in the mouth should be aware that this habit has been strongly associated with an increased risk of oral cancer.\n- Maté: Consumption of maté, a tea-like beverage habitually consumed by South Americans, has been associated with an increased risk of cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, and larynx.\n- Occupational exposure: Wood and nickel dust, formaldehyde, asbestos and synthetic fiber exposures have been associated with cancer of the larynx and sinuses, and some jobs in the construction, metal, textile, ceramic, logging, and food industries may have an increased risk of cancer of the larynx.\n- Radiation exposure: Radiation to the head and neck, for noncancerous conditions or cancer, is a risk factor for cancer of the salivary glands and thyroid.\n- Epstein-Barr virus infection: Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus is a risk factor for nasopharyngeal cancer.\n- Ancestry: Individuals from Southeast Asia are at higher risk for developing nasopharyngeal cancer.","Laryngeal Cancer Overview\nThis manual will examine the subject of laryngeal cancer, including the symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and what happens after treatment. The purpose of this guide is to educate you and to help you make informed decisions about your treatment.\nCleveland Clinic Head and Neck Institute caregivers work as a team to provide consistent, patient-centered care for patients who have laryngeal cancer.\nWhat is the larynx?\nThe larynx, or voice box, is located in the throat. The larynx helps us breathe, speak, and swallow. The vocal cords, which help us speak, are part of the larynx.\nThe larynx is made up mostly of cartilage, a flexible tissue that forms a framework of support. There are three parts to the larynx:\n- The supraglottis, or upper part.\n- The glottis, the middle part. This is where the vocal cords are located. The vocal cords open and close, and allow you to breathe and speak.\n- The subglottis, the lower part.\nThe larynx plays a role in several functions:\n- When you breathe, the vocal cords open to allow air to pass through.\n- When you speak, the vocal cords close. The air that passes through the vocal cords makes them vibrate, which helps create the sound of speech.\n- When you swallow, the epiglottis (which is part of the supraglottis) drops down over the larynx and the vocal cords close tight to keep food out of the lungs. (Food goes down the esophagus to the stomach.)\nWhat is laryngeal cancer?\nCancer is an uncontrollable growth of cells that invade and cause damage to the body. In laryngeal cancer, malignant (cancerous) cells form in the larynx. Most laryngeal cancers occur in the squamous cells, which line the inside of the larynx.\nAbout 60% of laryngeal cancers start in the glottis, 35% in the supraglottis, and the rest in the subglottis.\nLaryngeal cancer is one of a group of head and neck cancers. In the United States, approximately 13,000 people a year are diagnosed with laryngeal cancer, and about 3,700 die from the disease every year.\nWhat factors increase the risk of laryngeal cancer?\nA person has a much greater risk of developing laryngeal cancer if he or she smokes or uses other tobacco products. Drinking alcohol, especially in large amounts, also can increase the risk of developing laryngeal cancer. In fact, using tobacco and alcohol together increases the risk of cancer even more.\nOther risk factors include:\n- Age: Laryngeal cancer occurs most often in people over the age of 55.\n- Gender: Men are more likely to develop cancer of the larynx.\n- A personal history of head and neck cancer: Nearly one in four people who have had head and neck cancer will get it again.\n- Occupation: Workers who are exposed to sulfuric acid mist, wood dust, nickel, or the manufacturing of mustard gas have a greater risk of laryngeal cancer. In addition, machinists and people who work with asbestos are at greater risk.\nWhat are the symptoms of laryngeal cancer?\nSome of the following may be symptoms of laryngeal cancer, or they could be symptoms of other conditions:\n- A sore throat or cough that does not go away\n- A change in your voice, such as hoarseness, that does not get better after two weeks\n- Any pain or other trouble when you swallow\n- Ear pain\n- A lump in the neck or throat\n- Dysphonia (problems producing voice sounds)\nIf you have any of the following symptoms, see your doctor right away:\n- Dyspnea (trouble breathing)\n- Stridor (breathing that is high-pitched and noisy)\n- Globus sensation (a feeling like there is something in the throat)\n- Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)\nHow is laryngeal cancer diagnosed?\nThese tests and procedures may be used to help diagnose laryngeal cancer:\n- Physical exam: A physician will examine the throat and neck.\n- Laryngoscopy: The doctor examines the larynx with a mirror or a thin, lighted tube called a flexible endoscope.\n- Biopsy: The doctor removes a small piece of the larynx so that it can be examined under a microscope.\n- CT or CAT scan (also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography): Computed tomography uses X-rays and computers to produce images of a cross-section of the body.\n- MRI (also called magnetic resonance imaging): Magnetic resonance imaging uses a large magnet, radio waves, and a computer to produce clear pictures, or images, of the human body.\n- PET scan: A very small dose of a radioactive chemical, called a radiotracer, is injected into a vein in the arm. The tracer travels through the body and is absorbed by the organs and tissues being studied. A machine called a PET scanner creates three- dimensional pictures from the energy given off by the tracer substance.\nWhat are the stages of laryngeal cancer?\nA system known as staging is used to describe how far a tumor has grown, and what parts of the body it has invaded (spread to).\nFor instance, in laryngeal cancer, the stage will depend on the part of the larynx that is affected, and whether the cancer has invaded other parts of the body, such as the thyroid, esophagus, tongue, lungs, liver, and bones.\nCancer that begins in the larynx can spread to other parts of the body through the blood- stream or the lymph nodes. Lymph is a clear or slightly yellowish watery fluid that removes bacteria and certain kinds of proteins from tis- sues. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures located throughout the body. Clusters of nodes are found in the neck, armpits, abdomen, and groin. Other nodes are found in the chest, arms, and legs.\nThe stages of laryngeal cancer are grouped by “early” and “advanced” cancer:\n- In early laryngeal cancer (Stages 0, I, and II), the tumor is small and the cancer remains in the larynx.\n- In advanced laryngeal cancer (Stages III and IV), the tumor is larger and has affected the vocal cords, or has invaded the lymph nodes or other parts of the body.\nTHE HEALTHCARE TEAM\nAt Cleveland Clinic, laryngeal cancer is treated by a team of specialists, including:\n- Head and neck surgeons: Physicians who provide surgical care for patients with head and neck tumors.\n- Radiation oncologists: Physicians who use radiation therapy to treat cancer.\n- Medical oncologists: Physicians who evaluate and treat malignant (cancerous) tumors with medications.\n- Dentists: Dentists and oral surgeons offer a wide range of services, from dental cleaning exams and X-rays to advanced treatments for oral cancer.\n- Speech-language pathologists: Offer comprehensive evaluation and treatment for all speech, language, voice, cognitive (mental/intellectual), and swallowing disorders.\n- Registered dietitians: Help provide for the nutrition needs of patients, based on the patients’ nutritional status, condition, illness, or injury.\n- Social workers: Address concerns and informational needs of patients and families, and provide individual, family, and group counseling, referrals to local community and national organizations and support groups, and financial assistance information.\n- Primary care providers: This is usually an internist or family physician who oversees the patient’s medical care.\nHow is laryngeal cancer treated?\nLaryngeal cancer is treated with radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or surgery. Sometimes, it is treated with a combination of these methods.\nRadiation therapy delivers high energy x-rays to the tumor to kill cancer cells. By focusing the radiation on the cancer cells, the damage to normal structures can be minimized.\nChemotherapy is the use of medications to kill or to slow the growth of rapidly multiplying cancer cells. These medications are often given intravenously (through a needle into a blood vessel) and can have major side effects.\nSurgery for early laryngeal cancer is done to allow the patient to keep the major functions of the larynx, including speaking and swallowing. The goal is to take out the cancer without having to remove the entire larynx. In cases of advanced laryngeal cancer, a laryngectomy (complete removal of the larynx) is often performed."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f4e74af9-7087-44e3-9a3a-41f9080318da>","<urn:uuid:0df72444-8acf-47dd-81cd-c2b03f73e361>"],"error":null}

CP690 550 pretreatment totally abrogated the OSM-induced creation of IL-6 aswell as OSM-induced JAK/STAT and activation of mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs) in FLS. Conclusions These results claim that IL-6-type cytokines donate to rheumatoid synovitis through activation from the JAK/STAT pathway in rheumatoid synoviocytes. Inhibition of the pro-inflammatory signaling pathways by CP690 550 could possibly be important in the treating RA. Introduction Arthritis rheumatoid (RA) is normally a chronic inflammatory disease that’s seen as a the activation and proliferation of synovial tissue with linked degradation of articular cartilage . Synovial fibroblasts are thought to play a significant function ETP-46464 in rheumatoid synovitis through the creation of a number of inflammatory mediators . Activation of synovial fibroblasts is normally mediated in huge component by cytokines such as for example IL-1 or TNF-α that are made by monocytes/macrophages . Nevertheless other cytokines most likely participate in the procedure of synovial cell activation. From ETP-46464 the IL-6-related cytokines oncostatin M (OSM) is normally another item of macrophages and turned on T cells that’s raised in the synovial liquids of RA sufferers [4 5 Furthermore OSM stimulates chemokine and matrix metalloproteimase (MMPs) creation suggesting its essential results in synovial irritation . IL-6-type cytokines exert their results via the indication transducer gp130 resulting in the activation from the Janus kinase (JAK)/indication transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) cascade . In short the ligand-receptor connections elicits the set up of cytokine receptors receptor-associated JAKs which recruit and activate STAT protein. Phosphorylated STATs then dimerize translocate towards the immediate and nucleus transcription of the mark genes . Lately JAK inhibition provides been shown to truly have a prominent influence on autoimmune illnesses . CP690 550 can be an orally obtainable JAK antagonist that’s in advancement for the treating RA and various other autoimmune circumstances [10 11 Furthermore a recently available clinical trial showed that CP690 550 is normally efficacious in RA leading to speedy significant reductions in the signs or symptoms of RA [12 13 The function of oncostatin M in illnesses is normally less well described but recent research suggest that it could be involved with inflammatory cell recruitment and cartilage devastation in RA . In today’s study we utilized primary individual rheumatoid synoviocytes and showed the induction of multiple signaling cascades and a crucial role from the JAK/STAT pathway in the oncostatin M-mediated IL-6 synthesis. Furthermore we demonstrated that interference from the JAK/STAT pathway using CP690 550 a JAK kinase inhibitor totally abrogated the OSM-induced IL-6 creation in rheumatoid synoviocytes. Strategies and components Sufferers All RA sufferers fulfilled the American University of Rheumatology requirements for RA . Synovial tissue examples were extracted from seven sufferers with RA during synovectomy.

Learn to weigh those risks against the benefits of the treatment.\nIt’s understandable to feel uneasy about taking new medication. You may feel like you hear as much about risks from drugs as you do about benefits. Taking medication does involve risk – even for the “safest” of medicines and drugs that have been around for a long time. The goal is to get the most good while doing the least harm.\nWhen deciding whether to take a medication, don’t rely on the information you get from the news and in drug ads. It’s crucial to share your concerns with your doctor, who can talk about the likely benefits and potential risks specifically for you.\nHere, we help lay the groundwork for these discussions – and hopefully reduce some of your fears about side effects, too.\nWhy You're Worried\nHere are four common reasons you may be concerned, and some objective reassurances.\nThe risks aren’t clear. On the laundry list of side effects, common and less serious problems are lumped with rare and more serious ones. You may not know which on the list are likely to occur and you assume the worst. For example, with bisphosphonates – a medicine used to treat osteoporosis – osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical fractures of the femur are two rare side effects that have caused concerns.\nYou may be worried about those problems, but you don’t really know how likely they are to happen.\nKeep in mind: Sometimes the numbers aren’t available, but other times they may not be easy to understand. Have your doctor or pharmacist put the available data into context for you so it’s clear.\nThe numbers can fool you. How numbers are presented makes a difference in your perception of risk. For example, methotrexate, a mainstay disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and juvenile arthritis, is associated with a 3% risk of serious infection, meaning 3 in 100 people treated with the drug for a year get a serious infection. If a biologic drug, specifically a TNF-alpha inhibitor is added to methotrexate, the risk increases to 5% – meaning 5 in 100 people treated with both drugs get a serious infection.\nThis can be reported in terms of relative risk: “a 60% increase in the risk of a serious infection.” Or it can be reported as absolute risk: “An additional 2 in 100 people, or 2%, develop a serious infection.” The first example is more intimidating.\nKeep in mind: Just knowing there is a “significantly increased risk of infection,” doesn’t provide you the context you need. Understanding the numbers and talking you your doctor about your concerns may ease your fears. It may lead you to choose to increase your risk of infection because a more aggressive treatment approach could be key to shutting down pain and preventing joint deformity.\nThe drug seems worse than the disease. For many serious side effects, it’s unclear exactly what role the drug plays. Sometimes, the disease itself puts a person at risk for certain problems, with more severe disease equaling bigger risk. RA increases the risk of serious infection, including infections that require hospitalization, making it difficult to determine to what extent biologics may increase the risk.\nAge, other health problems and other medications can also increase the risk of certain side effects. Studies show that having diabetes, chronic lung disease or taking corticosteroids also worsens the risk of serious infection in people taking biologic agents.\nKeep in mind: While rare side effects can be blamed on drugs, doctors and researchers don’t know if there is really a causal association.\nNewer drugs list more risks. Over time, the Food and Drug Administration made changes to its drug safety program in an effort to better inform consumers about possible risks. Some of these changes were made possible by 2007 legislation authorizing more rigorous safety monitoring. As a result, newer drugs may have a longer list of side effects than older ones – but that doesn’t mean newer drugs are more risky.\nAs an example, a handful of people with RA have developed Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) while taking the biologic drug rituximab (Rituxan). The risk is estimated to be about 3 in 100,000. However, just as many people with lupus have developed PML and have never been on biologics – but have been treated with cyclophosphamide, a drug to treat kidney disease and other conditions.\nThe occurrence of PML with rituximab resulted in a black box warning due to the way serious side effects are now reported to the FDA. Cyclophosphamide, an older drug that predates the new safety reporting procedures, doesn’t carry the warning; even though it’s possible it also caused patients to develop PML.\nKeep in mind: Uncertainties surrounding side effects are the same, even though it may seem like newer drugs get associated with rare side effects more often because of how they are reported.\nTake Steps to Reduce Your Risks\nJust because a drug comes with certain risks doesn’t mean there’s nothing you can do about them. Many serious side effects can be reduced or prevented through smart strategies and a collaborative effort between you and your doctor.\nSimple lab tests and exams often can spot early signs of a problem so measures can be taken to avoid or minimize the problem.\nTest the liver. Because methotrexate can affect the liver, RA treatment guidelines recommend testing for liver problems before starting and regularly while using methotrexate. To reduce the risk of liver problems, also talk to your doctor about supplementing with folic acid.\nAssess bone loss. Osteoporosis is a major risk of long-term corticosteroid use. Guidelines recommend assessing total risk for bone loss (from all causes, including corticosteroids) and monitoring bone mineral density when corticosteroids are used for three months or longer.\nSee a dermatologist. People taking biologics should see a dermatologist at least yearly for a thorough exam because of an increased risk of skin cancer.\nBe vigilant about infections. To help reduce the risk of serious infections when taking immunosuppressive drugs, make sure you are up to date on all recommended vaccinations. Be vigilant about reporting anything more than the sniffles because early treatment of airway infections can help prevent a more serious problem requiring hospitalization.\nUnderstand safe doses. If you use pain medications, know what dose is safe for you and how to recognize acetaminophen as an ingredient.\nTalk Openly With Your Doctor\nEven the most informed patient worries about starting a new drug or continuing with a therapy that causes bothersome side effects. If you tell your doctor what worries you and why, he or she can begin to put what is important to you in context with what is important medically to create a treatment plan.\nIf, after an honest discussion with your doctor, you decide you no longer want to take prescription drugs for your condition, make sure to tell your doctor. Stopping suddenly can have its own side effects, and it’s important for you to make the decision fully informed about what the disease, untreated, can do to your body over the long-term.\nStay in the Know. Live in the Yes.\nGet involved with the arthritis community. Tell us a little about yourself and, based on your interests, you’ll receive emails packed with the latest information and resources to live your best life and connect with others."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2a53c2bc-c377-4f27-980d-d50a46daf138>","<urn:uuid:ea104b6f-cf4f-4875-bd5c-440e217b07ba>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do professional credentials and environmental labeling affect consumer trust in tax preparation and food products?","answer":"In tax preparation, the IRS Annual Filing Season Program provides a Record of Completion that demonstrates tax preparers' knowledge and compliance with professional standards, allowing them to be listed in the public directory of tax preparers. Similarly, in the food industry, research shows that consumers would benefit from carbon emission labeling on food products, as studies found that people significantly underestimate the environmental impact of different foods. For example, consumers don't realize that beef soup creates more than 10 times the amount of greenhouse gases than vegetable soup, and implementing clear labeling systems could help inform their purchasing decisions.","context":["The Annual Filing Season Program (AFSP) is a voluntary credential for tax professionals offered by the IRS. The AFSP is right for tax preparers who are not already enrolled agents, certified public accountants, or attorneys. IRS issues a Record of Completion to tax preparers completing 18 hours of tax education and meeting other requirements.\nWhat the Annual Filing Season Program Is\nThe AFSP is a voluntary credential for tax professionals offered by the IRS. Tax professionals who meet the requirements obtain a Record of Completion, are listed for one year in the public directory of tax preparers published by the IRS and can represent their clients (with limitations) before the IRS.\nHow the Annual Filing Season Program Works\nBoth first-time applicants and renewing tax preparers need to meet three requirements to participate in the AFSP and receive their Record of Completion. First, they take 15 or 18 hours of continuing education on federal tax topics. Second, they maintain an active preparer tax identification number (PTIN). Third, they agree to follow rules for professional conduct such as not giving false or misleading information to the IRS.\n1. Meet the Annual Filing Season Program Continuing Education Requirements\nInterested tax professionals will need to take 15 or 18 hours of continuing education from IRS-approved continuing education providers each year. Both first-time and renewing participants need to complete the six-hour Annual Federal Tax Refresher (AFTR) course, plus two hours of ethics, and 10 hours of other courses of your choice on federal tax topics.\nFind a Continuing Education Provider & Classes to Take\nVarious professional societies, companies, and colleges offer continuing education for the AFSP. Many continuing education courses are delivered online in a self-study format. You can browse a list of IRS-approved continuing education providers. The six-hour AFTR course is titled the same by all continuing education providers. Check the category your classes fall under, as you will need at least two hours of ethics courses. The remainder of your courses can be on any federal tax topic.\nRemember that Only ‘IRS Continuing Education’ Counts Toward the AFSP\nSome providers offer continuing professional education courses for certified public accountants, which are often labeled as “CPE,” as well as continuing education for the AFSP, often labeled as “CE.” Check what type of credits a course offers carefully as only courses that are approved for IRS continuing education will count towards the AFSP.\nKeep in Mind You Might Qualify for an AFTR Exemption\nSome tax preparers, such as those who have a state-issued credential from California, Oregon, and Maryland, do not need to take the six-hour AFTR course. Also, they need to complete 15 hours of continuing education instead of 18 hours.\n2. Obtain or Renew Your Preparer Tax Identification Number Annually\nTax professionals must obtain and annually renew a preparer tax identification number (PTIN). In fact, anyone who gets paid to prepare tax returns must have an active PTIN. Tax professionals obtain a PTIN for free directly from the IRS. PTINs must be renewed annually before filing tax returns for the new tax season.\n3. Agree to Comply With the AFSP IRS Professional Conduct Standards\nTo qualify for the AFSP, tax professionals must agree to follow certain rules of professional conduct such as being diligent to prepare accurate tax returns and avoiding deceptive advertising. The full list of standards for professional conduct are spelled out in two sections of Circular 230: Subpart B details duties and restrictions, and section 10.51 covers rules regarding incompetence and disreputable conduct.\nBy committing to these standards of professional conduct, you are protecting yourself, your reputation, and your clients from harm caused by unethical behavior. We spoke to Curt Lee, an accredited tax adviser, and business owner in Raleigh, North Carolina, who told us that tax preparers should not fear these rules. He said:\n“When you voluntarily enter into the Annual Filing Season Program, it does require higher demands. Circular 230 is another set of standards you have to hold yourself to, and some people don’t understand it. When they read 230, it scares them, and they become afraid of doing something wrong. Remember, the IRS already has rules in place [for due diligence and preparer penalties], 230 is just another level.”\n― Curt Lee, Owner, C B Lee & Company\nThe standards of professional conduct to which AFSP tax preparers agree include:\n- Be diligent in preparing accurate tax returns\n- Promptly complete tax projects\n- Avoid charging unconscionable fees\n- Cannot notarize tax returns they prepare\n- Return client’s records to the client\n- Avoid conflicts of interest\n- Avoid deceptive advertising\n- Not to ever deposit a client’s tax refund check in the preparer’s bank account\n- Follow best practices in preparing tax returns\n- Avoid signing tax returns that are false or unreasonable\n- Avoid giving false or misleading information to the IRS\n- Avoid encouraging their clients to violate federal tax laws\n- If a client hands you money for the purpose of paying the client’s taxes, pay that money promptly to the government and not steal the money\n- Avoid bribing or harassing or threatening any IRS employee\n- Must sign tax returns that you prepare\n- Avoid preparing tax returns if one does not have a valid PTIN\nWho the Annual Filing Season Program Is Right For\nAFSP is right for people who want to prepare tax returns professionally and want to receive a Record of Completion from the IRS. AFSP is appropriate for people who do not already have a professional credential such as enrolled agent, certified public accountant, or attorney. These professionals are already permitted to practice before the IRS and have already demonstrated a higher level of knowledge that is required for the AFSP.\nWhy the AFSP IRS Certification Is Beneficial\nThe AFSP benefits applicants in three ways. First, AFSP Record of Completion holders are included in the public directory of tax preparers published on IRS.gov. Second, the Record of Completion demonstrates that you voluntarily took continuing education on tax topics. Third, AFSP participants can represent clients whose tax returns they prepared when dealing with IRS audits, with IRS customer service representatives, or with the Taxpayer Advocate Service.\nTax preparers benefit from having the AFSP Record of Completion along with other professional credentials because credentials visibly demonstrate your knowledge to clients and potential clients. Additionally, we spoke with Eric Hansen, an accredited tax preparer and owner of Hansen Accounting, who said:\n“It’s always nice to have a third party who has put together a test, you pass the test, and you earn a professional credential that you can put on your business card and letterhead.”\n― Eric R. Hansen, Owner, Hansen Accounting\nAdditional details for the three benefits of AFSP certification include:\n- Listing in tax preparer directory: AFSP participants can choose to be listed in the public directory of tax preparers published on IRS.gov; potential clients can use this public directory find you and to verify your professional credential\n- Record of completion: Issued by the IRS Return Preparer Office, the Record of Completion is suitable for framing; you could also display it on your website\n- Client representation: AFSP participants can deal with the IRS on behalf of clients but only if they prepared the client’s tax return; the limited circumstances where AFSP participants can represent clients are when dealing with IRS customer service, with IRS auditors, or with the Taxpayer Advocate Service.\nAnnual Filing Season Program Costs\nThe only costs for AFSP are for taking continuing education (CE) courses. Each CE provider determines fees for their courses. TheTaxBook.com, for example, offers a bundle of 20 hours of continuing education in a self-study format for $169. Fast Forward Academy, another self-study provider, charges $99 for the 18 hours of continuing education needed for the AFSP. The IRS does not charge any fee for participating in AFSP or for the PTIN.\nTax preparers can obtain their 18 hours of continuing education for free by taking classes from and volunteering for the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) programs operated by the IRS.\nHow to Get an AFSP IRS Record of Completion\nThere is a three-step process for getting an AFSP IRS Record of Completion. First, the IRS will send you an e-mail about a week or two after you have completed the required continuing education courses. You then log into the IRS PTIN system, consent to the Circular 230 standards of professional conduct. About 24 hours after consenting, check your mailbox on the PTIN system for your Record of Completion, which can be downloaded or printed.\nIf you have not received your Record of Completion, the first thing you should do is check if all your continuing education credits have been posted to the PTIN system. If any of your tax courses have not been posted, you should contact the continuing education provider to make sure you get credit for the classes you took.\nPros & Cons of the Annual Filing Season Program\nBefore taking investing time and effort, tax preparers should carefully evaluate whether the advantages and disadvantages of participating in the AFSP. The pros of the IRS AFSP include limited representation rights, inclusion in the public directory of tax return preparers, and recognition of your professional knowledge. Cons of the IRS AFSP include the not having full representation rights, the cost of continuing education, and the higher scrutiny that comes with the standards of professional conduct.\nPros of the Annual Filing Season Program\nBenefits of the IRS AFSP include:\n- Limited representation rights: You can talk to the IRS to resolve audits on tax returns you prepared and signed. Without an AFSP Record of Completion, you won’t be able to talk to the IRS to resolve audits or customer service issues relating to tax returns you prepared.\n- Inclusion in the directory of tax return preparers: The IRS’s public database of tax preparers is searchable. Potential clients can search the directory to verify your professional credential.\n- Recognition of your professional knowledge: AFSP participants receive a Record of Completion, which can be displayed in your office or on your website.\nCons of the Annual Filing Season Program\nDisadvantages of the IRS AFSP include:\n- You don’t have full representation rights: AFSP participants can represent clients only if they prepared and signed the tax return. If you want to represent clients whose tax returns you did not prepare, then the better option is to become an enrolled agent, CPA, or attorney.\n- Cost of continuing education: While continuing education isn’t expensive, the costs and time commitment can still add up. Expect to spend under $200 and about 18 hours each year to meet your continuing education requirements.\n- Potential fines and disciplinary action: AFSP applicants can be fined or disciplined for violating the standards of professional conduct. Fines can be as much as 100% of the income you earned by violating the standards. IRS can also suspend your credential temporarily or permanently disbar you from preparing tax returns.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About the Annual Filing Season Program\nThis article covers the major aspects of the AFSP. Below we highlight some of the more common questions preparers ask about the AFSP IRS program.\nHow Do I Tell the IRS That I’m Applying for the AFSP?\nYou don’t. The IRS will reach out to you. After you complete the required continuing education and renew your PTIN, the IRS will send you an e-mail if you are eligible for the AFSP Record of Completion. That e-mail will contain instructions for how to log back into your PTIN account and complete the steps necessary for the Record of Completion.\nCan an Unenrolled Tax Return Preparer Participate in the Annual Filing Season Program?\nThe AFSP is specifically designed for unenrolled tax return preparers to demonstrate their tax knowledge and professional ethics. An unenrolled tax return preparer is any person who is not already enrolled to practice before the IRS, which includes enrolled agents, certified public accountants, attorneys, enrolled retirement plan agents, and enrolled actuaries.\nWhat Is an Exempt Tax Preparer?\nThe AFTR course is not required for AFSP applicants who meet exemption requirements. Exemptions include passing part one of the Special Enrollment Examination or being registered as a tax preparer with the states of California, Maryland, or Oregon. Exempt tax preparers need 15 hours of continuing education instead of 18 hours.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe AFSP is a voluntary professional credential issued by the IRS to tax professionals who demonstrate competency in federal tax by completing continuing education requirements. AFSP participants agree to hold themselves to the same high standards of professional conduct as enrolled agents and certified public accountants.","Global trade gives consumers access to endless tastes and flavors from around the world and a boundless supply of meats and poultry at their local grocery store. But do consumers understand the real price of global consumption? And if they did, would they change their buying patterns? The manufacturing processes involved in food production are often complex with any given product seeing many stages before it makes its way to our grocery store shelves.\nResearchers from the University of Technology Sydney and Duke University claim in their study published in Nature Climate Change that shoppers are largely unaware of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the food they purchase.\nIt’s easy for us to satisfy our hunger through cooking technologies like microwaves, ovens, and toasters or even though delivery. While these technologies heighten short-term convenience for us, they can have long-term negative effects on the environment.\nThe study finds that if food retailers label their products indicating the amount of carbon emissions each food item generates, consumers would be willing to purchase meals and ingredients that are more environmentally friendly.\nAccording to the study, the proportion of greenhouse gas emissions that can be attributed to food production and consuming habits is between 19 to 29 percent globally. This estimate includes all steps in the entire supply chain of a product such as fertilizing, farming, processing, exporting goods through transportation, household management, and waste.\nFurthermore, the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security institution (CCAFS) states that livestock contributes to 14.5 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions globally. This makes the animal agriculture industry the largest contributor to emissions out of all food supply chains.\nBeef and dairy cattle create the most damaging greenhouse gasses, resulting in 65 percent of the total 14.5 percent of emissions generated from livestock, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization. This is due to cattle being fed grain which is produced using fossil fuels. Another issue is the methane that cows produce in their digestive system which is released from their manure and further contributes to the accumulation of greenhouse gasses.\nFurthermore, another food report called “Options for keeping the food system within environmental limits” also published by Nature claims that animal food processing makes up 72 to 78 percent of total agricultural emissions.\n“Beef is more than 100 times as emissions-intensive as legumes,” said Marco Springmann from the University of Oxford, a co-author of the report.\n“In today’s agricultural system, we grow plants to feed animals, which require all of those resources and inputs: land, water, fossil fuels, pesticides, herbicides and fertilizer to grow,” said Sharon Palmer, a registered dietitian nutritionist and plant-based food and sustainability expert. “And then we feed plants to animals and care for them over their lifetime, while they produce methane and manure.”\nThe University of Technology Sydney, and Duke University study further tested the knowledge of more than 1,000 consumers on 19 different food items and 18 different electrical food appliances. They asked consumers what level of carbon emissions each product was responsible for producing, and found that participants’ highly underestimated how much the two categories contributed to global warming.\n“If you ask people to guess the difference between items such as beef and vegetable soup on the environment, they assume there is not much difference, but beef soup creates more than 10 times the amount of greenhouse gases than vegetable soup,” said Dr. Adrian Camilleri, lead author on the report.\nCamilleri explains that consumers are often unaware of how the production of certain food items is causing negative effects on global warming, creating confusion with consumers as to what steps they should take in order to help create a more sustainable environment.\n“This is a bit of a blind spot because if someone wants to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, they might think to turn off the heater, drive less or fly less,” said Camilleri. “Very few people think to eat less beef.”\nThe university study further indicates that food retailers or manufacturers could create a mandate to implement logos on food items modeled after the EnerGuide labeling used on mechanical equipment.\nThe purpose of this would be to measure the carbon footprint the food item generates, and expose that carbon footprint to consumers, giving shoppers better insight and opportunity to eat food products with less detrimental effects on the environment.\nIn testing an example of these labels on 120 participants, the researchers found the results were positive. According to the study, more consumers bought vegetable soup as opposed to beef when the carbon footprint labeling was included on the packaging.\nIn order to limit climate change in 2019, studies are showing that consumers can help by substituting some of their meat protein with a diet that contains plant and nut-based alternatives as well as buying food produced locally.\n“Research consistently shows that drastically reducing animal food intake and mostly eating plant foods is one of the most powerful things you can do to reduce your impact on the planet over your lifetime, in terms of energy required, land used, greenhouse gas emissions, water use and pollutants produced,” Springmann states.\nAlthough completely cutting out meats is not an ideal option for everyone, food experts are saying that a flexitarian diet makes for a healthy alternative that has less of a drastic impact on your body. Opting for animal protein that results in fewer carbon emissions, like eggs, fish, and poultry, followed by an abundant amount of fruits, vegetables and plant-based protein, could be a feasible alternative. According to Springmann, this option “is the least stringent that is both healthy and would reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough for us to stay within environmental limits.”\nSpringmann’s environmental food study further states, daily consumption of processed food and red meats could result to negative environmental effects increasing by 50 to 90 percent in the food industry by the year 2050. With plant-based protein being a prominent food trend, it could be possible for consumers to help prevent climate change by choosing products which create fewer carbon emissions."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:59a03bef-84a2-4337-b6fc-7dbe60f2ddba>","<urn:uuid:d8718ba1-dba2-45c7-8348-0c8ad4dfa024>"],"error":null}

The company is owned by the Kirk Kristiansen family who founded it in 1932.\nThe LEGO Group is engaged in the development of children's creativity through playing and learning. Based on the world-famous LEGO® brick, the company today provides play materials, experiences and learning materials for children in more than 130 countries.\nOur head office is in Billund, Denmark, but we have subsidiaries and branches throughout the world, and LEGO products are sold in more than 130 countries.\nCommunications Manager, Morten Vestberg – morten.vestberg@LEGO.com","Today, the LEGO Group announces a significant investment of DKK 1 billion dedicated to research, development and implementation of new, sustainable, raw materials to manufacture LEGO® elements as well as packaging materials.\nJørgen Vig Knudstorp, CEO and President of the LEGO Group, says:\n“This is a major step for the LEGO Group on our way towards achieving our 2030 ambition on sustainable materials. We have already taken important steps to reduce our carbon footprint and leave a positive impact on the planet by reducing the packaging size, by introducing FSC certified packaging and through our investment in an offshore wind farm. Now we are accelerating our focus on materials.”\nThe investment will result in the establishment of the LEGO Sustainable Materials Centre. The centre will be based at the LEGO Group’s headquarters in Billund, Denmark, and include all current functions and employees working to find alternative materials. In addition, the LEGO Group expects to recruit more than 100 specialists within the materials field during the coming years to work on this challenging ambition.\nThe LEGO Sustainable Materials Centre organisation will be established during 2015 and 2016, and it is expected that it will include satellite functions located in relevant locations around the globe. In addition, the centre will collaborate and develop partnerships with relevant external stakeholders and experts.\nLEGO Group owner Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen comments on the announcement:\n“Our mission is to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow. We believe that our main contribution to this is through the creative play experiences we provide to children. The investment announced is a testament to our continued ambition to leave a positive impact on the planet, which future generations will inherit. It is certainly in line with the mission of the LEGO Group and in line with the motto of my grandfather and founder of the LEGO Group, Ole Kirk Kristiansen: Only the best is good enough”.\nSignificant resources required\nThe decision to significantly boost the search for sustainable materials was taken at the recent General Assembly of the LEGO Group in May 2015.\nIn 2012, the LEGO Group first shared its ambition to find and implement sustainable alternatives to the current raw materials used to manufacture LEGO products by 2030. The ambition is part of the LEGO Group’s work to reduce its environmental footprint and leave a positive impact on the planet our children will inherit. As an example, in 2014 more than 60 billion LEGO elements were made – and finding alternatives to the materials used to make these bricks would significantly reduce the LEGO Group’s impact on the planet.\n“The testing and research we have already done has given us greater visibility of the challenges we face to succeed on this agenda and we respond by adding significant resources in order to be ready to move into the next phase of finding and implementing the sustainable materials. I am truly excited by the full commitment of the Board of Directors and our owner family to significantly boost the work to ensure a lasting positive impact,” says Jørgen Vig Knudstorp.\nWhen the LEGO Group is ready to introduce new materials it is vital that it does not compromise the quality or safety standards set by the LEGO Group and expected by parents. Consequently, the LEGO Group will continue to seek extensive research and robust data to ensure that all aspects of safety and quality are considered.\n“This is paramount to us as it enables us to provide children with a unique play experience that inspires and develops them and enables them to build a better tomorrow. This is ultimately the reason for our continued efforts to always do better,” says Jørgen Vig Knudstorp.\nCollaborating to find alternatives\nThe LEGO Group will not be able to solve the task of finding and implementing new materials alone. In recent years, the Group has collaborated with companies and experts on the task and these relationships will continue with existing as well as new partners with expertise in the field.\nAn example is the Climate Savers partnership between the LEGO Group and WWF signed in 2013, which has targets on developing a sustainable materials strategy. A new collaboration with WWF was agreed in spring 2015 and focuses on better assessing the overall sustainability and environmental impact of new bio-based materials for LEGO elements and packaging.\n“There is no common definition of a sustainable material. Several factors influence the environmental sustainability of a material – the composition of the material, how it is sourced and what happens when the product reaches the end of its life. When we search for new materials all of these factors must be considered,” says Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, adding:\n“What we announce today is a long-term investment and a dedication to ensuring the continued research and development of new materials that will enable us to continue to deliver great, high quality creative play experiences in the future, while caring for the environment and future generations. It is a daunting and exciting challenge.”\nAbout the LEGO Sustainable Materials Centre\n• The LEGO Group dedicates 1 billion DKK and sets up LEGO Sustainable Materials Centre to find and implement new sustainable alternatives to current raw materials.\n• More than 100 employees are expected to be recruited predominantly in the LEGO Group headquarters in Billund Denmark, to work on the task in the coming years.\n• The structure and organisation of the LEGO Sustainable Materials Centre will be developed during 2015 and 2016.\n• The LEGO Group will continuously report on the progress and learnings gained towards the 2030 ambition.\nWhat is a sustainable material?\nThere is no common definition of a sustainable material. Several aspects influence the sustainability of a material. It is to a high degree determined by its source, chemical composition, its use (in a product) and management (at end-of-life), and the impact it can have in both environmental and social areas.\nThe LEGO Group believes a new sustainable material must have an ever-lighter footprint than the material it replaces across key environmental and social impact areas such as fossil resource use, human rights and climate change.\nFor further information:\nLEGO Group Press Officer\nPhone: +45 7950 4348"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:416d315c-841e-4fa5-ba06-195f3498052c>","<urn:uuid:cd45024a-e08d-4c39-8f61-bee4442e2ff8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are two ways to avoid antivirus false positives?","answer":"There are two ways to avoid false positives: 1) downloading only known and trustworthy software and files that are typically included in antivirus whitelists, and 2) reducing the sensitivity of heuristic analyses in the antivirus configuration, though this should be used with caution as it may miss unknown threats.","context":["What is a false positive in an antivirus\nAs its name suggests, the false positive appears when an antivirus has considered that a legitimate and reliable file is a threat. And thus you have blocked, quarantined or deleted it.\nAll antiviruses are prone to generating more or less false positives, although it depends largely on the quality of its programming and on the heuristic-based scan engines. Some antivirus, such as Windows Defender, Avira or Kaspersky usually offer users very few false positives by having less strict heuristics, while Avast, AVG, Trend Micro or Panda generate a worrying number of false positives, according to the latest AV-Comparatives tests, for being much stricter.\nIt is not bad that an antivirus detects a false positive, just as it is not good that it does not detect them. The security company should adjust the heuristics of its security programs so that it is strict enough to keep hidden threats out, but not so strict as to bore the user with fake threat alerts.\nCauses that generate them\nThere’s a lot causes of false positives. The most commons are:\n- The use of compilers, compressors and packers commonly used by hackers. These packagers are used by developers to protect their software, but they are also used by hackers. For this reason, it is common for antivirus to detect executables that have used this type of tool as possible threats.\n- Installers with advertising or sponsored programs can also be detected by security programs as fake adware or PUPs.\n- Programs that make changes to the system. As viruses usually modify system files (especially DLL libraries), if a program tries to modify them, even if it is reliable, it will be detected by heuristic systems for having a suspicious behavior and, therefore, reported as a false positive.\n- The use of very strict heuristics. Antiviruses usually have several levels of heuristics. The more permissive, the less likely it is to detect a threat that is trying to sneak into the PC, although the stricter we configure it, the more false positives we will get.\n- The hacking tools They tend to always set off antivirus alarms, even if they are reliable programs that we are running. The reason is simple: the security program does not know if we are executing them, or if they are part of a computer attack. And, when in doubt, better to block.\n- Activators, key generators and pirated software usually. This type of content very often has hidden threats. And either because it makes changes to system files, because it has been packaged using tools common to hackers, or because it actually hides malware, it almost always sets off security software alarms.\nWhat are the dangers of a false positive?\nAlthough normally a false positive protects us against a possible threat when the antivirus is not sure that it is something really reliable. However, sometimes these false positives can also be a problem for our computer.\nThe first thing to keep in mind is that, if an antivirus detects a possible threat in a file, we should not unlock it unless we are 100% sure that it is a reliable file. It may happen that we have downloaded a game or program from the Internet, illegally, and that our software has detected it as a threat. As much as they advise us to allow it, it is better not to do so, since we do not know if the pirate is trying to deceive us.\nIn addition to that, what can happen is that our security program detects programs that are trustworthy as possible threats, either because of their inner workings or because there is some conflict with digital signature of the program that sets off the alarms of the heuristic systems. It has already happened in some cases with programs such as Ccleaner, IObit or uTorrent, which have been marked by some antivirus as threats.\nEven in the worst case, it may happen that a fault in the engine is detected DLL files or executable programs or Windows itself as suspicious. This has already happened on occasion, and the consequences are catastrophic, having, in the worst case, even reinstalling Windows from scratch. Fortunately, this type of problem is not very common.\nHow to deal with them\nIf our security program has blocked a file that we have downloaded from the Internet, an executable or a DLL library, the first thing we must do is ask ourselves, is it really reliable? If we’ve downloaded it from the developers’ website, or from their official GitHub repository, probably yes. Even so, before unlocking it, we must make sure 100% that it is indeed legit.\nWe can also resort to the use of second antivirus to have a second opinion about the security of the file. For example, we can send the file to be analyzed to VirusTotal to check, with more than 50 antivirus at the same time, if a file is really reliable. If several antiviruses detect the threat, it is that something is hidden.\nHow to avoid false positives\nThere are only two ways to avoid these false alert messages. The first of these is by making sure that we always download known and trustworthy software and files. The most common programs are usually always included in a white list by the antivirus so that the alarms do not go off with them.\nAnd the second way is to reduce the sensitivity of heuristic analyzes. In the configuration of some of these programs (not all) we can find the possibility of reducing this sensitivity. The lower the sensitivity, the less false positives we will have, although, in return, we may be missing possible unknown threats. This setting must be used with great caution."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e8fdcdad-913a-43a8-8d6f-f693e0c902dd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which Japanese artists received arts education in Tokyo: Hiroshi Sugito or Tetsuji?","answer":"Hiroshi Sugito has a connection to Tokyo education as he is currently Associate Professor at Tokyo University of the Arts. Tetsuji, on the other hand, received his education at Nagoya University of Arts, Department of Design, with no mention of formal education in Tokyo.","context":["Atsushi Fukui was born in 1966 in Aichi prefecture. In 1989, he completed his B.A. in oil painting at Tokyo University of the Arts. He is currently based in Yamanashi prefecture.\nHis major solo exhibitions include “air” (2016, yu-un, Tokyo) and “Council of Backpacking” (2015, ROPPONGI HILLS A/D GALLERY, Tokyo). His first show at Tomio Koyama Gallery was the group exhibition “morning glory” curated by Yoshitomo Nara (Tokyo, Japan, 2002). Thereafter, he held 6 solo exhibitions at Tomio Koyama Gallery.\nFukui’s major group exhibitions include “TAKAHASHI COLLECTION Mindfulness!” (2013, Kirishima Open-Air Museum, Kagoshima, Japan [touring Sapporo Art Museum, Hokkaido, Japan]) “ORANGE SKY” (2011, RH Gallery, New York), “Punkt Art 2011 David Sylvian-in cooperation with Atsushi Fukui uncommon deities” (2011, Sorlandets Kunstmuseum, Kristiansand, Norway), “convolvulus: Atsushi Fukui / Hideaki Kawashima” (2009, Michael Ku Gallery, Taipei), “The Masked Portrait” (2008, Marianne Boesky Gallery, New York), “ROPPONGI CROSSING” (2004, Mori Art Museum, Tokyo). His works have been included in the public collections of The Olbricht Collection (Germany), The JAPIGOZZI Collection (US/ Switzerland), The Takahashi Collection (Japan) and The Japan Foundation (Japan).\nYuka Kashihara uses oil paint applied in a thinly diffuse manner similar to that of Japanese nihonga painting, and by applying it in numerous layers she is able to create a unique depth of color. Within the world of her artworks, scenes from both reality and the spaces of the internal imagination are gently interwoven. Against this backdrop, having left Japan and moved to Germany where she continued developing her practice, Kashihara acquired an interest in the ‘distance’ between the internal and the external. This included the physical distance between Japan and Germany; and further, the distance herself as a Japanese person and herself while in Germany. This becomes expressed symbolically as an introspective speculation in the forms of the motifs of caves, holes, mountains and lakes which she repeatedly takes up within her work, and through this process of sublimation it is as though the original energies which lie dormant within the great Earth have become awakened.\nYuka Kashihara was born in 1980 in Hiroshima Prefecture. In 2006 she graduated from the Japanese Painting Department of Musashino Art University. In the same year she moved to Germany, and in 2013 she acquired a Diploma from the Academy of Visual Arts in Leipzig. In 2015, she was named a Meisterschüler (Masters graduate) of the same academy, studying under Professor Annette Schröter. In 2008 she exhibited at the Bauhuas Dessau Foundation in Shakkei (“borrowed scenery”), a solo show curated by research scholar Torsten Blume of the same Foundation, and in 2012 she exhibited in VOCA, Tokyo, where she received both the Honourable Mention Award and the Ohara Museum of Art Award.\n1980 Born in Hiroshima, Japan\n2006 B.F.A in Japanese Painting, Musashino Art University, Tokyo\n2012 Stayed in Germany under POLA Art Foundation Grants Program\n2013 Completed Diploma in Academy of Visual Arts Leipzig, Germany\nA part-time lecturer of Musashino Art University, Department of Japanese Painting, Tokyo (-2017)\n2015 Completed Meisterschüler in Academy of Visual Arts Leipzig, Germany (under Prof. Annette Schroeter)\nLives and works in Germany\nKim Chong Hak was born in Sinuiju in 1937.

She graduated from Oil Painting Course, School of Art, Nagoya University of Arts in 2008, and studied at Ecole nationale des beaux arts de Dijion, France as an exchange student. She received M.F.A from Graduate School of Tokyo Zokei University in 2010. She studied in Paris as a recipient of the POLA Art Foundation award for overseas research in 2017.\nA closet packed full of colorful dresses, an array of high-heeled shoes on shelves, vividly colored flowers: Midori Sato shows us things that every one yearns to see. Yet if we turn our attention to the details of her work, bold brushstrokes and an intentionally uneven paint coating tinge her subject matter with the contours of abstraction. This abstraction demonstrates the force of the power that draws the viewer into the picture plane.\nHer major solo exhibitions include “Floating Drapery” (Tomio Koyama Gallery, Tokyo, 2022), “Diaphanous petals” (The Pola Art Museum, Atrium Gallery, Kanagawa, 2019), “Bouquet” (8/ ART GALLERY/ Tomio Koyama Gallery, Tokyo, 2019), “Orange Glow” (Green Art Flowers Gallery, Paris, France, 2018) and “Reflections” (Roppongi Hills A/D Gallery, Tokyo, 2017).

In 1968 he graduated from the Department of Painting at Tama Art University, and served as a central member of the art movement Mono-ha that took place from the late 1960s to the 1970s. For over 50 years since, Suga has continued to pursue a consistent philosophy and actively develop his artistic practice, paving his own unique path as one of the leading figures of Postwar Japanese art in our times. Even in recent years when the reevaluation of Mono-ha has been gaining much international recognition, he persists in further deepening his contemplation, with his unfaltering passion and enthusiasm for his practice serving to define the presentness of his work.\nSince his first solo exhibition in 1968, Suga has presented work on over 400 occasions in numerous exhibitions both within Japan and abroad. Recent years in particular have seen remarkable developments and achievements in his career. In 2016 he held solo exhibitions at Pirelli Foundation’s HangarBiocca in Milan and Dia: Chelsea New York, in addition to a two-person exhibition with Karla Black at The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh. He was selected for the 57th Venice Biennale, “VIVA ARTE VIVA” in 2017, receiving high acclaim for Law of Situation in which he recreated of one of his early representative works in the form of an installation floating on water. In that same year Suga participated in the group exhibition “Japanorama: New Vision of JAPAN from 1970,”curated by Yuko Hasegawa that was held at the Centre Pompidou-Metz in France.\nSuga’s works are also housed in numerous prominent museums throughout the world including the Centre Pompidou, Dia: Chelsea, the Tate Modern, Dallas Museum of Art, M+, The Museum of Modern Art, New York, Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo.\nHiroshi Sugito was born in 1970 in Aichi prefecture, Japan.

His work is included in numerous public collections including those of MoMa, the Museu de Arte Moderna de Sao Paulo, the Pinacoteca do Estado de Sao Paulo, and the Museu de Arte Comtemporania da Universidade de Sao Paulo.","Tetsuji was born in Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Prefecture in 1968. After graduating from Nagoya University of Arts, Department of Design, he worked as a graphic designer. While he was attending university, he took a year off and traveled to Kenya as the 30th generation student of Kenya Swahili Language School of Japan-Africa Cultural Exchange Association. After graduation, he traveled to five countries including Zimbabwe. After returning to Japan, he started making paper-mosaic images based on his travel experience and pursued to become an artist after he won the 2007 Cannes International Exhibition. An unparalleled unique method has been described as a “paper quilt” in the Netherlands and has been exhibited both domestically and internationally through solo and group exhibitions.\nUniversal rhythm. The color that is there now. (Artist statement)\n“It will take about two more hours for those black clouds to get here.” In Africa, Tetsuji was at the eaves to get out of torrential rain, and he had a small conversation with an elderly man under the same eaves. At that moment he made up his mind to become an artist to express Africa, an absolute foreign country, using colored cutout papers. The sun rises and goes down every single day. It is a rhythm that has not changed since ancient times. The fundamental questions for all living creatures could be reasoned by using the five senses and sixth intuition, which are called instinct. There is no calculation or reason. Like people have a different understating toward one piece of poetry, all the creatures feel and understand the act of living itself differently. Here is the concept of his artwork which is “his artwork needs to be completed with a picture and a poem”.\nWhat Tetsuji is trying to express in his artwork is “ to live”.In the summer of 1990, he flew to Africa saying just this one word “I want to see the lion.” He wanted to see their lively eyes, not the tired eyes in the zoo. He learned the language, walked alone, and traveled with all his senses. The fact that during the stay he found “the color that is there now” and “he had lived in Africa” led him to use the colored paper to express the life of Africa. Of course, it is not only Africa that has life. Life is everywhere and plays the rhythm. Africa is just the starting point for Tetsuji.\n“To live” is sometimes strong and sometimes fragile. Someday the youth is gone. However, another beauty is born there. The same is true for paper. Letters and pictures written on the papers that were made hundreds of years ago are attractive because the time has given them depth and they have been able to remind you of the past. However the color of works changes over time, it means that it gets older with viewers. Being old means creating a story. Tetsuji compares a story to a journey and both a creator and viewers share the thoughts hidden in poetry.

{"question":"How does matter exist in different states according to the curriculum standards, and what essential laboratory protocols ensure safe handling of materials in these states?","answer":"According to the curriculum standards, matter exists in three states (solid, liquid, and gas), each with distinct physical properties. The states depend on molecular arrangement and motion - molecules in solids are tightly packed with restricted movement, molecules in liquids are loosely packed and move easily, and molecules in gases are far apart and move freely. When handling materials in these states in the laboratory, safety protocols require: using ventilation hoods for vapors, proper cleanup of spills and broken glass, appropriate storage of chemicals within hoods, cleaning work areas thoroughly after use, and caution when using Bunsen burners. Additionally, protective clothing must be worn and contact lenses should not be worn as they may absorb vapors.","context":["Put the VT to work in your classroom\nThe Mighty Elements\nLesson Question:How can students use the Visual Thesaurus to investigate chemical elements and their properties?\nLesson Overview:This lesson introduces students to the Periodic Table and to the Visual Thesaurus as reference tools they can use to learn more about the elements and their properties. Groups of students will investigate a small group of elements, determine their common traits, and create original trading cards to represent these elements and their unique properties.\nLength of Lesson:One hour to one hour and a half\nInstructional Objectives:Students will:\n- learn the relationship between matter and the elements\n- share their associations with different elements\n- understand the purpose of the Periodic Table of Elements and its patterns of organization\n- investigate the properties of particular elements\n- synthesize their knowledge of the elements by creating and sharing element trading cards\n- white board\n- computers with Internet access\n- \"Elements to Investigate\" sheet [click here to download]\n- small index cards\n- colored pencils or markers (enough for each group to use a set)\nRecognizing and defining different chemical elements:\n- Distribute the \"Elements to Investigate\" sheet [click here to download] and give students a few minutes to read through the element names on the sheet, placing small checks next to those elements whose names they recognize. Ask students to write a brief list in their notebooks where they may have encountered those familiar elements in their lives.\n- In a large group discussion, elicit students' notebook entries and list the elements that they recognize on the board, along with examples of where they may have encountered them.\n- Establish that although they may only recognize some of these elements (e.g., the oxygen we breathe, the gold and silver jewelry that we wear, the chlorine we use to cleanse pool water, etc.), they encounter many more of the elements than they are aware of.\n- Explain to students that all matter is composed of elements—either single elements or combinations of elements called compounds.\n- Display the VT word map for element on the white board and point out the definition that extends to \"chemical element\"—\"substances that cannot be separated into simpler substances.\" And by clicking on this meaning, you can display all the different chemical elements contained in the VT.\n- Click on a particular element in the array of elements to demonstrate how each element is defined. For example, the element silicon is \"used as a semiconductor in transistors\" and is associated with the atomic number 14 and the symbol \"Si.\" Inform students that every time they use a computer, they are taking advantage of the properties of silicon since computer chips are made of this element.\nIntroducing the Periodic Table of Elements:\n- Display a Periodic Table on the white board and have students try to find \"silicon\" on the table by looking for its atomic number 14 or for its symbol \"Si.\" (A great online periodic table can be found at www.chemicool.com or at www.periodictable.com.) Students should recognize that the elements on the Periodic Table are arranged by atomic number.\n- Explain that the Periodic Table of Elements arranges all the elements that have been identified in a pattern that groups elements with similar properties in the same area of the chart.\n- Inform students that they will be using the VT and the Periodic Table to help them investigate some of the more well-known elements, to research their extraordinary properties, and to then personify them as \"element super heroes\" on trading cards.\n- Organize the class into eight small groups (Groups A through H) and assign each group its own set of five elements to investigate --see \"Elements to Investigate\" sheet [click here to download]\n- Inform groups that their first task is to figure out what their set of five elements has in common. Groups should look each element up on the VT (or on www.chemicool.com) in order to come up with a common trait among their assigned elements.\n- Next, have groups come up with an original title for their set of elements, based on the commonality they find in their investigation. Groups should remember that their ultimate goal will be to represent their elements as \"element super heroes\" that have extraordinary properties. For example, Group B could be called \"The Harrowing Halogens\" or Group C could be called \"The All Mighty Alkali\" (due to their status as Alkali and Alkali Earth Metals). Groups should write their original titles on the \"Elements to Investigate\" Sheet.\nCreating trading cards:\n- Distribute five small index cards to each group and instruct students to create an individual trading card for each of their elements.\n- Each trading card should contain the following information about its element on the lined side of the card: name, two-letter symbol for element, team name, group classification on the periodic table, and description of properties according to the VT or according to another online source.\n- On the unlined side of the index card, students should include the element's name and an image that portrays the element as a \"superhero element\" with some type of extraordinary property. The image could be directly associated with the element's physical description or it could be based on one of the more common uses of that element.\nPresenting the elements:\n- Have each group briefly present its group of elements by summarizing the information they discovered about their elements through the VT and other online sources.\n- Since the trading cards are small, students may wish to pass them around the class during the presentations.\n- While each group is presenting its set of elements, other groups should be taking brief notes on the elements as they are presented.\nExtending the Lesson:\n- If time permits, groups could trade their cards with other groups with the goal of creating as many \"reactions\" as they can, being careful not to jeopardize their current potential for reactions. For example, Group B may wish to acquire hydrogen from Group D to form hydrogen chloride, but Group D may want to keep hydrogen since it forms so many reactions with its other Group D elements (e.g., hydrogen and oxygen react in forming water, hydrogen and nitrogen react in forming ammonia).\n- Each group's title should be assessed to determine if it accurately reflects a commonality among its set of elements.\n- Each group's set of element trading cards should be assessed to determine if they were completed accurately and creatively.\nStandard 8.

Make sure your pathway to them is never blocked.\n- Your work area (including the floor) should be absolutely clear. Remove all book-bags, books (except lab book and lab notebook) and briefcases from the lab bench area to the sides of the room, on windowsills or in the cabinets under your bench.\n- If you should get a chemical in your eyes, wash them in the eye-wash fountain for 15 to 20 minutes and notify your instructor.\n- Pay attention to the written instructions, and the instructor’s oral instructions, and follow them carefully. If you do not know what to do, ask! Even “safe” experiments can be dangerous if instructions are not followed.\n- No food or drink is allowed in the laboratory. Food should be consumed outside of lab. Never taste any chemicals in the laboratory. (Even common compounds like salt and sugar in the lab are not fit to eat.) Never drink from laboratory glassware.\n- Smoking is prohibited in the building, including the classrooms, labs and stairways. Violators may be reported to Security.\n- Report all accidents and glass breakage to your instructor. Ask to be taken to the Infirmary for treatment of cuts, burns, or inhalation of vapors. Spilled mercury (from broken thermometers) must be reported. Do not attempt to clean up broken glass or spilled blood. (Because of HIV risks, blood must be removed by approved methods.)\n- Avoid breathing vapors of any kind. Follow instructions for use of the ventilation hoods. Usually chemicals stored in the hoods should not be removed but should be used there.\n- Do not use mouth suction to fill pipets in transferring chemical reagents. Use a rubber suction bulb. More injuries occur each year from mouth-pipeting than from any other error.\n- Protect yourself! Long hair must be confined with rubber bands or a hairnet when in the laboratory. Wear loose, comfortable old clothing to lab, including long pants/skirt and shoes with a closed top (no open sandals!). (These protect you in case chemicals splash on you.) If you must wear good clothing to lab you may wish to invest in a lab jacket, sold at medical and chemical supply stores.\n- Do not wear contact lenses in the laboratory. They may absorb vapors which can permanently damage eyes.\n- Never block aisles with chairs or stools. Class chairs should be moved to the side of the lab.\n- Never push or shove others in the lab. Violators may be asked to leave or be debarred.\n- Never remove chemicals from the lab, and never attempt to do lab work at home. Do not work alone in the lab.\n- Clean up your bench and wash hands thoroughly before leaving lab.\n- Use caution when using Bunsen burners. Check that gas jets are off before leaving the laboratory\nI have read and understand the above rules and agree to obey them. I understand I may be removed from the lab room and may be debarred for failing to follow the rules."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fc0d3c9b-00b7-4003-8539-b930a643120c>","<urn:uuid:b1e34f1a-3f0a-49ef-b78c-562a103459dd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I study modernist art history - how did Arthur Dove approach darkness and sound differently in his paintings Music (1913) versus Fog Horns (1929)?","answer":"In Music (1913), Dove painted sounds of the night city as rhythmic, spiraling dark masses that obscure a distant skyline, using darkness as a tool for abstraction. In contrast, Fog Horns (1929) specifically focused on duplicating the sound of foghorns at sea through colors and shapes. While both works deal with translating sound into visual art, Music uses darkness to help move toward abstraction in depicting urban nighttime sounds, while Fog Horns more directly attempts to represent a specific maritime sound through abstract forms.","context":["Dark Matters, Paintings by Andrea Belag, Ryan Cobourn, Arthur Dove, Bill Jensen, and Ellen Phelan, curated by Jennifer Samet, at Steven Harvey Fine Art Projects, February 23- March 18, 2012.\nIn his Theory of Colors, Goethe observes that \"the greatest brightness short of dazzling acts near the greatest darkness. In this state we at once perceive all the intermediate gradations of chiaro-scuro, and all the varieties of hues.\" In Dark Matters, currently on view at Steven Harvey Fine Art Projects, the theme of darkness unites dazzlingly nuanced explorations of color and painterly approach in works by Ryan Cobourn, Arthur Dove, Andrea Belag, Bill Jensen, and Ellen Phelan. The superb selection of paintings spans nearly a century, adding a temporal dialogue to the mix.\nPainting darkness is a new and highly successful direction in the work of Ryan Cobourn, who has turned his searching, energetic brushwork from evocations of flowers and light on water to a sensate exploration of the indistinct. Painting the winter city at night, Cobourn embraces the challenge of observation in the absence of light. Masses of dark, uncertain forms are punctuated by far away lights - blinding touches that momentarily disrupt the ability to perceive the dark passages. Forced to actively focus and re-focus, neither painter nor viewer can locate forms with certainty, and Cobourn's paintings remain an active visual experience. They present the difficulty of seeing; darkness compels their forms and focus to remain constantly in flux.\nAcross the gallery hangs Arthur Dove's Music from 1913. For Dove, the difficulty of rendering forms in darkness proved a useful step in the early-modern march toward abstraction. Instead of painting sights, here Dove painted sounds - the Cagian cacophony of the night city. Dove’s sound-forms fan out rhythmically as their spiraling dark mass echoes, fills, and obscures a distant skyline.\nIn Dark Abstraction (Woods), 1920, Dove paints a forest landscape hovering between darkness and light. He connects two worlds, representation and abstraction, through a shared palette of muted, rich color. On the opposite wall, Ellen Phelan's Autumn Bay, 2003, investigates a similar duality, but her painting, shrouded in a nocturnal mist, seems more like a reminiscence whose shadows derive from the vagueness of memory. Juxtaposing these works from different centuries underscores the concerns specific to each. In Phelan's 21st century painting the tension between representation and abstraction, so palpable in Dove’s time, has been demystified and become a thing of the past.\nOther paintings in the show by Phelan, Bill Jensen, and Andrea Belag mine another lineage of dark painting, that of Goya and El Greco. In this tradition of dark painting, psychological tensions replace formal ones.\nIn Goya's \"Black Paintings,\" relentless natural, supernatural, and historical forces condemn human beings to desperate acts and melancholic contemplation. In this exhibition, Bill Jensen's concerns align closely with those of Goya. Jensen's Sorrow and Optimism, 2006-12, confronts uncontrollable fate in the form of 9/11, ongoing war, and illness. The lower half of the painting evokes one type of void, a cold watery depth, while the upper half evokes another. The upper surface of solid, dusky violet is disorienting - one moment a taut plane and the next an infinity. This visual struggle recalls that of Goya's dog, whose struggling is faintly hopeful in the face of near-certain death. The eye likewise struggles to comprehend the close-value color and sheer physicality of Jensen’s Ape Herd VI, 2002-03. Its shale-like, tactile surface resembles nothing so much as activated carbon, a substance whose uses include purification and the filtration of toxins.\nJensen’s paintings speak to a nearby work, Phelan's Untitled (two parts), 1979, where anxiety presents itself in oily blacks and somber grays. Encountering this painting is to encounter a reflected glare. The eye cannot penetrate the darkness save through a small cross, physically punched out of the aluminum support. The painting is an example of Phelan's early work which sought to reconcile painterly abstraction with process based minimalism, but in this context the cut surface feels more desperate, as if the painter were punching a hole through which to breathe.\nAndrea Belag's Red Lantern, 2012, alone on the end wall is an electric return to pure color, seen through a veil of limpid blue violet. Calling to mind another of Goethe’s observations, that “blue in particular, can be made to approximate to black,” Belag's dark colors surround and amplify a spectrum of pure primaries. The jewel-like result is a celebratory, chromatic energy reminiscent of El Greco's energized supernatural spirituality, signified by darkness shot through with brilliant color.","The year 2013 marks the 100th anniversary of the Armory Show, a groundbreaking art exhibition that helped spark the modern art movement in the United States. The U.S. Postal Service will commemorate the occasion with the issuance of the Modern Art in America stamp sheet.\nThis gorgeous pane of self-adhesive Forever® stamps features a dozen masterpieces created between 1912 and 1931. For design purposes and to preserve the horizontal or vertical orientation of the artworks, the stamp sizes vary.\nStuart Davis’s vibrant depictions of contemporary commercial objects made him an important precursor of the later Pop artists. His oil-on-canvas painting, House and Street (1931), presents two views of a street in New York, forcing the viewer to be in two places at once.\nCharles Demuth, a leading watercolorist of his era, created memorable “poster portraits” of several of his friends, including the poet William Carlos Williams, the subject of the work I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold (1928), in oil, graphite, ink, and gold leaf on paperboard.\nAaron Douglas was the most important visual artist to emerge from the Harlem Renaissance. The gouache-on-paper painting, The Prodigal Son (1927), was created in a modernist style that has been described as “Afro-Cubism.”\nArthur Dove was one of modern art’s earliest abstract painters and was probably the first American artist to paint a totally abstract canvas. Dove was interested in attempting to duplicate sound as colors and shapes. The oil-on-canvas painting, Fog Horns (1929), suggests the peal of foghorns at sea.\nMarcel Duchamp, an important forerunner of the Pop art and conceptual art movements, outraged and disturbed many viewers by irreverently flouting artistic convention. His oil-on-canvas painting, Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2 (1912), was the most talked-about work at the Armory Show of 1913.\nMarsden Hartley was one of America’s greatest modernist painters. His oil-on-canvas work, Painting, Number 5 (1914-15), is an abstract composite portrait of Karl von Freyburg, a young German officer who was killed in World War I.\nJohn Marin was the preeminent watercolorist of his era. He transformed the medium by experimenting with abstraction, such as in his watercolor-on-paper painting, Sunset, Maine Coast (1919).\nGerald Murphy produced only about a dozen works in less than ten years as a practicing artist, yet today he is recognized as a significant painter whose work prefigured the Pop art of the 1960s. The oil-on-canvas painting, Razor (1924), typifies Murphy’s work in its detailed depiction of commonplace objects.\nGeorgia O’Keeffe was one of the foremost painters of the 20th century. Widely known for her close-up flower paintings, O’Keeffe also famously painted urban and desert landscapes, including this oil-on-canvas painting, Black Mesa Landscape, New Mexico / Out Back of Marie’s II (1930).\nMan Ray was associated with some of the most important artistic movements of the 20th century—chief among them Dadaism and Surrealism—and is best known for his photography. His gelatin-silver print, Noire et Blanche (1926), is from a series of photographs juxtaposing a woman’s face with a Baule mask (or a replica) from West Africa.\nCharles Sheeler explored the balance between abstraction and realism in his photographs and paintings, which often depicted aspects of the mechanized modern world. By titling this oil-on-canvas painting American Landscape (1930), Sheeler explored the relationship between rural traditions and his modern subject matter.\nJoseph Stella, America’s first Futurist painter, is remembered for his multiple images of the Brooklyn Bridge and other iconic New York scenes. The oil-on-canvas painting, Brooklyn Bridge (1919-1920), has been read as a comment on the tension between technological achievement and the spiritual dimension implicit in any human endeavor.\nThe Modern Art in America stamp sheet will be issued in 2013.

{"question":"What was the purpose of marriage banns and when were they required?","answer":"Marriage banns were required by the Hardwicke Act of 1754. They involved the public announcement of an intended marriage, which had to be read in the parish churches of both the bride and groom for three consecutive Sundays before the wedding ceremony could take place. These announcements were required to be recorded in a register, either in a separate document or together with the marriage record itself.","context":["I can help with all resources marked , copyright permitting.\nSee also Links\nAlmost all of the links on this page are external to my site and somewhat beyond my control. If you discover one that is broken, please let me know and I will fix/remove it as soon as possible.\n- Alias—There are many reasons (other than criminal) why some people had more than one surname and were recorded as “X alias Y.” One that I have recently discoverd is that, after 1660, it may occur if the parents of the person were not considered legally married because the event took place during the Commonwealth/Protectorate of the civil war. Other reasons are that it could be a transitional period of the adoption of surnames (early in England but as late as the mid C19th in Wales). It could be that due to local custom or confusion a person was known by a different name; this particularly applied to incomers. Another reason could be that a person has deliberately changed their name, for example to that of their wife’s family for reasons of respect or inheritance.\n- Banns—From the Hardwicke Act of 1754, it was required that notice of an impending marriage should be read in the parish churches of bride and groom for three consecutive Sundays prior to the ceremony. This was supposed to be recorded in a register for the purpose, either separate or together with the marriage itself.\n- Bastardy Bond—these were to protect the parish (or the county) from the cost of rearing an illegitimate child which would otherwise be chargeable to the parish (or county) and were brought in in the reign of Elizabeth I. When it was known that an unmarried woman was pregnant she was brought before the parish or the court and questioned under oath and asked to declare the name of the father of her child. The reputed father was then brought before the parish (or court) and required to “post a bond” to cover the cost to the parish, or county, of rearing the child. If he (the bondsman) didn't have the money, his father etc. (surety) could guarantee the bond. If the woman refused to name the father, she, her father, etc. could post the bond. However, if the woman refused to name the father, or post the bond, she could be sent to prison. Up to 1834 one can find these records in the parish chest documents and in the quarter sessions. After 1834 they can be found in the quarter sessions or the petty sessions. [thanks to Corinne Thompson for this summary]\n- Bezants = these are the 15 gold circles on the badge of Cornwall.

However the geography made travel difficult at the best of times so for long periods the responsibility was delegated to the Archdeacon of Bodmin.

After the Norman conquest, William the Conqueror took possession of all English property and all landowners became his tenants. If a knight wished to sell or transfer property to someone outside his family, he was required to pay a fine to the king, and later to the royal county court. So the term “fines” came to mean a registered deed of property. The parchment on which the Fines were recorded was split into three separate sections, and the details of the property ownership were inscribed on each section. The three sections were cut apart with a wavy cut, to discourage forgers. The upper two thirds were divided between the old owner and the new owner, while the bottom third (“foot”) was kept by the court. All that was meant by your ancestors’ possession of land “in the Feet of Fines” was that they owned property for which a registered deed existed.

This is a brief guide to some that you will find and aproximate conversions.\n- Currency—The pound (£) sterling is the same as in the UK today, though the value will have changed over time. Prior to 1971 it was divided into 20 shillings (s) and the shilling divided into twelve pence (d). A farthing was a quarter penny and a guinea was 21 shillings. A crown was five shillings and a florin, two shillings. In very early records you may find a mark which was 13s. 4d and a groat (four pence).\n- Length—The mile consists of 1760 yards each of three feet ('). A foot is 12 inches (\"). Ocasionally you will find chains (22 yards) and furlongs (10 chains). Even rarer is the rod, pole or perch which was 5½ yards. For metric equivelents a mile is about 1.6km, a yard about 914 mm and an inch 25.4 mm.\n- Area of land—The acre (a) was 4840 square yards. A quarter of a acre was called a rood (r) and there were 40 perches or poles (p) to a rood. Hence a perch was 30¼ square yards. There were 640 acres to a square mile. For a metric equivalent a hectare is about 2.5 acres and a perch about 25 sq. meters. Beware, though, that in very old records there were different acres used in different parts of the country. A virgate was 30 acres and a hide = 4 virgates but again this varied according to the quality of the land as it was a measure of the amount needed to support a family.\n- Weight—One convenient measure is the ton which is almost identical to the metric tonne. It contained 20 hundredweight (cwt) each of 8 stones. A stone was 14 pounds (lb) which each contained 16 ounces (oz). You also sometime see a quarter which was 2 stone. Busshels varied according to what produce they were measuring. The useful metric equivalents are a pound = 454 grams, an ounce is 28 grams."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:60434f7d-a8eb-4572-8a83-5142529f9b9c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do digital assets evolve from static to dynamic value in the modern connected ecosystem?","answer":"Digital assets evolve from static to dynamic value through several key developments. Instead of being just 'stored static digits' belonging to one entity, they become 'stored dynamic value' that can generate benefits for many unrelated entities. This transformation is driven by technologies like IoT, where assets can report and share data in real-time regardless of geographic location. The value of digital assets increases according to their usage and can grow based on how they are re-used and shared to serve other entities. For example, in connected vehicles, sensor data about traffic, road conditions, and weather can be shared to benefit multiple entities like insurance companies, emergency services, and traffic control systems, enabling new services and value creation.","context":["Digital Asset Management has been known for decades and it refers to the assets that exist in a digital format. In essence, it is a set of databases and infrastructure to collect, store, and process the digital representation of assets allowing users to search, identify and read assets data.\nThe type and complexity of a digital assets range from a simple digital document, audio, image, or video file to any digital file representing physical devices such as sensors or machines. It also represents assets from a wide range of industries such as utilities, factories, transportation, buildings, consumer, wearable devices and vehicles, covering almost all things in our life.\nThe number of digital assets types and classifications are exponentially increasing with rising technology advancement due to the digital economy era.\nSo, what’s new in this definition?\nThe continuous evolution of new technologies, high speed wireless infrastructure, industrial and global social development are changing the way we currently do business, interact with each other and exchange values, either as individuals, organizations or even governments. Advanced implementations such as the shared economy, connected world, cloud services, digital twins, Internet of things, artificial intelligence, big data, connected society, machine learning are all together forming a new era of an industrial and digital economic revolution that is changing the future outlook of digital asset management.\n\"The digital assets will no longer be just “stored static digits” belonging to one entity, but is becoming a “stored dynamic value” with potential to generate more value to many even unrelated, entities\"\nThe majority of digital assets have a set of monetary value. Since digital assets represent a digitization of the elements owned by a user or an entity, assets value usually increases according to their usage. So, in general, the value gained from digital assets can be open for growth, depending on how far it can be re-used and shared to serve other entities. In other words, it can shift from a static, limited value to a shared, dynamic, limitless value.\nInternet of Things (IoT) has been emerging very strongly in the last few years as the largest global technology trend leading the changes for the connected ecosystem, with connected digital assets playing a major role in it.\nThe IoT is leading the transformation where, for the first time, we will start seeing more, new connected assets than not, where assets data are all reported, and possibly, shared in real-time regardless of the geographic location and type of the assets.\nThe digital assets will no longer be just “stored static digits” belonging to one entity, but is becoming a “stored dynamic value” with potential to generate more value to many, even unrelated, entities. Let’s look at few examples of how IoT is impacting digital asset management.\nIn the utilities management sector, energy flows can be controlled with a real-time understanding of the state of the grid assets: from power stations distribution to smart meters. Not only they can optimize the energy based on the actual capacities of their assets, but, as a step further, they can apply certain logic to draw a detailed consumption pattern that can better optimize and distribute energy more efficiently. A more sophisticated approach, known as predictive maintenance, is to build intelligent algorithms to detect the possibility of power failure or peak before they occur, preventing unplanned downtime, saving millions of dollars, productivity loss or other economic and social impact.\nAnother example, in the “connected vehicle” industry, is where a vehicle is equipped with a comprehensive set of sensors that are constantly sending a wealth of real-time information such as traffic data, road conditions, pedestrian flow, passenger status, weather data, or pollution levels. Although this set of digital assets can be owned by the vehicle owner or one service provider, it can now be a source of valuable information to be profiled, stored centrally and dynamically shared to provide benefits to an extended set of other entities (e.g., insurance companies and other service providers) enabling new services, such as safety, marketing, local business, traffic control, weather forecasting, and emergency services.\nIn the smart cities context, IoT’s ability to capture real-time sensor data on everything from energy consumption to problems with the water or sewage system, public transportation, streets, safety and traffic flow, can all be connected to the Digital Asset Management system and enable sound decisions to be made, there and then, as well as in the longer term, sharing with other entities to benefit from its value.\nFurthermore, when the digital assets data are managed through advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and deep learning, different patterns can be detected and more valuable information extracted that can’t otherwise be observed or used.\nThe most important outcome of this advancement is the enablement of a collaborative culture for innovation that has become indispensable for the value creation of the future, both within the business’s own boundaries and beyond, with partners, governments , institutions , customers and communities. More collaboration to bridge the gaps between developing and developed worlds will become a necessity for the advancement of societies.\nImagine, with shared digital assets that represent farming, agriculture, environmental or anonymous individual health information collected globally, from developed and developing countries alike, the extracted values for humanity to improve productivity, health, and to predict natural disasters and epidemics can be enormous. In addition to generating business values to the companies working on those data, new business models that pave the path for open innovation will evolve.\nHowever, significant global efforts and alliances need to lead the creation of such a collaborative environment, to bring different industries, technology leaders, standardization bodies, institutions, and governments together. These efforts are most likely to succeed if driven in an unbiased and not-for-profit atmosphere, taking a global approach to bridge the gaps and accelerating the adoption of the technology and interoperability in a collaborative eco-system environment. The Industrial Internet Consortium IIC represents a leading valid model to follow.\nDigital assets, embedded in IoT, are just the beginning of the digital ecosystem which is developing rapidly worldwide. A collaborative and technology innovation culture is becoming the path from just “digits” to a real global “value”."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:982764ef-8567-48e5-a125-9f0808c8eb59>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm fascinated by timekeeping mechanisms. How do grandfather clocks achieve accurate timekeeping through simple harmonic motion, and what are their key maintenance requirements for optimal operation?","answer":"Grandfather clocks achieve accurate timekeeping through a pendulum system that operates on simple harmonic motion principles. The pendulum's movement is regulated by an escapement mechanism consisting of three components: the pendulum, anchor, and escapement wheel. The escapement ensures consistent pendulum swings, with the anchor latching to the escapement wheel's teeth, allowing one tooth to pass with each oscillation. This creates a restorative force similar to other systems with simple harmonic motion. For optimal operation and maintenance, the clock requires several key considerations: The clock must be balanced and steady, with the pendulum swinging freely without hitting anything. The weights must be adjusted every 7 days to prevent the clock from stopping, and they must be correctly placed to ensure proper operation. There's also a small adjustment nut below the pendulum that can speed up or slow down the clock if it's gaining or losing time. The suspension spring should be checked for damage, and the clock hands should not contact each other or the dial.","context":["Because of its simplicity, simple harmonic motion is a physical model that can be used to investigate many more complex systems where there are restorative forces, such as the electrical interactions of atoms and the gravitational attractions between planets.\nSummary about the SHM\nThe MHS is the result of the action of a force that tends to keep some particle, or system of particles, in an equilibrium position , as happens with a spring when stretched or compressed, which is subjected to the action of an elastic force . In this type of movement, the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy is always constant, so we say that there is conservation of mechanical energy.\nWe call frequency the number of oscillations performed by a system in MHS that are completed every second. The period, in turn, is calculated as the inverse of the frequency and is equal to the time taken for the system in MHS to complete an oscillation. The units of measurement of frequency and period of the MHS are, respectively, the hertz (Hz) and the second (s). The formulas used to calculate these quantities are as follows:\nf – frequency (Hz)\nT – period (s)\nn – number of oscillations\nΔt – time interval (s)\nIn addition to the frequency and period quantities, the MHS is defined from angular quantities . Such quantities allow us to know in which position a particle in the MHS is, as well as to specify its measurements of kinetic and potential energy at that instant. The most important of the angular quantities related to MHS is angular frequency , also known as angular velocity or pulsation.\nω – angular frequency (rad/s)\nThe angular frequency has the dimension of rad/s. Radians are one of the different ways to define angles on the trigonometric circle. It is known that one complete turn along the trigonometric circle corresponds to 360º , which in turn correspond to 2π radians .\nIn the case of MHS, the trigonometric circle serves as a reference for a complete oscillation . For example, compressing a spring and releasing it, we have a complete oscillation when it has returned to its initial position – in which case we say that it has traveled an angular displacement equal to 2π radians.\nThe angular frequency can also be calculated as a function of other parameters, according to the harmonic oscillator type . Among all the possible types of oscillators, the ones that stand out the most for their importance are the simple pendulum and the spring-mass oscillator . The formulas used to calculate the angular frequency in these cases of simple harmonic motion are shown below.\nSimple harmonic motion formulas\nThe most important formulas of simple harmonic motion are the time equations of position, velocity, and acceleration . These equations allow us to determine the position, velocity or acceleration of a mobile in MHS at a given instant of time.\nIn the formulas above, the amplitude (A) is equivalent to the maximum distance that a particle can travel in relation to its equilibrium position . The variable t refers to the instant of time, and Φ 0 is called the initial phase and is related to the position at which the system started the movement.\nIn addition to the formulas already mentioned, there are also formulas that are used to calculate the period of oscillation and the frequency of the simple pendulum and also the mass-spring oscillator, namely:\nSolved exercises on simple harmonic motion\nQuestion 1 – Calculate the angular frequency of a particle that develops a simple harmonic motion knowing that the period of this motion is equal to 0.5 s.\na) π/2 rad/s\nb) π rad/s\nc) 4π rad/s\nd) 3π/2 rad/s\nTemplate : letter C.\nTo solve the exercise and calculate the angular frequency of the particle, we need to use the formula that relates this quantity to the period of motion.\nAccording to the calculation made, the angular frequency of the movement is equal to 4π rad/s .\nQuestion 2 – A particle describes a simple harmonic motion of amplitude equal to 4 cm. Knowing that the initial phase of the motion is equal to 0 and that its angular frequency is equal to π rad/s, determine the position of this particle at the instant t = 0.5 s.\na) 2 cm\nb) 5 cm\nc) 0 cm\nd) 4 cm\nTemplate: letter C.\nTo find out the position of the mobile, it is necessary to use the hourly equation of the position in the MHS; doing so, we must solve the following calculation:\nSince the cosine of π/2 rad is equal to 0, the result obtained is equal to 0 .\nQuestion 3 – Determine the maximum speed of a mobile that describes a simple harmonic motion of amplitude equal to 5 m knowing that its angular velocity is equal to 2 π rad/s.\na) 2π m/s\nb) 10π m/s\nc) π m/s\nd) π/4 m/s\nTemplate: letter B.\nThe formula relating the velocity of the particle that develops a simple harmonic motion is shown below. It is noteworthy that, in order to obtain the maximum speed in this type of movement, the sine, on which the speed function depends, must have its value equal to -1; So, just do the following multiplication.","Grandfather clocks, also called pendulum clocks, or longcase clocks, contribute greatly to the mood and mysticism of any room or hall. The contemporary versions of these clocks differ from previous models in that modern grandfather clocks neither include ancient clock elements nor need to be turned to display the correct time.\nThe idea of grandfather clocks invokes images of a towering, majestic oak clock in the corner, complete with a lengthy pendulum that is constantly vibrating.\nAlthough the origin of its name is unknown, a grandfather clock is generally defined as a pendulum clock that has a length of more than 1.5 meters. The majority of these clocks stroke or chime at the end of an hour, while some may chime or ring after half an hour.\nGrandfather clocks operate in one of the two main types of motions, eight-day or one day. A grandfather clock with an eight-day mechanism only needs to be set once a week, whereas one-day mechanism clocks need to be set every day.\nFor over three centuries, these antique clocks were widely used and regarded as the most accurate timekeepers. The traditional workmanship and royal majesty of grandfather clocks have ensured that the clocks have remained widely popular, even after so many years.\nIn this article, we’ll go over the main parts of a grandfather clock and how it works – illustrated by a 3D diagram. You may also read the parts of a wall clock to under their differences.\nHow Do Grandfather Clocks Work?\nThe movements lie at the heart of each pendulum clock. The hour/minute hand’s striking, chiming, and subsequent timekeeping are all dictated by the pendulum’s movement. The weights and hanging pendulum are essential components of every mechanical clock’s mechanism.\nThe timekeeping is regulated and adjusted by the movement of the pendulum. Three weights may be used in a pendulum clock to operate the clock’s striking, and chiming. Each of the three weights is unique and must be placed correctly to ensure optimal operation.\nA chain or wire suspends the weights from the escapement apparatus so that they work in line with the mechanism. The clock may stop working if the weights are not adjusted over 7 days. The lifting of the weights is achieved with the help of a crank. A series of hammering rods of different lengths produce striking and chiming sounds.\nParts of Grandfather Clock\nEach movement of a pendulum clock is due to the four fundamental internal elements that make it work. The escapement, gears, setting mechanism, and weight are all elements of the internal parts. Some external parts have been discussed below.\nThe escapement was designed to ensure that the pendulum maintains a consistent swing. Clockmaker designed the pendulum, the anchor, and the escapement wheel as the three components of the escapement. The pace at which the other gears in the clock movement is determined by the escapement wheel. This escapement wheel has specifically designed teeth. The pendulum is attached to the anchor, which latches to the teeth of the escapement wheel.\nThe anchors have an upward U-shape and have two meeting points with the escapement wheel. One of the wheel’s teeth is allowed to traverse with each oscillation of the pendulum. The second hand of the clock moves continuously as a result of this.\nThe clock’s minute and hour hands move because of this basic principle, but the wheels that drive the minutes and hourly hands rotate after pendulum vibrations. As a result, the pendulum becomes a mechanism for releasing the potential energy stored in the weight.\nWheels / Gears\nAlso called gears, several wheels are installed between the weight and the escapement gear to achieve desired spinning ratios daily or weekly for convenience of operation. The weighted wheel travels relatively slower than other wheels between the opposite edges, enabling the weight to fall and release energy at steady rates.\nThough the wheel of gear ratios are simple enough to comprehend, aligning each wheel to reach a hand on the grandfather clock face becomes tough. Tubular shafts are commonly used to conduct the operation of the hands of the clock – one inside the other to solve this difficulty. Also, with tubular shafts, organizing the gear to work continuously can be a challenging task.\nGear Trains / Wheel Trains\nThe speed from the mainspring to the weight is controlled by the gear train. The clock’s hands are connected to the teeth of different wheels in a wheel train. As a result, the hour hand moves slower than the minute hand.\nA tiny lever, or winder linked to a gear pulls the gear out of line with others to configure the working of grandfather clocks accurately. The setting mechanism brings the clock to a halt, permitting it to be turned and the time to be set.\nThe pendulum gives the clock potential energy, allowing it to oscillate at a steady rate.\nThere is a small adjustment nut below the pendulum which helps boost up or slow the clock speed if it is increasing or losing time.\nDriving Weight and Main Spring\nThe clock’s power supply is provided by the mainspring. The mainspring could be a pulley that is turned by a driving weight on a cable. The power supply in several smartwatches and clocks is a metal string. This is sometimes referred to as spring winding since it preserves the mechanical power that is used to spin the clock’s movements.\nThe weight’s projected energy loss is represented by the unfolding of the string around the gear and consequent lowering of the weight. As a result, mechanical clocks should be reset regularly to replenish the stored energy of the weights.\nThe dial is the displayed face of the clock that records the revolutions of the escapement-driven gear train. In a nutshell, it uses spinning hands to show the time. A dial has numerals 1-12 on it in the most widely used displays. Subdials also display the date and lunar phases in certain clocks.\nThe chimes are among the most notable and distinctive features that have helped to define the grandfather clock. A grandfather clock without a working chime is not regarded as authentic and genuine. A variety of wheels, pulleys, levers, and hammers will be required to make the chime operate properly.\nNormally, chime sequences are sounded at the top of each hour, but quarter-hour chime sequences (the most renowned chimes sequences are Westminster quarters) were introduced to pendulum clocks in the twentieth century.\nOrigin of Grandfather Clocks\nThe sundial was man’s earliest timekeeping instrument. It was a device that measured the movement of a huge object’s shadow to calculate equal fractions of the day. A sundial is undoubtedly a useful tool for measuring time intervals, but because of the Earth’s eccentric orbital path, the time recorded by a sundial over a year might be less precise, and this left a lot of opportunity for advancement.\nWhile sundials were perhaps the most popular tool for keeping time, they were not the only ones. The clepsydra (water clocks) and the clepsammia (hourglass) were also rare inventions. Water clocks worked by allowing water to leak through tiny holes in a vessel.\nThe process of making these mechanical gadgets for measuring time was highly costly. Further, temperature, wind speed, and the fluctuation in pressure inside the vessel all influenced the time interval between movements of the clock’s operation, causing the time to be inaccurate.\nOn the other hand, the hourglass told the precise time, but it took a lot of concentration to notice when the final grain of sand dropped and to flip it over quickly.\nFortunately, in 1658, because Robert Hooke developed the anchor escapement mechanism, the grandfather clock was born. The anchor system lowered the movement of the pendulum to 4°-6°, enabling makers of grandfather clocks to make use of longer pendulums with slower beats. The newer grandfather clocks used less energy, enabling clocks to function for longer periods than traditional sundials, hourglass, and water clocks. These were also more precise and produced minimal friction.\nBy 1680, a clockmaker from Britain, William Clement had created the first grandfather clocks. Later that year, the most famous British clockmaker, Thomas Tompion, began producing them as well. Grandfather clocks became popular all over England as well as in Asia and Europe. The average cost of grandfather clocks in England peaked between 1680 and 1800, limiting clock purchases to the comparatively wealthy. However, by 1800, salaries had grown to the point that many families in the lower-middle-class could afford grandfather clocks.\nHow to Take Care of a Grand Father Clock\nExamine to see if your grandfather’s clock is balanced and steady. Ensure that the clock’s hands are neither contacting one other nor the dial of the clock. As the pendulum swings, ensure it doesn’t scratch or hit anything. Lastly, double-check that the suspension spring is not damaged and the pendulum is properly hanging.\nThe design and production of a grandfather or pendulum clock necessitate exceptional workmanship as well as a wealth of knowledge in physics and engineering. The concepts of energy and mechanics, along with the qualities of a pendulum that result in an accurate clock, remain an impressive feat.\nAlso, note that some grandfather clock components may not be found readily available in stores, therefore repairing a grandfather clock, especically clocks may cost a lot of money. To preserve the integrity and durability of each grandfather clock, it is important to take good care of them."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2235bfd2-6ae5-4507-b792-727d6cc849c9>","<urn:uuid:5775ee69-66d0-4243-86f2-978dec6a866e>"],"error":null}

From the Greek archetypos, formed from the verb “archein” (“to begin” or “to rule”) and the noun “typos” (“type”). The ancient Greek philosopher Plato, believed that all things have ideal forms of which real things are merely shadows or copies. And in the psychology of C. G. Jung, “archetype” refers to an inherited idea or mode of thought that is present in the unconscious of the individual. In everyday prose, however, “archetype” is most commonly used to mean “a perfect example of something.”\nIn literary criticism, a primordial image, character, or pattern of circumstances that recurs throughout literature and thought consistently enough to be considered a universal concept or situation. Term adopted from psychologist Carl Gustav Jung, further developed in a literary context by critic Northrop Frye (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2016)\nStereotype and cliché: both words come from French and were originally printers’ terms, and both have come to take on somewhat negative meanings in modern use. Their original meanings are essentially synonymous, referring to printing blocks from which numerous prints could be made. Today cliché refers to something hackneyed, such as an overly familiar or commonplace phrase, theme, or expression. Stereotype refers to an often unfair and untrue belief that many people have about all people or things with a particular characteristic.\nExamples of character archetypes\nTaking as an example the book I’ve recently mapped to the Hero’s Journey, Matilda by Roald Dahl, Matilda, the Protagonist, has also combined features of several Jungian character archetypes: the Hero, the Rebel, the Magician and the Explorer. I think of Miss Trunchball, which in the book is the Antagonist, as an Ugly Witch and a Terrible Mother.\nIn the same novel I can see some other character archetypes. Miss Honey, the Mentor, can be considered according to C.G. Jung the Orphan, the Caregiver as well as the Sage, being a teacher.\nSome character archetypes with examples\nThe petty bourgeois hero: Giovanni Vivaldi, the main character played by Alberto Sordi in An Average Little Man (1977), film directed by Mario Monicelli\nThe strong warrior: Beowulf, Achilles\nThe tortured hero: Odysseus, the mathematician and Nobel prize Nash played by Russel Crowe in A Beautiful Mind (2001), film directed by Ron Howard\nThe simple young man: Renzo Tramaglino, the male hero in The Betrothed (Italian: I promessi sposi), an Italian historical novel by Alessandro Manzoni (1827)\nThe innocent young girl: Lucia Mondella, the female hero in The Betrothed (Italian: I promessi sposi), an Italian historical novel by Alessandro Manzoni (1827)\nThe unaware princess: Cinderella and Snow White\nThe antihero: Donald Duck, Forrest Gump\nThe self-destructive artist: Amedeo Modigliani, Kurt Cobain\nThe tragic lovers: Orpheus and Eurydice, Romeo and Juliet\nThe rebel: James Dean, Che Guevara\nThe evil stepmother: Miss Trunchball in Matilda by Roald Dahl, the Evil Queen in Snow White fairytale\nThe mermaid: Anita Ekberg in La dolce vita (1960), film directed by Federico Fellini\nThe faithful friend: doctor Watson for Sherlock Holmes\nThe interior enemy: Mr Hyde in the Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886) by Robert Louis Stevenson\nThe little naughty kid: Pinocchio, the protagonist of the children’s novel The Adventures of Pinocchio (1883) by Italian writer Carlo Collodi\nThe evil (negative) hero: Richard III\nThe wise old man: Merlin the wizard\nIt seems that there is virtually no end to archetype generation. Perhaps, like plot, through which we organize events in a meaningful connected way, this is our spontaneous (human) way to organize things, concepts, people in categories, and so, again, to put order to chaos. This is a concept that I would like to explore in more depth.\nMerrian-Webster.

Definition and meaning\nNash equilibrium occurs when each player is seeking his or her best possible strategy, while fully aware of the strategies that everybody else is pursuing. It is a key concept in **game theory. As soon as the Nash equilibrium is reached, there is no reason for anybody to consider changing their strategy. The Nash equilibrium is named after John Forbes Nash Jr. (1928-2015), an American mathematician who shared the 1994 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with two other game theorists.\n** Game theory is the study of how humans make decisions of strategy in situations – the formal study of cooperation and conflict.\nAccording to the Economist’s glossary of economic and business terms, to define the Nash equilibrium is as follows:\n“An important concept in game theory, a Nash equilibrium occurs when each player is pursuing their best possible strategy in the full knowledge of the strategies of all other players.”\n“Once a Nash equilibrium is reached, nobody has any incentive to change their strategy. It is named after John Nash, a mathematician and Nobel prize-winning economist.”\nThe Coordination Game – a classic, two player, two-strategy game. Players 1 & 2 should coordinate by adopting Strategy A, to receive the highest payoff – 4/4. If they both choose Strategy B, however, there is still a Nash equilibrium. Even though 2/2 is less than 4/4, they both opt for Strategy B and have no incentive to change that strategy because it prevents them from getting a 1.\nWhen a Nash equilibrium exists, none of the players has anything to gain by changing only his or her own strategy. In this state, each player has chosen a strategy, none of them can benefit by changing their own strategies while nobody else alters theirs.\nThe Nash theory can be tested in real situations using experimental economic methods.\nThe Nash theory helps economists determine how competing companies set their prices, and how auctions should be set up by governments so that they can squeeze the most from bidders. It is also used to work out why groups sometimes make self-defeating decisions.\nNash theory – the Prisoners’ Dilemma\nThe Prisoners’ Dilemma is commonly used to explain how we make decisions. Imagine there are two prisoners, each one alone in his prison cell – they cannot communicate or pass messages to each other.\nThe Nash equilibrium was named after John F. Nash Jr. (1928-2015), an American mathematician considered by many of his peers as a genius. In 1959, he was admitted to McLean Hospital and diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Russell Crowe played Nash in the biographical movie ‘A Beautiful Mind’, which was inspired by a 1998 book of the same name by Sylvia Nasar. The film won four Academy Awards for Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture. (Images: John Nash – biography.com. A Beautiful Mind – Wikipedia)\nThe public prosecutor gives the prisoners the following choices:\n– If they both betray each other about the murder, they will probably get 5 years in prison each.\n– If A betrays B, while B remains quiet, then B will go to prison for 20 years, while A will be set free. If A remains quiet and B betrays him, A will go to prison for 20 years and B will be set free.\n– If they both keep quiet, they will face just one year each in prison.\nIf they had the opportunity to talk to each other, the best strategy would be to keep quiet – nobody would serve a long stretch that way.\nHowever, an economist who supports the concept of the Nash equilibrium would determine that they would both chose to betray each other.\nThe Nash equilibrium – self-interest rules\nEvery member of a group makes the best decision for himself or herself – so the Nash equilibrium concept shows – based on how they think the others will act. Nobody can do better by altering their strategy – every group member is deciding in their own best possible interest, given their choices.\nIn the Prisoners’ Dilemma situation, remaining silent is never a good idea as far as prisoners A and B are concerned, no matter what the other prisoner does.\nSince prisoner A may have pointed the finger at B, by also being a snitch (betrayer) it is a guarantee for B that he won’t do life in prison. And if A remains silent, then betraying him sets B free. Prisoner A also uses the same logic the other way round.\nNash equilibrium in the business world\nIn the world of business, economists use the Nash equilibrium to determine how commercial rivals respond to each other’s prices. Two giant rivals setting pricing strategies to outcompete each other are likely to squeeze consumers harder than they would if there were hundreds of similarly-sized players in that sector.\nEconomists can understand – using the Nash equilibrium – how decisions that appear good for the individual, may be disastrous for the group. This terrible outcome for all explains why we over-pollute our atmosphere with carbon dioxide or overfish the oceans.\nIf only we could agree and showed some restraint, we would all be so much better off!\nHowever, as far as the individual is concerned, gas-guzzling and fishing like crazy makes sense. The concept helps policymakers devise solutions for difficult problems.\nNash equilibrium used by governments\nNash equilibrium experts say they have helped governments raise billions of dollars, pounds and euros. The following quote comes from an article in The Economist:\n“In 2000 the British government used their (Nash equilibrium geeks’) help to design a special auction that sold off its 3G mobile-telecoms operating licences for a cool £22.5 billion ($35.4 billion).”\n“Their trick was to treat the auction as a game, and tweak the rules so that the best strategy for bidders was to make bullish bids (the winning bidders were less than pleased with the outcome).”\n“Today the Nash equilibrium underpins modern microeconomics (though with some refinements). Given that it promises economists the power to pick winners and losers, it is easy to see why.”\nVideo – Nash equilibrium – Definition and Meaning\nIn this Khan Academy video, the speaker presents a Prisoners’ Dilemma situation similar to the one in the article above – however, in this case they have been caught red-handed dealing illegal drugs."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3fa7ebc6-db5c-4ddd-a978-b80f1eef0a1e>","<urn:uuid:25c99d5e-6c8d-4887-aa81-cb52d4d36368>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do storage capabilities compare between manual drafting and AutoCAD?","answer":"Manual drafting requires large physical space for drawing process, storage, and viewing of paper documents. In contrast, AutoCAD offers digital storage with various export possibilities, allowing projects to be saved in multiple file formats (including PDF and image files), shared via email, and stored electronically, eliminating the need for physical storage space.","context":["Manual drafting techniques\nManual drafting is the practice of creating drawings by hand. Manual drafting techniques have traditionally enabled the planning and communication of design ideas and construction information. As there is a very diverse range of information that may need to be communicated, there are a similarly wide range of drawing types. See Types of drawing for more information.\nThe evolution of manual drafting techniques has created a discipline around which other forms of drafting, such as computer-aided design (CAD) have subsequently developed.\nThe advantages of manual drafting include; the low cost of equipment compared to CAD hardware and software, the clarity that can be achieved by being able to see all shapes, sizes and angles on one sheet, the ability to bring creative style and expression to drawings, and a degree of depth and weight that can be easier to convey with 'analogue' rather than 'digital' drawing techniques.\nHowever, manual drafting is now becoming something of a lost art, as; it requires a large amount of space, both for the drawing process, storage and viewing; drawings cannot be linked to digital information, they can take much more time to prepare in comparison with CAD drawings, they are more difficult to correct, text and colour can be more difficult to apply, it is more complicated to create three-dimensional representations and so on.\nManual drafting requires a flat drafting table, drafting or drawing board, typically with a parallel motion, that allows consistent drawing of parallel lines. Drawing boards can often be adjusted in height and angle to suit the user.\nVellum paper was used traditionally for drafting and came supplied in rolls. More recently, drafting paper, standard paper sheets, or tracing paper have become more common as they are less expensive.\nManual drafting tools include:\n- Specialised pencils with varying lead strengths.\n- Technical drawing pens of varying sizes (see technical drawing pen sizes for more information).\n- Colour application pens.\n- Scale rules.\n- Set squares.\n- T squares.\n- Steel rules that are not damaged by being used repeately to draw lines.\n- Drafting tape or clips to secure the corners of the sheet to the board.\n- Pencil sharpeners.\n- Pen cleaners.\n- Scalpel blades for scraping off ink or removing sections of drawings.\n- Clear tape for repairing drawings (this does not show on reproductions)\n- Mechanical lead holders for using various size leads for different parts of the draft.\n- Templates or stencils allowing easy drawing of certain objects, symbols, common shapes, text and so on.\n- Text writing machines.\n- Letraset lettering sheets that can be applied to drawings as a form of transfer. Other sheets include people, trees and other common objects and symbols.\n- Pantone colour and greyscale sheets than can be cut and applied to drawings to bock colour or shade areas.\n- Tipex (which does not show on reproductions).\n- Drawing board attachments that can be fixed to the parallel motion to create specific angles, reproduce lines or change scales.\nLines in manual drafts should be clean and sharp. A straight edge should always be used when manually drafting. A parallel motion, or T-square can be used to draw horizontal lines, and a T-square or set square to draw vertical lines or other common angles. Typically, the bottom of the set square is placed on the top of the parallel motion, and the vertical portion used to draw straight lines. To draw a vertical line using a T-square, the T portion should be placed flat against the top of the drawing board.\nEqual pressure should be applied on the pen or pencil when drawing lines, slightly rotating the point, and not removing it from the paper until the line is completed.\nSprinkling setting powder, or using fixing sprays over pencil lines can help maintain the integrity of the lines when the sheets are folded or rolled, or otherwise brushed against.\n Line weights\nManual drafting techniques typically involve drawing different line weights to represent different items. Different line weights can be created by using a different size mechanical pencil lead, or a different size of technical drawing pen.\nExterior walls are typically drawn on floor plans and sections with heavy, solid lines. Windows may be drawn lighter, or with the same heaviness but in a dash-dot-dash format. Interior walls have slightly lighter line weights. Elements such as fittings should be drawn with the lightest line weight, and sometimes dashed lines.\nIt is important to maintain correct lettering sizes in manual draft, for example:\n- Notes: 3/32 inch letters.\n- Special notes: 1/8 inch letters.\n- Titles: 1/4 inch letters.\nF pencils or technical drawing pens are typically used for lettering, with a small right triangle to draw straight portions of the letter. Curved portions may be drawn freehand. Thicker strokes are used for horizontal lines, thinner strokes for vertical lines. It can be useful to draw light guidelines first to ensure the correct and uniform text height.\nAlternatively, stencils, transfers or writing machines may be used.\nThe use of different scales enables objects and spaces to be depicted at a specific ratio to their actual size, helping to maintain consistency. Suitable scales will vary depending on the size of object, size of paper and level of information that needs to be conveyed, however, floor plans are commonly drawn with a 1/4 inch scale, kitchens and bathrooms with a 1/2 inch scale, wall sections with a 3/4 inch scale and so on.\nThere are a number of techniques of projection that can be used to represent three-dimensional objects in two-dimensions by 'projecting' their image onto a planar surface.\nSee Drawing projections for more information.\nStandard notation conventions should be followed so that there is clear communication between different people and mistakes are avoided.\nSee Notation and units for more information.\nA range of standard symbols and hatching techniques can be used to convey recognised meaning without the need for explanation.\nSee Symbols on architectural drawings for more informaiton.\nSince the 1980's, computer aided design (or computer aided drafting), and more recently, building information modelling have transformed drafting techniques, in particular allowing alterations to be made with relative ease.\nParametric modelling allows the 'automatic' creation of aspects of drawings based on a series of pre-programmed rules. So for example, a rule might be created to ensure that walls must start at floor level and reach the underside of the ceiling. Then if the floor to ceiling height is changed, the walls will automatically adjust to suit. Other examples might include the colour of similar elements, the height of window cills above floor level, the relationship between walls and a pitched roof, and so on.\n Related articles on Designing Buildings Wiki\nFeatured articles and news\nIn the week of the momentous Heathrow decision, we look back at the development and design of T5.\nBSRIA’s flagship event will address performance and wellbeing beyond compliance.\nYoung Architects and Developers Alliance launched to build the relationship between the two disciplines.\nBS 8536-2:2016 Design and construction: Code of practice for asset management (Linear and geographical infrastructure).\nPaying for off-site goods or materials can be useful, but it puts the client at risk.\nPeople power can be transformative if properly informed and inspired.\nZHA win competition to build an Urban Heritage Administration Centre in Saudi Arabia.\nLeaps, not steps, are needed to avoid a ticking time bomb, say BRE in response to Farmer Review.\nA multi-purpose hall in France covered in a translucent orange membrane.\nWinning designs revealed for a rock formation-influenced residential complex in Rennes.\nAn article explaining the techniques, regulations and environmental impacts of carbon capture and storage.\nWatch one of the first documentaries by the acclaimed Adam Curtis, examining the substandard system building of the 1960s.","Equipped with the right applications, a computer can be of great help in virtually any domain of activity.

Environmentalists, farmers, and climate change activists have pushed for a cleaner alternative to traditional energy sources, but the region has long been slow to respond to the changing climate.\nBut now, a group of Southern states is taking action to combat global warming.\nCarbon Capture and Storage\nCarbon is one of the main gases emitted by fossil fuel combustion. Climate change activists have been promoting clean energy, including wind and solar power, in order to avoid fossil fuels. In addition to reducing emissions, cleaner energy sources can create jobs and help preserve areas such as national parks.\nBut fossil fuels can also be used for fuel sources. Both coal and natural gas are created from fossil fuels that have been buried deep underground over centuries. Scientists believe the coal and gas stay buried long after they’re created, but can still cause harm to the environment. Scientists say fossil fuels contribute to a larger problem: climate change.\nCarbon can be captured and stored, but only if the fossil fuel is burned. To make coal and gas more environmentally friendly, some are looking for ways to capture the carbon after the fuel has been burned. The process is called carbon capture and storage, or CCS.\nSouthern States Join Coal and Gas Emissions Freeze\nWith CCS, a large amount of carbon dioxide is injected into the ground, where it is held in place and cannot be released back into the atmosphere.

{"question":"How to ensure business continuity when key IT personnel leave unexpectedly?","answer":"To ensure business continuity when key IT personnel leave, proper documentation is essential. Instead of relying on 'tribal knowledge' (unwritten rules or information known only by specific individuals), organizations should maintain clear, easy-to-access documentation of steps, operations, and responsibilities for each role. This documentation should be updated regularly and include system information, business processes, and procedures. Having solid documentation enables seamless onboarding of new personnel and ensures mission-critical systems and data can be recovered efficiently without having to recreate lost knowledge.","context":["No step is more critical for success in the field of Information Technology than documentation. It’s squarely in the middle of the System Development Life Cycle, but usually left until after testing and deployment. However, when it comes to a successful Disaster Recovery (DR) strategy, documentation is even more important than it is for standard IT functions.\nWhile most companies have at least some plan for data backup and recovery, a DR strategy requires more than just being able to restore lost data.\nA DR plan doesn’t just entail having a backup plan for the data in your servers. It is the overarching document that guides your employees and partners in restoring functionality to your business. Because your technology and systems are constantly being updated or changed, this plan has to be a “living document.” Changes to systems, teams, and architecture must be accounted for in your DR plan as they happen. This information must also be available to everyone responsible for any part of the recovery process. Let’s dive into this a little further and we’ll help you develop a roadmap for documentation of your disaster recovery plan.\nThe Elements of a Good Plan\nA good DR plan document will be detailed, kept up-to-date with current information, and accessible by anyone who needs to refer to it in the case of a disaster. The elements will vary according to your company’s structure, the type of business you have, and what services you have supported by partners like your MSP or Cloud provider.\nThe following is a short list of essential elements that you need to include at a minimum.\nCommunication and Roles\nWho does what and how to get ahold of people are the two most essential needs in the immediate aftermath of the disastrous event. Contact information for all employees and providers essential to the DR needs to be kept up-to-date and readily accessible. Also, each team and team member’s roles in case of an emergency event must be clearly outlined.\nDiagrams of the equipment, infrastructure, and data flow can be an essential part of any necessary restoration or rebuilding.\nSystems and Asset Inventory\nThe Systems and Asset Inventory covers physical assets—like servers and laptops—as well as agreements with providers and agreements with vendors. If you are outsourcing your primary IT and data to an MSP, you will have a shorter list of actual assets, but will need to know exactly what your agreement provides.\nApplication Dependencies and Prioritization\nDetailing which applications interact with others is essential to the plan. Your plan should list the application you need to restart first, identify the apps that are mission critical and those you can delay restarting, as well as the level of priority to recover each. Once determined, these should be outlined in both your internal and external Service Level Agreements (SLAs). You will also need to have a step-by-step roadmap for your administrators to follow, so that systems like point-of-sale payment or customer-facing applications are restored quickly, while those that can be delayed slightly are moved lower down on the list.\nRTO and RPO\nRecovery Time Objective (RTO) is the “deadline” in a disaster recovery situation. It’s determined by evaluating how quickly your system needs to be back online when something goes wrong. Your backup/replication strategy and schedule will determine how recent the data you are restoring will be. You want to make sure the latest backup is not older than the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) you have set. Think about the potential re-work required when you determine RPO – it will be different for every business and sometimes different for individual applications.\nAfter DR events, most industries have regulatory obligations regarding reporting, documentation, and future protection against further instances. Whether HIPAA, Sarbanes-Oxley or PCI SSC—if your business is subject to regulations which require reporting after an outage or breach, this is a must include.\nDifferent Degrees of Disaster\nThe worst-case scenario for a business disaster is obvious—some catastrophic event physically destroys your primary site. Whether a tornado, fire, or man-made disaster, most people can easily understand “what if everything at our primary location were suddenly wiped out?”\nBut there are varying degrees of failures that can occur with your business’s mission critical systems and data that might not be as immediately evident. Partial loss of or corruption of data, security breaches, temporary service outages, even loss of personnel who play key roles can constitute a disaster that can impact your day-to-day operations.\nIf you are using a Managed Services Provider for all or part of your solution, that can mitigate the impact of all of these. But an additional key component is proper documentation, especially in the last case.\nGood Documentation Versus Tribal Knowledge\nWhen key IT personnel are lost (whether voluntarily or accidentally) whatever information they haven’t documented often goes with them. Undocumented information about systems, procedures, or necessary business information is often referred to as “Tribal Knowledge.”\n“A set of unwritten rules or information known by a group of individuals within an organization but not common to others that often contributes significantly to overall quality. Tribal knowledge may be essential to the production of a product or performance of a service but may also be counterintuitive to the process.”—BusinessDictionary.com\nWhen the loss of key employees happens, having solid documentation about the systems and business processes that person was responsible for enables you to seamlessly onboard someone else in that position. In the case of Disaster Recovery, where time is a crucial factor, you do not have the luxury of painstakingly recreating any Tribal Knowledge that is required to get mission critical systems and data to a point of minimum viable recovery. It is imperative that clear, easy-to-access documentation of the steps, operations, and responsibilities of each person be updated regularly and maintained.\nNot Once a Year, But All the Time\nAgain, any Disaster Recovery plan needs to be a “living document.” Your business needs, technology, and the infrastructure you rely on to succeed change at different paces. Effective documentation creates a roadmap for your employees to follow in the event something happens that affects the data or systems that are your business’s lifeblood. Every step in the process that is missing will result in lost time and require backtracking and recreation. Even if 100% of your IT is outsourced, someone needs to know who to call and whose job that is should the worst happen.\nAdditional Resources on This Topic:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:971e7f1d-544b-402d-90fb-bb66f5c37bea>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the main differences between the Turkmen language and Khorasan-Turkish?","answer":"Turkmen and Khorasan-Turkish have notable differences, particularly in their vowel systems. While Turkmen shows a strongly developed opposition of long and short vowels (with vowels like a/ā, e/ǟ, ı/ī, i/ī, o/ō, ö/ȫ, u/ū, and ü/ǖ), Khorasan-Turkish does not display such a pronounced distinction in vowel length. This is one of the key features that establishes Khorasan-Turkish as a separate language from Turkmen, despite being historically considered a branch of Turkmen.","context":["TURKMENS OF PERSIA\nThe Turkmens inhabit an extensive area which stretches from the northwest of Kazakhstan and the adjacent parts of Russia over Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan to northern and northwestern Afghanistan, as well as to northeastern Persia. Turkmens’ area of settlement becomes much larger when the “Turkmens” of the Near East (Turkey, Iraq, and Syria) and China are taken into account. Approximately 400,000 people in the Near East identify themselves as Turkmens, but in reality they are descendents of the Oghuz (see ḠOZZ) immigrants of the 11th-13th centuries. More than a half of these groups, who are not directly related with the Turkmens of Central Asia, are living in the northeastern and central Iraq. The others settle in northern Syria (in the outskirts of Aleppo and along the Syrian-Turkish border) and in Turkey. The “Turkmens” of China (Salars) are partly of Turkmen origin (Salır-Turkmens), but their present language and culture are very different from those of the Turkmens of the Middle East (for the language of the Salars see Hahn, 1988 and Tenishev, 1976). A part of them evidently originate from the Turkmen immigrants from the surroundings of Samarqand, who settled in the region of today’s Chinese provinces Xinjiang, Gansu, and Qinhai from the 14th century onwards (on the problem of the ethnogenesis of the Salars see Ataev, 1993, p. 287 and Dzhikiev, 1991, pp. 244-48).\nThe Turkmens of Persia live in the northeast of the country, in the province of Khorasan (mostly along the border-areas adjacent to Turkmenistan), as well as in the northeastern part of the province of Mazandaran. Estimates on the number of the speakers of Turkmen differ greatly. The numbers vary from around 400,000 to 1,000,000 (Clark, p. 11). In reality, the speakers of the Turkmen language in Persia should number a little more than 400,000. Higher numbers result from counting those who speak Khorasan-Turkish (Ḵorāsāni; see TURKIC LANGUAGES OF PERSIA) which had for a long time been regarded as Turkmen or at least as a branch of Turkmen. Larger numbers can also derive from the fact that the areas of settlement of the speakers of both languages overlap. In the course of the Turcological expeditions of the Department of Turcology and Altaic Studies oft the University of Göttingen to Persia in 1968, 1969, and 1973, the independence of the Khorasan-Turkish language was established (Doerfer and Hesche, 1993, pp. 14-23). Later, these results misled Gerhard Doerfer, who assumed that “the Turkmen language is not spoken in Khorasan at all, if only occasionally, while it is spoken in Astarābād” (tr. from Doerfer, 1978, p. 133). Such a conclusion is as wrong as the numbers given by Larry Clark (1998, p. 11). Besides this, in Persia, the Turkmen language is second only to the Azerbaijani language, which has the largest number of speakers among all Turkic languages of Persia.\nThe Turkmen language of Persia is divided into a number of dialects, which, although they have their specific characteristics, do not differ much from each other. Geographical location and the “tribal affiliation” of the speakers form the background of the dialectal variety. The dialects of Turkmen are spoken in their respective areas, where the members of the corresponding “tribes” live. For example, the Sarık dialect is spoken in Turkmenistan, as well as in Persia and Afghanistan. According to Clark (pp. 17-18), the main dialects of the Turkmen language are: 1. Teke; 1.1. Ahal (sub-dialect of Teke); 1.2. Marı (sub-dialect of Teke); 2. Yomut; 2.1. western Yomut; 2.2. northern Yomut; 3. Ärsarı; 4. Salır; 5. Sarık; 6. Chowdur; 7. Alili; 8. Gökleng; 9. Nohur; and 10. Änew. Except for some “minor dialects,” dialects 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 above are spoken in Persia.\nThe Turkmen language of Persia—in contrast to the Turkmen language of Turkmenistan—is less studied. It was not even taken into account in numerous works on the Turkmen language, like the articles of Louis Bazin (1959) and Johannes Benzing (1939). Karl Heinrich Menges mentioned the Turkmens of Persia, but provided no detailed information about them (Menges, p. 278). The first more or less extensive description was given in 1966 by Yusuf Azmun (Azmun). Later—as the result of the Turcological expeditions undertaken by Gerhard Doerfer and his collaborators—the study of G. Doerfer and W. Hesche followed (Doerfer and Hesche, 1998). In more recent overviews, the Turkmen language of Persia has been taken into consideration, or at least some information about it has been provided (Clark). The Turkmen language of Persia is less investigated than that of Turkmenistan due to the fact that, for a long time, Persia had lacked Turkic studies, and there were just a few specialists interested in the turcophone minorities during the Pahlavi period. In addition to that, possibilities for fieldwork have been quite limited since the Islamic Revolution. On the other side, Soviet Turcologists have compiled very good and comprehensive dictionaries and grammars (Clark, 1988, pp. 22-26).\nThe Turkmen language belongs to the Oghuz group of Turkic languages and forms a separate northwestern branch within it. Turkmen shows the largest number of archaic features among the Oghuz languages, e.g., the preservation of long vowels (see Räsänen). The Turkmen language has the following stock of vowels: a/ā, e/ǟ, ı/ī, i/ī, o/ō; ö/ȫ; u/ū, and ü/ǖ. The Ḵorāsāni (Khorasan-Turkish) language was considered to belong to the Turkmen, while it does not show such a strongly developed opposition of long and short vowels and must be regarded as a language different from the Turkmen. Table 1 below shows the differences in the two languages, and in the dialects of the Turkmen language as well.\nSee TABLE 1 for the pronominal predicate forms in the Ḵorāsāni (Khorasan-Turkish) and in various dialects of Turkmen (I = vowel-change ı/i/u/ü, U = u/ü, A = a/ä, X = x/χ, K = q/k, and x/k; according to Doerfer, 1983, pp. 109-17).\n1 according to Doerfer, 1977-78, pp. 167-75 and Berdyev, pp. 290-94; 2 dialects Teke, Yomut, Salır, etc., according to Berdyev, pp. 386-94 and Arazkuliev, pp. 146 f. and 156; 3 dialects Gökleng, Alili, etc.; 4 dialects Sarıq and Ärsarı.\nThe Turkmen language, which has always been in contact with Iranian languages, particularly Persian, shows a number of borrowings from them. This is especially true for the Turkmen literary idiom which, being created in the middle of the 18th century by Dawlat-Moḥammad Mollā (Dövlet-Mäm(m)et Molla) known as Āzādi (1700-60) and his son Maḵdumquli (Maqtımqulı, 1733-82), has included Persian elements since its earliest times. At the time of the beginnings of the Turkmen literature, this was due to the influence of the Persian language on the education, like it was in the theological institutions in Samarqand, Khiva, Bukhara, etc. which were visited by the founders of the Turkmen literature. In the case of Persian loan words, distinction must be made between the borrowings from Persian directly and the borrowings from Persian through Chaghatay. In the case of the borrowings from Persian directly, again, differentiation is necessary between the loan words from the spoken language and those borrowed from the literary Persian. Beside the great number of Persian loan words in Turkmen (deryā ‘river,’ hemme ‘all,’ mašgala ‘family,’ pagta ‘cotton,’ etc.), one can also find various morphemes, which have found their way into this language. For example, the suffixes +dār, +gar, +keš, etc., as well as the prefixes bī+, bet+ and nǟ+. Some of these morphemes still exist in the spoken language, while others are just non-productive forms in modern times, that is, they exist in literary texts exclusively, or occur in specific composite words, and/or are added to Persian loan words only. Some of these elements, combined with the Turkmen suffixes +lik/+lık and +čilik/+čılık, are also used to form abstract nouns, e.g., betbagtčılık ‘misfortune’ < betbagt ‘unhappy’ (< Pers. badbaḵt +čılık; see Clark, p. 541).\nCertain features that are specific for varieties of the same dialects can be explained by the distribution of the Turkmen settlement areas within the territories of different states, like Persia and the successor-states of the former Soviet Union. Thus, the Russian language influenced the Turkmen dialects of Central Asia for some decades (or even centuries), while the Turkmen dialects of Persia were more exposed to the influence of Persian.\nFor a music sample, see Ilāri.\nS.

{"question":"What are the key differences between presenting evidence through an affidavit versus a remote video deposition in terms of admissibility and procedural requirements?","answer":"Affidavits require specific formatting and signing requirements - they must be divided into numbered paragraphs, signed at the bottom of each page by the deponent and an authorized person, and include a proper jurat with full details. Any attached documents must be properly annexed with identifying statements. In contrast, remote video depositions face additional procedural hurdles, including Constitutional concerns in criminal cases, particularly regarding the Confrontation Clause. They require proper security, reliability, and synced-video transcripts, often necessitating specialized deposition companies to handle technical requirements. The admissibility of remote testimony is typically inversely proportional to the witness's importance to the case, with more important witnesses needing more compelling reasons for not testifying in person.","context":["This fact sheet explains what an affidavit is and when you need to file one. It also gives basic information about what you can and cannot include in an affidavit.\nWhat is an affidavit?\nAn affidavit is a written statement prepared by a party or witness. It is the main way you present evidence (facts of the case) to a court. Any affidavit you file in court to support your case must be served on all parties, including the independent children’s lawyer (if appointed).\nWhen do I file an affidavit?\nIn the Family Court, you need to file an affidavit with an interim application, response or when directed by the Court. The Family Court has a blank affidavit form which can be used by applicants and respondents. In the Federal Circuit Court, you need to file an affidavit with your application or response, for both interim and final orders, and when directed by the Court. The Federal Circuit Court has a blank affidavit form which can be used by applicants and respondents.\nYou should use the form that is relevant to the Court handling your matter. You can get the forms from www.familycourt.gov.au, www.federalcircuitcourt.gov.au by calling 1300 352 000 or at your nearest family law registry.\nCan I prepare my own affidavit?\nAlthough you can prepare your own affidavit, it is often not easy. If you need help preparing your affidavit, you should seek legal advice. You can get legal advice from a:\n- legal aid office\n- community legal centre, or\n- private law firm.\nCourt staff can help you with questions about court forms and the court process, but cannot give you legal advice.\nHow do I structure an affidavit?\nIn the Family Court the affidavit should be typed. In the Federal Circuit Court, the affidavit may be typed or printed clearly on only one side of the page. The content of an affidavit should be divided into paragraphs that are numbered. It is a good idea to divide an affidavit into sections under separate headings; for example, the heading might be ‘Arrangements for the children after separation’ or ‘Property accrued during the marriage/de facto relationship’. Each paragraph should, if possible, cover one topic or subject matter.\nAffidavits by other witnesses\nIf you are relying on evidence from a third party to support your case, such as a family member, friend or professional, you will need to file a separate affidavit on their behalf. You should only file an affidavit by a witness if the evidence is relevant to your case.\nUnless a court orders otherwise, a child (under the age of 18 years) should not prepare an affidavit to support your case.\nWhat can I say in an affidavit?\nAn affidavit is a statement of facts. Therefore, you should include all the facts that are relevant in your case. Importantly, your affidavit should support the orders you have asked the Court to make in your application or response. The length of your affidavit will depend on the complexity of your case. Your affidavit does not need to be lengthy as long as you include all the facts that you are relying on as evidence. Try and leave out things not relevant to what the Court has to decide.\nCan I give my evidence in court instead?\nThere is limited opportunity to give a personal account of your evidence in court. Most evidence is provided by affidavit. This allows a case to run more quickly and efficiently as all parties know what evidence is before the Court.\nWhat should not be included in an affidavit?\nGenerally, an affidavit should not set out the opinion of the person making the affidavit; that is, it must be based on facts not your beliefs or views. The exception is where the person is giving evidence as an expert; for instance, a psychologist or licensed valuer.\nWhere possible you should avoid referring to facts that are based on information received from others (known as hearsay evidence). There are, however, a number of exceptions to the hearsay rule. If you need to rely on hearsay evidence in your affidavit, get legal advice to see whether it would be admissible in court.\nYou should not refer to anything said or documents produced in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of your dispute, as these are not admissible as evidence in Court. There are some exceptions and if you want to refer to these communications you should read section 131 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). If you are unsure about what can and cannot be included in your affidavit, you should seek legal advice.\nIf you refer to a document in your affidavit, you must attach a copy of it to the back of your affidavit (known as an annexure). Examples of an annexure are a contract of sale or a child’s school report. If there is more than one annexure, you need to refer to each one by a number or letter; for example, Annexure 1 or Annexure A. You also need to number the annexures consecutively, that is, from the first page of the first annexure to the last page of the last annexure.\nEach annexure must have a statement signed by the authorised person identifying the annexure as the document referred to in the affidavit. The wording of the statement is:\nThis is the document referred to as Annexure [insert reference number] in the affidavit of [insert deponent’s name], sworn/affirmed at [insert place] on [insert date] before me [authorised person to sign and provide name and qualification].\nThe statement must be signed at the same time as the affidavit and by the same authorised person.\nSigning an affidavit\nThe person making an affidavit (the deponent) must sign the bottom of each page in the presence of an authorised person, such as a lawyer or Justice of the Peace (if you are overseas a Notary Public or Australian Diplomatic/Consulate Officer can witness the signature). On the last page of the affidavit the following details must be set out (known as a jurat):\n- the full name of the person making the affidavit, and their signature\n- whether the affidavit is sworn or affirmed\n- the day and place the person signs the affidavit, and\n- the full name and occupation of the authorised person, and their signature.\nIf any alterations (such as corrections, cross-outs or additions) are made to the affidavit, the person making the affidavit and the witness must initial each alteration.\nFSAFF 0313 V3","We also understand that in this technological age, “confrontation” at some point may take on a meaning that none of us has yet imagined or realized. Despite advances in communication technology, a defendant’s right to a fair trial with all its attendant Constitutional guarantees is our legal and moral obligation to uphold.\nJudge Michael P Barnes, Indiana Court of Appeals\nWilliams v State is one such unpublished opinion from the Indiana Court of Appeals.\nThe Defendant was convicted of murdering an elementary schoolteacher and sentenced to 95 years in prison. Williams v. State, 2012 Ind. App. Unpub. LEXIS 755 (Ind. Ct. App. 2012).\nThe Defendant appealed on multiple grounds, including whether the Skype deposition of a crime lab expert violated the Confrontation Clause and was hearsay. The crime lab witness case involvement included handling a doorknob, a key piece of evidence, with a bloodstain on it.\nThe State requested conducting the video deposition of the witness, because she was unavailable due to retiring and moving out-of-state to care for her “gravely ill and elderly” mother. Williams, at *5-6.\nOver the Defendant’s objections, the Skype deposition was held approximately 2.5 months before trial. The witness was deposed with a Marion County deputy prosecutor, a Cuyahoga County, Ohio, deputy prosecutor, and the lead police detective physically present with her. The Judge presided over the deposition in court, with the Defendant, defense attorney, another deputy prosecutor, and IT personnel. Williams, at *6.\nThe Sixth Amendment requires that “out-of-court testimonial statements by a witness who does not appear at trial are inadmissible unless the witness is unavailable to testify and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.” Williams, at *9, citing Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 53-54, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 1365, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004).\nIndiana Evidence Rule 804(b)(1) states a deposition is admissible hearsay if the deponent is unavailable to testify as a witness at trial. Williams, at *9.\nEvidence Rule 804(a) defines witness unavailability. A witness is unavailable if the witness:\n(1) Is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of the declarant’s statement; or\n(2) Persists in refusing to testify concerning the subject matter of the declarant’s statement despite an order of the court to do so; or\n(3) Testifies to a lack of memory of the subject matter of the declarant’s statement; or\n(4) Is unable to be present or to testify at the hearing because of death or then existing physical or mental illness or infirmity; or\n(5) Is absent from the hearing and the proponent of a statement has been unable to procure the declarant’s attendance by process or other reasonable means.\nThe Court “believed” that the witness’ “unavailability” pushed the law to “the very edge of the envelope,” because it was not the witness’ physical or mental infirmity that prevented her from testifying at trial, but her mother’s illness. Williams, at *10-11. Moreover, the determination the witness was unavailable was two and a half months before trial. Williams, at *11. Additionally, there was no information if the health condition of the witness’ mother changed in that time. Williams, at *11-12.\nDespite the unanswered questions, the Court found that even if the State failed to demonstrate the witness was unavailable, any error was harmless, because the Confrontation Clause “does not require reversal if it can be shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict.” Williams, at *12, citing Koenig v. State, 933 N.E.2d 1271, 1273 (Ind. 2010).\nThe Court explained that the witness’ involvement in the handling the doorknob and bloodstain evidence was “slight” because she “handled the doorknob during the course of the testing process and was involved in the chain of custody of the blood stain swabbed from it, but no more.” Williams, at *13.\nBow Tie Thoughts\nJudges and attorneys in their “normal” lives use technology such as Skype to communicate with family members, friends or hold meetings. This everyday use makes adopting remote video deposition technology easier, because attorneys are comfortable using video conferencing technology.\nSuch an embrace of Skype is a positive thing for cutting costs for travel to remote depositions of secondary witnesses. However, there are always legal issues to consider in using a technology in a way it might not be intended.\nWhile this Court did not outright hold Skype was acceptable for a remote deposition, there are well-established remote deposition companies whose services provide security, reliability and a synced-video transcript. Using such companies could avoid potential notice and procedural requirements in a remote deposition, such as responsibilities of the videographer and oath requirements for swearing in a remote deponent. In short, using one of these companies is a good insurance policy to avoid any procedural challenges to a remote video deposition that otherwise could be overlooked.\nJudge Barnes highlighted there could be real Constitutional issues in criminal cases with remote video testimony. I expect whether a remote video deposition being used at trial will be inversely proportional to how important the witness is to the case. If the witness is very important, their reasons for being unavailable must be very compelling for them not to testify in person."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:577c833e-5d8f-4e41-a2af-e8637f375c59>","<urn:uuid:ee5796fc-893f-4f40-ad1e-b441a3f2ccd0>"],"error":null}

Optoma CinemaX P2\n- 4K UHD + HDR10: Enjoy a high-quality, cinematic home theater...\n- 6-SEGMENT COLOR WHEEL: Experience richer colors and enhanced...\n- BRIGHT, RELIABLE LASER: Laser technology delivers outstanding...\n- ULTRA-SHORT THROW: The CinemaX P2’s space-saving, ultra-short...\n- EASY IMAGE SETUP: Using Optoma’s SmartFIT app, ensure easy...\nThe Optoma CinemaX P2 is our top pick for the best home projector, thanks to its top-of-the-line specs and smart features. For starters, it's compatible with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa voice control while also supporting IFTTT, making it fairly easy to integrate into your smart home or connect to other smart devices. It also comes with the complementary SmartFIT app for quick image alignment and geometry correction.\nThis projector uses a laser phosphor light source with a 6-segment color wheel and dynamic contrast for great overall picture performance. This performance is further enhanced by the true 4K resolution as well as full coverage of the Rec.709 color spectrum. More so, its bright lamp and remarkably short throw make it's suitable for virtually almost all spaces.\nThe Smart+Technology, an Android-based OS, allows you to watch content on the projector right from streaming apps. The P2 also comes with an integrated 40-watt soundbar with Dobly Digital 2.0 support. However, you'll probably need an external system for full surround, but the built-in speakers' sound quality and output are still pretty good.\n2. Optoma UHD50X\n- TRUE 4K ULTRA HD: Experience high-quality home cinema feel with...\n- LAG-FREE GAMING: Introducing the world's first ultra-fast 240Hz...\n- HDR & HLG COMPATIBLE: Enjoy brigher whites and deeper black...\n- DYNAMIC BLACK: Dynamic Black technology provides more depth to...\n- FLEXIBLE INSTALLATION: Whether ceiling mounted or placed on a...\nThe Optoma UHD50X is an excellent choice if you want a projector suited to multi-use space, such as a living room or media room. Its impressively low 16ms input lag and 240Hz refresh rate means this unit can also support 4K gaming on the newest consoles and platforms. These specs are just as beneficial in past-paced sports and movies, delivering a truly great home cinema experience.\nThe 3400-lumen lamp is sufficiently bright for all indoor environments. However, a longer throw distance (9-11 feet for a 100-inch screen) means you'll need a somewhat large space, and more preferably with ceiling mounting. That being said, the 15% vertical lens shift with zoom and keystone correction means you can still get your ideal picture fairly easily.\nThe Optoma UHD50X produces a true 4K resolution picture, using Dynamic Black technology to enhance the contrast further, sharpening the image even more. Additionally, the wider DCI-P3 color gamut is miles ahead of most projectors, giving the overall picture quality more nuance and realism. And it also features HDR tone mapping, which helps maintain color accuracy for an undoubtedly immersive home cinema experience.\n3. Sony VPL-VW590ES\nIn recent years, Sony has produced quite a few native 4K projectors, all high-end and immensely commendable. The 1800-lumen VPL-VW590ES is arguably their best home theater projector. Its color palette focuses more on picture vibrancy and eye-catching appeal, while its shading enhances the image subtlety.\nThis projector's 4K detail is excellent, delivering incredible texture and realism to every part of the image on the screen. Tonal light is equally great in light and dark scenes, as well as mixed lighting scenes, thanks to the Dynamic Iris that helps with pinpoint contrast control. The VPL-VW590ES also stands out from other projectors with its proprietary Sony motion processing, which is nothing short of phenomenal.\nSetting up this projector for your home cinema is quite straightforward. With a 6000-hour lamp life, you'll certainly have a superb viewing experience for at least the next 5 or so years. Plus, a 350,000:1 contrast ratio guarantees a picture quality that'll keep your eyes glued to the screen.\n4. Epson Home Cinema 2250\n- Stunning picture quality — delivers an immersive viewing...\n- Smooth, crisp images — with Image Enhancement and Frame...\n- Built-in Android TV (2) — latest Android TV interface with a...\n- Best-in-Class Color Brightness (1) — advanced 3LCD technology...\n- Ultra bright picture — 2,700 lumens of color and white...\nThe Epson Home Cinema 2250 is possible the best projector you can get for your home cinema on a budget. This unit includes smart features for Google voice control and direct content streaming, a pleasant surprise at the price. On top of that, color production is quite splendid, thanks to the 3LCD display that gets rid of brightness hotspot and rainbowing issues.\nThe main trade-off is perhaps the low 1080p (full HD) resolution. Even though the dynamic contrast ratio is actually pretty high, on-screen detail is still notably less than on a 4K projector. In addition, the integrated speakers aren't particularly outstanding, so you'll most likely have to use external speakers with this home projector.\nAlthough the unit doesn't require a dedicated home theater, you'll still require a fairly large room. But if viewing space is not an issue, this projector has a fairly flexible setup, with a wide 2D keystone correction and a 15 vertical lens shift. Overall, this is a great portable home theater projector with incredible versatility. Factor in the solid build and the Epson Home Cinema 2250 is a definite bang for your buck!\n5. Epson EpiqVision Ultra LS300\n- Stunning Picture Quality up to 120\" – Delivers an immersive,...\n- Sound by Yamaha — Custom-designed audiophile 2.1 speaker system...\n- Built-In Android TV (2) – Latest Android TV interface with a...\n- Ultra-Short Throw Laser Array Technology — Unique multi-array...\n- Elegant Design — Designed with simplicity in mind, the Epson...\nThe EpiqVision Ultra LS300 is a solid contender for the best home theater projector, with its capability to turn any room into a true home theater. Its exceptional ultra-short throw can produce a 100-inch screen with less than a one-foot distance! Moreover, it's remarkably bright, thanks to the 3600-lumen laser diode light source that still delivers excellent picture quality even in high levels of ambient light.\nThe Epson LS300 is equipped with a 3LCD display for a wide color gamut with no rainbowing or flickering. Its high dynamic contrast gives the picture excellent depth and rich black levels. The only drawback is the 1080p maximum resolution, although the multi-diode laser array still delivers better image clarity and sharpness than lamp-based projectors.\nIt also features an Android TV interface that allows you to download streaming apps, such as Hulu and Disney+. Built-in Chromecast support lets you mirror content from your smartphone or tablet. The Ultra LS300 is also equipped with a built-in Yamaha 2.1 10W sound system that equally delivers great audio quality.\nFactors to Consider in the Best Home Theater Projector\nIt's pretty straightforward when it comes to brightness; the brighter the lamp, the better the home projector can maintain image quality with ambient light in the room. In a light-controlled space, say a dark room, brightness as low as 1500 lumens would be enough to deliver sharp, detailed images. However, if the home theater space has windows, or for lights-on viewing, we recommend a brighter lamp with at least 2500-3000 lumens.\nNeedless to say, the more lit the viewing space is, the brighter the lamp needed for crisp image quality. All the home theater projectors on this guide are bright enough for different levels of ambient light. In fact, some, such as the Optoma UHD38 with 4,000 lumens, maintains full-color saturation without any wash-out, even in well-lit spaces.\n2. Picture Quality\nThere are three key aspects to consider to determine the picture quality: resolution, color production and contrast. Nowadays, the best projectors come with a 3840 x 2160 native resolution, more popularly known as 4K Ultra HD. Put into better context, a 4K display produces approximately 4 times the on-screen pixels produced in full HD, delivering significantly enhanced detail and realism.\nOn top of the resolution, it's also important to consider the color gamut, which determines color production. The DCI-P3 spectrum is a wider gamut, containing roughly 50% more colors than the Rec.709 spectrum, typically produced on most TVs and projectors. Contrast is also key to ensure that you get excellent image quality, with rich color, particularly deep blacks.\n3. Throw Distance\nA projector's throw distance basically refers to the range (between the device and the projector screen) required to produce a large image. A short throw distance is necessary for smaller spaces, but it also presents more installation flexibility. Furthermore, it also helps to enhance the overall image quality since the shorter distance means the emitted light is diffused less before it gets to the screen.\nSome of the home entertainment projectors featured on this guide have impressively ultra-short throws. The Epson EpiqVision ULtra LS300 is particularly excellent here. This unit can produce a picture with as little as an inch between the lens and the wall, and it only needs approximately 1 foot to produce a 100-inch screen.\n4. Smart Features\nCapabilities suchlike direct streaming interfaces and voice control support are rapidly becoming standard on the best home theater projectors. If you opt for a projector that doesn't support your preferred streaming services, wireless connectivity is essential, allowing you to mirror content from your smartphone or tablet.\nCompatibility with Google or Alexa voice control is also worth your consideration. It allows you to integrate the projector into a smart home theater, meaning you never have to get off the couch during movie night. For this, you can look out for projectors that have built-in support for IFTTT.\n5. Native Aspect Ratio\nGenerally, projectors come with a fixed resolution display, more commonly known as the native aspect ratio. The most common aspect ratios for the best projectors are 4:3, 16:10 and 16:9. This means the chip (a tiny version of the image displayed on the screen) in the projector is shaped in the specified 4:3, 16:10 or 16:9 proportions.\nA 16:9 native aspect ratio is designed mostly for home theater use. This is primarily because widescreen DVD, Blu-ray and even HDTV signals are encoded or broadcast in the 16:9 format. In addition, home theater enthusiasts also lean towards the 16:9 aspect ratio because it's closer to the original 35mm film format. A 4:3 projector can also display widescreen images, but unfortunately, there will be letterboxing (tiny black bars that normally appear on the top and bottom of the image).\nQuick Tip: The 16:9 mode on your home theater projector should be used ONLY with anamorphic DVDs. Set the DVD player to output to a 16:9 screen and the projector to 16:9 mode to get the desired results.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s) on Home Theater Projectors\n1. How long should a home theater projector last?\nHome entertainment projectors are usually built to last a decent while. A new LED projector lasts for as long as 20,000 hours of use. An LCD projector, just like a DLP projector, typically has a lamp life between 2000-4000 hours. Lamp projectors will last somewhere between 1,000 to 4,000 hours of use, which is roughly 5 years. The best part is, projector lamps can be replaced quite easily when they burn out.\n2. Should I mount my projector on the ceiling or set it on a tabletop?\nEach option has its perks and downsides, and it all boils down to your personal needs and preferences:\na). Ceiling Mounting\n- Gets the projector out of the way, creating a more polished look in the viewing area and at the same time keeping your projector secure.\n- Saves you the hassle of setting up the projector for each use.\n- However, you will have to know the ideal throw distance between the projector and your screen before installation.\nb). Table Top Projection\n- A typical portable projector weighs less than 20lbs, therefore easy to transport from location to location.\n- However, you'll have to set up the projector for each use.\n- The primary viewing area might not have a neat look, especially since the projector will be visible.\n- Should preferably consider a projector with minimal fan noise, around 30dB or lower for 'whisper quiet' fans.\nQuick Tip: Buy the projector before the screen. Install the projector first, then use it for a short while to determine which screen best fits your needs. This also allows you to ensure the projector meets your expectations.","4K SXRD Home Theater Projector\nNative 4K resolution for lifelike pictures\nWith more than four times the resolution of Full HD, native 4K offers 8.8 million pixels (4096 x 2160) for a picture that’s so incredibly lifelike, it’s like looking at the real thing, which is why it is the resolution defined by the DCI (Digital Cinema Initiative) for theatre distribution.

{"question":"How do ammonia's toxic effects differ when comparing its impact on human health through household cleaner exposure versus its effects on fish in aquarium environments? Please detail the specific health consequences for both scenarios.","answer":"In human health contexts through household cleaner exposure, ammonia causes: irritation to skin/eyes (potentially leading to blindness), asthma, chronic bronchitis, and severe burns at higher concentrations. Additionally, it creates lethal fumes when mixed with chlorine products. In aquarium environments, ammonia's effects on fish include: damage to gill membranes, prevention of normal respiration, immune system suppression, increased disease susceptibility, and rapid death at high levels. Even trace amounts stress fish significantly. Ammonia continuously accumulates in aquariums through fish waste and uneaten food, requiring regular monitoring and maintenance of biological filtration systems to prevent fish deaths.","context":["You love keeping your place clean and healthy. But if you’ve ever looked at the ingredient list of conventional household cleaners, you’ll know that, even though they’ve got the “cleaning” part down, the same can’t be said for the “healthy” part.\nWhen we examined what’s in conventional household cleaners, we were shocked by what we found. (Spoiler alert: they’re really toxic).\nAnd today we’re sharing these findings with you.\nWe’ve put together a list of the most dangerous chemicals in household cleaners. Use this post to sort through your household cleaning products and stop exposing yourself (and your family) to harmful substances.\nWe’ve also researched some natural alternatives to household cleaning products, all vetted by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) to equip you with some safe home cleaning product options that you can switch to.\nIf natural DIY cleaning recipes are more your style, we’ll also tell you about ingredients that have even amazed researchers when they tested their cleaning power.\nWithout further ado, here are the most toxic ingredients in your household cleaners.\nHarmful chemicals in household cleaners\nPhthalates are nasty because they disrupt your endocrine system – meaning your hormones, which are important for the proper functioning of several body systems, especially the reproductive system.\nThey accumulate in your body over time. Your body acquires them both through contact with your skin and inhalation (or ingestion).\nPhthalates commonly lurk in soaps of all kinds (including shampoos, hand soaps, body washes, and dish soap), hair sprays, anything containing artificial fragrance (including household cleaners and baby wipes), and even toilet paper.\nCheck the ingredient list of your household cleaning products to make sure they do not contain phthalates. According to the National Academies Press, these are the most commonly found phthalates:\n- DMP – Dimethyl phthalate\n- DEP – Diethyl phthalate\n- DBP – Dibutyl phthalate\n- DIBP – Diisobutyl Phthalate\n- BBP – Benzylbutylphthalate\n- DEHP – Diethylhexyl phthalate or DOP – dioctyl phthalate\n- DINP – Diisononyl phthalate\nUnfortunately, there are far more than can be listed here. Suffice it to say: if there’s an ingredient that ends with the word “phthalate”, or that is listed as an acronym that ends in “P”, steer clear of it.\n2. Perchloroethylene (PERC) or Tetrachloroethylene\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has classified perchloroethylene as a potential human carcinogen.\nIt also wreaks havoc on your nervous system. Symptoms of exposure include neurological effects, behavioral changes, impairment of coordination, sleepiness, dizziness, and loss of consciousness. (Yikes!)\nIt can also irritate your respiratory tract and cause eye and kidney problems. This is mega-bad stuff, folks.\nPerchloroethylene is most commonly found in dry-cleaning products. That’s why it’s super important to only go to a dry-cleaner that refrains from using perchloroethylene.\nShould you encounter household cleaning products that include perchloroethylene on the ingredient list, it’s important to avoid inhalation and contact with the skin.\n3. Quarternary ammonium compounds, or “Quats”\nThese chemicals can be found in products like floor cleaners, fabric softeners, oven cleaners, hard-water-stain removers, toilet cleaners, stove top cleaners, all-purpose household cleaners, and in chemically-based antibacterial products.\nLike the recently-banned triclosan, Quats promote the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. According to the EWG’s Healthy Guide to Cleaning, Quats should not be inhaled or come into contact with skin.\nThe best way to avoid these ingredients is to avoid using chemical disinfectants and store-bought fabric softener. (Vinegar is a great alternative on both counts).\nIf that’s not your style, we have created a list of common Quats so you can check the ingredients of your products:\n- Babassuamidopropalkonium chloride\n- Behentrimonium chloride\n- Behentrimoniu methosulfate\n- Benzalkonium chloride\n- Cetalkonium chloride\n- Grapefruit seed extract (…I know! But this stuff is actually\nheavily processed with intense chemicals, hence the Quats.)\nGuar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride\n- Methylbenzethonium chloride\n- Stearalkonium chloride\n- Vegetable oil quaternary\nThis is what gives the household cleaner products in your cabinet—multipurpose cleaners, kitchen cleaners, bathroom cleaners, and window cleaners—their sweet smell.\nAccording to the EPA, exposure to 2-butoxythanol enters your body through skin contact, inhalation, and/or ingestion. Once inside, it can damage your red blood cells and liver, depress your central nervous system, and cause cancer.\nProducts that contain 2-butoxythanol can be dangerous to your health, and should be avoided.\nAlthough many people believe they will be fine as long as they use the product in a well-ventilated room, our two cents is: why be so cavalier with your health? After all, if it’s a scented product and you can smell it, then you’re breathing it in.\nWe recommend using safer alternatives like water, vinegar, lemon juice, salt, baking soda, and hydrogen peroxide (available at any drugstore).\n5. Ammonium hydroxide\nAmmonium hydroxide is found in glass cleaners and polishing agents for sinks and bathroom fixtures, as well as oven cleaners, drain openers, toilet cleaners, stove top cleaners, and all-purpose household cleaners.\nThis substance can be dangerous if inhaled, leading to asthma and chronic bronchitis.\nAccording to the New York State Department of Health, exposure to this chemical even at low concentrations leads to skin or eye irritation, and even blindness. Higher concentrations cause severe injury and burns.\nAmmonia that comes into contact with products containing chlorine (including bleach) gives off fatal fumes.\nThis is why we recommend staying away from products that include ammonia.\n6. Chlorine (sodium hypochlorite)\nIf you use bleach, toilet bowl cleaners, laundry whiteners, scouring powders, oven cleaners, drain openers, hard water stain removers, stove top cleaners, household cleaners, or mildew removers, you may be exposing yourself to chlorine.\nAccording to The New York State Department of Health, chlorine can lead to airway irritation, wheezing, difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough, chest tightness, eye irritation, and skin irritation (learn more about things you should never put on your skin).\nAs we saw, chlorine produces a poisonous (potentially fatal) gas when it comes into contact with ammonia. This combination can happen even if you are not mixing bleach with other cleaning products. For example, urine naturally contains ammonia. Therefore, using chlorine to clean a diaper pail, kitty litter box, or urine mess can inadvertently release poison gas.\nChlorine also gives off poisonous gas when it comes into contact with anything acidic–which includes vinegar, lemon juice, window cleaners, drain cleaners, and other types of cleaning products.\nChlorine bleaches are harmful in other ways besides creating poison gas. They kill germs in a heavy-handed way that helps to create drug-resistant “superbugs”.\nChlorine is also highly corrosive, and can damage the surfaces and materials in your home. Chlorine bleach should never be used on wood, paper, stone (including stone countertops), tile, grout, or fabric, because it corrodes these materials. It also shouldn’t be used on anything metal.\n7. Coal tar dyes (aniline)\nThe National Toxicology Program and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have found coal tar to be carcinogenic. Also, the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics warns of exposing your skin to coal tar.\nRemarkably, many household cleaning products include coal tar dyes even though they serve no purpose in the cleaning function!\nTo spot coal tar dyes, look out for these ingredients on cleaning product labels:\n- Coal tar solution\n- Coal tar solution\n- Coal tar solution USP\n- Crude coal tar\n- KC 261\n- Picis carbonis\n- High solvent naphtha\n- Naphtha distillate\n- Benzin B70\n- Petroleum benzine\n8. Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs)\nA study published in the Oxford Journal of Toxicological Sciences has shown that nonylphenol ethoxylates affect your endocrine (hormone) system and harm male reproductive capabilities.\nNonylphenol ethoxylates are found in numerous cleaning products, including stain removers, toilet bowl cleaners, all-purpose cleaners, air fresheners, degreasers, liquid laundry detergents, and car wash products.\nOur suggestion: avoid the NPEs. Instead, use genuinely natural cleaning products made from good ingredients.\nHere’s a list of Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs) to look out for on your household cleaning products:\n- 2-(p-Nonylphenoxy) ethanol\n- 2-(2-(p-Nonylphenoxy)ethoxy) ethanol\n- p-Nonylphenol polyethylene glycol ether\n- Nonylphenol hepta(oxyethylene)ethanol\n- Nonylphenol nona(oxyethylene)ethanol\n- Onylphenoxy ethanol\n- Oxirane, methyl-, polymer with oxirane, mono(nonylphenyl) ether\n- 2-(2-(2-(2-(p-Nonylphenoxy)ethoxy) ethoxy)ethoxy) ethanol\n- Nonylphenol polyethylene glycol ether\n- Ethanol, 2-[2-(nonylphenoxy)ethoxy]-\n- Nonylphenol ethoxylate\n- Poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), alpha-(nonylphenyl)-omega- hydroxy-, phosphate\n- Nonylphenol ethoxylate\n- Ammonium salt of sulphated nonylphenol ethoxylate\n- Poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), alpha(isononylphenyl) omega-hydroxy\n9. Sodium dichloroisocyanurate dihydrate\nThis ingredient has been found to seriously irritate the respiratory system and eyes. Inhaling its fumes or dust causes respiratory damage.\nHands should be washed upon contact, as sodium dichloroisocyanurate dihydrate can also severely irritate the skin.\nThis ingredient is commonly found in deodorizers, surface cleaners, toilet bowl cleaners, and disinfectants.\nNow that you know some of the worst common ingredients in cleaning products, and no longer want to use them, how do you get rid of them?\nHow to safely dispose of products containing these ingredients\nHere are a few tips to keep in mind in order to do this the right way.\nWhat NOT to do:\n- Do NOT pour these products down the drain (as this will contaminate the environment and your local water supply)\n- Do NOT toss them in the garbage (as the container will eventually leak, causing the toxins inside to leach into the ground and groundwater).\nWhat to do:\n- Drop them off at your local collection point for toxic household products. Most local governments offer at least one “hazardous waste” collection day per year; if you live in a big city, your local collection point might be open several days a week. A quick web search will reveal what’s available in your area.\n- Talk to members of your household about the dangers of these products in order to prevent them from reappearing in your cupboards.\n- Choose safer alternatives. Water, club soda, hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, lemon juice, salt, baking soda, non-chemically-based dish soap, and good old-fashioned elbow grease are wonderfully versatile cleaning agents. When you are armed with knowledge about the clever uses of each, no household grime will stand a chance.\nReady to learn more?\nDIY natural household cleaners for cleaning your home\nIf you want to stop using conventional household cleaners, the good news is that there are many natural alternatives available to you that work well, especially for removing hard water stains.\nVinegar is one of them.\nA study published in Environmental Health showed that vinegar can be used as a household cleaner. Tests have shown that it kills 98.6% of common bacteria found in households. Vinegar’s acidity also helps it to dissolve dirt and grime.\nIt’s a simple, all-natural substitute to conventional cleaners and well-suited for cleaning windows, blinds, kitchen appliances, bathtubs, shower floors, sinks, stove tops, and many other areas in your home. (Just don’t use vinegar on marble or granite countertops, because the acidity can etch the stone). Lemon juice substitutes well for vinegar.\nAnother ingredient that makes for a great DIY household cleaner is baking soda. Sprinkling some baking soda onto a moist cloth is a great for cleaning surfaces like kitchen counters, sinks, tiles and other areas.\nWhat if you don’t like the smell of vinegar, and are looking for a stronger cleaner than baking soda? Then you can choose from a number of carefully-formulated natural cleaning products.\nThere’s one important caveat though. You need to ensure that each product you buy is truly safe for your health, and isn’t just a marketing hoax.\nIn the next section we’re going to walk you through what to look out for when choosing a truly natural household cleaner.\nNatural alternatives to conventional cleaning products\nThere are some amazing natural cleaners available that facilitate your move away from toxic household cleaners to healthy, natural alternatives.\nBut don’t take a product’s packaging at face value. As consumers have grown more health-conscious, manufacturers have gotten increasingly clever at leading us to believe that their products are “green,” even when they’re not.\nAn independent study by The Sins of Greenwashing found that only 4.5% of products that claim to be healthy and environmentally friendly actually live up to their promise.\nThe most common sins that manufacturers commit include:\n- Cherry-picking certain positive attributes without mentioning a product’s weightier harms (e.g., organic cigarettes; sugary cereal fortified with iron; a cleaning product that contains essential oils alongside really harmful ingredients.)\n- Making vague promises, or not providing any proof for claims (e.g., “MSM is known as the ‘beauty mineral’.”)\n- Designing product labels in “earthy” tones, or using retro / nostalgic / childlike graphic design to imply that a product is wholesome.\n- Making meaningless “green” claims (e.g., advertising a product as “CFC-free” even though CFC is a universally-banned substance.)\n- Implying that a harmful ingredient is safe by offering irrelevant information about it (e.g. “laureth-7 (plant-derived cleaning ingredient)”).\n- Making outright false statements about a product’s environmental impact.\nThe surest way to protect yourself from harmful ingredients –and from marketers’ greenwashing attempts– is to read a product’s full ingredient list.\nThe list of dangerous chemicals in household cleaners that we presented in this post can help you to a certain extent to spot dangerous ingredients and identify greenwashers.\nAt the same time, chances are you will quickly run into ingredients on product labels that you do not recognize. When that happens, ignore anything the manufacturer may say on the label or website (e.g. “plant-derived”) to attempt to explain the ingredient away. Instead, look up the ingredient or product in the EWG database.\nThe EWG database is a powerful tool that helps you to see through a company’s marketing communications and spot ingredients that can harm your health.\nBut in case you don’t have time for that, we created a list of common cleaning products that got excellent scores for health and sustainability from the EWG:\nTheir natural laundry soap gets your clothes clean, makes them smell great, and all of this without any (and we mean any) harsh or toxic substances.\nHere’s their ingredient list:\nWater, Decyl glucoside, Sodium oleate, Glycerin, Caprylyl glucoside, Lauryl glucoside, Sodium chloride, Sodium gluconate, Carboxymethyl cellulose, Alpha-amylase, Protease, Lipase, Citrus Limon (Jade lemon) peel oil, Citrus aurantium bergamia (Bergamot) peel oil (Furocoumarin-free), Syzygium aromaticum (Clove) bud oil, Citrus limon (Lemon) peel oil, Cinnamomum zeylanicum (Cinnamon) bark oil, Eucalyptus radiata oil, Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary) leaf oil.\nWe checked each ingredient individually to ensure the formula is safe, and we were very pleased with the result. This is a truly natural product that we’re happy to recommend. You can check for yourself in the EWG database to see if you agree and then read what other customer had to say about this amazing product.\nThis next cleaner easily removes food residue on your countertop and dinner table. It works great in your bathroom, even electronic gadgets, hardwood floors, granite, glass, metal, painted surfaces, plastic, porcelain, stainless steel, and any other solid surface.\nAnd all of this without using any harsh and toxic ingredients.\nThe ingredients of this all-purpose cleaner are: lavender oil, grapefruit oil, coco-glucoside, lauryl glucoside, ethanol, and water.\nThe EWG gave this product an “A” rating, and you can check out how the individual ingredients were rated in the EWG Guide to Healthy Cleaning database.\nHaving a natural all-purpose cleaner in your household can be very handy, especially since there’s no natural alternative for some types of special cleaning products.\nThis is one example where a natural all-purpose cleaner comes in handy and if you happen to have a glass or ceramic stovetop, and want a simple, non-toxic solution, then a stove-top scraper can serve you in addition.\nDue to the especially harsh toxins in conventional toilet bowl cleaners, you should consider using a natural alternative to protect yourself and your family.\nWe found a toilet bowl cleaner that was formulated without ingredients that compromise your health. You can read the reviews here:\nNot all Seventh Generation products are of equally high quality. However, we are happy to recommend Seventh Generation’s Toilet Bowl Natural Cleaner, Emerald Cypress & Fir because the formulation is so non-toxic that the EWG gave it an “A” rating.\nDish soap is another household cleaner product that contains ingredients that are more harmful than most people would expect.\nConventional dish soaps often contain ingredients like:\n- Benzisothiazolinone (leads to skin irritation or damaged skin)\n- Dipropylene glycol (causes cancer, damages DNA, irritates or damages skin, damages vision, affects respiratory, digestive, nervous, endocrine, and reproductive systems.\n- Fragrance (unspecified ingredient used to hide a large number of toxic chemicals)\n- Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (affects your digestive system)\n- Methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone (irritates and sensitizes skin, causes allergic contact dermatitis)\n- Polysorbate-20 (damages DNA, causes cancer, developmental, endocrine, and reproductive problems, affects respiratory, nervous, and digestive systems, irritates or damages skin, and damages vision)\n- Sodium laureth sulfate and sodium lauryl sulfate (damages DNA, affects many body systems including respiratory, endocrine, reproductive, digestive, and nervous systems, and causes cancer)\nYour dishes are what you eat from. Your (moist) food spends time on the dishes, and picks up any chemical residue lingering on it– which is why the chemicals in your dish soap matter more than any other household cleaning product in your house.\nHere’s an all-natural dish soap we’re excited to recommend. It’s made from just six easy-to-understand ingredients:\n- Distilled water\n- Vegetable glycerin\n- Coconut oil\n- Castor oil\n- Lavender essential oil\nNow that you’ve learned which ingredients in household cleaners to avoid, find out how to detox your body naturally in 8 sure-fire steps.\nAnd if you wanna read more about how to keep your home sparkling clean, here’s a list of the top 100 house cleaning and housekeeping blogs.\nHey there reader!

We always love to hear from you!","API Ammonia Test Kit\nSalicylate test measures ammonia levels in both fresh & saltwater aquariums. Ammonia, the #1 killer of tropical fish, is continually produced in the aquarium from fish waste & uneaten fish food. Tests ammonia levels from 0 to 8 ppm. Test kit of 110 tests.\nWhy test for Ammonia?\nTropical fish continually release ammonia (NH3) directly into the aquarium through their gills, urine, and solid waste. Uneaten food and other decaying organic matter also add ammonia to the water. A natural mechanism exists that controls ammonia in the aquarium – the biological filter. It is made up of nitrifying bacteria, which live in the gravel bed. However, as with any natural process, imbalances can occur. Testing for the presence of toxic ammonia is essential, so that once detected, steps can be taken to remove it. Otherwise, ammonia in the aquarium will damage gill membranes, and prevent fish from carrying on normal respiration. High levels of ammonia quickly lead to fish death. Even trace amounts stress fish, suppressing their immune system and thereby increasing the likelihood of disease outbreaks and subsequent fish loss.\nThis salicylate based ammonia test kit reads the total ammonia level in parts per million (ppm) which are equivalent to milligrams per Liter (mg/L) from 0 ppm to 8.0 ppm (mg/L), in either fresh or saltwater aquariums. Thus, there are two Ammonia Test Color Charts — one for freshwater aquariums, and one for saltwater aquariums — so be sure to use the correct chart for your type of aquarium when interpreting test results. The Freshwater Ammonia Test Color Chart is the appropriate chart to use for testing freshwater aquariums to which salt has been added.\nDirections for Testing Ammonia Levels\n- Read thoroughly before testing. Do not allow Test Solutions to get into aquarium.\n- To remove childproof safety cap: With one hand, push red tab left with thumb while unscrewing cap with free hand.\n- Fill a clean test tube with 5 ml of water to be tested (to the line on the tube).\n- Add 8 drops from Ammonia Test Solution Bottle #1, holding the dropper bottle upside down in a completely vertical position to assure uniformity of drops added to the water sample.\n- Add 8 drops from Ammonia Test Solution Bottle #2, holding the dropper bottle upside down in a completely vertical position to assure uniformity of drops added to the water sample.\n- Cap the test tube and shake vigorously for 5 seconds. Do not hold finger over the open end of the tube, as this may affect the test results.\n- Wait 5 minutes for the color to develop.\n- Read the test results by matching the test solution against the Ammonia Test Color Chart. The tube should be viewed against the white area beside the color chart. Color comparisons are best made in a well-lit area. The closest match indicates the ppm (mg/L) of ammonia in the water sample. Rinse the test tube with clean water after each use.\nWhat the Test Results Mean:\nIn a new freshwater or saltwater aquarium, the ammonia level may surge to 6 ppm (mg/L) or more, and then fall rapidly as the biological filter becomes established. The ammonia will be converted to nitrite (also toxic), then to nitrate. This process may take several weeks. Use Aquarium Pharmaceuticals STRESS ZYME® to speed up the development of the biological filter. In an established aquarium, the ammonia level should always remain at 0 ppm (mg/L). The presence of ammonia indicates possible over-feeding, too many fish, or inadequate biological filtration.\nThe ammonia level is not an indication of the nitrite level; nitrite is another toxic waste material which must be tested separately.\nMonitoring Ammonia Levels:\nRegular testing is necessary to make sure the ammonia level is safe. Aquarium water should be tested for ammonia every other day when the aquarium is first set up, and once a week after the biological filter has been established (in about 4 to 6 weeks).\nChanging 25% of the aquarium water will reduce the ammonia level in emergency situations. In situations where animals are present, daily testing and water changes may be required over several days until ammonia levels fall naturally. The use of a bacterial cycling agent such as Stress Zyme to innoculate the aquarium, in conjunction with an ammonia-neutralizing water conditioner may also be beneficial.\n- HARMFUL & CORROSIVE C\n- Bottle #2 contains sodium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite\n- Causes severe burns\n- Contact with acids liberates toxic gas\n- Toxic by inhalation, in contact with skin and if swallowed\n- Danger of cumulative effects\n- Keep locked up and out of the reach of children\n- Keep away from food, drink and animal feeding stuffs\n- In case of contact with eyes, rinse immediately with plenty of water (at least 15 minutes) and seek medical advice immediately. If contact lenses are present, remove after 5 minutes and continue rinsing\n- After contact with skin, wash immediately with plenty of water. Remove contaminated clothing\n- Wear suitable gloves and eye/face protection\n- In case of accident or if you feel unwell, seek medical advice immediately (show label where possible)\n- Do not mix with acidic materials"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c452bc92-a827-46c9-b36e-97d7fb72ea81>","<urn:uuid:6be96764-0080-4490-acf5-dac75c5f0b8d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm researching ancient writing systems. Which emerged earlier and had more cultural impact - the Phoenician alphabet or Sumerian cuneiform?","answer":"Based on the historical evidence, Sumerian cuneiform emerged earlier, dating back to around 3200 BCE, while the Phoenician alphabet was developed around 1200 BCE. However, both systems had significant but different cultural impacts. Cuneiform was the first organized writing system, primarily used for taxation and transactions. The Phoenician alphabet was revolutionary in its simplicity, using just 22 characters to represent sounds rather than thousands of symbols. While cuneiform was the pioneer of writing systems, the Phoenician alphabet had a more lasting influence as it directly led to the Greek alphabet and eventually evolved into our Modern Roman alphabet. It also influenced the Early Aramaic, Nabatian, and Arabic alphabets.","context":["The Phoenician Empire\nThe Mediterranean Sea has spawned many civilizations through history. The Phoenicians, which originated around 1200 BCE, is one example. Despite the rather small size of this civilization, its impact on our world has been considerable. Being a seafaring nation, the Phoenicians established colonies all over the Mediterranean area, including the present-day cities of Carthage and Tripoli. As notable traders, they shared cultures with many nations, which allowed their invention of the alphabet to spread throughout Eurasia. The Phoenician Empire\ncontinued to evolve until its eventual incorporation into the Persian and Macedonian Empires, around 400 BCE.\nPhoenicia is an ancient region lying on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The Empire peaked at around 1000 BCE, and developed until around 700 BCE. Phoenicia, now known as Lebanon, Syria, and Israel, was naturally isolated from other civilizations by the Lebanon Mountains in the east, and the great sea on the west. The small region stretched about 320 kilometers long and about 25 kilometers wide. This geographical isolation gave the Phoenicians enough protection to evolve into a strong nation, while giving it the freedom to trade and explore across the Mediterranean.\nAlthough little is known about the ancient civilization, it is known that the government was, at least in part, a monarchy. Royalty was considered a matter of divine descent, so kings could not be chosen outside of the royal family. The merchant families also held much power in Phoenicia, due to their great influence\nin public affairs. Although the name Phoenicia implies that the civilization was a unified state, the nation consisted of separate city-kingdoms. Each Phoenician City was considered independent from one another, and was ruled by its own king.\nPhoenicians were known as the most distinguished seafaring traders and merchants of the ancient world\n. In fact, they called themselves Kena'ani (or Canaanites), which is Hebrew for \"Merchant\". They established trading colonies all over the Mediterranean Sea, including Carthage, Simyra, Zarephath, Byblos, and Tyre (Sur). Maritime trading also reached into the Atlantic Ocean to England. Some of the goods traded included glass, color dyes, metals, horses, ebony and ivory, linen, coral, honey, spices, oil and precious stones.\nMaritime trading would not be possible for the Phoenicians without developed nautical technology. Phoenicians were known for having extremely advanced ships and navigation. Ships were built with a keeled hull, which allowed them to travel on the open seas. These ships used both oars and large square sails that were supported on high masts to propel themselves. Phoenicians also built strong warships complete with battering rams and iron bows to defend against enemy ships. Phoenicians are also credited as the first civilization to use Polaris (the North Star) in navigation.\nPhoenician crafts were an important part of their trading industry. The civilization was famous for its Tyrian purple dye, often considered worth its weight in gold, which was extracted from Murex sea snails. The dye was used on expensive linen, and later used in royal garments of the nations the traded with Phoenicia. Using imported materials, Phoenicians also specialized in glass production, and perfected the production of transparent glass. Other crafts include wine making and metallurgy. The latter was used in currency. Interestingly enough, a coin produced in Phoenicia, which bares a map of the world, included what resembles the American continents! However, questions on weather the Phoenicians actually discovered the Americas remain unanswered.\nOne of the most important Phoenician contributions to humanity was its 22-character alphabet. It was a revolutionary in that it highly simplified the process of reading and writing. Prior to this invention, societies had to create thousands of symbols for the thousand of words in their language. The Phoenician alphabet uses the 22 characters to represent 22 different sounds, which when put together, form a word.\nAlthough the alphabet leaves out vowel sounds, it directly led to the Greek alphabet. Later, it evolved even further to become our Modern Roman alphabet. The Phoenician alphabet also closely compares to the Early Aramaic, Nabatian, and Arabic alphabets.\nAlthough the Phoenician Empire did not leave a very conspicuous trail in its path, its contributions to human civilization are of great importance. Being the most noteworthy seafaring and trading nations of its time, the Phoenicians connected Mediterranean cultures by establishing trade routes throughout Eurasia. Specialized crafts of the society included glass production, metallurgy, and textiles. The biggest contribution of the society was the phonetic (the word usage is not a coincidence) alphabet, which later evolved into the Modern Roman alphabet we use today.","What civilization was responsible for the development of writing?\nThe beginning of writing has its inception in \"hash marks\" used for counting by people living 50,000 years Before Christ (B.C.). These marks slowly took on more complexity. By 4,000 B.C. the marks had gotten very complex and were used to convey detailed bits of information. In the Indus Valley, some peoples were using such marks to decorate pottery but the marks didn't convey enough cohesive information to be qualified as writing. Writing is defined as an organized and consistent system of graphemes that conveys both concrete and abstract information [grapheme: the minimal unit of a writing system (a, b, c, etc)]. The first to develop such a system were the Sumerians who developed an organized system of graphemes to use in taxation transactions to keep information organized in such a way that all participants in a taxation transaction knew the same things and could agree to the same actions and outcomes. From this beginning, the whole Sumerian writing system developed that later met the definition of an organized system of graphemes for conveying both concrete and abstract information.\n[For more detail, see the article \"The Invention of Writing\" at Erasmatazz.com from which this answer is drawn.]\nI agree with all of the previous answers that state the oldest form of writng (cuniform) is attributed to the ancient Sumerians of Mesopotamia 3200 B.C.E. However, recent archaeological discoveries in Egypt by Gunter Dreyer, German Archaeological Institute in Cario might tell a different story. The small tags he found in the tomb of King Scorpion I date from 3400-3200 B.C.E. suggesting that there might be a two hundred year window that could possibly change the answer to your question, which is why your question is so important to human history. It is vital that those who study our human origins through historical method continue to measure their evidence with that of the archaeological evidence. The quest to understand and correctly document the human experience is ever changing, therefore new information/evidence that has academic merit should always be acknowledged.\nWe do not know this for sure, because some culture might have been writing on wood or papyrus or something and its writings could have been lost because they rotted. However, the first writing we know of was invented by the Sumerian culture of Mesopotamia. This writing was done with a stylus on wet clay. It is known as cuneiform. The word \"cuneiform\" means \"wedge-shaped.\" This term is used because that is what shape the characters generally were.\nThis type of writing was being used as long as five thousand years before the present time.\nWriting has developed with as a series of innovations and and improvement, that took place over a period of around 20,000 years, in ways of representing information in form of pictures and symbols made on plain surfaces. Perhaps, thousands of people from different parts of the world have contributed such development, in prehistoric and ancient era. There are no historical evidence available to to identify any one person or even a small group of person as inventors of writing.\nThe origin of writing can be seen in drawings made on walls of caves, more than 20.000 years back to describe some events. Writing of this type conveyed meaning without depending on knowledge of any particular language. Many scholars believe that writings that depended use of symbols defined by a system of language were first developed by Sumerians around 3500 B.C. This system of writing called cuneiform was very complex with use many symbols that represented words and syllables. Earliest system of writing using a system of alphabets is believed to have been developed by Semites around 1500 B.C.\nIn many ancient communities, writing had an important role, especially since the writing system was known only to certain people. They were considered privileged and keepers of the gift of the gods. Egyptians, Mayans, Chinese, everyone saw writing as a gift from God. Thus, the invention of writing was attributed, by the ancient Egyptian,to the god named Thoth, who had given them the arts and sciences,for the Sumerians, writing was a gift given by the god Enlil, while for the Mayans, shaman and Itzamna wizard were creators of the world and writing.So who knew the secret of the gods was privileged, and sometimes, in this respect, was superior even to leaders.\nThe modern world has decided: writing weren't given to us by the gods, but it was invented by humans, and its invention was made independently, in places like China, Mesopotamia and Mesoamerica. Recently Europe entered in books, struggling for recognition as the place where writing was invented long ago.\nAt first, people scratched on the walls of caves, but in time turned to other media that can be transported. Thus, occured the notes on clay tablets, on the bone or tortoiseshell.\nThe ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia,are fighting for a podium place on the older writing systems. The oldest examples of writing from Mesopotamia is dating from IV millennium BC, but apparently cuneata records on various media have been made much earlier: the adhesive tablets were used by communities in Mesopotamia since 8000 BC.\nThe tablets used were simple (revealed in today's Turkey, Syria, Israel and Jordan), but others, were more complicated, where writing was decorated with all kinds of signs.These small plates, in their evolved from, occurred only in IV millennium BC. AD and it seems that they were used to record trade. Tablets were stored either in \"envelopes\" made from clay, or they were connected with thick twine.\nAnd the Chinese have proved to be inventive, but one thing should be noted: the Chinese system of writing was registering little changes in 3500 years of evolution.The oldest forms of Chinese writing were found on the frog shell and animal bones, being dated between 1500-1000 BC. Their features? Pictographic symbols, that are stylized representations of the objects that they represent. Later, the Chinese have placed their notes on bronze vessels and some of the oldest forms of writing are used today when it comes to art of calligraphy.\nFor the V-VI centuries BC, the Chinese have started to harmonize the system of writing and to remove variations in different regions, so outlined then writing has been preserved until today , only in the twentieth century it was less simplified.\nComplex proved to be the system of Egyptian writing,so hieroglyphics scratched were known only to few people: the scribes or members of religious orders.Therefore, often, even all Pharaohs were not aware of the writing system. So, in addition to hieroglyphics, the Egyptians developed simpler writing systems : hieratic, used by priests, and Demotic, used by ordinary people.Among the oldest inscriptions in hieroglyphs are those known as Narmer and dated to around 3200 BC.\nThe Latin alphabet is the most widely used system of writing and is dated around 700 BC."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a6c71634-af90-4d91-97fd-3f68c5c9ec17>","<urn:uuid:922f9ad6-a9dd-43f7-9e21-4b138a43bfb9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Looking to protect my finances - which costs more on average: identity theft or regular financial fraud?","answer":"Identity theft tends to be more costly, with an average loss of nearly $5,000 per victim. In comparison, general financial fraud results in lower average losses of $1,173 per victim according to a 2017 study by the Stanford Center For Longevity and FINRA Investor Education Foundation.","context":["Fraud: What You Need to Know\nCheryl Obermiller knows firsthand the pain of financial fraud.\n“In January of 2010, I received a notice from the Internal Revenue Service that I had a substantial tax problem,” says Obermiller, president of Obermiller Construction, a heavy construction company located in Harrisonville, Missouri. “My accountant was out of the office that day due to bad weather, and when I called to ask her about it, she seemed confused and upset.”\nOnce she started investigating, Obermiller realized that her accountant had stolen tens of thousands of dollars and payroll tax money and that was “just the tip of the financial iceberg.” The damage to Obermiller personally and professionally amounted to more than $1 million, a situation that took “several years to fix,” she says.\nThe accountant pleaded guilty to financial fraud and was sentenced to 33 months in the federal penitentiary. She had used multiple fraud tools to steal the money, Obermiller says. “The primary loss was through check forgery, but there was also credit card fraud, payroll fraud, and insurance fraud committed, as well.\"\nIn a way, Obermiller was fortunate. Authorities caught the fraudster, and Obermiller was able to keep both her finances and business afloat after the incident.\nOthers aren’t so lucky, as fraud continues to take its toll on unsuspecting Americans, who rarely see the crime coming.\nHow severe is the problem of fraud?\nWhile the data varies, a February 2017 study by the Stanford Center For Longevity and the FINRA Investor Education Foundation reported that among individuals surveyed for the study, average losses across all fraud types were $1,173 per victim. In addition, “more than 1.2 million fraud complaints were made to law enforcement and federal agencies in 2015, and over half of the consumers filing complaints reported losing money,” the report stated.\nAdditionally, the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud states that insurance fraud alone accounts for $80 billion in losses annually.\nWhat is fraud?\nStep No. 1 in avoiding being a fraud victim is to know what it is and how to make distinctions from other data security crimes—like identity theft—so you’re better prepared to defend yourself against financial fraudsters.\n“Fraud comes in countless forms, but some are more common,” says Jef Henninger, founder of the Law Offices of Jef Henninger, in Tinton Falls, New Jersey. “Insurance fraud, credit card fraud, tax fraud, and mortgage fraud are some of the most common. Fraud can be defined as ‘deception intended to result in financial or personal gain.’”\nIt’s important for financial consumers not to equate identity theft with financial fraud. While there may be distinct similarities, there are also fundamental differences between the two, Henninger states. “ID theft is a form of financial fraud,” he notes. “While ID theft is often linked with monetary loss, it can be used to assume someone else's identity for non-monetary reasons.” That can separate the crime from pure financial fraud.\nOthers agree, noting that there are larger differences between financial fraud and identity theft.\n“Identity fraud means criminals are trying to make unauthorized transactions using your credit card number or your bank account,” says Neal Ungerleider, founder of Almost Millions, a personal finance site for freelancers and the self-employed. “However, identity theft means someone is using your personal data—things like your Social Security number or birthdate—to open new accounts or buy expensive products and services in your name.”\nWhile sophisticated criminals favor some types of fraud (especially computer fraud, such as phishing and ransomware), other types of fraud are more prevalent among the common thief, he notes.\nThose categories include the following types of fraud:\nCredit card fraud\nCredit card fraud is the theft of your credit card or bank debit card, leading to the unauthorized use of an individual cardholder's funds. As long as the cardholder resists contacting his or her financial institution to report card fraud, the criminal can and may continue to use the card to make unauthorized purchases.\nBest step to combat credit card fraud? Keep your card safely at home until you really need it. Don’t give your card number out indiscriminately, and always keep an eye on your card during any purchase experience. Also, if you’re purchasing items online, don’t reveal your card number unless you're confident the retail site you’re using is safe and reputable.\nBy and large, tax fraud, also known as tax ID theft, primarily occurs when a criminal steals and uses an individual’s Social Security number to file a tax return, most always to claim a fraudulent tax refund. Victims often discover the problem when the IRS notifies them that someone else has filed a federal tax return using the same Social Security number.\nBest steps to combat tax fraud? Avoid any attempts by others to obtain your Social Security number online or via mobile texting. The IRS will initially contact you, for any tax reason, only by mail. Thus, to stop tax fraud in its tracks, avoid giving your Social Security number to any unverified contact, whether by email, phone or text.\nThe Pennsylvania state government describes welfare fraud as “when an individual uses fraudulent means to receive public assistance benefits to which they were not entitled.”\nBest steps to combat welfare fraud? While welfare fraud can target individuals—when a victim's Social Security number is unlawfully used to collect benefits—most welfare fraud comes in the form of fraudsters filing false benefits claims with state governments. Welfare fraud abusers should know that the legal penalties are significant. For example, the state of Pennsylvania says, “If found guilty of committing welfare fraud, a defendant must make full restitution of the overpaid benefits, can receive a sentence that can include community service, probation or incarceration, pay costs and fines to the court, and be disqualified for a period of time from public assistance benefits.”\nCheck fraud primarily aims to defraud an individual, business or government agency by either forging another individual’s name on the legitimate owner’s check, altering the face of a check, creating a fraudulent check, or intentionally writing fraudulent, or “bad,” checks to individuals and businesses. While state laws vary, check fraud can carry severe penalties. These can include jail time and significant fines.\nBest ways to combat check fraud? Never leave your checkbook unsecured, and always cover your checks when using them for payment purposes. Check fraud perpetrators often use high-tech devices to obtain your checking account and bank routing numbers, and use them to engage in check fraud. Also, don’t share your checking account number online, unless the website in question is safe and secure (i.e., a bank, credit card, or other business that uses high levels of web security to protect consumers).\nThe FBI defines mortgage fraud as \"the material misstatement, misrepresentation or omission relating to the property or potential mortgage relied on by an underwriter or lender to fund, purchase or insure a loan.\" Mortgage fraud often targets banks and other lenders that offer mortgage loans to consumers and businesses. It usually does not target individuals, although home sellers may see a home sale collapse in the event of a mortgage fraud scenario. Also, individuals can be victimized by mortgage fraud when their Social Security numbers are illegally used to obtain home loans or mortgage lines of credit.\nAny homeowner looking to sell a home should have any potential buyers fully vetted before signing any home purchase documents.\nFraud, fraud and more fraud\nWhile the fraud categories listed above are at the top of the list of most law enforcement officials, they aren’t the only forms of fraud.\n“There are so many ways people get defrauded,” says David Edwards, president at Heron Wealth, a New York City-based financial advisory firm. Besides common forms of fraud, like credit card or Social Security fraud, Edwards lists these additional fraud categories:\nConsumer finance fraud: This includes, “working with companies that promise to repair credit, remove tax liens, modify a mortgage or help with business financing,” Edwards says. “Often consumers end up paying interest rates of up to 50% while their checking account gets cleaned out.”\nMedical fraud: “Another common identify theft is submitting false medical claims on someone else’s insurance records,” Edwards adds. This can also result in felony charges.\nCharitable fraud: Fake charities that entice people’s funds without a legitimate purpose.\nLottery fraud: “Fake lotteries entice people to claim their prize after sending in cash ‘to pay for taxes,’” Edwards adds.\nSenior fraud: “Seniors are particularly susceptible to pitches over the phone, including the “IRS” scam where an “inspector” demands immediate payment by credit card of a “tax lien,” says Edwards.\nHow To Report Fraud\nIf criminals commit financial fraud against you or someone you know, take action. Depending on the type of fraud, there's often help available. Here are some suggested contacts:\nThe Federal Trade Commission (for ID theft and most types of consumer fraud) – Visit the FTC Complaint Assistant or call at 877-382-4357.\nThe FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (for online-based scams, investment and sales fraud, extortion, hacking and phishing scams, and email fraud) – Visit this site to file a complaint.\nThe U.S. Postal Service/Postal Inspection Service (for mail-related crimes, but mostly for outright mail theft that often leads to Social Security and credit card fraud.) – You’ll find the agency’s site here.\nFor outright credit card, debit card, or check fraud, contact your financial institution directly for steps to take after being victimized by fraud, and to close affected accounts. You may also want to file a police report so that you have an official record of the crime.\nDon’t take fraud lightly\nFinancial fraud is sinister and an all-too-common crime across the U.S. To protect your financial assets, know the types of fraud that could target your household, and know where to go in the unfortunate event financial fraud happens to you.\nSymantec Corporation, the world’s leading cyber security company, allows organizations, governments, and people to secure their most important data wherever it lives. More than 50 million people and families rely on Symantec’s Norton and LifeLock comprehensive digital safety platform to help protect their personal information, devices, home networks, and identities.","Identity theft, which hits more than 12 million Americans per year — carries a per victim cost of nearly $5,000, according to some reports. So, the need to protect yourself is obvious.\nAnd protection doesn’t have to be costly in terms of money or time. Here are 10 quick, easy and free ways to reduce your risk:\n1. Mail outgoing bills from the post office or a secure USPS dropbox, not your unlocked home mailbox. The reason: Thieves cruise neighborhoods, looking for upright flags indicating outgoing mail, and steal check-containing envelopes addressed to mortgage, credit card and other vendors. Not only do invoices and checks reveal account information, but checks can be “washed” to steal money from your bank account. Also try to retrieve incoming mail soon after its delivery.\n2. Get off mailing lists for pre-approved credit card offers. These are a gold mine for mail-stealing identity thieves. Call 1-888-567-8688 from your home phone or visit optoutprescreen.com. This service, run by the three credit reporting bureaus, requires your Social Security number when you call by phone. Avoid that step by opting-out online. Stop other so-called junk mail at dmachoice.org.\n3. Build better passwords. Those with at least 12 keystrokes — versus the often advised eight characters — can take hackers using automated programs (or their own know-how) longer to crack. For easier recall when mixing upper- and lower-case letters, numerals and symbols, consider using your favorite song or poem as a guide. For instance, Avicii’s “Wake Me Up” refrain becomes “Wmuwiao@!” Change or add a different digit on each account for maximum protection.\n4. Consider free antivirus software. Many Internet and cellphone providers offer subscribers free antivirus and malware protection software. Sometimes they include pricier “security suite” products. Many leading vendors also provide free downloads, including AVG, Avast, BitDefender and MalwareBytes.\n5. Password-protect your smartphone (done by only one in three users) with a PIN that isn’t 1234, 0000, 2580, 1111 or 5555 — the most easily hacked. Set it on auto-lock and install a location-tracking app, which is already installed on iPhones but needs to be activated.\n6. Avoid making copies of medical, tax-related or other sensitive documents on digital copiers at libraries or businesses. They are often leased, and information stored on their hard drives can be retrieved by scammers who subsequently purchase them.\n7. Use a crosscut shredder before disposing documents that contain key personal identifiers — account numbers, passwords and PINs, SSNs and birth dates. Consider shredding items with your name, address and phone number. So-called Dumpster diving is messy and less-than-stealthy, but still accounts for about 4% of identity theft cases.\n8. Access your free credit report once a year from each of the three major credit bureaus. Regular reviews can lead to discovering fraudulent credit accounts opened in your name. You can also monitor your credit for free using the Credit Report Card, which updates your credit scores monthly.\n9. Never click on links in emails from strangers, or those purporting to be from a government agency. (Uncle Sam usually sends official correspondence by mail.) Don’t provide Social Security numbers or other sensitive info to unsolicited callers. When scanning the Web, access websites by typing the address yourself rather than relying on links found through search engines.\n10. Keep doors and drawers secure. Identity thieves can’t steal your information if they can’t get to it. Keep computers, paper files such as bank or credit card statements, passports, Social Security cards, earnings statements, birth certificates and any other documents with personal identifying information behind closed — and locked — doors or in locked drawers. Always be aware of who has access, such as household employees or work crews — and even family members."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:656de80b-40be-48ab-a309-7684b4db9f02>","<urn:uuid:b620a9ac-c5cd-479e-905c-5f3444d74a6a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do pharmaceutical manufacturers handle material feeding challenges in continuous processes while ensuring GMP compliance?","answer":"In continuous manufacturing, two main feeding challenges persist: feeding at very low flowrates and feeding poorly flowing powders with electrostatic adhesion. While loss in weight (LIW) screw feeding remains dominant, manufacturers manage these challenges through various solutions like experimenting with different agitator and screw geometries, and coprocessing poorly flowing powders with flow aids. For GMP compliance, pharmaceutical manufacture requires high levels of sanitation and hygiene throughout the process, including proper handling of materials and containers. Standard operating procedures must be in place with appropriate records for material handling and processing, and manufacturers must prevent contamination and cross-contamination from materials like living microorganisms, hormones, toxic substances, and other active substances.","context":["OR WAIT null SECS\nExperts at Hovione describe progress being made in understanding how to optimize continuous processes for oral solid-dosage drug products.\nContinuous manufacturing (CM) of oral solid dosage drugs has benefits that include faster development, a smaller equipment footprint, greater flexibility in manufacturing scale, tighter process control (and, thus, improved quality), and the potential for real-time release. Contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) Hovione partnered with Vertex in 2016 to expand Hovione’s facility in East Windsor, NJ, with continuous manufacturing equipment to produce Vertex products. Pharmaceutical Technology spoke with CM team members at Hovione: Alexandra Adao, head of Quality Assurance Continuous Manufacturing; Sarang Oka, process development engineer; and Jose Luis Santos, head of Drug Product Continuous Manufacturing about their experiences with implementing CM.\nPharmTech: As CM processes for solid-dosage drugs are being commercialized, what benefits are being realized? What challenges are arising?\nSantos (Hovione): CM is a tremendous opportunity to advance drugs to the market at a much faster pace than traditional batch manufacturing, and additionally enabling enhanced product quality based on enhanced process understanding and a richer data environment.\nInvestment is significant, not just in terms of the equipment itself, but also the software for integration, which should include a strong [process analytical technology] (PAT) framework; the facility to host the equipment; and all the utilities associated.\nThe teams to be put together may be much different from the standard teams that typically support batch solid dose manufacturing. Now the skill-set should comprise a strong background as well on process modeling, automation and control. PAT is now a mandatory role in the teams. The quality teams should either adjust themselves to embrace a new paradigm, or new focused teams should be put together.\nDevelopment is more difficult, and requires more sophisticated process understanding, including process modeling. Currently it’s probably not as rapid as batch development, given the steep learning curve for most companies. It is likely that development takes more time than batch for similar development phases, but it shows a clear potential to be much faster than batch in the full cycle of development of a drug, since development is conducted always in the same equipment and same scale.\nEven if our experience is still limited, the numbers we have currently at Hovione in terms of equipment occupancy already surpass those from our typical batch processes. So, there is a significant opportunity to make much better use of the assets in continuous as compared to batch manufacturing.\nPharmTech: What are some of the challenges for feeding materials into the system, and what are some of the best practices that have been implemented?\nOka (Hovione): Two challenges in feeding that plagued the technology in its early days continue to persist at their core, namely, feeding at very low flowrates and feeding of poorly flowing powders that exhibit substantial electrostatic adhesion. Although substantial progress has been made in how the challenges are managed, there has been very little transformative change in technology of powder feeding. Loss in weight (LIW) screw feeding continues to be the dominant feeding technology. For example, a few years ago, an academic group prototyped the use of a salt-shaker type feeder for feeding at very low flowrates. The technology showed only limited success, and thus, in absence of any transformative digression from LIW screw feeding, we continue to be constrained by physical limitations of screw feeders.\nAs previously mentioned, we have, however, made substantial progress in how we manage the challenge when feeding poorly flowing powders or feeding at low flowrates. The primary challenge with poorly flowing powders is inconsistent filling of the screw pitch. Vendors have experimented with various agitator and screw geometries to improve screw filling, and these have shown promising results. Some powders, such as certain grades of silica with very low bulk density and substantial electrostatic adhesion tendency, however, continue to pose a challenge. Another trick in the book is coprocessing the poorly flowing powder with a flow aid prior to introducing the powder to a feeder. For example, poorly flowing active ingredients are preblended with silica to improve their flow properties prior to being fed via screw feeders. In terms of excipients, progress has been made to design and develop excipients that are well suited for processing in continuous manufacturing lines and don’t suffer from the aforementioned challenges.\nIn the case of feeding at low flowrates, we are largely constrained by physical limitations of the hardware. There is a physical lower limit below which signal-to-noise ratios even for the most sophisticated load cells becomes too low for effective gravimetric control, and this handicaps our ability to feed below a certain flowrate. A management strategy has been to preblend (in batch) the ingredient with low weight fraction in the formulation with another ingredient, and then feed the preblend at the combined, higher feedrate.\nPharmTech: What are some best practices for technical transfer or scale-up that are unique to or particularly important for CM processes?\nOka (Hovione): These are many advantages when developing products for continuous processes. Development is performed at scale, eliminating the need for performing rigorous scale-up studies as would be the case for batch processing. One can be very confident that experiments performed and results obtained on a standalone loss-in-weight feeder will translate well when an identical feeder is used to feed the same material in the integrated process train. Tech transfer is often performed between very similar (in size and other characteristics) or identical units. The challenge arises when development is performed on equipment that is different from commercial equipment. We still do not have correlations that help us transfer process between dissimilar pieces of equipment or process trains. Recommended practice for organizations who wish to build multiple lines is to develop identical lines, if there is desire to transfer products between lines.\nInterestingly, since several unit operations in the batch paradigm are intrinsically continuous (such as roller compaction or tableting), practitioners have been able to rely on their current development practices built over decades of development knowledge. For example, the use of compaction models and compaction simulators to develop roller compaction or tableting processes in batch manufacturing have been applied to developing these unit operations for continuous processes. Practitioners have been able to directly transfer such best practices developed for the batch world and apply them to developing continuous processes. Of course, this is not possible in cases where the unit operation is different from a batch process, such as powder blending, and completely novel development frameworks have had to be built for these.\nPharmTech: How are process models/digital twins being used in CM process development/process control? What are the next steps for the near future?\nOka (Hovione): Serious effort is being made in the development of digital twins for continuous manufacturing process trains and individual unit operations, with the underlying modeling framework ranging from discrete element method (DEM) based, population balance models, or other empirical and semi-empirical approaches. A very popular application of digital twins has been to perform in-silico residence time distribution (RTD) experiments. These experiments can be done either at the unit operation level or at the full process train level. Thorough characterization of the RTD enables one to track evolution of disturbance through the rig, which is a crucial element of today’s control schemes. The underlying models, if well calibrated, also enable the practitioner to ‘dial-in’ and test a desirable RTD, all performed from the comfort of one’s desk. Applications also include understanding the impact of material properties and process parameters on process performance and eventually product quality. Some digital twins even predict product performance, that is, the performance of the drug within the body.\nIt is also important to mention the drivers for these efforts. The primary driver continues to remain circumventing the use of valuable early stage API. However, practitioners of the technology are beginning to realize that most CM rigs have large turnaround times for cleaning. Introducing the material into the rig for experimentation and ‘dirtying’ the rig is associated with the cost of the follow-up cleaning. This limitation is especially important to us, as a CMO, where this translates to a substantial opportunity cost. Tools that help us minimize the use of the rig are thus incredibly important to us. These could be very sophisticated models or simple tools based on engineering correlations that predict the performance of the product in the rig.\nPharmTech: Is real-time release happening? What roadblocks remain?\nAdao (Hovione): Hovione has already introduced all the requirements to enable real-time release testing in the quality systems. There are some companies that have already successfully implemented it, and we are confident that we have in place all the conditions to also perform its implementation.\nThere are some technically relevant aspects that enable the implementation of real-time release testing, namely the online and inline PAT capabilities and the design of automation control systems (e.g., equipment monitoring, material tracking). An appropriate control strategy that combines both capabilities is a key element for an adequate implementation of the real-time release in CM. At Hovione, the referred capabilities are already in place and system qualification was performed, taking also into consideration the requirements for real-time release testing.\nAn example of a potential challenge in the implementation of real-time release is dissolution testing. In order to enable real-time release, the use of model-based prediction of dissolution performance based on process parameters and critical quality attributes (CQAs) will be required, and consequently, an adequate model maintenance procedure needs to be in place. The model maintenance requires a parallel testing program to test the methods against the respective laboratory/regulatory methods. Therefore, in addition to the significant effort associated with the verification of the models during implementation, there is also an important effort associated with the model lifecycle.\nAs a CMO, we have been preparing ourselves to be able to accommodate this type of release, and we agree on its benefits, as it can provide an increase of quality assurance and reduce release time, with an overall benefit for the patients.","See how our market-leading reporting and analysis system supports your auditing requirements\nCall us for an expert pest survey on 1800-212-212-5\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products has to be maintained at high standards to ensure the strength of the active ingredients, quality and purity of the final products. These standards ensure safe and effective products for patients.\nMinute changes in any of these factors can have serious consequences for patients, therefore the controls and checks put in place need to be far more stringent than, for example, the food industry.\nThe medical profession and patients expect medicines to be identical to a high level of precision and safe every time they receive a new batch.\nThe major burden for ensuring consumer safety, lies firmly at the manufacturing stage, where it is essential to use industry-accepted Good Practices to maintain safety and efficacy.\nThe regulatory authorities and the industry itself put great emphasis on manufacturing pharmaceutical products using practices and processes that ensure high levels of quality and safety are built into every step.\nRegulatory requirements emphasise Good Practices for controlling quality and safety, from drug development to distribution:\nThe WHO defines Good Manufacturing Practices as…\n“...that part of quality management which ensures that products are consistently produced and controlled according to the quality standards appropriate to their intended use and as required by the marketing authorization, clinical trial authorization or product specification.” (WHO, 2011).\nThe US developed the first GMPs for manufacturing, processing, packing and holding finished pharmaceuticals in 1963 (in the US called Current Good Manufacturing Practices and WHO followed with its own GMPs in 1967.\nThe first attempt at globalising pharmaceutical regulations for harmonisation was made by WHO in 1975 with an action programme for essential drugs and a certification scheme for international trade.\nWHO GMPs became widely accepted in pharmaceutical regulations, first by the European Community, followed by Japan and the US.\nThese three created the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) in 1990 to coordinate development of the increasingly complex and expensive regulatory procedures.\nOther developed countries and international bodies subsequently adopted GMPs. Each further developed them to comply with strict manufacturing and health requirements, to cover new product types and new technologies:\nThe trend in pharmaceutical regulation is to become more complex with stronger control mechanisms and mandatory documentation of various processes and test results (Brhlikova et al, 2007).\nIn recent years, manufacturing and GMP compliance problems have resulted in “chronic supply shortages” of some essential medicines for which there are no alternatives, resulting in public health crises.\nMany medicinal products have become ‘victims’ of globalisation.\nManufacturers have moved production to single locations, outside the major markets, making supply chains lengthy and more risky.\nMany products are manufactured in single countries with uncertain political, regulatory or environmental situations, increasing the risk of disruption — such as occurred in Japan following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.\nThis is compounded by lack of built in redundancy or fail-safe mechanisms for maintaining supplies, resulting in global supply shortage when production has been disrupted.\nThis has led to importation of unlicensed versions of pharmaceutical products to protect patients who need medicines, on the basis that the poor quality medicine is less risk than no medicine at all (European Medicines Agency, 2012).\nEU regulations require all pharmaceutical manufacturers to comply with EU Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) if they want to supply products to the EU.\nManufacturers and importers must be authorised and registered by a competent authority from a member state.\nManufacturers and importers are regularly inspected by an EU competent authority or other approved authority to check compliance with the EU GMPs. This applies wherever the manufacturer is located.\nThe frequency of inspection is based on a risk assessment and in addition the local national competent authority must supply written confirmation that each batch of product conformed to GMPs.\nWhere products are imported by a separate company the importer is responsible for ensuring compliance with GMP.\nThe EU legislation governing pharmaceutical products is compiled in the publication “The rules governing medicinal products in the European Union”.\nIn addition, the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and Healthcare (EDQM) of the Council of Europe (separate from the EU and EC), which is responsible for the European Pharmacopoeia, can also inspect manufacturers and issue Certificates of Suitability that can replace most of the data in the EU Marketing Authorisation of medicines (Luigetta R, 2015).\nIn the US the regulatory standard for human pharmaceutical products is the Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations, which are enforced by the FDA.\nThe FDA inspects manufacturers worldwide for compliance with CGMP.\nThe FDA issues guidance for manufacturers in the Code of Federal Regulations, Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Finished Pharmaceuticals.\nThese guidance documents do not bind companies to follow them and an alternative approach is acceptable if it fulfils the requirements of the regulations.\nInternation Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering (ISPE) has compiled links to GMP regulations and resources for individual countries: Australia, Canada, China, EU, India, Japan, US: ispe.org/gmp-resources/regulations.\nIn addition to all legal and regulatory requirements, a pharmaceutical business may also need to comply with additional standards for commercial reasons.\nExamples of additional standards are:\nGood Manufacturing Practices form part of a pharmaceutical quality system. It aims to minimise the risks in manufacture to ensure safety, quality and efficacy.\nA manufacturer has responsibility to ensure the pharmaceutical products are fit for use, comply with marketing authorisation requirements and have adequate safety, quality and efficacy.\nSenior management has the responsibility to ensure that the pharmaceutical quality system is adequately resourced, roles, responsibilities and authorities are clearly defined and communicated.\nPharmaceutical manufacture requires high levels of sanitation and hygiene at every point of the process, covering personnel, premises, equipment, materials, containers, and cleaning and disinfection products.\nIt also requires elimination of potential sources of contamination, both for hygiene purposes and for medical effectiveness, which could be affected by, for example, dust from other product ingredients or cleaning compounds.\nThe basic sanitation and hygiene GMPs below are derived from WHO guidelines (WHO, 2011).\nThere should be sufficient numbers of qualified personnel who should be aware of the principles of GMP applicable to their role, including hygiene practices.\nWaste should be removed from production areas and properly stored in suitable containers in designated areas and disposed of in a timely manner.\nStandard operating procedures, with appropriate records should include:\nPharmaceutical products need particular care to prevent contamination and cross contamination from materials and other products such as living microorganisms, hormones, toxic substances, and other active substances.\nWHO.

{"question":"what are bacteria classification and pathogenesis mechanisms?","answer":"Bacteria can be classified in several ways: by cell wall structure (gram-positive with thick peptidoglycan walls and gram-negative with outer membranes), by shape (spherical/cocci, rod-shaped/bacilli, spiral-shaped/spirilla, and filamentous), and by metabolism (aerobic, anaerobic, or facultative). Regarding pathogenesis mechanisms, bacteria cause disease through multiple processes: they can attach to and feed off host cells, release toxins that generate inflammation, multiply inside cells until rupture, or steal nutrients from the host. The pathogenic process involves four stages: exposure, adhesion, invasion, and infection. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for disease prevention and treatment, as pathogenesis refers to both the mechanism of infection and disease development.","context":["Bacteria are a vast group of unicellular microorganisms, visible only under the microscope. They populate virtually every natural environment and interact with essentially every living organism. They are actually one of the first life forms and have evolved into an incredibly wide range of microorganisms. For the most part, bacteria are either harmless or beneficial and co-exist with living organisms. However, a small number are pathogenic and produce disease in various life forms. Bacteria that are pathogenic to humans are usually classified as gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, differentiated by shape, peculiarities of cell structure and life-sustaining activities.\nWhat are bacteria?\nBy definition, bacteria denominates one of three major divisions of cellular life and refers to a large and varied group of generally microscopic microbes. Almost all forms are microscopic, meaning they are visible only under the microscope, but not with the unaided eye. There are two exceptions to this: Thiomargarita namibiensis and Epulopiscium fishelsoni. Bacteria are unicellular, or single-cell organisms, although they can organize and form multi-cellular structures. Bacteria that organize in multiple-cell structures are more efficient and resilient to antibacterial agents. Because they exhibit life-sustaining activities, they are considered a type of life form.\nOne of their distinctive traits is their lack of a nucleus, a central element in the cell that contains the cell’s genetic material and regulates DNA replication. Bacteria also don’t have specialized cell subdivisions enclosed in separate membranes to carry out different functions. Those who do have some semblance of such subdivisions do not have them separated from the rest of the cell material (cytoplasm). In addition to a cell nucleus, bacteria also lack a subdivision called mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell responsible for generating energy for cell processes that regulate its life-sustaining activities. They will, however, have different types of such subdivisions with similar functions. After all, bacteria too need to convert some sort of food or fuel into energy to be able to grow and multiply. They are essentially simpler, one-cell life-forms.\nBacteria types and shapes\nBacteria can be successfully classified according to their morphology into several categories.\nBacteria according to cell wall structures are commonly classified as gram negative and gram positive. The classification is obtained as a result of the Gram staining test.\n1) Gram positive bacteria have a thick, outer cell wall made of what is known as peptidoglycan which surrounds the cell membrane. This thick outer layer serves a protective role. During the Gram stain test, the peptidoglycan retains a purple dye, which is confirmation of the bacteria being gram positive. Read more about the difference between gram negative and gram positive bacteria.\n2) Gram negative bacteria have an outer membrane, a thin layer of peptidoglycan and a cell membrane. The outer membrane serves as protection against some antibiotics and prevents them from reaching the peptidoglycan layer and causing it do malfunction. The thin layer of peptidoglycan of these bacteria does not retain the initial purple dye applied in the first phase of the Gram stain test, only the second pink dye. This result is what allows for the classification as gram negative.\nBacteria according to shape:\n1) Spherical or ovoid (coccus, cocci)\n2) Rod-shaped (bacillus, bacilli)\n3) Spiral-shaped (spirillum, spirilla)\n4) Filamentous, elongated shapes.\nBacteria according to organizational structures. Bacteria are single-cell organisms, but have the ability to organize in structures for more efficient use of resources, better survival rates and increased resistance to antibacterials. They are known as micro-colonies.\nLesser organizational structures of bacteria can be called arrangements and include pairs, chains, bunches, clusters, threadlike filaments, helix arrangements and others.\nBacteria according to size. Microscopic forms are usually between 0.5 micrometers (half of a millionth of a meter in length) and 5 micrometers (5 millionths of a meter in length). Bacteria smaller than 0.1 to 0.3 micrometers are called ultramicrobacteria. Thiomargarita namibiensis (not microscopic) is the largest bacterium, measuring between 100-750 micrometers (or 0.1 to 0.75 millimeters). Epulopiscium fishelsoni (also not microscopic) measures between 200-700 micrometers (or 0.2 to 0.7 millimeters).\nBacteria according to metabolism (life sustaining activities) can be divided into several categories:\n1) Aerobic or anaerobic or facultative.\nAerobic bacteria use oxygen to produce energy, while anaerobic bacteria do not require it. Bacteria can be obligate aerobe organisms, meaning they rely on oxygen to grow (example: Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Some are facultative anaerobe, meaning they use oxygen if available to produce energy for the cell to use, but are also capable to survive and grow without it. Obligate anaerobic bacteria are damaged by the presence of oxygen (example: all Clostridium). Microaerophile bacteria require low oxygen concentrations (up to 10% atmospheric oxygen concentration), but are damaged by higher values (example: Helicobacter pylori). Aerotolerant anaerobes do not require or use oxygen if present, but are not damaged by it (example: Streptococcus mutans).\n2) Fermenting bacteria (example: Lactobacillus) rely on fermentation to produce energy for the bacterial cell and support its metabolism. They can be facultative anaerobic or microareophilic. These are the bacteria that convert sugar or starch into lactic acid.\n2) Motile or non-motile. How do bacteria move? For example, Escherichia coli have a flagellum, a tail-like projection that allows them to move. Helicobacter pylori have multiple such projections that allow them to eat their way into the stomach lining. Neisseria meningitidis has shorter, hair-like protuberances that allows it to attach to cells. Myxococcus xanthus moves by propelling itself in a gliding movement. Pseudomonas aeruginosa moves by crawling over surfaces with the help of hair-like projections called pili. Klebsiella pneumoniae and others are not motile.\n3) Spore forming or non-spore forming. Gram positive bacteria like Bacillus and Clostridium form spores. In simple words, spores are inactive seed-like productions that carry the genetic material of a bacterium. They do no grow or multiply and are resilient to external factors that would normally cause the active bacterium to cease to be viable. They can however produce infection once the right conditions are met, ensuring the propagation of the bacterium strain. Most gram negative bacteria do not form spores.\nBacteria types in relation to host with examples\nSome bacteria thrive in the environment, others need to be in a relationship with a host to live, grow and multiply. This relationship bacteria-host is called symbiosis and is a form of relatively long-term biological partnership. According to it, the following types arise:\n1) Commensal bacteria: they benefit from their host, but don’t help or harm it. Some strains of Staphylococcus aureus are commensal bacteria. They are normally part of the human skin micro-flora or present in the mucous membranes of the nose or mouth, where they thrive thanks to conditions provided by the host. However, they are not pathogenic and do not cause infection and disease. At the same time, they do not provide any benefits for their host.\n2) Mutualistic bacteria: they benefit from the association with a host and, at the same time, produce beneficial outcomes for said host. Examples: probiotic human gut bacteria (also referred to as gut flora or microbiota). For the most part, they produce various metabolites that inhibit the growth of other pathogenic bacteria or fungi and contribute to normal gut flora populations in exchange for nutrients. This often results in better immunity for the host, especially at the level of the gastrointestinal tract.\nFor example, Lactobacillus is known for converting carbohydrates (sugars, starch) into lactic acid in the digestive tract through a process called fermentation. Other Lactobacillus species help synthesize vitamin K or B vitamins like vitamin B12 or vitamin B9 (folic acid) or inhibit Candida growth. Some mutualistic strains help prevent tooth decay.\n3) Pathogenic bacteria: they infect a host and produce disease. Some infect specific tissues, some can only produce disease inside a cell, others are opportunistic and require specific conditions to cause disease (like lowered immune system defenses from other diseases). Some strains will feed off other microorganisms. Examples of bacteria pathogenic to humans and the diseases they may cause:\n– Escherichia coli: diarrhea, traveler’s diarrhea, meningitis.\n– Haemophilus influenzae: bacterial meningitis, pneumonia, bronchitis, infections of the upper respiratory tract.\n– Helicobacter pylori: gastritis, gastric ulcers, stomach cancer.\n– Mycobacterium: tuberculosis.\n– Pseudomonas aeruginosa: pneumonia, endocarditis (type of heart inflammation), sepsis.\nWhat do bacteria do?\nBacteria are living organisms and their purpose is to essentially survive, grow and multiply. In order to do so, they may need a host to get food from and support life sustaining activities (metabolism). Depending on the type of association with a host, they may produce infection and disease, benefits for the host or neither of the two.\nHow do bacteria make you sick?\nBacteria can make us ill in several ways. One way is by attaching to host cells and using them for their own nutrition. So basically they feed off host cells to support their own life sustaining processes (metabolism) which allows the bacteria to grow, multiply and make you sick. Some bacteria steal nutrients such as iron to support their metabolism. Others trick host cells to swallow them up. This alone affects the cell. Some move on from one cell to another. Most divide inside our cells until they rupture and release the multiplied bacteria.\nWhen Gram negative bacteria come into contact with immune system cells, they release toxins from their outer cell wall which generate inflammation and cause symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, aches or even sepsis in severe cases. Only pathogenic bacteria make you ill and not all of them all the time. Some require very specific conditions to produce disease and are called opportunistic pathogens.\nHow do bacteria feed to grow and multiply?\nDifferent bacteria have different metabolisms, meaning they use different elements to grow and multiply as well as obtain them through various processes. Bacteria may feed on organic elements such as carbohydrates, protein or fats or use water. Different species may rely on carbon, hydrogen, sulfur, iron or ammonia oxidation to produce energy for the cell and sustain metabolic processes. Some can produce carbon themselves, for example, while others ingest it from their environment. There are those that secrete enzymes that digest elements around them and turn them into food. Aerobic, anaerobic respiration, fermentation are three common processes through which bacteria produce energy to fuel themselves.\nHow do bacteria grow and multiply?\nOnce they are in the right environment, bacteria need necessary food or fuel to use for life-sustaining processes. These processes allow them to grow. Bacteria essentially multiply by creating clones of themselves, a process called fission. One bacterial cell will grow, then replicate its DNA which will then move to the opposite part of the cell. Finally, the cell becomes longer and divides, forming two identical copies or clones (binary fission). Sometimes, one cell can create several copies (multiple fission). It can take anywhere from less than 10 minutes to 30 minutes and up to more than 3 days for bacteria to multiply.\nThis post was updated on Friday / July 31st, 2020 at 11:10 PM","- 1 What is the pathogenesis of bacteria?\n- 2 What are the steps of bacterial pathogenesis?\n- 3 What are the mechanisms of pathogenesis?\n- 4 What is an example of pathogenesis?\n- 5 What are the 4 types of pathogenic bacteria?\n- 6 How is bacterial infection caused?\n- 7 Which diseases are caused by bacteriophage?\n- 8 Which bacteria is more pathogenic Gram positive or negative?\n- 9 What is the importance of pathogenesis?\n- 10 What are the 6 types of pathogens?\n- 11 Is mechanism and pathogenesis the same?\n- 12 What is an example of etiology?\n- 13 What is the difference between pathogenesis and etiology?\n- 14 What is disease triangle?\nWhat is the pathogenesis of bacteria?\nBacterial pathogenesis is the process by which bacteria infect and cause disease in a host. Not all bacteria are pathogens and have the ability for pathogenesis (also known as virulence).\nWhat are the steps of bacterial pathogenesis?\nTo cause disease, a pathogen must successfully achieve four steps or stages of pathogenesis: exposure (contact), adhesion (colonization), invasion, and infection.\nWhat are the mechanisms of pathogenesis?\nThe pathogenic mechanisms of a disease (or condition) are set in motion by the underlying causes, which if controlled would allow the disease to be prevented. Often, a potential cause is identified by epidemiological observations before a pathological link can be drawn between the cause and the disease.\nWhat is an example of pathogenesis?\nTypes of pathogenesis include microbial infection, inflammation, malignancy and tissue breakdown. For example, bacterial pathogenesis is the mechanism by which bacteria cause infectious illness. Most diseases are caused by multiple processes.\nWhat are the 4 types of pathogenic bacteria?\nPathogen types. There are different types of pathogens, but we’re going to focus on the four most common types: viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites.\nHow is bacterial infection caused?\nBacterial infections are caused by the transmission of bacteria. You can be exposed to bacteria from other people, through the environment, or from eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water.\nWhich diseases are caused by bacteriophage?\nThese include diphtheria, botulism, Staphylococcus aureus infections (i.e. skin and pulmonary infections, food poisoning, and toxic shock syndrome), Streptococcus infections, Pasteurella infections, cholera, Shiga toxing-producing Shigella and Escherichia coli infections, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.\nWhich bacteria is more pathogenic Gram positive or negative?\nThe majority of the WHO list is Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Due to their distinctive structure, Gram-negative bacteria are more resistant than Gram-positive bacteria, and cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.\nWhat is the importance of pathogenesis?\nPathogenesis is defined as the origination and development of a disease. Insights into disease etiology and progression, the two major aspects of pathogenesis, are paramount in the prevention, management and treatment of various diseases.\nWhat are the 6 types of pathogens?\nDifferent types of pathogens\n- Bacteria. Bacteria are microscopic pathogens that reproduce rapidly after entering the body.\n- Viruses. Smaller than bacteria, a virus invades a host cell.\n- Fungi. There are thousands of species of fungi, some of which cause disease in humans.\n- Parasitic worms.\nIs mechanism and pathogenesis the same?\nPathogenesis refers both to the mechanism of infection and to the mechanism by which disease develops.\nWhat is an example of etiology?\nWhen a cause of a disease is determined, this is called its etiology. For example, the etiology of cholera is known to be a bacterium that contaminates food and drinking water in places with poor sanitation.\nWhat is the difference between pathogenesis and etiology?\nThe terms “etiology” and “pathogenesis” are closely related to the questions of why and how a certain disease or disorder develops. Models of etiology and pathogenesis therefore try to account for the processes that initiate (etiology) and maintain (pathogenesis) a certain disorder or disease.\nWhat is disease triangle?\nThe disease triangle is a conceptual model that shows the interactions between the environment, the host and an infectious (or abiotic) agent. This model can be used to predict epidemiological outcomes in plant health and public health, both in local and global communities."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d8c7d4a6-d422-4c84-a398-826adec378f9>","<urn:uuid:dcf40a80-9bb3-4b8d-898e-db31286b4c5a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the organizational structures and scales of operation differ between Tramin and Isole e Olena wineries?","answer":"Tramin operates as a cooperative network of 270 farmers managing approximately 620 acres across four communities, maintaining a small estate-like farmer-to-land ratio that allows for hand-harvesting. In contrast, Isole e Olena is a single family-owned estate comprising two adjoining properties totaling 290 hectares, of which 53 hectares are planted to vines, managed by Paolo De Marchi who took over from his parents in 1976.","context":["Tramin Pinot Grigio 2009\nCritical AcclaimAll Vintages\nLocated in the heart of Alto Adige in the town of Termeno on the south side of the Alps, Tramin comprises of one of the oldest networks of farmers forming a winery. Rich in tradition, Tramin’s wines are authentic expressions of a unique terroir, supported by a common philosophy of hard work, dedication, confidence and creativity among all participating members. Tramin operates on a human scale with a farmer-to-land ratio similar to that of a small estate, allowing for delicate hand-harvesting. A unique architectural landmark that blends in among its natural surroundings was designed for Cantina Tramin’s new headquarters in 2010, combining a modern structure with the original cellar. When viewed from outside, the building is striking for its curves, while the interior is a well-planned winery with dedicated areas for cellar workers and visiting wine enthusiasts. Designed by leading Italian architect Tscholl Werner, the building is located on the exact footprint of the original cellar so as not to sacrifice any land from the surrounding vineyards. Founded in 1889 by Pastor Christian Schrott, Tramin now boasts 270 members across approximately 620 acres in the communities of Tramin, Neumarkt, Montan and Auer. The town of Tramin — the German name for Termeno — is home to the aromatic grape, Gewürztraminer. The Traminer grape (as it is affectionately called here) is one of the oldest in the world and boasts a noble lineage. In fact, recent studies show that it is the ancestor of some of the oldest grape varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Riesling, and Pinots Blanc, Gris and Noir. At Cantina Tramin, the Traminer grape grows in the subzone of Sella, a terroir that’s particularly suited to Gewürztraminer; hence the name of the winery, Cantina Tramin. Among the northernmost vineyards in Italy, the 620 acres that provide grapes for the Tramin winery are located in Alto Adige, better known to its mostly German-speaking inhabitants as the Südtirol. These vines grow in an exquisite, high-walled glacial valley that protects them from the northern cold and traps the sun’s warmth. The winery itself is located on the Wine Route (Strada di Vino/Weinstrasse) in the commune of Termeno — or Tramin in German — a few miles south of the provincial capital Bolzano (Bozen) and 60 miles from the Austrian border. Approximately 37 acres of Tramin’s vineyards are currently cultivated using organic and biodynamic principles. With 12 Tre Bicchieri-award winning wines to date, Tramin also boasts the talent of Willi Stürz, named Gambero Rosso’s “Winemaker of the Year” in 2004. He joined the winery in 1992 and has been committed to addressing its winemaking challenges from the start. A native of Termeno, he is deeply tied to its culture and people, which can be seen in his work. A professional of uncommon depth and focus, Willi cultivates a balance of traditional winemaking with the use of modern technology and deep expertise, which has resulted in great success for Tramin. Wolfgang Klotz oversees sales and marketing, and manages the winery with Willi Stürz.\nTrentino, the southern half, is primarily Italian-speaking and largely responsible for the production of non-native, international grapes. There is a significant quantity of Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Merlot produced. But Trentino's native and most unique red variety, Teroldego, while still rare, is gaining popularity. It produces a deeply colored red wine rich in wild blackberry, herb, coffee and cocoa.\nThe rugged terrain of German-speaking Alto Adige (also referred to as Südtirol) focuses on small-scale viticulture, with great value placed on local varieties—though international varieties have been widely planted since the 1800s. Sheltered by the Alps from harsh northerly winds, many of the best vineyards are at extreme altitude but on steep slopes to increase sunlight exposure.\nThe primary white grapes are Pinot grigio, Gewürztraminer, Chardonnay and Pinot blanc, as well as smaller plantings of Sauvignon blanc, Müller Thurgau. These tend to be bright and refreshing with crisp acidity and just the right amount of texture. Some of the highest quality Pinot grigio in Italy is made here.\nShowing a unique rosy, purplish hue upon full ripeness, this “white” variety is actually born out of a mutation of Pinot Noir. The grape boasts two versions of its name, as well as two generally distinct styles. In Italy, Pinot Grigio achieves most success in the mountainous regions of Trentino and Alto Adige as well as in the neighboring Friuli—all in Italy’s northeast. France's Alsace and Oregon's Willamette Valley produce some of the world's most well-regarded Pinot Gris wine. California produces both styles with success.\nTasting Notes for Pinot Grigio\nPinot Grigio is a dry, white wine naturally low in acidity. Pinot Grigio wines showcase signature flavors and aromas of stone fruit, citrus, honeysuckle, pear and almond. Alsatian styles are aromatic (think rose and honey), richly textured and sometimes relatively higher in alcohol compared to their Italian counterpart. As Pinot Grigio in Italy, the style is often light and charming.\nPerfect Food Pairings for Pinot Grigio\nThe viscosity of a typical Alsatian Pinot Gris allows it to fit in harmoniously with the region's rich foods like pork, charcuterie and foie gras. Pinot Grigio, on the other hand, with its citrusy freshness, works well as an aperitif wine or with seafood and subtle chicken dishes.\nSommelier Secrets for Pinot Grigio\nGiven the pinkish color of its berries and aromatic potential if cared for to fully ripen, the Pinot Grigio variety is actually one that is commonly used to make \"orange wines.\" An orange wine is a white wine made in the red wine method, i.e. with fermentation on its skins. This process leads to a wine with more ephemeral aromas, complexity on the palate and a pleasant, light orange hue.","Isole e Olena\nA CREAM IMPORT SELECTION\nCountry of Origin: Italy\nLocation: Barberino Val d'Elsa, Chianti Classico\nPeople: Paolo De Marchi, Owner & Winemaker\nWine Spectator: A Moving Target with Tuscan Legend Paolo De Marchi\nAbout.com: Italian Food\nJancis Robinson: Paolo de Marchi on Esca\nPolish Wine Guide: Isole e Olena - lightness, juiciness, naturalness\nThe incredibly talented, humble, and kind Paolo De Marchi is at the helm of Isole e Olena, and has been since 1976 after taking over from his parents who purchased the property in the 1950s. From the beginning, Paolo has done groundbreaking work to understand and propel the image of Sangiovese. Until very recently, Sangiovese was thought to fare poorly by itself, and the Chianti Classico appellation demanded that it be blended with other grapes (including white) to earn the DOCG. Paolo differed from this opinion. He studied his Sangiovese vines, convinced he could produce a wine that would rival international single-varietal wines. Radically, Paolo produced his first 100% Sangiovese Cepparello in 1980 (according to history he was the second person to do this after Montevertine); this wine was an immediate success and set the standard for the pure Sangiovese movement in Tuscany. Cepparello put Paolo and his estate on the map. 40 years later, the revered Paolo is producing some of his best wines yet!\nIsole e Olena is comprised of two adjoining estates in the Barberino Val d’Elsa subregion of Chianti Classico. The land totals 290 hectares of which 53 hectares are planted to vines, which include traditional Tuscan varieties as well as international varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, and Chardonnay. 70% of the estate’s production is traditional Chianti Classico and Vin Santo. The location is on the cooler, western side of Chianti Classico at about 1,310 feet. The wines maintain freshness even in the hottest years because of the sea breezes and steep diurnal shift.\n\"Paolo De Marchi describes 2016 as a cool year with a lot of sunshine and well-timed rains, conditions that resulted in slow ripening of the grapes and a late, relaxed harvest that started at the end of September and wrapped up during the second half of October. As for the wines, they are simply off the charts. I don't know if there is much more I can say than that.\"\n\"Always outspoken, Paolo De Marchi is not shy when it comes to expressing his views. For that reason, he is not really part of the 'in crowd' of owners in Chianti Classico's highly political ecosystem. But he doesn't need to be, the wines speak for themselves. These wines are simply extraordinary. The only wines that fall a bit short are the 2015s, but rain during harvest is not exactly easy to work around. De Marchi's Chianti Classico Gran Selezione is one of just a few wines that truly express what the top of the qualitative hierarchy is, while his wines from international varieties, now out of favor, remain compelling. The flagship remains the 100% Sangiovese Cepparello, which in its best vintages, is capable of developing beautifully in bottle for 25+ years.\"\n\"Paolo De Marchi made one of the very finest wines of the 2014 vintage with a stunning Cepparello. De Marchi was able to push the harvest into late October and early November, which means the Sangiovese got the benefit of the warm, dry days and cool nights that arrived towards the end of the growing season, a time when the last phase of ripening took place under the gentle, shorter days of fall. There are plenty of other noteworthy wines in this collection, including the terrific 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon Collezione Privata. These wines show why De Marchi and Isole e Olena occupy a spot among the world's elite wine estates.\"\n\"Paolo De Marchi remains one of the most forward-thinking producers in Italy. His 100% Sangiovese Cepparello was a ground -breaking wine in the 1980s, when Sangiovese was four-letter word and international varieties were all the rage. Now the Gran Selezione is hot and there has never been more focus on pure Sangiovese in Chianti Classico. So what does De Marchi do? Simply make one of the greatest Tuscan wines ever with his 2010 Chianti Classico Gran Selezione, which is, ironically, a blend of Sangiovese and Bordeaux varieties. So, now the top wine at Isole e Olena - an estate that has championed Sangiovese for three-plus decades (far before it was fashionable to do so) - is now a blend. In 2011, De Marchi added a dollop of Trebbiano to freshen up his Cepparello. What's old is new again? At the end of the day, none of that really matters. 'I want to make the best wine I can. Period,' says De Marchi in his typical self-deprecating style. Make no mistake about it, these are some of the greatest wines being made anywhere in the world.

The ways in which plants thrive or fail are shaped by their evolutionary history, as well as the evolution that unfolds every planting season.\nWe're most familiar with the evolution of resistance to pesticides in insects and to herbicides in weeds. But evolution has many other effects on farms. For example, many important crop plants, like soybeans, cannot extract nitrogen from the atmosphere on their own. They depend instead on bacteria that live inside their roots.\nIn exchange for fixed nitrogen, the bacteria get nutrients from the plants. It may seem like a happy case of cooperation, but the evolution of cooperation always runs the risk of cheating and deception.

While both aim to promote financial independence, microcredit operates as a traditional lending model, while matched savings programs provide direct monetary incentives for saving behavior.","context":["If the financial network is considered with spider web, the ultimate concern is to connect the web strings to the services of small business entity and poor individuals. Microfinance includes microcredit which facilitates small loans to basic elementary clients; savings of the surplus money; micro insurance and payment network and coverage. The target group is usually poor population segments, socially marginalized , isolated and uplift them for making them sufficient enough to proceed with their procedural workings and rotate the cycle to earn enough to recycle ,service the interest of loan, pay out the installments and to scoop out the surplus as savings or investments.\nIn initial stages microfinance has limited coverage like providing loans to poor entrepreneurs and small business lacking access to credit. The relationship based banking for individual entrepreneurs and small businesses was one of the roadways for defining the ambit of microfinance. The other path was aggregate based where several entrepreneurs come together to apply for loans and other financial services as a group entity.\nEvolution is the mechanism for a modification with time variable. Microfinance emerged as a spurt and came out with a movement having objective to reach poor and deprived people and households with an array of quality products and services in financial sector without limitation to just credit but also savings, insurance, payment services, fund transfers. The narratives derived from the microfinance were different from one to another. It was described as a catalyst to economic development, creating opportunity for the employment creation and enhancing the growth of the economy. Some of them were of the opine that microfinance is to optimally managing the finances of the poor. Certain sets of activities classified to be financial in developed countries are not monetized in developing countries. The cause behind the same is due to scarcity of dispensable income. Last two decades have witnessed microfinance as sector to satisfy the unmet demands of the poor, isolated group at a large scale.\nSpecifically emphasizing about the women entrepreneurs, microfinance has created platform for them to start and explore the potential of their skills and talents. It is not only creating jobs for women but also opens the door for investment, savings, educating wards and also setting example for others. According to a joint report by Bain & Company and Google, Women in entrepreneurship can generate 150-170 million jobs in India, which is more than 25 percent of the new jobs required for the entire working age population by 2030.\nThe report titled Women Entrepreneurship in IndiaPowering the economy with her has found that of the 432 million women in working age, about 343 million are not paid formal workers. An estimated 324 million of these women are not in labour force, and another 19 million are in the labour force but are not employed. The report suggests that in addition to job creation by private and government sectors, entrepreneurship is an untapped opportunity for working age women in India.\nThere has been growth of about 6 percent from existing 14 percent to 20 percent in context of women-owned enterprises. The structure of women owned enterprises in India are largely single person type which results to lower returns and employment. The report also states that women enterprises are often over represented in numbers as survey across parts of India suggest that 10-30 percent women-owned enterprises are often not run by women.\nContinue reading your story on the app\nContinue reading your story in the magazine\nNEW AGE CUSTOMERS BUILDING THE DIGITAL CAPABILITIES\nIntroduction Consumer markets in India are expected to reap the benefit of favorable macroeconomic parameters as well as its demographics.

Ultimately, economic justice means fairness and equality for survivors and the ability to make decisions about their lives and intimate relationships without fear of negative financial impact.\nFinancial instability is one of the largest obstacles for survivors seeking safety and one of the reasons that survivors most often give for why they stay or have returned to their abuser. The ability to survive financially without the abuser presents challenges, whether it be due to loss of income, a place to live, childcare, healthcare or other money issues, including access to credit. Advocating for economic justice strategies can improve the many social conditions that prevent safety for survivors. Safe options to addressing some of these challenges include making informed decisions about how to avoid predatory lending and consumer scams, building good credit, accessing resources for affordable housing, financial education and for building assets through savings, homeownership or entrepreneurship.\nAs a part of the Economic Justice Initiative, FCADV provides on-site, regional and statewide trainings as well as technical assistance to Florida's certified domestic violence centers. The training includes information on working with survivors to develop spending plans, avoid predatory lending, re-establish credit and/or banking relationships and learning about innovative programs such as matched savings and micro-entrepreneurship.\nTrainings and technical assistance are also available to help advocates understand housing protections for survivors and indentify potential solutions to long-term housing needs. In addition to training and technical assistance, FCADV works to support implementation of VAWA housing protections and to indentify additional resources for survivors. Affordable housing is a complex challenge, and FCADV is committed to exploring innovative strategies to address this issue.\nThe Allstate Foundation provides funding to FCADV to support designated local centers with economic empowerment programs for survivors. These programs provide education in financial literacy, access to local resources, expanding access to banking services and building financial stability by using strategies such as matched savings.\nFor more information, contact the Economic Justice program by telephone at (850) 425-2749.\nResources for Advocates / Housing Links and Resources\nAccessing safe and affordable housing is a consistent barrier for survivors. Below are helpful links to address the housing needs of survivors. However, training and technical assistance specific to housing is available through FCADV’s Economic Justice program. For more information, contact the Economic Justice program by telephone at (850) 425-2749.\nHousing Rights for Survivors of Domestic Violence Living in Public Housing or Using Vouchers. 2006.\nMaintaining Safe and Stable Housing for Domestic Violence Survivors\nFinding Affordable and Accessible Rental Housing\nA useful tool for assisting survivors is a housing locator system with an up-to-date database of all housing units built with public funding (in English and Spanish).

This curriculum includes financial tools and information to assist survivors of domestic violence to fully understand the dynamics of economic abuse. Survivors engage in short-term and long-term planning to accomplish their personal financial goals and gain financial stability. Survivors learn:\nApproaches for locating and effectively accessing local, state and national personal safety and financial resources;\n- Information on how to protect one's personal and financial safety in-crisis and post-crisis;\n- Strategies for dealing with the misuse of financial records; and\n- Tools to help achieve long-term economic empowerment without regard to level of income or earning power.\nAllstate employees and agencies partner with FCADV and Florida's certified domestic violence centers to train and support advocates to utilize the curriculum with survivors in groups or in one-on-one sessions.\nFor additional information on The Allstate Foundation economic empowerment programs or to download the free Moving Ahead Through Financial Management Curriculum, a comprehensive package of user-friendly financial tools and information available in English or Spanish, please visit: http://www.clicktoempower.org/.\nIf you are interested in receiving hard copies of the curriculum, training for facilitators or additional technical assistance, please contact FCADV’s Economic Justice Initiative by calling the number below.\nFor information about financial abuse and resources available to survivors, visit:http://www.womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?id=14107&state_code=PG.

There is one central site that provides a truly free credit file disclosure, commonly called a credit report, once every 12 months from each of the nationwide consumer credit reporting companies: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. To obtain a free credit report, visit: www.annualcreditreport.com. Matched Savings Programs (Individual Development Accounts)\nMatched savings accounts or Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) enable low-income families to save and build assets. IDAs encourage savings efforts by offering them 1:1, 2:1, or more generous matches for their own deposits. IDAs reward the monthly savings of working-poor families who are trying to buy their first home, pay for post-secondary education, or start a small business. Many IDA programs are funded through the Assets for Independence program from the US Department of Health and Human Services. These programs are implemented by community-based organizations in partnership with a financial institution that holds the deposits.\nMicroenterprise and Small Business Development\nMicroenterprise provides opportunities for survivors to start their own small business to supplement their income or as their main employment.\nThe Association for Enterprise Opportunity (AEO) is the national association of community-based organizations that provides entrepreneurial education, access to capital, and support to aspiring and active low-income entrepreneurs. Their website provides a comprehensive overview of how micro loans work.

{"question":"Can you provide a comparison of the flowering and care requirements for Himalayan Meadow Primrose when grown indoors vs outdoors?","answer":"For indoor growing, Himalayan Meadow Primrose should be started in February to transplant after the last frost. The plant needs bright, indirect sunlight and high humidity (50% or higher), which may require a humidifier. For outdoor growing, seeds can be sown in autumn or spring (March-June). Autumn sowing leads to early blooms the following year. In both settings, the plant requires temperatures between 50°F and 70°F, and consistently moist but not waterlogged soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. Outdoor plants should be placed in partial shade to avoid intense midday sun. The plant needs about one gallon of water per square foot of soil weekly during the growing season, with reduced watering in fall and winter.","context":["If you are not sure when you should sow your seeds our summary will help you.\nHere you will find general information - for detailed sowing tips of the specific plants please go to our product description.\nGarden Flowers and Groundcovers\nMost of the garden flowers can be sown in Autumn or Spring.\nAutumn sowing will result in the blooms early in the season the following year.\nAutumn: Sow in pots or trays of moist seed compost and cover with a very fine sprinkling of compost or vermiculite. Make sure that the seeds are kept in the light place which is necessary for them to germinate. Keep the surface of the compost moist but not wet because the seeds may rot. Temperature should be around 20 dec C.\nSpring: The best time to start the seeds is March – June.\nSow outdoors where they are to flower. Cover the seeds with the thin layer of soil and keep the moist. You can also start the seeds inside and then transplant them outside when the seedlings are big enough\nWinter : February is the month when you can start your flowers indoors to be able to transplant them in the garden after last frost.\nTrees and shrubs from our climate zone\nTree Seeds can be sown all year round you only need to remember about cold stratification. When you receive the seeds, soak them in the hot water for 48 hours. Change the water few times. After this process seeds have to be dried that they don’t rot and put in the fridge for 3 months. You can mix them with moist, but not wet soil and check on them every week or so.\nAfter cold stratification you can sow them inside in the pot, provide with lots of light and keep the soil moist at all times.\nIt is advised to keep the seedling indoors during first winter to protect them from the cold weather.\nExotic Trees and shrubs Can be sown all year round\nMost of the exotic tree seeds don’t need to go through cold stratification process. You can sow them indoors, in the greenhouse or use propagator which increases humidity, keeps the temperature constant throughout the day and night. Light and humidity are the most important factors.\nCarniovorous Plants Can be sown all year round\nSeeds should be sown in transparent, closed and easily cleaned pots. You can also use other containers such as glasses (e.g. canning jars), saucers, or plastic boxes. All pots must be cleaned very carefully in order to obtain successful results. Seeds can also be sown in regular plastic pots if you can maintain high humidity, for example, in an aquarium covered with a lid.\nSeeds should be sown on the surface of the moist planting medium and maintained in a humid environment (RH, relative humidity, from 60 to 100%). Seeds should be gently pressed into the growing medium, covered lightly with soil or left uncovered. Carnivorous plants germinate with bright light. The soil should be kept moist at all times (bottom watering is best), using only boiled or distilled water. After the seed starts germinating, slowly harden the young seedlings by successive increases in ventilation. Allow the humidity to decrease to approximately 60 - 80%.\nMost CP germinate within a temperature range of 17 °C - 35 °C. Indirect or filtered sunlight is best. Temperatures over 40 °C are harmful to seeds and especially to young seedlings. Seeds of some species require special treatments such as stratification; a cold or heat treatment required before germination can occur. This procedure removes germination inhibitors, without which germination takes too long or does not occur at all.\nCacti Seeds Can be sown all year round\nIt is important not to bury the seeds too deep. The best is to sow the seeds on the surface and leave them as is. Use a fine mist spray bottle to water your seeds this as it does not disrupt the seeds and waters the surface evenly without puddles. Give the seeds a good soak so that most of the substrate is moist. At this point in a cactus' life they are actually not good with dry conditions. Most species benefit from very high humidity and do not like to dry out. After watering place the pots inside a zip lock bag or place a cut bottle or clear plastic cup over the pot to create a humid environment, while still allowing light in. Depending on species, keep the seedlings in the humid environment for 1-6 months","Himalayan Meadow Primrose Primula rosea (Or)\nThe Himalayan meadow primrose is a charming flowering plant with vibrant pink flowers that have a yellow eye at the center. These blooms are arranged in clusters atop the green, oval-shaped leaves that form a lush rosette at the plant's base. The leaves have a sort of crinkled texture, which adds to the plant's visual interest. The flowers emerge on stems that rise above the foliage, creating a delightful contrast against the green backdrop. The profusion of bright blossoms makes it an eye-catching addition to any garden space where it is grown. The overall appearance of the Himalayan meadow primrose is one that exudes a wild, natural beauty, often reminiscent of the alpine meadows where such plants are typically found.\nAbout this plant\nRosy Primrose, Himalayan Meadow Primrose, Pink Primula.\nPrimrose is generally considered a non-toxic plant to humans, and there is limited information on its toxicity. However, all parts of the plant may contain small amounts of saponins and other compounds which can sometimes cause mild stomach upset if ingested in significant quantities. It is not known for causing serious health issues in humans, but as with any plant, individual reactions can vary, and it is advisable to avoid ingesting this or any ornamental plant.\nPrimrose is not known to be highly toxic to pets, but it might cause mild gastrointestinal upset, such as vomiting or diarrhea, if ingested in large amounts. As with humans, the presence of saponins and other compounds in the plant may act as irritants. It is recommended to keep pets from eating ornamental plants as they could have various reactions depending on the individual animal's sensitivity.\nColor of leaves\n6 inches (15 cm)\n8 inches (20 cm)\n- General Benefits\n- Ornamental Value: The rosy primrose is prized for its bright pink blossoms that add color and beauty to gardens and landscapes.\n- Attracts Pollinators: The flowers of the rosy primrose attract bees, butterflies and other beneficial pollinators, supporting biodiversity.\n- Easy Maintenance: As a hardy plant, it requires minimal care once established, making it suitable for novice gardeners.\n- Seasonal Interest: It blooms in the early spring, providing early-season interest in the garden when other plants are not yet in flower.\n- Compact Growth: Its small and compact size makes it ideal for rock gardens, containers, or small garden spaces.\n- Herbaceous Perennial: As a perennial, it returns year after year, offering long-term enjoyment without the need to replant annually.\n- Moisture Indicator: It prefers moist conditions; thus, its presence can indicate areas in the landscape with adequate water or indicate when additional watering is needed.\n- Medical Properties\n- Anti-inflammatory: Primula rosea has been used in traditional medicine to reduce inflammation.\n- Antispasmodic: It may also have properties that help relieve spasms.\n- Diuretic: There are claims that this plant can act as a diuretic, aiding in the removal of excess water from the body.\n- Air-purifying Qualities\nThis plant is not specifically known for air purifying qualities.\n- Other Uses\n- Adding color to salads: The bright pink flowers of the Primula rosea can be used as an edible garnish to add a pop of color and a mild, sweet flavor to green salads.\n- Natural dye: The petals of the Primula rosea can be boiled to extract a natural dye that can be used for coloring fabrics or even Easter eggs.\n- Garden aesthetics: With their vibrant colors, they can be planted in rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover to enhance the visual appeal of the area.\n- Companion planting: Primula rosea can be grown alongside other moisture-loving plants to create a cohesive and supportive planting environment.\n- Butterfly attraction: The flowers attract butterflies and other pollinators, which can help pollinate other plants in the garden.\n- Educational tool: Primula rosea can be used in schools or educational programs to teach students about plant biology, life cycles, and horticulture.\n- Culinary experimentation: Some chefs may use the flowers to experiment with new dessert presentations, flavorings, or as part of an herbal infusion for drinks.\n- Photography subject: The striking colors and textures of Primula rosea make it a popular subject for photographers, especially in macro photography.\n- Floral arrangements: Fresh or dried Primula rosea flowers can be used in floral arrangements to provide a touch of nature indoors.\n- Art inspiration: Artists may use the distinct look of Primula rosea as inspiration for paintings, drawings, and other art forms.\n- Feng Shui\nThe Primrose is not used in Feng Shui practice.\n- Zodiac Sign Compitability\nThe Primrose is not used in astrology practice.\n- Plant Symbolism\n- Youthfulness: Primula, commonly known as primrose, often symbolizes the essence of youth and vitality because they are among the first flowers to bloom in spring.\n- Renewal: As a herald of spring, primroses symbolize new beginnings, rebirth, and the rejuvenation of nature after winter.\n- Love and Affection: With its delicate and cheerful appearance, the primrose can represent the blossoming of love and the care one person holds for another.\n- Hope: The primrose's penchant for blooming in early spring also makes it a representation of hope and the expectation of better times ahead after the cold winter months.\n- Protection: According to some traditions, primroses have been thought to provide protection against evils and misfortune, especially when planted at the doorstep.\nHimalayan meadow primrose should be watered moderately, ensuring the soil stays moist but not waterlogged. During the growing season, typically in spring and summer, water the plant generously about once a week with about one gallon per square foot of soil, adjusting based on rainfall and temperature. Reduce watering frequency in the fall and winter to prevent root rot. Always check the top inch of soil for dryness before watering to avoid overwatering, which can be harmful to the plant's health.\nHimalayan meadow primrose thrives in partial shade where it can receive bright, indirect sunlight. The ideal spot for this plant is one where it's shielded from the intense midday sun, such as under a tree canopy or beside a structure that casts partial shadow. Avoid exposing it to prolonged hours of direct sunlight, especially in hotter climates, to prevent scorching the leaves.\nThe Himalayan meadow primrose prefers cool to moderate temperatures, flourishing in a range between 50°F and 70°F. It can tolerate minimum temperatures down to around 32°F, but frost can cause damage, and maximum temperatures should not exceed 80°F to prevent heat stress. The ideal temperature conditions are within the cool to mild range, which will support healthy growth and flowering.\nPruning Himalayan meadow primrose is primarily for removing spent flowers and dead or damaged foliage to encourage new growth and additional blooming. Light pruning can be done throughout the blooming season as needed. The best time for more extensive pruning is immediately after flowering has finished in late spring or early summer.\nRosy Primrose thrives in consistently moist, well-draining soil enriched with organic matter, such as peat or leaf mold. Ideal soil pH for Rosy Primrose should be between 6.0 and 7.5. For best results, a mix of loam, peat, and perlite in equal parts can be used to maintain the necessary moisture and drainage balance.\nRosy Primrose typically needs to be repotted every one to two years, preferably in the spring. Inspect the root system; if the roots have filled the pot, it's time to repot into a slightly larger container maintaining the same soil composition.\n- Humidity & Misting\nRosy Primrose prefers high humidity conditions to thrive. Aim for a humidity level of 50% or higher. They are more likely to prosper outdoors in a naturally humid environment, but indoor growers should consider using a humidifier or pebble tray to raise moisture around the plant.\n- Suitable locations\nPlace Rosy Primrose near bright, indirect light and maintain high humidity.\nPlace in partial shade, ensure moist soil and protect from midday sun.\n- Life cycle\nPrimula rosea, commonly known as Rosy Primrose, begins its life cycle as a seed, typically sown in cold conditions as it requires a period of cold stratification to germinate. Upon exposure to favorable temperatures in spring, the seed germinates and develops into a small rosette of leaves close to the ground. As the plant matures, it forms a more substantial leaf rosette, and a flowering stalk emerges, bearing clusters of bright pink to rosy-purple flowers. After pollination, often by insects attracted to the flowers' color and nectar, the flowers develop into capsules containing numerous tiny seeds. These seeds are then dispersed by various means, including wind and water, completing the reproductive cycle. In its perennial phase, the Rosy Primrose will enter a period of dormancy during the winter, conserving energy to begin the cycle anew come spring.\nThe Himalayan Meadow Primrose, known scientifically as Primula rosea, can be propagated most popularly by seed. The best time to sow seeds is late winter to early spring. To propagate by seed, surface sow the tiny seeds on a well-draining seed-starting mix, as light aids germination. It's essential to not cover the seeds with soil but to press them gently into the surface. Maintain moisture but avoid overwatering to prevent fungus or seed rot. Top the container with clear plastic wrap or a propagation dome to maintain humidity, placing it in a location with bright, indirect light and a temperature around 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5 to 18.3 degrees Celsius). Seedlings will typically emerge within 3 to 6 weeks and can be transplanted into individual pots once they have several true leaves."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dfda7b3e-983d-4fb1-98d6-95e6f8c77ded>","<urn:uuid:25db8cf0-b8f0-4f89-9a38-056e066d9dc4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the main social factors that became critical during the pandemic crisis, and how did this relate to companies' climate transition efforts?","answer":"During the pandemic, three key social factors emerged as critical: health and safety, labor relations, and respect for the community. Health and safety became central as companies grappled with workplace safety and public health system capacity. Labor relations became a flashpoint as unemployment spiked above 14% in the U.S., testing companies' ability to protect employees while maintaining operations. Community respect was demonstrated through pandemic mitigation measures and corporate contributions to community needs. These social challenges coincided with increased focus on climate transition, as demonstrated by Climate Action 100+'s new Net-Zero Company Benchmark, which now includes indicators for just transition - assessing how companies' net-zero transitions impact their workforce, communities, and supply chains. This integration of social and climate factors reflects growing recognition that company sustainability requires managing both environmental and social risks.","context":["Article originally published in November 2021 issue of ProxyInsight. Written by Stephanie Maier, Global Head of Sustainable and Impact Investment at GAM Investments and current chair of Climate Action 100+ global Steering Committee, and Anne Simpson, Managing Investment Director, Board Governance & Sustainability at CalPERS and member of the Climate Action 100+ global Steering Committee.\n2021 has been a remarkable year for shareholder action on climate change. Investors secured historic results, accelerating the decarbonization of the world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters through new net-zero commitments, replacing directors, and aligning political lobbying with the Paris Agreement. The progress shows what investors can achieve and Climate Action 100+ is raising its game.\nAs investors, we know we can and we must turn the financial tide and drive meaningful decarbonization by stepping up the intensity of our engagements with companies. We are not alone in this viewpoint. The Climate Action 100+ initiative now includes more than 615 investors responsible for over $60 trillion in assets under management.\nA PROXY SEASON TO REMEMBER\nThere was extraordinary growth in climate-related shareholder resolutions in the 2021 proxy season, as investors demonstrated their willingness to use these as an effective means of securing more ambitious targets from companies. In the U.S., there were over 147 climate-related resolutions filed, with 47 going to a vote and support averaging 40%. Six out of 14 shareholder proposals filed by Climate Action 100+ investor signatories and flagged by the initiative won majority support, according to Proxy Insight Online data.\nTURNING COMMITMENT INTO ACTION\nTo provide a transparent and objective way of measuring company progress, Climate Action 100+ launched the first iteration of its Net-Zero Company Benchmark in March. This provides the foundation for company engagement coordinated through the initiative, and the assessments have become a widely-cited demonstration of the progress companies are making in aligning to a net-zero future.\nTo date, 111 of the systemically-important emitters on the Climate Action 100+ focus list have responded to this call from from investors by setting net-zero targets. But there is still much more work to do and investor signatories are engaging intensely with companies on improving their alignment ahead of the next round of assessments in March 2022.\nClimate Action 100+ launched a new sectoral program this year, looking at the actions that companies, industries as a whole and investors in carbon-intensive sectors must take to accelerate the pace of the net-zero transition. But decarbonisation isn’t a ‘one size fits all’ approach. The strategies published so far for the aviation, steel, food and beverage, and electric utilities sectors aim to provide sector specific detail and clarity. In the coming months we’ll be working on sector strategies for the remaining sectors that are vital to the transition.\nRAISING THE BAR IN 2022\nClimate Action 100+ recently published an updated framework and indicators for the next iteration of the Net- Zero Company Benchmark company assessments, which will be released in March 2022. The new and updated indicators reflect the evolving priorities of investors, with a new climate accounting and audit indicator representing the increased focus around incorporating climate risk in financial accounts. In addition, the inclusion of a just transition indicator assesses the impact of a company’s net-zero transition on its workforce, communities, and supply chains.\nBuilding on the strong results from this year, we expect there will be a laser focus on how company net-zero goals are being met with short-, medium-, and long-term emissions reduction targets, and we anticipate more resolutions on integrating climate risk into financial accounts. We also expect to see more companies producing transition plans and putting these to shareholder advisory votes.\nWhere we don’t see the required progress being made from companies, the next step is to ask directors to respond to these challenges and bring about the required change. This year, investors demonstrated their willingness to hold boards to account on climate change, in particular with the election of three new directors at Exxon Mobil.\nNone of these are small challenges but if we can build on the momentum that was achieved this year, we are hopeful we can drive further alignment with the goals of the Paris Agreement. As fiduciaries, with a duty of prudence, loyalty, and care, we expect nothing less than the companies across our portfolios to manage the risk and find the opportunity that the transition to net-zero will bring.","ESG investing and the pandemic\nAt the onset of this year’s pandemic-driven volatility, signals of ESG-related strength were widely noted, both at the company level and in ESG-focused equity investment strategies. For example, a Harvard Business School working paper released in April documented how companies that the public perceived as behaving more responsibly during the March downturn had less-negative stock returns than their competitors.1 And in a widely cited U.S. mutual fund industry study, fund rating agency Morningstar remarked that “4 times more sustainable funds finished in the best quartile than in the worst quartile of their categories” during the first quarter.2\nWhat was the key to this resilience? One reason is a widespread energy sector underweight among ESG investment approaches. As COVID-19 dealt a serious blow to the near-term prospects for global economic growth, that helped trigger an oil price collapse and major volatility across the energy sector. A structural view against the future prospects of traditional energy companies, it appeared, helped the performance of a broad swath of ESG funds versus their traditionally managed peers.3\nBeyond the cautious sector view, the Wall Street Journal noted in late March that ESG factors, particularly social factors, could become more important at the corporate level as investor interest in companies’ approach to human capital management grew more urgent.4 And as Morningstar’s Head of Sustainability Research for the Americas John Hale declared, ESG strategies appeared to be notably consistent outperformers because they tended to pursue the “quality companies of the 21st Century,” with a focus on “selecting stocks with better ESG credentials.”5\nIn this moment, ESG factors showed their close alliance—even an identity—with the most operative contemporary definitions of quality. Notably, though, this isn’t quality conceived as a history of profitability, but quality associated with a mix of quantitative and qualitative signals of sustainability, particularly factors that have often been called nonfinancial, intangible, or prefinancial.\nIn times of crisis, the prefinancial costs can become financial—sometimes, materially so—flipping the script of materiality and displacing other factors that might formerly have been deemed to have a greater impact on a company’s bottom line. One of the questions we face now concerns whether this reshuffling of factors on the basis of their materiality requires a tactical or a more strategic shift in investment approach.\nThe pandemic and the proliferation of social risks\nAs the pandemic has progressed, it appears that companies with a stronger ESG proposition seemed better prepared to weather the economic storm that no one projected would happen6, not to mention the social unrest that soon followed. Surfacing a range of systemic social risks, the pandemic has underscored the fragility of economic structures in relation to social factors.\nAccording to some observers, ESG strategies have maintained an edge through 2020’s market dislocations because they’ve taken a long view on what counts as a sustainable investment across sectors. Banks and other institutions that formerly downplayed the significance of ESG investing have consequently developed a keen interest in sustainable investment characteristics.7 We think this set of key characteristics is a dynamic but finite set of interrelated ESG factors.\nAn ESG strategy’s potential for outperformance, moreover, rests on its practice of modeling different scenarios of deterioration or strength. That can mean anticipating the consequences for corporate health in the context of varying climate scenarios or the degree of positive or negative momentum due to changes in social conditions. While the social factors at issue in the pandemic have varied by region and timeframe, the social factors we’ve observed as being the most material for the greatest number of companies include health and safety, labor relations, and respect for the community.\nHealth and safety: public health structures under pressure\nHealth and safety are at the center of the pandemic’s swirl of uncertainty. In March, market participants of all levels of sophistication suddenly found themselves grappling with personal and community-focused health questions that could have profound consequences for their lives, livelihoods, and investment portfolios:\n- Is it safe for anyone to go to work or for my children to go to school? How long will my family need to shelter in place?\n- Is our public health system equipped to handle the pandemic or will it be pushed past its breaking point?\n- Would resources aimed at finding a cure be allocated in a way that hastened the development of truly effective treatments for the general population or shareholder- and insider-focused profits?\nThere were and continue to be no guarantees that the resolution to these health and safety questions will be positive in the short to medium term, neither for the global population nor for the global economy. Faced with such staggering uncertainty, traditional asset managers and asset owners were all equally in the dark about what they could reasonably expect from their portfolios in the way of risk/adjusted returns. But because of their focus on systemic risks, ESG- strategies can be more aware of the materiality of social risks for different companies, industries, and economically interdependent regions exposed to outbreaks.\nLabor relations: a major stress test for companies in hard-hit areas\nAt no time since the Great Depression did so many people lose their jobs or have the safety of their employment put into doubt so quickly. Consequently, labor relations swiftly became a flash point for companies across the capitalization spectrum:\n- How steadfast could companies be in treating employees empathetically—putting their health and safety, not to mention their jobs, above corporate profits? What if the crisis wears on into 2021 and beyond?\n- Would companies be able to create safe workspaces for their employees? At what cost?\n- Were companies fully aware that their behavior during the crisis might define their future ability to retain talent and customer loyalty?\nIn the early stages of the first wave of the pandemic, charts showing unemployment data registered an implausibly sharp spike. Within a matter of weeks, U.S. unemployment rose above 14%, indicating tens of millions of people had lost their jobs. While data was more mixed in European countries, emerging economies also faced a severe employment shock.8 What could companies and sovereigns realistically do to protect the unemployed and the still employed but quickly overextended essential workers? How companies treat their employees in the context of once-in-a-generation financial difficulty is perhaps the ultimate stress test measuring the relative strength of the social factor across companies, industries, and sectors.\nRespect for the community: positive catalyst for change?\nRespect for the community has become another flash point of risk and opportunity for many companies since the onset of the crisis:\n- Would companies take pains to shift their operations smoothly—for example, by implementing business continuity plans or by putting certain operations on hold until a time of relative safety?\n- If a company operated in the presence of the general public, did it respect pandemic-mitigation measures or treat these in a more cavalier manner?\n- Did companies donate resources to help the broader community? Whether that meant donating PPE gear or converting manufacturing capacity to build ventilators, produce hand sanitizer, and so on.\n- In what ways have companies pledged to change for the long term, particularly with respect to how they see themselves and their operations having an impact on the communities in which they operate?\nMany companies have shown a willingness to tread a path toward social change. Nowhere is this more evident than in the United States, where the pandemic has exacerbated tensions in the country’s ongoing reckoning over its history of racial injustice. Where companies stand on the relevant issues has more than occasionally had an impact on their business, and—on the hopeful side—these positions may become catalysts for improved results in U.S. board diversity, gender equality, and equitable compensation structures that favor broad stakeholder interests.\nSustainable investing is resilient investing\nFor ESG investors, the central focus is on sustainability, a condition of resiliency represented in company fundamentals and management effectiveness at managing material risks, which, in aggregate, gives companies a better chance of thriving in the future. As it was recently put in Responsible Investor, the measure of a company’s sustainability comes down to “how resilient and agile [they are] in handling many stakeholders, global uncertainties, shocks and disruptions—regardless of whether these are caused by a pandemic, social unrest, or an environmental emergency.”9\nQualitative, prefinancial factors are accepted by ESG strategies as potential drivers of future business strength and weakness. That may be one reason why momentum continues to gather behind ESG strategies, as investors increasingly look to see whether a company has the strategic vision and capabilities to achieve and maintain strong ESG performance—in other words, long-term resiliency and the ability to manage tail risks.\n1 “Corporate Resilience and Response During COVID-19,” Alex Cheema-Fox, Bridget LaPerla, George Serafeim, and Hui (Stacie) Wang, Harvard Business School Accounting & Management Unit Working Paper No. 20-108, April 2020. 2 “Sustainable Funds Weather the First Quarter Better Than Conventional Funds,” Morningstar, April 3, 2020.

See, for example, Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates’s 2015 Ted Talk. 7 Wall Street Journal, March 25, 2020. 8 “Emerging economies in full-blown unemployment crisis,” United Nations, June 4, 2020. 9 “No Surprise: Sustainability Funds Outperform the Market—Despite COVID-19,” Responsible Investor, April 24, 2020.\nA widespread health crisis such as a global pandemic could cause substantial market volatility, exchange trading suspensions and closures, and affect portfolio performance. For example, the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in significant disruptions to global business activity. The impact of a health crisis and other epidemics and pandemics that may arise in the future, could affect the global economy in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen at the present time. A health crisis may exacerbate other preexisting political, social, and economic risks.

{"question":"Why is succession planning important for nonprofit organizations?","answer":"Succession planning is crucial for nonprofits because unplanned transitions in key positions can cost significant time, money, and cause public relations challenges. Additionally, nonprofits face workforce realities like retiring Baby Boomers and difficulty attracting new talent. Without proper succession planning, these organizations risk their futures and face expensive consequences when replacing key positions or managing leadership voids.","context":["As published in The Long Beach Business Journal, Third Sector Report Columnist\nIt’s too bad that whenever the word, “succession,” finds its way into conversations at most nonprofit organizations, most view its utterance as code for someone needs to go.\nWhen an inevitable transition does occur, these same organizations soon discover that having kept succession in the closet ultimately costs their worthy causes significant amounts of time, money and angst.\nWhy Succession Plans Are Crucial\nThe third sector is no different than the other sectors when it comes to human resource matters and leadership. Most transitions in key positions aren’t planned. Messy exits can be a public relations challenge. And, transitions that should have happened earlier, but for personal or political reasons were avoided, creates a domino-effect of other’s choosing to vacate their positions instead.\nWhile nonprofits face other common workforce realities such as a Baby Boomer generation retiring en masse and the difficulty of attracting and keeping up-and-comers, the sector has a couple of quirks that make leadership continuity slightly more complicated: The first is that each of these realities can be applied not only to paid employees, but also to volunteers. The second is that without term limits and a commitment to succession, great causes can easily evolve into family-run businesses disguised as nonprofits.\nAll of these factors sum up to a subject that is emotionally charged and filled with deeply-rooted confusion over what constitutes prudent succession planning for a nonprofit organization.\nReplacing key positions, managing with a leadership void, and curbing high attrition are expensive propositions for any enterprise. For organizations that depend on people’s generosity to survive, however, these are situations that demand pro-active and visible attention.\nMost Nonprofits Lack Adequate Succession Plans\nThe Daring to Lead study released by CompassPoint Nonprofit Services in Oakland dramatically illustrates the current state of the sector when it comes to succession:\n- 17 percent of 3,000 nonprofit organizations indicate having a succession plan\n- 24 percent of nonprofit executives report planning to vacate their positions within two years\n- 45 percent have no executive performance review process to annually discuss succession\nBased on these numbers, there is a significant quantity of important nonprofit organizations whose futures are at risk. Sadly, most of them have little idea how large the risk is because succession has been considered an unmentionable in their cultures.\nFor those who have believed that investing time and money in leadership development, retention and succession will hurt a nonprofit’s overhead calculations, the Daring to Lead numbers suggest that the day in court is nigh. The costs of sloppy human resource practices, poorly managed executive exits, replacing avoidable vacancies, and a lack of competent future board leadership creates a tab that is going to difficult to prove as circumstantial. The sum of these costs will be even more difficult defend as responsible fiduciary oversight in the name of charity.\nSuccession, like fundraising, is an integral piece of a successful nonprofit’s organizational culture. Both subjects are forms of resource development that are equally vital for fueling its future.\nSix Crucial Attributes of a Successful Succession Plan\nCultures that value succession have six distinct attributes. The first is operating with a common understanding that succession is about ongoing efforts to assure a continuity of good leadership is in place for the organization. It is not about naming an heir-apparent or planning one person’s transition.\nThe second attribute is completing a contingency operations plan every year and creating a warehouse of vital organizational information should a key position become vacant for any reason. The third attribute is a series of board-approved succession policies which mandates such things as performance reviews, term limits, human resource procedures, and nominations.\nDemonstrated competencies in basic human resources is the critical fourth attribute. The fifth is completing and managing from a strategic plan that pays as much attention to developing human capital as it does to developing financial capital for creating its future. And, the final attribute is assigning the task of succession to key people as part of their job responsibilities and performance objectives.\nFor me, nonprofit leadership succession has become an obsession. Perhaps I’ve stood on the curb for too many years watching people confuse or avoid the subject and declining to get on the succession planning bus. It’s painful to witness so many great executives, boards and organizations now at significant risk of being hit by it.\nImage courtesy of pexels.com."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:17b4a9a1-a659-4558-9695-74b1c5279415>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do strategies for preventing the spread of bed bugs in buildings compare with protocols for controlling mercury contamination, particularly regarding isolation and protective measures?","answer":"Both bed bugs and mercury require comprehensive containment strategies. For bed bugs, this involves educating residents about proper inspection and disposal protocols, developing specific building protocols, and ensuring infested items are properly wrapped in sealed plastic before removal. For mercury, containment involves engineering controls like exhaust ventilation, establishing eyewash stations and safety showers near workstations, and requiring specific protective equipment including vapor respirators, full suits, gloves and boots. In both cases, immediate isolation of the hazard is critical - bed bug-infested furniture must be wrapped and sealed, while mercury spills must be immediately contained and absorbed with inert materials. Both situations also require careful attention to prevent spread to other areas and systematic protocols for disposal.","context":["This is a sample furniture inspection and disposal protocol designed to be used by building managers and landlords to develop their own building specific protocol. Developing a system for inspecting and disposing of potentially infested furniture - in conjunction with resident/staff education - will prevent infested furniture from entering the building or spreading bed bug problems to other units.\nWhen bed bug inspections reveal that a bed or other piece of furniture is infested with bed bugs, home owners often panic and seek to immediately discard the furniture.\nThere are times that furniture should be discarded but certainly not always. Remember that bed bugs can be eliminated from beds or stuffed furniture using control methods mentioned later. In most cases there is no need to throw expensive furniture out.\nHaving said that, there are situations when a heavily infested piece of furniture might best be simply disposed of. Just how that is done is critical to prevent the spread of bed bugs.\nFurniture moving is most often a two man job. When it comes to bed bug infested furniture, this is even more true.\nBefore you even begin to move the furniture, make a sound plan as to how and where the furniture can be moved easily and safely.\nRemove bed bug infested furniture from a home or apartment with ‘containment’ in mind. The goal is as much to prevent the spread of the bugs, as it is to be rid of the furniture. To do this you must ensure that all bugs are contained inside the furniture on the way to the dumpster. This is best done by wrapping the chair or couch in plastic. Drop cloths are inexpensive large sheets of plastic that can be wrapped around the furniture and sealed with tape. Be sure to seal up any openings or tears so that the bugs cannot fall out as the furniture is loaded, tipped and carried down hallway, stairs and through doors.\nOnce the furniture is successfully removed from the building it is the final responsibility of the owner to ensure that the furniture is not picked up by another and taken into another home or apartment, thereby spreading the bed bug infestation. The best way to assure that this does not occur is to render the furniture unusable. Breaking the wooden framing and slashing the fabric with a utility knife are two effective ways of doing this. Further, ensure that others know that the furniture is infested by marking it as such before you leave it to be discarded.\nManagement will design building-specific protocol for disposing of all furniture and other household items. This protocol should include the following:\nEducating residents on proper inspection and disposal of furniture is the key to preventing the spread of bed bugs. Once a protocol is developed, it must be communicated to all residents without exception and periodically repeated. With the proper education, your tenants can become an ally in preventing your building from ever becoming a bed bug haven.Back to top","MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET\nProduct Name: Mercury\nCatalogue Codes: SLM3505, SLM1363\nTSCA: TSCA 8(b) inventory: Mercury\nCI#: Not applicable.\nSynonym: Quick Silver; Colloidal Mercury; Metallic Mercury; Liquid Silver; Hydragyrum\nChemical Name: Mercury\nChemical Formula: Hg\nToxicological Data on Ingredients: Mercury LD50: Not available.

{"question":"What characteristics make slab built ceramics different from wheel pottery?","answer":"Slab built ceramics allows for more spontaneous, loose, lively and organic shapes compared to wheel pottery. The technique involves hand-shaping slabs of clay into finished platters, plates, and bowls. It offers more flexibility in creating complex shapes and curves very quickly, and allows for incorporating personal techniques like custom molds and stamps for embellishment. Each piece can be highly individual, unlike wheel-thrown pottery.","context":["It doesn’t matter how big the box is: human beings simply don’t fit in them.\nCreativity, experimentation, exploration — these elements rage against the sides of the box until they knock them down, freeing the spirit within. And the more stubborn and determined the person, the more he or she resists the box — and the more interesting their story.\nSo it is with Dave Raynalds, a Portland potter who specializes in slab ceramics, a technique that involves hand-shaping slabs of clay into finished platters, plates, and bowls.\nNot a Box: Slab Built Ceramic Shapes\n“All my work is slab built,” Raynalds says. “I prefer the spontaneous, loose, lively and organic shapes that slab building can give.”\nRaynalds first experimented with the slab ceramic technique in college, when he took an art class every term, from drawing to macrame. During his pottery class, he created a vast and impressive array of items, all slab built, and then was mildly . . . irritated when he received a lower grade because he had done no wheel work. It was 40 years later that persistent insistence by his wife, enrolled in a pottery class at the Multnomah Arts Center, convinced Raynalds to give it another try.\n“I knew I would love it, but I didn’t want to intrude on her thing,” Raynalds explains. “It didn’t take much convincing, though, and now we both spend four or five days a week at the studio at the center.”\nInspired by Betty Feves\nRaised in Pendleton, Raynalds attended junior high and high school when Betty Feves, the nationally famous ceramicist and musician, was on the school board, so all through his pre-college schooling, he received excellent education in the arts, due to the district’s commitment to providing it. In college, he took his degree in geology, and because of his tendency toward kicking the box, embarked upon a career as a cabinet maker, or as he puts it,\n“I got into woodworking by buying so many woodworking tools that I had to turn professional. I worked as a cabinet maker for 30 years.”\nNow retired from cabinet making, Raynalds incorporates his woodworking experience into his pottery, as he takes a woodworker’s approach to clay using similar building techniques.\nOut of the Box Woodworking Tricks for Slab Built Ceramics\n“Many woodworking tricks translate well to slab-built ceramics. But unlike wood, if you cut something too short, you can add more clay and move on.\n“Clay lends itself to more organic shapes than wood. This appeals to me because complex shapes and curves can be generated very fast, as opposed to wood.”\nHis geology studies come into play with painting watercolor landscapes, a pursuit he adopted five years ago on a canoe trip in Utah, complete with sketchbook and portable paints. And coming full circle, the painting incorporates back into the slab ceramics, as he chooses and uses glazes and creates designs. Nothing is isolated, and no experience is wasted.\n“I am a born tinkerer and maker,” Raynalds says. “I’ve made my own recumbent bicycle, a replica of an Aleutian skin kayak, a ten-foot computer-controlled telescope, and many other gadgets.\n“I enjoy sewing my own camping equipment — panniers, backpacks — as well as participating in family quilting round robins. As a cabinet maker, I worked for artists making large installations and custom framing.\n“I was one of the first bicycle messengers in Portland, and have crossed the country twice on my bicycle.”\nEclectic, Unique, Out of the Box Resume\nIt’s an eclectic, highly personalized resume, one that evidences the owner’s willingness to try not only new, but seemingly unrelated things. For instance, regarding being a bicycle messenger, something many people have encountered only through Kevin Bacon’s 1986 movie, Quicksilver, Raynalds says,\n“I got the job from an ad in a newspaper. At that time, there were no bike messengers except an old guy who delivered office supplies.\n“I delivered mostly legal papers, real estate documents, and blueprints on a one-speed Schwinn with coaster brakes. I did this for four years.”\nCiting Goodwill as a favorite source for texture materials and tools for his work, Raynalds creates his own molds and stamps to embellish his pottery, with the focus on each piece being as highly individual as its creator.\n“While I was a cabinet maker, I tried to do high end work, or interesting work,” Raynalds says.

{"question":"As a soil researcher, I'm curious about biodiversity assessment methods - how do the biodiversity measurement approaches differ between the citizen science soil project and the vineyard research program?","answer":"The citizen science project focuses primarily on bacterial diversity assessment through isolation of bacteria and detection of gene sets from soil samples. In contrast, the vineyard research program takes a much broader approach to biodiversity assessment, examining multiple taxonomic groups including: plants (species richness and cover), microflora (bacteria and fungi through pyrosequencing), soil macrofauna (earthworms collected through standard procedures), and insects (ground beetles via pitfall traps and parasitoids via larvae collection). While both projects examine soil microorganisms, the vineyard program conducts a more comprehensive ecosystem-wide biodiversity assessment across different trophic levels.","context":["Citizen science to explore diversity of microbes in dirt\nThe « Science à la Pelle » Project\nMost of the drugs we know are derived from molecules discovered in plants or bacteria. Most of the antibiotics used (still today) in human and animal health are, more or less, produced naturally on Earth by bacteria.\nIsolated and purified, they have undoubtedly radically shaped modern medicine.\nWithin our INSERM unit, a new method has been developed so we can use to our advantage the diversity of bacteria present in the soil, and the diversity of genes they possess, to find new drugs.\nFrom a soil sample, bacteria are isolated, and sets of genes detected that constitute the « recipes » for producing new drugs.\nWe ask the help of citizens to collect new soil and help us discover new drugs!\nYou can participate in the project or just learn more here: https://www.science-a-la-pelle.fr\nA few press articles: France Info, Le Figaro, Le Quotidien du Pharmarcien\nFollow the projet on twitter and instagram: @ScienceAlaPelle\nArtificial Intelligence and Gender equality\nCo-author with F. Vincent of the book “L’intelligence artificielle pas sans elles”, Belin edition, 2019\nLoose title translation : Artificial Intelligence, not without her. Book for the general public on algorithms bias and more generally on links between sex/gender and artificial intelligence. The book was accompanied by development of an exhibition, outreach videos, a comic book and a series of conferences on AI sexist bias (Description of the full campaign here). The book was reprinted 3 times in a few months and sold in several thousands of copies. Following the publication of the book, we were contacted by members of the Parliament, and of the government to consult on this subject. We also followed up with conferences and additional publications (Revue Hommes et libertés, Ligue des Droits de l’homme : La mixité, outil de questionnement scientifique ; Revue Diplomées : Cultures numériques, la norme mâle) and inspired and helped elaborate within a NGO a pact for companies, associations, institutions for an inclusive AI.\nA few videos: TV interview on France Info: L’instant ; Outreach video: The creation of algorithms bias\nA few press articles: Le Monde, Uzbek et Rica, Le Nouveau Magazine Litteraire, L’Opinion, Libération\nGender Bias in Research and gendered innovations\nScience suffers from a sex and gender bias. Upon discovery of how research is impacted by this phenomenon, notably in the wonderful website: https://genderedinnovations.stanford.edu/methods-sex-and-gender-analysis.html. Aude and Flora Vincent set out to to raise awareness about this subject. This is taking diverse forms such as videos, lobbying scientific institutions, writings and conferences. Here are showcased:\n– one outreach video, that explains the basis of this concept and why it matters. It won a prize at the 2013 gender summit contest. It also exists in French\n– one video of a conference we gave at l’Echappee Volée (a general public conference TED-like, 1200 people). The text of the talk was published in the book « Demain, territoire de tous les possibles “under the direction of Michel Levy-Provencal, Larousse.\nPromoting science without stereotype: WAX Science\nCo-Founder and Co-President of WAX Science\nWAX Science (What about Xperiencing Science) is an NGO that promotes science without stereotypes and gender balance in science by creating and spreading innovating tools (co-presidency 2013-2016). It was founded in 2013 (and is still running) and during the co- presidency rose to 40 active volunteers, 6 full time interns, 50k€ budget, tens of projects, and more than 10 000 people reached by the activities of the association.\nOne of the specificity of the association is the work at the interface between design and science. Typically, we developed « tools » (exhibitions, workshops, educational kit, videos) which we then use in the field but which we also shared on our wesite. The objective, that these can be used free of charge by other associations or people wishing to raise awareness in these areas.\nFor example, we created\n– « pedagological kits » with both content and activities: on HIV (initially created for Solidays), Genetic Engineering, and women in science (Les Découvreuses anonymes)\n– exhibitions such as Les Decouvreuses Anonymes (showcased dozens of times in more than 5 countries) about women in science or « Femmes Objets » (all exhibitions here)\n– workshops: for example a year of activity for a science club in primary school (all workshops here )\n– videos (all videos here) such as portraits produced in partnership with national media like Mademoizelle on women scientists such as Francoise Barré Sinoussi or Marthe Gautier. Regarding Marthe Gautier, we also sought to develop her online presence by creating for example her wikipedia page or telling her story on the WAX website and in videos.\nAmong these « tools », those which invested the most time in were « websites ». The first, wax-science.fr had several objectives: to offer original articles with a different vision of science, far from stereotypes but also to be a platform for the dissemination of the tools that we have developed (open source model). From 10,000 unique visitors in its first year, the site had over 45,000 unique visitors in its 4th year, for a total of 602 original articles.\nWe then created the app and associate website Itcounts (http://itcounts-app.org/). Its objective, developing citizen science to count men and women in professional circles (teams, meetings …). The app offers both counting and data analysis tools as well as access to the collected data. This work notably led to a collaboration with a researcher at Sciences Po to try to develop new indicators of parity during conferences. Finally, we collaborated with Data For Good to develop a data visualization project around gender equality in the french parliament (http://www.pariteaupouvoir.com/).\nBeyond these different « concrete » tools, we gave a lot of talks in a variety of settings (schools, companies, large audiences, small committees, etc.) on various subjects (popularization of science, gender bias in science, equality between women and men, interest in activism …). On average over our 4 years of co-presidency, we were running 32 interventions per year and 3200 people were affected « directly » by these conferences.","Work Package 1: Experimental setup\nObjective of WP1\nIn this WP we will focus on three major objectives to be carried out during the first project year:\n1. Development of appropriate techniques to quantify biodiversity and soil based ecosystem services;\n2. Identification of experimental sites in the appropriate landscape context;\n3. Further experiments promoting knowledge on management options enhancing ESS.\n9 experimental sites equally distributed in 3 landscape configurations (from vine monoculture to diversified landscapes)\nwill be identified in each country. Each experimental site allows testing three soil management modalities, representing a disturbance gradient\n(for instance permanent ground cover, tillage, green fertilizer, ...).\nDetails per tasks\nIdentification of experimental sites\nDifferent strategies in soil management (tillage, permanent\nground cover, …) will be chosen and compared\nThe selection of experimental sites in each participating country are based on two major variables,\none being the soil management strategy and the second being the level of landscape diversity.\nEach partner has identified three levels of soil management intensity (levels of disturbance) that exist in the respective area of production.\nOnce the soil management modalities have been fixed, three plots of similar soil type (focal fields), close together (maximum 200 m apart)\nor one plot harbouring each one of the three modalities (minimal surface per modality 20 acre) have been identified or created.\nThis setup is repeated in landscape sectors of different intensities (percentage of semi-natural habitat). In total, 9 experimental sites are tested during the PromESSinG project in each participating country. In order to quantify the percentage of major landscape elements, a detailed GIS-mapping will be performed in a 1km radius around each focal field.\nSimple (left) and diversified (right) landscapes will be chosen to implement the experimental plots.\nWork Package 2 : Biodiversity assessment\nObjective of WP2\nWP2 aims at assessing the diversity of indicator species occurring in vineyards, with a special focus on soil related organisms.\nThe final goal is to get insights in the role of various functional groups in provisioning ecosystem functions and services by investigating different levels of disturbance and effects of landscape heterogeneity.\nDetails per tasks\nThe vineyards inter-rows\ncan host a high diversity\nof plant species\nPlant species richness\nPlant species richness: Identification of species will be performed in the focal fields; estimates of the relative percentage of identified species using abundance or cover scales will be provided.\nBacteria and fungi\nplay an important role\nin soil fertility\nMicroflora – nutrient transformers, decomposers and microsymbionts: Diversity of soil microflora including AMF will be assessed through 454 pyrosequencing of bacteria and fungi present in the samples (Lindahl et al. 2013, Philippot et al. 2012).\n\"the soil engineers\"\nMacrofauna – soil structure engineers: Earthworms will be collected according to standard procedures (Pelosi et al. 2009) in a known volume of soil. Individuals collected will be identified to the lowest taxonomical level possible and biomass will be measured.\nare feared predators !\nInsects – biocontrollers: Predators such as ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) will be collected using pitfall traps and determined to species level. Parasitoids of grape berry moth (GBM) larvae will be sampled by collecting first generation GBM larvae in young flower buds and keeping larvae in the laboratory until parasitoids emerge. In addition, yellow sticky traps will be installed in the vineyards to monitor presence of Anagrus spp. parasitoids.\nWork Package 3 : Assessment of ecosystem functions and associated services\nObjective of WP3\nIn this WP soil- and landscape-based ecosystem services will be quantified in temperate European vineyard systems. For this purpose, key functional groups of soil biota and beneficial insects and three ecosystem processes they influence will be considered all having a substantial relevance for the grapevine grower.\nDiversity parameters obtained in WP2 will form the basis for assessing differences in ecosystem functions and services among the different plots.\nDetails per tasks\nTea bags contain organic matter.\nThey will be weighed and then buried for three weeks.\nAfter this period of decomposition by soil organisms, they will be collected and weighed again, in order to determine\nthe organic matter decomposition rate.\nSoil fertility, structure and water retention capacity\nMeasurement of soil texture, soil water holding capacity and nutrient content in the various samples will be done according to standard procedures. Diversity parameters obtained from WP2 for soil microflora including AMF and earthworms will be used to assess the effects of species diversity on the relevant functions of the vineyard soil ecosystem. Soil organic matter decomposition and enzyme activity of soil microflora will be assessed via litter bags.\nPresence of entomopathogenic fungi will be monitored. Plant-beneficial rhizosphere bacteria including the fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. will be identified. They might have the potential to protect grapevine roots against fungi causing root rotting like Roesleria spp. Diversity parameters obtained from WP2 for carabid beetles and parasitoids will be used to assess the effects of species diversity on the relevant functions of the vineyard soil ecosystem. Plant abundance and species composition will be assessed at certain time points during the vegetation period on plots of a size of 1 m2 replicated several times within the respective vineyard plots.\nWork Package 4 : Provisioning Services\nObjective of WP4\nIn this WP we will evaluate the effects of a combined soil- and landscape based trial on grape quality during the vegetation period as well as the socio-economic impacts of different management systems.\nDifferent environmental factors as well as management practices influence yield and quality of grapes, which are in particular temperature, water availability, micro climate, canopy management, yield expectations, plant protection measures and time of harvest. Different soil management practices, e.g. partial rootzone drying, could have effects on plant physiology and therefore also on grape quality.\nDetails per tasks\nGrapes will be collected\non experimental plot to\nmeasure quality parameters\nsuch as sugar, acidity, etc.\nGrape quality will be measured with FT-IR analyses, in order to determine must standard parameters, as soluble solids, glucose, fructose, titrateable acid and pH.\nwill also be assessed\nTotal amounts of polyphenols, anthocyanins and flavonoids can be quantified by using spectralphotometric methods. Methanol extracts of frozen grapes or grape skins will be used and measurements will be performed.\nImplications as well as social and economic acceptance of the different soil management strategies and landscape factors identified in PromESSing by the grapevine grower will be addressed by following two approaches:\n1. Studying aspects of the integration of the different soil management strategies into the grapevine production system: parameters like economic costs, equipment, workload and integration into general work procedures will be evaluated.\n2. Studying the recognition of ESS by grapevine growers as far as they are linked to the soil and evaluating the values and sustainability of the ESS for the farmers and their applied production system.\nWork Package 5 : Analysis and Synthesis\nObjective of WP5\nData from the common experiments will be analyzed at different spatial and temporal levels. The data will be analyzed at the country level, as well as across Europe, for all data sets that have been collected in multiple countries.\nThe analysis will identify factors (management, landscape) associated with biodiversity and ecosystem services in different countries.\nDetails per tasks\nUnivariate analyses will give an overview of the effects of management and surrounding landscape on biodiversity, ecosystem functions and associated services in European vineyards. The different biodiversity/ecosystem measurements will be the response variables and the management regimes (as factors or ranked disturbance intensities) and surrounding landscape complexity as explanatory variables, explicitly taking into account the nested hierarchy of the treatment variables (management nested within landscape).\nMultivariate analyses allow comparisons of similarity of communities. We will use standard multivariate analyses (NMDS, DCA, RDA, CCA) to investigate the relationship between community composition (biodiversity) and environmental variables (management, landscape). Multivariate analyses will also be used to reduce the dimensionality of environmental data (collinearity) for univariate analyses. Multivariate analyses can also help identifying species associated with different ecosystem processes.\nWork Package 6 : Spreading of project results\nObjective of WP6\nThe purpose of this WP is to execute the process of implementation and dissemination of project results to local and regional stakeholder groups in each country (e.g. wine grower associations, conservation advisors, land managers), to regional-European authorities, policy makers (national and EU-level), to the international scientific community (i.e. agro-ecologists, agronomists) as well as to the general public.\nA project website (www.promessing.eu), Workshops, Scientific publications, Policy briefs."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d2c40655-acc6-441f-b615-9816143e0dcf>","<urn:uuid:75b27b0b-c37d-4d50-85d7-240403266b2a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do transit times and navigation procedures differ between a night journey on the Trent waterway versus a Panama Canal crossing?","answer":"A Panama Canal transit takes approximately 10 hours and follows a strictly controlled procedure with mandatory pilot guidance and organized convoy systems starting between 5-7am. In contrast, night navigation on the Trent waterway is more flexible but requires additional precautions - while it's feasible in familiar areas, GPS is recommended for unfamiliar sections since everything appears different at night and there's a risk of getting lost or disoriented. The Trent system allows for more independent navigation but requires careful attention to markers and channels, particularly at night, unlike the Panama Canal's highly structured, piloted daytime transit system.","context":["You literally do not require maps, compass or gps for this trip. Bring them if you like but wasn't required. The trent map fold out you can get from any lock was more than enough.\nTrent waterway for the most part is clearly marked and there are only a few spots where you have to stop and think about it.\nI did have gps on my blackberry and it was helpful, used it to gauge where I was not really for navigation. If travelling at night, recommend gps of some sort, on water in familiar area at night is fine but in areas you have never been, everything is different, not a time to get lost or disorriented. I also had a handheld gps which showed speed and distance traveled, either don't bring or stowe and don't look. Found myself constantly checking it, how fast am I going, how far have I gone, turned mine off after day and a half.\nHere are some tips.\nSimcoe, when you come out of the Orillia Narrows and follow to the left, you will jump a few points and then will just see horizon line in the distance, looking straight across you will see what looks like a point in the distance (barely) wasn't sure if I had to go around it, it's an island and the channel is to the left of the island. Just head for it and when you get close enough to make out the island head to the point on the shore to the left and keep following shore to channel. Needless to say, if weather is up and Simcoe can pick up quickly I might suggest hugging the short instead of being 5km from shore in bad weather.\nCanal lake, the lake splits around a big island on the opposite side, stay on right side, you will see a bridge with like a half moon tunnel, just go under it.\nBalsam lake, when you come out of canal, just head to 12 o'clock and you will hit the island, depending on wind either go right and around point, way the markers go, or go left and around the long way. Rosedale is on opposite end of island at the far left. Update: Best to go left and around the island and not right, where the waterway goes, shorter and easier in the wind, learned that in the 2010 Trip.\nCameron lake, almost no markers so at first hard to tell if you should go down left or right side. Fenelon Falls is down the end on the left, look for white buildings on shore and head for them, when you get to Fenelon Falls make sure you enter lock between the two markers (red triangle and black square) there are rock walls that line channel on both sides, can't cross over if you miss and will have to circle back.\nBobcaygeon, when you leave and come out of channel, it looks like you go straight towards the left, don't. Go right and follow the big island on the left. Don't get discouraged, looks like a long way, channel is not that far down pigeon lake on the left.\nPeterborough, when you come out of Ashburnham lock you will see markers leading into Peterborough on the right and will automatically head that way, at least I did. The next lock is straight towards the bridge on the left not in Peterborough.\nBay of Quinte, when you come out of Trenton you will see markers heading towards the island on the left, run parallel to the island and you will see the markers in the distance to the entrance to Murray Canal. Red triangle. At first you think you have to go down right shore because there aren't many markers past the island.\nThe above are the only spots where I had to think about where to go","For the last 100 years the Panama canal has served as a maritime shortcut. This 80 kilometer / 50 mile long waterway connects the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean without having to sail all the way around the southern tip of South America. The canal uses a system of locks that operates as water elevators to raise vessels 26 meters / 85 feet above sea level. Through the fresh waters of Panama ships can make their way to the other side where they will be lowered again back to sea level. Passing through all of these different stages makes any transit by cruise ship a special experience which should always be on your cruise bucket list. The original Panama Canal The current canal was officially opened on August 15th 1914. Since it’s opening more than one million ships from all over the world have sailed the canal. When the canal was build the maximum width of ships being able to go through was 33,5 meter thus officially establishing the “Panamax” for ships around the world. For over a century almost every ship in the world would not exceed the Panamax. Although the world was ready for bigger ships, the Panama canal was not. Therefore plans were made to create a new canal with a wider span: 55 meter. The new Panama Canal The new panama canal will open up in juni 2016. This $5.25 billion expansion project started in 2007.. For the last 9 years Panama has been working on a new canal where larger ships are able to go through. The new canal will be able to handle cargo ships carrying 14000 20 foot containers. This is nearly three times the size it can currently accommodate. With the opening of the new canal the new Panamax is being established changing the future of the cruise and maritime industry. The old and new canal will both be operational after the opening of the new canal. Cruise ships larger than the original Panamax obviously pass through the new canal whereas other cruiseship from now on have to confirm a preference with reservation on wether they want to pass through the old of new canal. The new locks have been build parallel to the old locks. The rest of the route remains the same.\nPanama canal transit by cruise ship\nA transit through the canal typically takes around 10 hrs. Hours may vary because the speed of your cruise ship will be determined by the canal authorities and pilots.\nIn the early morning 3 pilots will board te vessel the get your cruise ship through the canal. Usually a speaker of the Panama Canal will also board te vessel to give scenic commentary as you go through the canal.\nThere are several locks, lakes and canals that your ship will pass through when transiting through the Panama Canal. From the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific these would be:\nA. Entering the Panama canal at Christobal and leaving the Caribbean sea. This is where you pick up the local pilots and narrator.\nB. Pass through the Gatun locks. This is where the cruise ship will be elevated 26 meters / 85 feet above sea level. If your cruise ship passes through the new canal your ship will use the locks parallel to the old locks.\nC. Sail over the Gatun lakes which is a large fresh water lake through the Panamanian rain forest. Keep your eyes open for pelicans and crocodiles.\nD. Gamboa is the half way point and headquarters of the Panama Canal dredging division.\nE. Sail through the famous Culebra Cut, also known as Gaillard Cut. This is where you will pass gold hill and sail under the Centennial Bridge.\nF. Pass through the Pedro Miguel Locks and Miraflores locks. If your cruise ship passes through the new canal you will just go through 1 set of new locks which runs parallel to the 2 older locks.\nG. You will sail under the bridge of the Americas and have a beautifull view over the skyline of the Panama city.\nH. Exiting the canal at Balboa at the Pacific ocean.\nIf you are doing the transit from the Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean Sea you can obviously start at letter G and work up to A.\nYou can share your experience in the canal with friends and family back home. They can watch your cruise ship go through the locks via the live Panama Canal webcam. Click here to be forwarded to the webcam page.\nMost asked questions about the Panama Canal:\nHow much does it cost to go through? Tolls vary and are never public. It is know however that the most a cruise ship every paid to go through was 500.000 US dollar. Usually cruise ships state the price is between 100.000 and 300.000 US dollars, depending on the size of the ships and the number of beds on board. Reservation and transit fees must be paid in advance.\nTwo way traffic\nIs there two way traffic in the canal? Yes, there is. However, ships usually go in convoy (Northbound and Southbound convoys) Each convoy starts at their end of the canal between 5 and 7 am. They pass each other half way on Gatun lakes and Culebra Cut."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9581f66d-21ea-4f41-a4d8-469f9fb5c008>","<urn:uuid:a7693b0a-ba24-49cc-894b-8b4d315e67a4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between Barbara Fredrickson's mathematical approach to emotional wellbeing using the positivity ratio and the cognitive model's approach to understanding human emotions and behavior?","answer":"Fredrickson's positivity ratio proposes a precise mathematical tipping point of 2.9013 positive to 1 negative emotions for human flourishing, suggesting that exceeding this ratio leads to positive emotional chaos and wellbeing, while falling below it results in languishing. In contrast, the cognitive model takes a more process-oriented approach, focusing on how people's perceptions and automatic thoughts about situations impact their emotional, behavioral, and physiological reactions. The cognitive model emphasizes that individuals can learn to recognize and correct dysfunctional thinking patterns to reduce distress, rather than focusing on achieving a specific numerical ratio of positive to negative emotions. It also assumes that human cognition can be understood through scientific methods and that internal mental processes follow algorithmic information processing models.","context":["It was autumn of 2011. Sitting in a dimly lit London classroom, taking notes from a teacher's slides, Nick Brown could not believe his eyes.\nBy training a computers man, the then-50-year-old Brit was looking to beef up his people skills, and had enrolled in a part-time course in applied positive psychology at the University of East London. \"Evidence-based stuff\" is how the field of \"positive human functioning\" had been explained to him — scientific and rigorous.\nSo then what was this? A butterfly graph, the calling card of chaos theory mathematics, purporting to show the tipping point upon which individuals and groups \"flourish\" or \"languish.\" Not a metaphor, no poetic allusion, but an exact ratio: 2.9013 positive to 1 negative emotions. Cultivate a \"positivity ratio\" of greater than 2.9-to-1 and sail smoothly through life; fall below it, and sink like a stone.\nThe theory was well credentialed. Now cited in academic journals over 350 times, it was first put forth in a 2005 paper by Barbara Fredrickson, a luminary of the positive psychology movement, and Marcial Losada, a Chilean management consultant, and published in the American Psychologist, the flagship peer-reviewed journal of the largest organization of psychologists in the U.S.\nBut Brown smelled bullshit. A universal constant predicting success and fulfillment, failure and discontent? \"In what world could this be true?\" he wondered.\nWhen class was over, he tapped the shoulder of a schoolmate he knew had a background in natural sciences, but the man only shrugged.\n\"I just got a bee in my bonnet,\" Brown says.\nBefore enrolling in the positive psychology program at the University of East London, Brown had been in a self-described \"rut.\"\nThe married father of two had graduated from Cambridge University in 1981 with a degree in computer science, and spent most of his career as an IT networks operator at an international organization in Strasbourg, France.\nAfter nearly 20 years in the position, stretched thin between technical duties and managerial headaches, he was looking for something new. So he jumped at the chance to transfer into human resources when it presented itself. The move didn't deliver the change he was expecting, however. Still operating in a large bureaucracy — the same organization, in fact — Brown was now tasked with promoting staff welfare. But he had \"little leeway to make decisions,\" and was constantly signing off on stuff he \"thought was just plain wrong.\" Adding insult to injury, when charged with renewing his company's suppliers list for training and coaching materials, he wound up interacting with \"nuts\" and \"charlatans,\" people who listed reiki and crystal healing among their interests, or resorted to \"hand-waving\" when selling their wares.\nHe was fed up. Coming up on 50, his mother ailing, \"the general BS, the constant, not particularly high, but nonstop level of moderate dishonesty,\" was beginning to wear on him.\nThen one day in November 2010, Brown happened to find himself at a Manchester conference attending a talk by popular British psychologist Richard Wiseman, who had written a book called The Luck Factor.\n\"Basically, the way to be lucky is to just put yourself in situations where good things can happen,\" Brown remembers, \"because more good things will happen to you than bad on any given day, but nothing will happen to you if you just sit indoors.\"\nAfter the talk, Wiseman signed books. The pile dwindled down and down, and only four books remained when Brown made it near the front of the line. Four people were standing between him and Wiseman.\n\"I thought, 'Well okay I'm not going to get one,'\" he says. \"And then I was about two feet from the front, and the woman in front of me, she was one step away from him — had been queuing for 20 minutes — she just decided she didn't want a book anymore and walked off.\"\n\"Well there you go,\" Brown said, greeting Wiseman, \"the science of luck.\"\nThe two men laughed and got to talking. Brown explained his situation at work. He asked Wiseman where he could find \"evidenced-based stuff,\" science-backed skills he could use to motivate employees and gain the upper hand of the hucksters and quacks hawking Tony Robbins-esque fluff.\nThe emerging field, Wiseman said, was called positive psychology.\nAs described by the Oxford University Press, positive psychology aims \"to study positive human nature, using only the most rigorous scientific tools and theories.\"\nIn 1998, then-president of the American Psychological Association Martin Seligman announced the birth of positive psychology, calling it, \"a reoriented science that emphasizes the understanding and building of the most positive qualities of an individual: optimism, courage, work ethic, future-mindedness, interpersonal skill, the capacity for pleasure and insight, and social responsibility.\"\nIn large part, positive psychology can be defined by what it is not — the study of mental illness (rather, it aims to preempt it) — and in contrast to what came before it — a branch of the social sciences called humanistic psychology that focuses on \"growth-oriented\" aspects of human nature, but which some in positive psychology criticize as not being adequately scientific.\nA typical positive psychology exercise, as described by Seligman, the movement's most visible figure, in his popular 2011 book Flourish, goes like so:\n\"Every night for the next week, set aside ten minutes before you go to sleep. Write down three things that went well today and why they went well.\"\nThe \"What Went Well\" or \"Three Blessings\" exercise, which is known in positive psychology as a \"positive intervention,\" comes as part of a package of treatments collectively called positive psychotherapy. And in a study of people with severe depression, Seligman found that positive psychotherapy relieved, \"depressive symptoms on all outcome measures better than treatment as usual and better than drugs.\"\nSimilar findings have afforded positive psychology a level of public credibility that few other psychological subfields enjoy. Centers and academic programs have sprouted up across the world, the most influential of them being Seligman's own one-year, $45,000 Master of Applied Positive Psychology program at the University of Pennsylvania.\nIn 2002, with a $2.8 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education, the Penn Resiliency Program (part of the University of Pennsylvania's Positive Psychology Center) began a four-year study of positive psychology's effects on ninth-graders at a high school outside of Philadelphia. Six years later, in 2008, Seligman entered into a far-reaching collaboration with the U.S. Army, resulting in a $125 million government-funded \"Army-wide\" program known as Comprehensive Soldier Fitness (CSF).\nGuest-editing a January 2011 special edition of the American Psychologist that was dedicated to the program, Seligman wrote, along with two military personnel, that CSF's goal is to, \"increase the number of soldiers who derive meaning and personal growth from their combat experience,\" and \"to decrease the number of soldiers who develop stress pathologies.\"\nRecently, however, it has been reported that CSF has done little to reduce PTSD. Nevertheless, the government is expanding the $50-million-per-year program.\nOne of the authors who contributed to the American Psychologist's special edition on Comprehensive Soldier Fitness was Barbara Fredrickson. Co-writing \"Emotional Fitness and the Movement of Affective Science from Lab to Field,\" she cited her 2005 work on the \"critical positivity ratio.\"\nFredrickson is best known for her \"broaden-and-build\" theory, which posits that the cultivation of positive emotions promotes greater and greater wellbeing. She is considered a rock star of the positive psychology movement, once having been praised by Seligman as its \"laboratory genius.\" Over the course of her career, according to her curriculum vitae, she has received $240,000 in awards and fellowships and over $9 million in grant funding.\nWhere the concept of a ratio of positive to negative emotions dates back to the 1950s, the specific origin of the critical positivity ratio took place in 2003, writes Fredrickson in her general readership book Positivity: Top-Notch Research Reveals the 3-to-1 Ratio That Will Change Your Life.\nA Chilean business-consultant named Marcial Losada, \"who had begun to dabble in what had become his passion: mathematical modeling of group behavior,\" sent her an out-of-the-blue email. Appealing to research he performed in the 1990s that coded the language of 60 business teams for positive and negative affect, Losada said he had \"developed a mathematical model — based on nonlinear dynamics — of (Fredrickson's) broaden-and-build theory.\"\nTwo independent tests by Fredrickson studying the emotional ratios of individuals seemed to confirm Losada's findings. In 2005, the two unveiled the critical positive ratio in an American Psychologist paper titled \"Positive Affect and the Complex Dynamics of Human Flourishing.\"\nThe theory was bolder than bold: Mankind, whether working alone or in groups, is governed by a mathematical tipping point, one specified by a ratio of 2.9013 positive to 1 negative emotions. When the tipping point is crested, a kind of positive emotional chaos ensues — \"that flapping of the butterfly's wing,\" as Fredrickson puts it — resulting in human \"flourishing.\" When it is not met (or if a limit of 11.6346 positive emotions is exceeded, as there is a limit to positivity), everything comes grinding to a halt, or locks into stereotyped patterns like water freezing into ice.\nIn Positivity, Fredrickson writes that it is possible to promote positive emotions and decrease negative ones. The critical positivity ratio, then, represented a stark dividing line — the difference between a bummer of a life and a blissful one. Feel good about twelve things in your day and bad only about four, and by the laws of the ratio you'll be happy. Knock just one of the good emotions out, however, and you won't. So get that extra cookie and talk with someone you love, and push yourself over the mathematical hump.\n\"Our discovery of the critical 2.9 positivity ratio,\" Fredrickson and Losada wrote, \"may represent a breakthrough.\"\nNarratively is an online magazine devoted to original, in-depth and untold stories.

The cognitive model refers to how people’s perceptions of, or impulsive thoughts about situations impact their emotional, behavioral (and often physiological) reactions.\nIndividuals’ perceptions are often imbalance and dysfunctional when they are distressed. They can learn to recognize and assess their “automatic thoughts” (spontaneously occurring verbal or imaginal cognitions), and to correct their thinking so that it more closely resembles reality. When they do so, their distress usually decreases, they are able to behave more functionally (especially individuals suffering from anxiety and depression), and their physiological arousal terminates.\nCBT aids individuals learn to recognize and assess their “automatic thoughts” and change their thinking to be healthier. The cognitive model is at the core of CBT, and it plays a critical role in guiding therapists use gentle Socratic questioning to develop treatments.\nCBT is, in fact, a term that encompasses for many different therapies that share some common elements. Two of the earliest forms of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy were: Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), developed by Albert Ellis in the 1950s, and Cognitive Therapy (CT), developed by Aaron T. Beck in the 1960s.\nAlbert Ellis suggested that each of us hold a unique set of assumptions about ourselves and our world that serve to direct us through life and define our reactions to the various situations we encounter.\nUnfortunately, some people’s assumptions are largely irrational, controlling them to act and react in ways that are inappropriate and that bias their chances of happiness and success. Albert Ellis called these basic irrational assumptions. Ellis considers that people often compellingly hold on to this irrational and illogical way of thinking, and thus employs highly emotive techniques to help them vigorously and forcefully change this irrational thinking.\nThe ABC Model\nA major service in cognitive therapy is what Albert Ellis (1957) called the ABC Technique of Irrational Beliefs.\nTheses three steps analyze the process by which a person has developed irrational beliefs and may be recorded in three-points.\n- Activating Event\nABC Model of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)\nA- Activating Event or objective situation- The first point accounts for the objective situation, that is, an event that ultimately leads to some type of high emotional response or negative automatic thinking.\nB- Beliefs- The second point, the client writes down the automatic thoughts that happened to them, the core beliefs he holds for his internal self.\nC- Consequences- The third point accounts for the negative feelings and dysfunctional behaviors that follows. The negative thoughts of the second point B are seen as a connecting bridge between the situation and the stressful feelings. The third point C is next explained by describing emotions or negative thoughts that the patient thinks are caused by A. This could be anger, sorrow, anxiety, etc.\nBasic Assumptions of Cognitive Model/Cognitivism\nFollowing are the basic assumptions of Cognitive Model/Cognitivism\n1. Human cognition can at least in principle be fully revealed by the scientific method, that is, individual components of mental processes can be identified and understood.\n2. Internal mental processes can be explained in terms of laws or algorithms in information processing models.\n3. Learning requires the development of mental demonstrations or memories that are not always reflected in our behaviors.\n4. From behavior, one can predict about mental processes that cannot be observed.\n5. Cognitive processes are the main focus in cognitive psychology.\n6. Individuals are involved in the learning processes like processing, assimilating, accommodating the learned information in an active manner.\n7. Information is structured and kept in scehma (concepts that are closely associated)/scripts.\n8. Some learning operations like language are sole to individuals.\nWhere does Cognitive Model stand in today’s age?\nThere are many applications and implications of cognitive model in a wide range:\n- Cognitive models are used by clinical psychologists to evaluate person to person differences in mental processes between normal people and clinical patients e.g., psychotics like schizophrenia patients and also neurotics like people with Mood Disorders, Anxiety Disorders, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).\n- Cognitive models are also used by cognitive neuroscientists to grab the idea of how different brain regions perform “psychological” function(s).\n- Cognitive models of decision making are used by decision researchers to predict which products are preferred by consumers and moreover for investment portfolios for businesses, medical options and military policies.\n- Aging process and decline in activity and slowing-down process of cognitive functioning is defined by aging researchers with the use of cognitive model.\n- Human to machine like interactions are explained by human factor researchers by using cognitive models.\n- Cognitive models are also used to anticipate and detect dangerous targets, automated recognition of faces and handwriting; and controlling the movement and behavior of robots by artificial intelligence and robotics researchers.\n- Social scientists such as sociologists and economists use cognitive models to design computerized agents in agent-based models for predicting behaviors in market and social-network working.\nCritical Analysis of Cognitive Model\nIf we critically evaluate the cognitive model, it has both some major advantages and disadvantages as well. Followings are the Strengths and the Weaknesses of Cognitive Model:\n- One advantage of cognitive model is that it has many practical implications e.g., Baron-Cohen and his colleagues’ study illustrates how theory of mind was an insufficiency of autism and rendered a new test for Theory of mind.This test could be used to evaluate if someone is suffering from autism or not, whilst the information that individuals with autism or Asperger’s syndrome lack theory of mind can lead to understand what is autism and how we can accommodate this into school and various work-related situations.\n- Another advantage is that it consists of experiments as its basic research tool.\n- Reductionism is a potential strength as it allows us to understand behavior in simple form and enable us to imply theories to wide variety of areas, as it is more psychological in nature than an holistic model.\n- The main deficit of this approach is that it applies to cognitive processes that cannot be observable. It depends heavily on the anticipating. Critics of Loftus and Palmer’s directing questions experiments pointed out the validity of re-constructive memory hypothesis, as one cannot be sure that memory has changed as the scientists were not able to observe memory, but only those questions were answered which may have been the consequence of demanding characteristics, or might be the lack of judgment of speed.\n- So cognitive model may be poor in defining its scientific nature. It is being assumed that findings are the consequences of processes that are not visible and is subjective in nature which could lead them to self-fulfilling prophecy and internal validity is another issue being out-stretched.\n- Another disadvantage of cognitive model is that it does not take into account other factors regarding behavior that may affect behavior.\n- This model is somewhat reductionist in nature as it explains just five mental processes such as thought, attention, memory, perception and language and discredit other factors.\nThe cognitivism or cognitive model has key strength of practical and fruitful implications, but the main disadvantage is that it does not observe the speculated causes of behavior. The scientific nature of this model is one of the worthy facet for discussion and this can be regarded as both its advantage and disadvantage, as is its reductionist nature."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c765be26-0eb2-4e6f-a727-594759df7c1f>","<urn:uuid:6f90c92b-a65e-4a9f-8786-75ce033242de>"],"error":null}

{"question":"How does the application of Game Theory differ between business decision-making contexts and the academic course MTH 5130?","answer":"In business decision-making, Game Theory is primarily used as a technique to simulate rivalries or conflicts between businesses, with the main aim of finding ways to gain advantage at the expense of rivals. The academic course MTH 5130 offers a more comprehensive theoretical foundation, covering core principles of game theory including game algebra, Nash equilibrium, zero-sum games, mixed strategy games, prisoner's dilemma, and applications to specific strategic situations like bargaining, bidding, and market competition.","context":["Decision-making is the most fundamental function of management professionals. Every manager has to take decisions related to his or her field of work. Therefore, this is an all-pervasive function of basic management. There are various methods for the process of decision-making. The Quantitative Technique of decision-making helps in making these methods more convenient and efficient.\nAlmost every function of a typical manager will require him or her to make decisions on a routine basis. These decisions mostly depend on the nature as well as the scope of his or her work. Also, it depends on the authority and the powers of the manager.\nA decision is a judgment of a course of actions that are always aiming to achieve a specific result. For every task a person wants to achieve, decision forms the foundation of it.\nThe manager often chooses the best option from a range of alternatives for every task that he or she has to complete within a given time. Every decision has many consequences. Therefore, choosing the right decision is very important.\nIt can be said that the entire decision-making involves selecting a course of action from various alternatives. This is a very curial function that all the managers have to carry out routinely.\nWhat are the Quantitative Techniques of Decision Making?\nWhile making a decision there are several Techniques that a manager of a company or an organization can employ. Quantitative Techniques help the manager to take decisions objectively and in an efficient way. Such Techniques rely on a scientific and statistical approach to make a good decision. The six important quantitative Techniques of decision making are as follows.\nThis Technique helps in maximizing an object that is under limited resources. The main objective can be either optimization of a utility or minimizing of a disutility. In simple words, one can say that it helps in utilizing a resource or a constraint to its maximum potential.\nUsually, all managers use this Technique only under conditions that involve certainty. Therefore, this might not be very useful to the manager when circumstances are uncertain or unpredictable.\nProbability Decision Theory\nProbability decision theory is a Technique that lies in the case, where the probability of an outcome can only be predicted. In simple words, one cannot always predict the exact outcome of any course of action.\nThe managers use this approach to determine the probabilities of an outcome using the available information, firstly. The managers can also rely on their subjective judgment for this purpose. Next, they use this data of probabilities to make their decisions. They often use the decision tree or the pay-of matrices for this purpose.\nThe Game Theory\nOften, the managers use certain quantitative Techniques only while making decisions pertaining to their business rivals. The game theory approach is one such kind of Technique.\nThis Technique stimulates the rivalries or conflicts between businesses as a game. The main aim of the managers of a company under this Technique is to find ways of gaining at the expense of their rivals. In order to do this, they can use two people or 3 people or even ‘n’ number of people games.\nEach and every business often suffers waiting for periods or queues pertaining to their personnel, equipment, resources, or services. For example, sometimes a manufacturing company may gather a stock of unsold goods due to irregular demands. This theory aims to solve such types of problems.\nThe main aim of this theory is to minimize such waiting periods and also reduce the investments in such expenses. For example, the departmental stores often have to find a balance between the unsold stock and the purchasing of fresh goods. The managers in such examples can employ the queuing theory to minimize their expenses.\nThe stimulation Technique observes several outcomes under hypothetical or artificial settings. The managers try to understand how their decisions will work out under diverse circumstances.\nThen they finalize accordingly on the decision that is likely to be the most beneficial to them. Understanding the outcomes under such stimulated environments instead of natural settings reduces the risk drastically.\nAll the complex activities often require concentrated efforts by the personnel in order to avoid the waste of time, energy, and also money. This Technique basically aims to solve by creating strong network structures for the work.\nOther than calculus, several other techniques can be used to solve decision-making issues. Mathematical programming is one such technique that can be used when several factors affect the choice of strategies. For example, if the aim is to reduce the total cost, no constraint can affect our choice of strategies. If there are constraints, they might limit the funds which can be spent on the inventory, the space for inventory set up or the highest number of orders that can be placed by the buyer or purchasing department.\nIn this case, it can become an issue in constrained minimization. However, mathematical programming can be a solution for it.\nThe constraints form an environment where decision-makers can minimize or maximize the goals to be achieved.\nConstraint minimization and maximization is the best feature of mathematical programming. It is one of the most suitable frameworks for analyzing business problems.\nCost Analysis Or Break-Even Analysis\nAll managers want to make profits. The objective of cost analysis or break-even analysis is to determine the break-even points or the optimum levels on which the profits are maximum. In decision-making, managers must pay attention to profit-making opportunities of alternative courses of action. This requires that the cost of these alternatives must be assessed properly. A significant cost analysis is made between fixed and variable costs.\nA cost can be classified as fixed or variable in terms of the frequency of changes occurring in them at a particular period. However, in the long run, all costs are variable.\nFixed costs are those which remain constant irrespective of the production or sales. For instance, a manager's salary will not change irrespective of the goods produced or sold out. On-road tax on a vehicle doesn’t change with its annual mileage covered. Whereas, variable costs change with time. It highly depends on factors like the number of goods produced, sales in the financial year, or any similar factor. Some of its examples include sales commission concerning sales occurred, petrol prices in relation with distance traveled, labour wages based on hours worked, etc.\nFrom a decision-making point of view, it is significant to know whether the cost will vary or not as a result of the decision.\nThe total cost can be determined by adding the variable cost to the fixed cost of various levels of activity (for example, the number of items produced).\nIt is a mathematical Technique for quantitative decision-making. This Technique is used to calculate the economic costs and the social advantages linked with a particular course of action. In this Technique, efforts are made to calculate the costs and benefits, not only for those that can be expressed in rupees but also the less effectively calculated outcomes of the decision.\nUsually, this technique is used for making decisions on public projects in which social benefits, social costs, and actual out of the pocket costs are considered. Here, the cost analysis is associated with the economy of the entire society besides considering the benefits of individuals or a particular group. The goal of this analysis is to get maximum profits for society.\nThere are two most crucial quantitative Techniques under this approach. These include the Critical Path Method and the Programme Evaluation and the Review Technique. These techniques are effective because they segregate the work efficiently under the networks. They also drastically reduce time and money.\nCharacteristics of Quantitative Techniques\nThe quality of the solution can be improved by quantitative Techniques but it is not necessary that the solution is perfect. These Techniques help in finding the solution to the problem.\nThe quantitative Techniques are related to the optimization theory. One can find the best solution to the given situation.\nModels are used in quantitative Techniques. By doing mathematical analysis and experiments, a good decision can be made.\nTo perform quantitative Techniques, a group of people having different skills is required so that they can estimate the pros and cons of the solution to the problem. Executives must show a willingness to participate in the decision-making.\nThe complexity of the situation gets reduced when managers use quantitative Techniques to find an easy solution. They can even innovate solutions to the most complicated and costly functions.","The Math Minor is designed to equip students with the quantitative skills that are often required for entrance into top graduate schools.

{"question":"How do disability accommodations differ between federal courts and Maine courts for jury service?","answer":"In federal courts, the trial court determines juror qualification under the Jury Selection and Service Act, and if qualified, interpreters or auxiliary aids are provided. In Maine's courts, jury service opportunities cannot be denied based on disability, and courts must make all necessary arrangements to accommodate jurors with disabilities throughout the entire process - from summoning to deliberation. Maine only allows excusal if the person cannot perform jury duties even with reasonable accommodation.","context":["When you expect to be in a federal court for any reason, you or your lawyer must contact the court in advance to request the accommodations that are necessary for you to understand the court proceedings. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not apply to the federal courts. However, the Judicial Conference of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts has adopted a policy that all federal courts will “provide reasonable accommodations to persons with communications disabilities.” Federal court policy requires federal courts to provide sign language interpreters or other appropriate auxiliary aids and services, at no charge to deaf or hard of hearing court participants. Federal court policy allows federal courts to decide whether to provide accommodations for court spectators who are deaf or hard of hearing. These guidelines are published in Vol. I, Administrative Manual, Chapter III, General Management and Administration, Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures. These guidelines are reprinted below.

General Policy.\nAs adopted in September 1995, it is the policy of the Judicial Conference that all Federal courts provide reasonable accommodations to persons with communications disabilities.\n2. Sign Language Interpreters and Other Auxiliary Aids and Services.\nEach federal court is required to provide, at judiciary expense, sign language interpreters or other appropriate auxiliary aids or services to participants in federal court proceedings who are deaf, hearing-impaired, or have other communications disabilities. The court shall give primary consideration to a participant’s choice of auxiliary aid or service.\n“Auxiliary aids and services” include qualified interpreters, assistive listening devices or systems, or other effective methods of making aurally delivered materials available to individuals with hearing impairments.(i) “Participants” in court proceedings include parties, attorneys, and witnesses. The services called for under these guidelines are not required to be provided to spectators, although courts may elect to do so in situations where they determine such to be appropriate, for example, providing an interpreter to the deaf spouse of a criminal defendant so that the spouse may follow the course of the trial. “Court Proceedings” include trials, hearings, ceremonies and other public programs or activities conducted by a court. “Primary consideration” means that the court is to honor a participant’s choice of auxiliary aid or service, unless it can show that another equally effective means of communication is available, or that the use of the means chosen would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the court proceeding or in undue financial or administrative burden.\nThe determination of whether a prospective juror with a communications disability is legally qualified to serve as a juror is one for the judgment of the trial court under the Jury Selection and Service Act, and that determination is not governed or effected by these guidelines. However, where an individual with a communications disability is found so qualified, a sign language interpreter or other appropriate auxiliary aid or service should be provided under these guidelines.\nEach court is required to identify a specific office or individual(s) to serve as access coordinator from whom participants in court proceedings may request auxiliary aids or services. The access coordinator must be familiar with the judiciary’s policy of providing reasonable accommodations to persons with communications disabilities, to ensure that the policy is properly implemented. The access coordinator must have a ready working knowledge of the types of auxiliary aids and services available to serve the needs of disabled persons and of the local sources from which auxiliary aids and services may be procured. Personnel in each court are to be instructed as to the judiciary’s policy and the identity and location of the access coordinators in their particular court. Each court shall appropriately publicize the identity and location of its access coordinator through courthouse signs, bulletin board announcements, pamphlets, announcements in the local press, etc.\nCourts may, but are not required to, establish specific procedures through which requests for auxiliary aids and services are to be submitted, such as requiring that they be submitted to the access coordinator in writing or that they be submitted in advance of the court proceeding involved. Courts may also establish procedures through which persons dissatisfied with the court’s proposed provision of auxiliary aids and services may seek review or reconsideration. Any such procedures must be appropriately publicized. These guidelines are not intended to, nor should they be construed to extend or modify existing law.\nIn all situations in which services are provided under these guidelines, regardless of whether any direct new costs are incurred, courts are to file reports with the Administrative Office on forms provided for this purpose.\n6. Effective date.\nThese guidelines are now in effect.\n(i) Where a court determines such to be appropriate, computer-assisted real-time [also called CART] reporting is one of the services that may be provided under these guidelines, but solely in furtherance of the limited purposes for which the guidelines have been adopted. Thus, real-time reporting should be provided for only as long as and for the specific purposes required by a participant: for example, only for the duration of the deaf witness’s testimony. Real-time reporting is to be used solely to assist in communication and is not to be used in lieu of conventional means of producing the official record. Real-time service provided under these guidelines shall be limited to a video display of spoken words, and shall not include enhancements such as key word searching or the provision of unedited daily transcripts. Courts may not use this policy as an authorization to purchase and install real-time court reporting equipment in the courtroom. Such purchase is controlled by Judicial Conference policy relating to the methods of court reporting.","Policy on Access for People with Disabilities\nTranslated Versions of the Policy on Access for People with Disabilities: The documents below are in .pdf format. You will need the latest version of Adobe Reader to open the documents.\nThe Judicial Branch of the State of Maine does not condone discrimination in any form against persons with disabilities. Discrimination against persons with disabilities violates the individuals' civil rights, undermines the integrity of the court system and the workplace, and adversely affects the equal administration of justice. In addition jury service is a right and responsibility of all qualified citizens.\nIT IS THE POLICY of the Judicial Branch of the State of Maine that:\n- Programs, activities, services and facilities of the court system will be fully accessible to individuals with disabilities, as required by fairness and justice as well as the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Maine Human Rights Act;\n- All employees of the court system will provide prompt, courteous and equal service to all persons including those with disabilities and report any incident of discrimination against persons on the basis of disability;\n- Opportunity for jury service will not be denied or limited on the basis of disability;\n- Complaints of discrimination on the basis of disability will be promptly responded to and every effort will be made to resolve all complaints as quickly as possible;\n- Qualified individuals with disabilities will not be subjected to disability- based discrimination in regard to job application procedures; the hiring, advancement or discharge of employees; job training; employee compensation; or any other term, condition, and privilege of employment; and\n- All Judicial Branch employees will receive training to enable them to meet the responsibilities established by this policy and to help assure their sensitivity to the needs of individuals with disabilities.\nIn order to advance these policies the Judicial Branch shall implement the following provisions:\n- PHYSICAL ACCESS TO COURT FACILITIES\nThe Judicial Branch of the State of Maine recognizes its obligation to provide full physical access at court facilities and identifies the following areas of priority in providing that access during the interim period before full access is available:\n- Routes of entry, entrances, and parking spaces.\n- Clerks' offices, including public service counters.\n- Jury deliberation space.\n- ACCOMMODATIONS AND AUXILIARY AIDS AND SERVICES\nThe Judicial Branch recognizes its obligation to make appropriate accommodations and provide auxiliary aids and services to ensure effective communication and participation of individuals with disabilities who have contact with the court system. It is a high priority of the Judicial Branch to develop and promptly obtain the necessary auxiliary aids and services until appropriate auxiliary aids and services are available to every courthouse. In the meantime every reasonable effort will be made to provide accommodations and auxiliary aids and services to ensure effective communication and participation of individuals with disabilities in the court system.\nAccommodations are to be furnished at no charge to individuals with disabilities. In most cases, presentation of proof of disability is not required. Examples of accommodations that may be provided include the following:\n- Qualified sign language, oral, and cued speech interpreters;\n- Real-time transcription services (CART);\n- Assistive-listening devices;\n- Provision of court documents in large-print and Braille;\n- Audiotapes, recording equipment and computer disks;\n- TTY and amplified telephones;\n- Arrangement made to ensure that service dogs are allowed to remain with their owner with a disability at all times.\nThe Judicial Branch may also provide any other reasonable accommodation necessary to permit a person with a disability to participate fully in or to observe court activities.\n- FINANCIAL RESOURCES\nThe Judicial Branch will actively pursue the financial resources necessary and will work diligently to eliminate any and all existing barriers to persons with disabilities.\n- GENERAL ACCOMMODATION REQUEST PROCEDURE\n- Accommodations will be available and not have to be requested whenever possible. Where it is necessary to make a request, the following procedure will be followed:\n- Requests for accommodations may be made to the Clerk of Court where the proceeding will take place.\n- All requests for accommodations shall describe the accommodation sought, and if not apparent the reason for which the request is being made.\n- Any denial of a requested accommodation by a judge or duly authorized\ncourt official will be accompanied by a written statement of the reason\n- JURY SERVICE BY PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES\n- The judge or other Court personnel shall make whatever arrangements are necessary to reasonably accommodate jurors with disabilities, in order to ensure effective communication and participation at all stages of the jury summoning, orientation, instruction and deliberation process.\n- Eligible persons who are summoned to serve as jurors may be excused\non the basis of disability from jury service only if they are incapable\nwith the help of a reasonable accommodation, of performing their duties\nas a juror.\n- ATTORNEY REQUIREMENTS\nAttorneys in a proceeding should notify the Court as soon as they become aware that a person with a disability is involved in a proceeding and will require an accommodation from the Court.\n- GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES\nThe Judicial Branch shall develop written procedures including a grievance procedure to implement the policy stated herein.\n- A copy of the court's notice of compliance and grievance procedure shall be available in each clerks office and provided to any individual.\n- The court shall make every reasonable effort to resolve any complaints to the satisfaction of the person with a disability.\nNothing in this policy shall be construed to impose limitations or to invalidate the remedies, rights, and procedures accorded to any individuals with disabilities under local, state or federal law."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ff88b3dc-1adf-4677-899d-2d676923af2c>","<urn:uuid:037c0cbc-332f-4807-95a6-d9019c6d92ed>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is happening to sunlight exposure in Colombian coffee regions since last century?","answer":"The number of hours of sunlight has declined by 19% since the middle of the last century due to increasing cloud cover, affecting coffee production in some areas.","context":["Just like it’s affecting other sectors of agriculture, climate change is starting to pose problems to coffee production. Colombia, the third-largest coffee producer in the world, is going through some serious trouble keeping up production, a new study showed.\nCoffee is one of the biggest crops in Colombia. Up to 550,000 families depend directly on coffee production for their livelihoods and many more depend on it indirectly. Due to changing climate conditions, there have been increasing concerns about the future quantity and quality of the coffee yield in Colombia in the decades to come. A new study shows that people are right to be concerned.\nCoffee is very sensitive to unpredictable weather. Studies estimated that a 2ºC increase in temperature would lead to losses in productivity of up to 34% for Mexico and 20% for Brazil, respectively. When it comes to Colombia, the findings forecasted a 4–24% increase in yields in the scenario where temperatures increase not more than 2 ◦C. However, this is highly dependent on the region.\nPrevious studies have also shown that the mountain region, where coffee is grown in Colombia, is warming by 0.3 degrees Celsius (0.5 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade. Plus the number of hours of sunlight also has declined by 19% since the middle of the last century due to increasing cloud cover – with not enough sun to sustain a high level of production in some areas.\n“The Andes Mountains cross Colombia from its southwest to the northeast corner. Colombian coffee is currently growing in areas with different altitude levels, and climate impacts will likely be very different for low altitude and high-altitude regions,” Sandy Dall’Erba, co-author of the new study and agricultural researcher, said in a statement.\nDall’Erba and a group of researchers looked at climate and coffee production for the entire territory of Colombia. They worked with a data set of 521 coffee-producing municipalities that continuously registered at least one hectare of Arabica coffee production from 2007 to 2013. This high level of detail allowed researchers to identify significant regional variations.\nWorking with climate models, the researchers anticipated weather conditions from 2042 to 2061 and future coffee production for each municipal area. They found that low-altitude municipalities will be negatively affected by climate change over the coming years – with thousands of families seeing their livelihood affected in consequence.\n“Colombia is not going to experience reduced productivity overall. But when we look into the impact across municipalities, we see many differences that get lost in the national average. That has important implications for coffee growers who live in one municipality versus another,” lead-author Federico Ceballos-Sierra said in a statement.\nAt the national level, productivity of coffee production will increase 7.6% by 2061, the study showed. But the forecasts change when zooming in specific regions. High-altitude regions in Colombia (1,500 meters or 5,000 feet above sea level) are expected to have a 16% increase in productivity, while low-altitude regions would have an 8.1% decrease.\nThis means that a higher temperature because of climate change will affect the current prime coffee growing locations, turning them into areas too hot and dry for production, while benefiting areas that now are considered marginal for coffee production. Smallholder coffee growers will have to find ways to adapt, using strategies such as more frequency irrigation. Although the study focused on Colombia, many other coffee-growing areas likely face similar pressures.\n“Our research presents what we anticipate will happen 20 to 40 years from now, given current conditions and practices. Future studies can look into different adaptation strategies and their costs, and evaluate which options are best. Beyond the 40-year horizon we focus on, the prospects might be grimmer without adaptation. Production cannot keep moving to higher levels,” Dall’Erba said in a statement.\nThe study was published in the journal Agricultural Systems."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f5c13e63-d792-42bd-b1a6-5ed212e84dbc>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did Germany's monetary policy in 1923 lead to hyperinflation?","answer":"In 1923, after France and Belgium occupied Germany's Ruhr Valley to force war reparations payment, the German government began printing billions of Reichmarks. This led to such severe hyperinflation that Germans needed baskets and wheelbarrows to carry around the cash needed for everyday life.","context":["The Treaty Of Versailles probably didn’t cause World War II. It didn’t help, though\nFeature | by Gregory Beatty\nAs we commemorate the centennial of the Armistice that ended World War I on Nov. 11, 1918, it’s worth remembering that two decades later the main combatants, joined by Japan in south-east Asia, were back at it in World War II.\nAn estimated 60 million people died in that conflagration (20 million soldiers, 40 million civilians). So while WW I, at the time, was touted as “the war to end all wars” it was anything but.\nHistorians have had a century to chew over WWI, the Armistice, and follow-up peace conference in Paris in 1919 that led to the Treaty of Versailles and other treaties. And there are some, says University of Regina historian Ian Germani, who trace a direct line between that turbulent time and WWII.\nBut is that reasonable?\n“I think that’s probably overly deterministic,” he says. “Margaret MacMillan, in particular, in her fantastic book Paris 1919, argues it wasn’t inevitable that the peacemaking should result, 20 years later, in another conflict. That ignored, she said, some of the intervening events.”\nStill, the Paris peace process was flawed. And those flaws, in turn, did lay groundwork for WWII.\nCould war have been prevented? That’s an impossible question to answer. But it’s an interesting one to think about.\nSetting The Scene\nFighting in WWI broke out between the Allies (France, Britain, Russia) and Central Powers (Germany, Hapsburg/Austro-Hungarian Empire, Ottoman/Turkish Empire) on Aug. 1, 1914. By year’s end, says Germani, opposing armies were bogged down in brutal trench warfare. “On the Western Front, at least, you don’t have a restoration of mobile warfare until March 1918,” he says.\nThat came courtesy of a German offensive. Troops got within 120 km of Paris, which caused a brief crisis in the Allied command. But after a few days, the attack stalled.\nA few weeks earlier, Germany had settled its Eastern Front war by signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with newly Soviet Russia. “That liberated German forces for a final offensive in the West,” says Germani. “But it’s a gamble.”\nInitially neutral, the United States had finally decided, in April 1917, to enter the war on the Allied side. American troops had yet to arrive in large numbers, but they were coming. And Germany knew once they arrived, they would overwhelm its war-weary army.\nHence, the gamble.\nAs early as January 1918, Allied leaders were making peace overtures to the Central Powers. Best-known is U.S. President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points Speech (delivered to Congress on Jan. 8), where he identified 14 principles related to self-determination, territorial accommodation, arms reductions and more that could form the basis of peace.\nThe speech was distributed behind German lines, and it did carry weight, says Germani.\n“The German perception, which was kind of a promise President Wilson put out, was if they got rid of their militarist government, then a negotiated, honourable peace could be arranged. That lay behind their readiness to accept the exile of the Kaiser and establishment of a new government.”\nRather than a “Peace Between Equals” as Wilson proposed, though, the treaty’s terms were dictated largely by the victors. Many were harsher than Germany had expected, and that led to a feeling of betrayal.\n“The treaty deprived Germany of about one-tenth of its pre-war population and 13 per cent of its territory,” says Germani. “Anschluss with Austria was also verboten. The German-speaking population of Austria, which probably would’ve been satisfied to join Germany, was denied that possibility. So the idea of self-determination was applied to those nationalities who were perceived to have been on the winning side and not those on the losing side.\n“In the aftermath of Versailles,” Germani adds, “there are millions of Germans living outside the new Weimar Republic. Most controversial was the Polish corridor where western Prussia was annexed to be part of a new Polish state. The same thing happened with the French annexation of Alsace-Lorraine — many of the German-speaking population chose to move rather than change nationalities.”\nAnother grievance for Germany were clauses 231-232 of the treaty, which attributed responsibility for the war to the Central Powers and imposed reparations.\nHistorians have a much more nuanced view of WWI’s origin. United under Bismarck in the 1860s, Germany had defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–71, and with its surging industrial and naval strength, was worrying Britain. After several centuries of rule, the Ottoman and Hapsburg Empires were crumbling too, and Czarist Russia was in turmoil.\nTechnology and other modernist influences were taking hold as well, reshaping European society and causing considerable political, economic and cultural uncertainty.\n“Those anxieties and insecurities all play into the crisis,” says Germani. “One problem Margaret MacMillan notes is that in 1914 you had a lot of weak men trying to appear strong. There was a fear of being perceived as [weak] and not showing the necessary resolution in defence of national interests.”\nAt various times, in various ways, historians have mounted plausible arguments that the Allies (France and Britain primarily, but also Russia) were actually responsible for WWI.\n“The majority view is that the burden of responsibility lay with the German military and political leadership who were willing to take the risk of war in 1914,” says Germani. “But the implication that sole responsibility lies with Germany or the Central Powers is a difficult position to uphold.”\nTo compensate civilians for damage suffered during the war, Germany was required to pay 132 billion gold marks (US$33 billion) in reparations. Bitterly opposed to the idea of war guilt, Germany was reluctant to pay.\nTo force compliance in 1923, France and Belgium occupied Germany’s industrial heartland, the Ruhr Valley. That prompted the German government to print Reichmarks by the billions, sparking hyperinflation, so that Germans were reduced to using baskets and wheelbarrows to carry around the cash needed for everyday life.\nGermany’s monetary policy was irresponsible, says Germani, but politics were in play too.\n“‘Okay, you want payment? Here you go. It’s not worth anything’. That was a message German politicians could disseminate to the electorate, and they were happy to hear it. It was a way of protesting the treaty.”\nLeague Of Nations\nAs part of the Versailles Treaty, Wilson proposed the creation of an international body that could adjudicate disputes without nations resorting to war. But when the treaty came before the U.S. Senate, it was voted down by antagonistic Republican and Democrat factions.\nHaving enjoyed an economic boom selling munitions and other equipment to both sides during the war’s early years, and unscathed by the carnage Europe had suffered, the U.S. was on a fast track to becoming a global superpower. And its decision not to sign the treaty was a major blow to the league’s ability to enforce peace, says Germani.\n“We think of November 1918 as the moment when peace broke out,” says Germani. “But for many people it doesn’t bring peace. You have conflict between states, you have civil war within states between different nationalities, you have revolution, Europe is an incredibly violent place following the Armistice.”\nGermany and Russia were also disqualified from joining the league, so from the start it faced an uphill struggle. And when the dogs of war began to stir again in the early 1930s, it couldn’t restrain them.\nReferencing Margaret MacMillan’s idea that WWII wasn’t an inevitable outcome of the Armistice, Germani cites the Great Depression in 1929 as another key.\n“That helped bring to power, a few years later, the Nazis who are committed to overturning the treaty. Prior to then, they hadn’t done well at the polls. In fact, between 1925–29, you had something of a rapprochement between France and Germany.”\nThat contrasted with the peace process itself, where France, still stinging from its Franco-Prussian War defeat, had sought retribution.\n“The signing of the Versailles Treaty in the Hall of Mirrors was designed to be as humiliating as possible for the Germans,” says Germani. “That was where the Second German Empire had been founded in the aftermath of France’s 1871 defeat. So the French were determined to rub in Germany’s defeat by having the signing ceremony there.\n“That caused great offence in Germany, and certainly unease within the victorious powers,” Germani says. “Already, in 1920, you have [British economist] John Maynard Keynes publishing The Economic Consequences of the Peace in which he expressed grave reservations about the treaty.”\nA second critical factor was the success the German military had sidestepping responsibility for the war and peace treaty, claiming instead that it had been undermined by social-democrats in the Weimar government.\n“The army itself, by the terms of the treaty, is reduced to 100,000 men,” says Germani. “It wasn’t allowed any tanks and aircraft. But the leaders are still well-connected to right-wing circles — and looking for ways to reverse decisions made at Versailles.” That included the Beer Hall Putsch which Hitler and 2,000 of his Nazi followers led in Munich in November 1923.\nYet another complicating factor was the divergent interests of Britain and France, says Germani.\n“France is much more interested in imposing harsh terms, for understandable reasons. The British are more concerned about the possibility of Germany serving as a check on Soviet communist influence.\n“So there are different priorities, and the treaties are a result of compromises worked out. Some historians would argue the terms weren’t unreasonable. What was lacking was the will to enforce them. That contributed a lot to the appeasement, the nagging suspicion that perhaps the Germans had a point.”\nAnd the rest, as we all sadly know, is history."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a6166ac1-e571-44c7-89ff-15480c86b4b9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the relationship between classical physics limitations and quantum theory development, and how does this historical evolution connect to current research at modern physics institutions?","answer":"At the end of the nineteenth century, classical physics could not explain several phenomena including the invariance of speed of light, specific heat approaching zero at low temperature, and blackbody radiation spectrum. This led to the introduction of relativity and quantum theory, which have become vital tools for humanity. This evolution continues today, as evidenced by current research at institutions like MIT's Center for Theoretical Physics, where researchers work on quantum computation and explore fundamental forces from string theory to subatomic particles, demonstrating the ongoing development of physics beyond classical limitations.","context":["Physics peels back the cosmos to uncover universal laws\n03. The font of human curiosity is bottomless — Department of Physics\nModern physics is a multifaceted field that covers areas from subatomic particles to cosmic and biological phenomena and even economic phenomena. Join us for a solid education in this exciting field.\nProfessor Seiji Miyashita\n2013 Department Chair\nDepartment of Physics\nFaculty of Science\nAs Pascal and Bacon described it, physics is the study of the wonders of nature to separate out magical belief and to transform the knowledge obtained into forms useful for humans. It’s a field in which we closely examine the world around us and use what we find to uncover universal laws. Examples of revolutionary discoveries in physics include Kepler’s laws of planetary motion, which led to Newton’s discovery of universal gravitation. This in turn allowed us to predict the motion of objects, eventually taking humankind to the moon. Maxwell’s equations explained the seemingly magical forces of electromagnetic phenomena, which today are a keystone of the information technology industry. Yet our questions never cease—today we are working hard to learn what matter is at its lowest levels, how it functions, and what is the true nature of our universe and the source of diversity in the world around us. Human curiosity knows no bounds.\nA defining characteristic of physics is that it aims to explain natural phenomena as they are. For example, Kepler came to the conclusion that the planets do not travel in perfectly circular orbits. However, he had not discovered a flaw in nature but rather made a first step toward a deeper natural law. A similar development occurred at the end of the nineteenth century, when several phenomena were discovered that could not be explained by classical physics. Examples include the invariance of the speed of light, the specific heat of objects approaching zero at low temperature, and the spectrum of blackbody radiation. Explaining such phenomena required the introduction of relativity and quantum theory, ideas that have expanded in recent years to become vital tools for humanity.\nPhysics is a versatile field that is applicable at a wide range of scales, from subatomic particles and atomic nuclei to cosmological phenomena, the composition of matter, and the emergence of life. In recent years findings from physics have even been applied to economic phenomena. Our department includes almost 40 groups of professors, associate professors, and instructors. They specialize in areas that run the gamut in this wide-ranging field of study. Our students begin their study with a solid education on the fundamentals of physics, including quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, electromagnetics, and fluid dynamics. Time is set aside for learning the mathematics needed to fully understand these topics, and our curriculum is rounded out with time for insightful experiments. Our department is furthermore characterized by building camaraderie between our students through events like our traditional Newton Festival.\nAdvancement after graduation\nIn recent years, nearly all of our graduates go on to pursue graduate studies. Most graduates from our master’s and Ph.D. programs move on to jobs in academic, industrial, or government laboratories, where they pursue research in a variety of fields. We have a career guidance support system for job seekers, in which dedicated staff supplies information and advice for finding employment. For those with strong motivation, there are excellent employment prospects after graduation.\n|1877||Department of Physics established along with the University of Tokyo|\n|1886||Restructured within Imperial University|\n|1901||Divided into Departments of Theoretical Physics and Experimental Physics|\n|1919||Unified as Department of Physics as part of the Imperial University reformation|\n|1951||Reorganization of the Faculty of Science; Departments of Astronomy, Geophysics, and Physics unified|\n|1967||Departments of Astronomy, Geophysics, and Physics divided into separate departments|\n― Office of Communication ―","The Center for Theoretical Physics (CTP) is a unified research and teaching center focused on fundamental physics.

{"question":"In terms of safety, what's the difference between operating microwave ovens versus air conditioners?","answer":"Air conditioners and microwave ovens have different safety considerations. For air conditioners, the main safety concern is proper sizing - an undersized unit can overheat while an oversized one won't remove enough moisture, making the room uncomfortable. For microwaves, there are multiple safety concerns: avoiding metal containers that can cause fires, preventing superheated liquids that can erupt, ensuring the door closes properly to contain radiation, standing 3-4 feet away during operation, and being careful with hot food and steam. Microwaves also have two independent systems that stop electrical activity when the door opens, while proper BTU sizing is the primary safety feature for air conditioners.","context":["What Size Air Conditioner Do I Need?\nSize matters. Especially when choosing the correct BTU size for an air conditioner. Choose too small a unit, you could end up with a room that's not cool enough, or with an air conditioning unit that overheats. On the other hand, too large a unit for the space will not remove the necessary moisture from the room, making it feel clammy and uncomfortable. Here’s how to calculate BTU to find the perfect AC unit for your needs.\nWhat is a BTU?\nA BTU or British Thermal Unit is a measurement of how much energy is required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree. That might not sound useful when it comes to air conditioning your home or business but the underlying calculation is critical to staying comfortable.\nEach air conditioner or heater is rated to produce a certain number of BTUs. Many factors go into calculating BTUs, so we have put together a set of tools to help with air conditioner sizing.\nAir Conditioner BTU Chart\nThe chart below is a great starting point for sizing your AC. These BTU calculations are based on a standard room with 8-foot ceilings, two windows and one door. If the room has more windows, doors or higher ceilings, adjust the BTUs upward.\nOther factors in determining the BTU size would be the room’s purpose. Kitchens normally have more heat thanks to stoves and ovens, and rooms with computers and other electronics give off extra heat. Therefore, these rooms would require bumping the air conditioner size up.\nBTU Calculator - Room AC Size Guide\nWondering what size air conditioner you need? Our BTU calculator is designed to determine how many BTUs are needed for a single room. This calculation will not work for a whole house or commercial location, but is ideal for determining your mini split, through-the-wall, PTAC or window AC size.\nWe have used our years of experience in air conditioning to put together this easy-to-use BTU calculator. Simply fill in all the fields, and we will generate a number of BTUs that you should use. Use this number as a guideline when choosing what size air conditioner would work best for your room, whether it’s a window air conditioner or another type of small room AC unit.\nAll calculations are estimates based on the information you provide. Again, this calculator is only designed to determine the needs for a single room, not an entire home or commercial business. If you are trying to determine the AC unit size for a multi-zone mini split, be sure to calculate each room individually then add them together.\nFinding the correct window AC size (or other AC unit size) is a priority to making your home comfortable. An air conditioner is an investment, so finding the right one the first time can make the purchase process go much more smoothly.\nHave a more complicated space or need help using this tool? We are here to help with your air conditioner sizing needs. Call us at 877-847-0050 or contact us online.","The microwave oven is now an essential part of most kitchens. During the summer or other hot times of the year, it's an excellent appliance to use because it won't heat up your kitchen the way an oven will. Unfortunately, most people still use the microwave to heat coffee, melt butter or make popcorn. That's just fine - but the appliance can do so much more! Read on to learn how to use a microwave oven.\nHow the Oven Works\nThe microwave works when the high voltage is converted to waves of electromagnetic energy, which is a combination of electrical and magnetic energy. This energy is in the frequency band of radio waves, not x-rays. A waveguide and stirrer blade work together to make sure the energy reaches all areas of the oven interior. When the door is opened or the timer reaches zero, the energy automatically stops, so no microwave radiation leaves the oven. All ovens also have two independent systems that ensure the electrical activity stops as soon as the door is opened.\nThe microwaves make the water molecules contained in food vibrate and 'wiggle', which produces heat. This is what cooks the food, and also why the oven itself doesn't heat up. That's why foods that have a lot of water, like fruits and vegetables, cook more quickly. Foods high in fat and sugar also cook more quickly. Metal reflects the microwaves, and the energy passes through glass, plastic, and paper. As soon as the microwave energy is absorbed by the food, it is converted to heat - so the microwave energy can't 'contaminate' the food.\nAlthough heat is produced directly in the food, microwave energy doesn't cook food from the inside out. More dense foods like meat are cooked primarily by conduction of heat from the outer layers, which are heated by microwaves.\nIn combination microwave/convection ovens, you'll notice that the interior is metal. A convection oven's special feature is a fan that constantly circulates hot air around the food, so it cooks more quickly and browns very evenly. Follow the cooking instructions to the letter if you have one of these appliances.\nNever try to repair your own microwave. It is a complex appliance that includes a magnetron, high voltage transformer, thermal protectors, and complicated circuits.\nMicrowave Oven Safety\nNow a few words about microwave safety:\n- The foods will be very hot when removed from the oven, so use oven pads and be careful.\n- If the food is covered during cooking, make sure to leave a small portion vented, or uncovered, so steam doesn't build up and burns you when the covering is removed.\n- The foods should sit as directed in the recipe after being removed from the oven so the heat can continue to spread and dissipate. This is called 'standing time', but it is actually more cooking time.\n- Most ovens have hot spots, and if you eat the food directly from the oven, a few areas could be superheated and will burn.\n- On the flip side, there can also be cold spots where the food doesn't get hot enough to kill bacteria. Follow stirring and rotating instructions carefully.\n- Don't use metal containers unless the recipe specifically directs you to: as stated above, microwaves bounce off metal, which can cause arcing and a fire inside the oven. Some recipes may call for shielding parts of the food, especially meats, with small amounts of foil. This is perfectly acceptable as long as the directions are carefully followed.\n- Make sure any glass, plastic containers, and plastic wrap you use are labeled 'microwave safe'. You can also test containers, as directed on the next page.\n- Don't heat water or other liquids beyond the time recommended by the manufacturer or any recipe. Superheating can occur when plain water is heated in a clean cup for an excessive amount of time. The water will look innocuous, but when moved it can literally erupt out of the cup. Don't heat the water twice - that adds to the superheating risk. Adding sugar or coffee granules to the water will reduce the risk of superheating.\n- Never operate a microwave if the door is damaged or doesn't close securely.\n- Don't operate the oven while it is empty. This can also cause arcing and start a fire.\n- It's also a good idea to stand 3-4 feet away from the microwave when it is operating - just to be on the safe side!\nThe more you know about how to use a microwave oven, the better the results. These cooking tips are invaluable.\n- When using the microwave to defrost meat, the foods must be completely cooked right away. The microwave may have partially cooked part of the meat, and bacteria may grow if the food isn't thoroughly cooked.\n- Arrange food evenly in the pans and follow directions for stirring, rotating and standing time. Most recipes are developed for use in a 700-watt oven.\n- Check the food at the shortest time in the specified cooking range. Let the food stand as directed, then test using an instant-read thermometer to be super safe, or test according to the recipe's doneness tests. You can easily cook it longer if the food isn't done.\n- If you're wondering if a dish you own is microwave safe, there's an easy way to test it. Place a cup full of water and the dish you want to test in the microwave. Cook at 100% power for one minute. If the water gets hot and the dish you're testing stays cool, it is safe to use in the microwave. If the dish gets hot, it contains lead or metals and shouldn't be used in the microwave.\n- Onions and other vegetables are easily sauteed in the microwave. Just chop as directed in the recipe, place in a safe container, add 1 Tbsp. of water and cook on HIGH for 1-2 minutes until soft. This is a great way to cook quickly with no added fat.\n- In general, the outside sections of the food will cook more quickly. So arrange fish fillets, for example, so the thinner parts are toward the center. When cooking on any other power level than HIGH, the oven cooks by cycling power on and off, so the energy has a chance to move through the food without overcooking. MEDIUM and LOW power are generally used to soften, melt, and defrost foods, while HIGH is usually used for cooking.\n- Follow the recipe! Remember to use a microwave-safe plastic wrap to cover the food while cooking if the recipe says to. Leave one corner uncovered to vent steam so it doesn't build up to dangerous levels. And always be careful when removing the cover from food; the steam will billow up quickly and it's easy to get burned. Pay careful attention to arranging the food, stirring, rotating, and standing instructions in the recipes.\n- To easily clean the microwave, place 2 Tbsp. of lemon juice in 1 cup of water in a 2 cup liquid measuring cup. Microwave on HIGH for 2-3 minutes, until the liquid is boiling. Let the liquid remain in the microwave, without opening the door, for 5 minutes. Remove the measuring cup. The microwave will easily wipe clean with a paper towel.\nGet the Recipes!\nThese fabulous recipes are the last part of learning how to use a microwave oven. Enjoy every bite.\nBut first, do you know the wattage of your microwave oven? If you're not sure, here's an easy way to find out, according to the University of Tennessee. Fill a glass measuring cup with exactly one cup of lukewarm tap water. Microwave the water, uncovered, on HIGH until water begins to boil. If boiling occurs in less than three minutes, the wattage of your microwave is 600 to 700; three to four minutes, the wattage is 500 to 600; more than four minutes, the oven wattage is less than 500 watts. Most microwave recipes are developed for ovens with more than 600 watts of power. If your oven's wattage is less than that, you will probably need to add more cooking time.\nMany of these recipes cook entirely in the microwave oven. Be sure to follow cooking, rotating, stirring, and standing times carefully. Never try to taste or eat food as soon as it comes out of the oven because the food is still cooking and increasing in temperature.\nNow enjoy these recipes!\n- Microwave Meatloaf\nThis classic meatloaf cooks to perfection in the microwave oven.
