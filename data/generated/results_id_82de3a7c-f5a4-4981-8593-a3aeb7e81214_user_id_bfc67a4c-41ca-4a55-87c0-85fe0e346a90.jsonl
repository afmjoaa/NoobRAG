{"question":"What are the key differences between volleyball and netball in terms of player positioning and movement restrictions?","answer":"In volleyball, 6 players are positioned on each side, with 3 in the attack line and 3 in the defense line. Players rotate clockwise after the opponent scores, and back line players cannot attack from the attack zone (3-meter line). In netball, there are 7 players with specific positions (GS, GA, WA, C, WD, GD, GK) who are restricted to certain court areas. For example, the Goal Shooter can only move within the attacking third, while the Centre can move anywhere except the shooting circles. When male players are involved in netball, there's a maximum limit of 3 males on court at once, with specific positioning requirements.","context":["The rules of volleyball are quite simple, in addition, there are not so many of them when compared, for example, with basketball. Most people begin to get acquainted with this game at school at physical education lessons. This sport was invented in 1895 by the American George William MorganSince then, the game has evolved significantly and updated its rules several times.\nVolleyball can be considered one of the most affordable sports; for its game you need a small area stretched between a net and a ball. 6 people play on each side (less is allowed in amateur competitions). The victory goes to the team that allowed the ball to land in its own half of the field fewer times. On the one hand, the essence of the game is clear and understandable, but in fact, volleyball has a number of nuances that all participants in the game should definitely know.\nThis is interesting: for the first time volleyball was included in the program of the Olympic Games in 1964.\nThe basic rules of volleyball in a concise manner on points\nThe following paragraphs provide a series of rules that will be enough to explain the game to schoolchildren and beginner volleyball players:\n- Two teams play, each consisting of 6 people (3 - attack line, 3 - line of defense).\n- For one draw, the team is allowed to touch the ball only 3 times (blocking is not considered a touch).\n- It is forbidden to catch, throw or hold the ball.\n- The player cannot touch the ball twice (the block does not count).\n- Players move clockwise. The team must move (change positions) after the opponent first scored a point, and then your side.\n- In volleyball there are 3 games, each is played up to 25 points (to win the game, there must be a difference of 2 points, if the score is 24:24, then the match continues until there is a necessary two point difference).\n- Each team in each game has the right to take 2 time-outs lasting 30 seconds each.\n- Players in the back line are not allowed to attack from the attack zone (3 meter line). If the volleyball players of the back line want to perform an attack hit, then they must make a jump to the 3-meter line without interceding for it).\n- Contact of the ball with any part of the player’s body is allowed (the answer is for many interested - you can play foot volleyball).\n- If two or more players touch the ball at the same time - this is considered one touch.\n- After the filing, the front line players can change positions between themselves.\n- 8 seconds from the moment the referee blows the whistle.\n- Only one hand feeds.\n- In each game, the team is allowed to make a maximum of 6 substitutions (at the same time, several performers can be replaced at once).\nThese were the basic rules of volleyball, and now we will understand the main aspects of the game in more detail.\nWhat is the essence of volleyball?\nThe goal of volleyball is to move the ball using the net through the net to half of the opponent’s field, trying to make the round touch the court or bounce off the field from any part of the opponent player. At that time, the opposing team must prevent the ball from reaching their half of the court.\nVolleyball rules prohibit players from hitting the ball twice. Usually, a team tries to organize an attack with three touches: the first is the reception and simultaneous transfer to the binder (the one that is under the net is zone 3), the second is the transfer to the attacker, and the third is the strike.\nThe victory goes to the team that won more games (in total, from 3 to 5 sets are played depending on the tournament).\nTeams, site and technical aspects\nAt the same time, 6 players should be on the court. Substitutions are allowed to be used throughout the match, however, in one game (set), the coach can make a maximum of 6 substitutions.\nEach player takes his position in the attack zone (next to the net) or in the defense zone (the back of the court behind the three-meter line). According to the rules, there are 6 zones in volleyball, each has its own number (see the picture below) Players move clockwise.\nThe volleyball court has a rectangular shape measuring 18 by 9 meters. In the middle of the platform, a grid is stretched at a height from the floor:\n- For men - 2.43 m.\n- For women - 24 m.\nFor students of different ages, the grid height has the following meanings:\n- Boys 11-12 years old - 2.20 m.\n- Girls 11-12 years old - 2.00 m.\n- Boys 13-14 years old - 2.30 m.\n- Girls 13-14 years old - 2.10 m.\n- Boys 15-16 years old - 2.40 m.\n- Girls 15-16 years old - 2.20 m.\nThe circumference of the volleyball is 65-67 centimeters, and the weight is 250-280 grams.\nTo score a point, the ball must hit the floor in half of the opponent’s field or go off the court from an opponent player - this is the main way to score, but there are many other ways to replenish your piggy bank with points, for example:\n- Opponent did not serve or did it with violations.\n- The opponent could not break the ball over the net with the last blow.\n- The opponent stood up for the midline of the field or touched the top edge of the grid during the attack.\n- Incorrect execution of the transmission (holding or grabbing the ball in hands).\n- Incorrect command transition.\nA set of points when blocking. Players of the defending team can jump out and block the opponent’s shot, if after blocking the ball bounces in half of the opponent’s field or leaves them outside the field, then your team will receive a point. If after the block the ball bounced to your half of the court, the ball is awarded to the opposing team.\nAccording to the rules, the game is played up to 25 points, but if the score reaches this mark, and none of the parties has an advantage of 2 points, then the set continues until this necessary two point difference.\nDo you know? The longest volleyball game lasted 48 minutes. It was a match of the championship of Italy (men), the teams “Cuneo” and “Sisley” played. The second set of the match ended with a score of 54:52.\nDepending on the level of competition, in volleyball the number of sets varies from 3 to 5. The last 5th game is played up to 15 points.\nWhat are the violations of the rules in volleyball?\nVolleyball is a dynamic sport, therefore, participants may break the rules during the game. Violations in volleyball are:\n- Touching the ball by one player twice in one rally (block is not taken into account).\n- Front line infeed.\n- More than three touches of the team for the rally.\n- Disorders in the arrangement.\n- Serving more than 8 seconds from the moment of whistle.\n- Touch the top of the grid.\n- An outpost for the midline of the field (a spade is fixed if the arm (s), leg (s) are completely in half of the opponent’s field.\n- Unsportsmanlike behavior of volleyball players - kicks of opponents, trips, etc.\n- Conflicts with the judiciary.\nVolleyball rules were briefly presented. This simplified version of the rules can be used to teach the game to students of different ages. Volleyball is a very interesting and energetic sport, which for many is a hobby or an active holiday. Note that in Russia volleyball is one of the three most popular sports.","- The objective of a netball team is to score more goals than the opposition. A goal is scored through a successful shot into the opponent’s hoop. The team which scores the most goals wins the game!\n- Matches will be 4 x 8 minutes with 2 x 30 second breaks and 1 x 1 minutes break. There will be no injury time taken.\n- Ensure that the toss has been made and Power plays chosen before play is due to commence. Fill in your team sheet, if you are the last to complete it take it to your umpire.\n- Positions A netball team is made up of 7 players. Each player has a nominated position and role and may only be permitted into certain areas of the court. If a player enters a zone which they are restricted from then they are deemed ‘offside’.\nThe positions in a netball team are as follows:\n- GS – Goal Shooter – Can move anywhere within the attacking third of the court but cannot leave it.\n- GA – Goal Attack – Can move anywhere within the attacking third and the centre third of the court.\n- WA – Wing Attack – Can move within the attacking third and centre third, with the exception of the shooting circle.\n- C – Centre – Can move anywhere across the court, apart from either of the shooting circles.\n- WD – Wing Defence – Can move within the centre third and the defensive third, with the exception of the shooting circle.\n- GD – Goal Defence – Can move anywhere within the attacking third and the centre third of the court.\n- GK – Goal Keeper – Can move anywhere within the defensive third of the court but cannot leave it.\nWhere the teams have male players\n- A maximum of 3 males may take the court at one time (one in each third). If playing with 3 males on court positions are GK, C & GS. With 2 males on court they can choose to play in either GK, C or GS. If only 1 male is on court they can play in any of the 7 positions’ as they are the only male.\nPositioning of players for start of play\n- Players are responsible at the start and restart of play:\n- The Centre in possession of the ball shall stand wholly within the Centre Circle, on either on or both feet\n- The opposing Centre shall be in the Centre Third, and free to move.\n- All other players shall be in the Goal Third which is part of their playing area and free to move, but none of these players are allowed in the Centre Third until the whistle has been blown to start or restart play. If one player enters the Centre Third before the whistle is blown, a free pass is awarded to the opposing team where the infringement occurred.\nStart of Play\n- The umpire shall blow the whistle to start and restart play\n- The pass made by a Centre in response to the Umpire’s whistle at the start and restart of play shall be designated a Centre Pass\n- Play shall be started, and restarted after every goal scored, and after each interval, by a Centre pass\n- When the whistle is blown the Centre in possession of the ball shall throw it within three seconds and shall obey the footwork rule.\n- The Centre pass shall be caught or touched by any player:\n- Who is standing wholly within the centre third\n- Who lands with the first foot, or both feet, wholly within the centre third.\nPlaying the Ball\n- A player may:\n- Catch the ball with one or both hands\n- Gain or regain control of the ball if it rebounds from the goalpost o Bat or bounce the ball to another player without first having possession of it\n- Tip the ball in an uncontrolled manner once or more than once and then; (a) catch the ball (b) direct the ball to another player\n- having batted or bounced the ball once, either catch the ball or direct the ball to another player o Roll the ball to oneself to gain possession\n- Fall while holding the ball, but must regain footing and throw within three seconds of receiving the ball\n- Lean on the ball to prevent going offside o Lean on the ball on court to gain balance\n- Jump from a position in contact with the court and play the ball, provided that neither the player nor the ball make contact with the ground, or any object or person outside the court while the ball is being played.\n- A player may not:\n- Strike the ball with a fist.\n- Fall on the ball to gain possession.\n- Attempt to gain possession of or throw or the ball while lying, sitting or kneeling on the ground\n- Use the goalpost: (a) as a means of regaining balance; or (b) as a support in recovering the ball going out of court; or (c) in any other way for any other purpose, which does not include the ball rebounding from the goalpost.\n- Deliberately kick the ball. A free pass will be awarded to the opposing team where the infringement occurred.\n- After a goal is scored, the game restarts from a Centre Pass taken by the team who conceded the last goal. The Captain winning the toss chooses end or 1st centre pass at the start of the 1st and 3rd quarter. The other team will have 1st Centre Pass at the start of the 2nd and 4th quarter.\nOver a Third\n- The ball may not be thrown over a complete third without being touched or caught by a player who, at the time of touching or catching the ball is standing wholly within that third, or who lands with the first foot, or both feet, wholly within that third.\n- A player who lands with the first foot wholly within the correct third is judged to have received the ball in that third. The subsequent throw shall be considered to have been made from the third in which the player first landed.\n- A player, who lands on both feet simultaneously with one foot wholly within the correct third and the other in the incorrect third, shall be penalised.\n- At the moment the ball is passed there must be room for a third player to move between the hands of the thrower and those of the receiver.\nFootwork & Contact Rules\n- A player cannot let their landed/landing foot touch the floor again if they lift it away from the ground at all while in possession of the ball. Thus, it is often said that a player can only take 1.5 steps while holding the ball. They can however still balance on the other foot even if landing leg is lifted.\n- In an effort to attack or defend or to play the ball a player shall not:\n- Move into the path of an opponent who is committed to a particular landing space\n- Position so closely to an opponent that the player is unable to move without contacting\n- Push, trip, hold or lean on an opponent or use other forms of physical contact\n- Place a hand or hands on a ball held by an opponent\n- Knock or remove the ball from the possession of an opponent\n- Whilst holding the ball push it into an opponent\n- To defend a player with the ball you must be 3 feet away from the player’s first grounded foot.\n- If a player steps back or to the side, you must still be 3 feet from the player’s first grounded foot.\n- A player will be penalized for obstructing an opposing player that is not in possession of the ball if they are with the 3 feet distance of that player and they employ any movements which take their arms away from their body\n- Within this distance a player is not obstructing if their arms are outstretched to:\n- Catch, deflect or intercept a pass or feint pass.\n- Obtain a rebound from an unsuccessful shot at goal.\n- Momentarily signal for a pass or to indicate their intended direction of movement.\nOut of Court\n- The ball is out of court when:\n- It touches the ground outside the court\n- It touches an object or person in contact with the ground outside the court\n- It is held by a player in contact with the ground, an object or a person outside the court\n- A ball which hits any part of the goalpost and rebounds into play, is not out of court.\n- A player having no contact with the ball may stand or move out of the court but, before playing the ball, the player must re-enter the court and no longer have contact with the ground out of court.\n- A player who has left the court to retrieve a ball or to take a throw in must be permitted direct re-entry to the court.\n- Each team will elect one quarter as a Power Play when any goals scored will be doubled. The elected Power Play quarter must be notified by the team captain before the quarter commences.\n- Shooters may shoot from inside or outside of the Goal Circle. All successful goals from outside the Goal Circle will be worth double i.e. two Goal Points. The umpire will signal a successful Goal by raising one hand for one Goal Point and two hands for two Goal Points (In a Power Play this could result in 1 Goal scoring 2 Goal Points or 4 Goal Points)\n- There is no Umpire whistle after a goal is scored.\n- Unlimited number of rolling substitutions per team per quarter is allowed. Each team may make any number of rolling substitutions at any one time.\n- A rolling substitute may enter the game while play is in progress.\n- There will be a designated Substitution Box at each transverse line, where rolling substitute/s shall wait holding up a Substitution Paddle indicating the player/s to be substituted.\n- Team changes may not be made during a rolling substitution, as the game is not stopped Substitution Boxes for both teams are located on the same side of the court.\n- Infringements taken at the umpire’s discretion, as a penalty pass or a shot at goal undefended.\n- A deliberate delay of play anytime during the duration of the game may result in the Umpire awarding the non-offending team with a five-meter forward gain in court position and/or a penalty pass or shot.\n- The umpire(s) shall have sole control of the game.\n- The decision of the Umpire shall be final and shall be given without appeal.\n- The ball shall be played live if it comes into contact with an Umpire during play, but if such contact interferes with the course of the game, the Umpire may decide to have a toss ball between two opposing players in that area of play.\n- The Umpires whistle shall: o Start and re-start the game at the beginning of each quarter and end each period of play. o Indicate when a goal has been scored.\n- Indicate when an infringement of the rules has been made.\n- The Umpire shall:\n- Refrain from penalizing an infringement of the rules when by doing so the non-offending team would be placed, at a disadvantage.

{"question":"I have trouble sleeping and take B vitamins. What's the connection between vitamin B12 and vitamin B6 in terms of their effects on sleep quality?","answer":"Both B vitamins play different roles in sleep regulation. Vitamin B12 has been shown to help improve sleep quality when supplemented at high doses (3,000 mg daily) in patients with sleep-wake schedule disorders. Vitamin B6 supports the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and GABA in the central nervous system, which are important for sleep regulation. B6 deficiency can lead to various sleep-related symptoms including insomnia, nervousness, and depression. The difference is that while B12's effects focus primarily on sleep-wake cycles, B6 has broader effects on the nervous system and neurotransmitter production that influence sleep quality.","context":["Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) is a very important B vitamin, especially for women. It seems to\nbe connected somehow to hormone balance and water shifts in women. Vitamin B6 is actually three related compounds, all of which are found in food–pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine. Pyridoxal is the predominant biologically active form; however, in vitamin supplements, pyridoxine is the form used because it is the least expensive to produce commercially. Vitamin B6 is stable in acid, somewhat less stable in alkali, and is fairly easily destroyed with ultraviolet light, such as sunlight, and during the processing of food. It is also lost in cooking or with improper food storage.\nPyridoxine is absorbed readily from the small intestine and used throughout the body in a multitude of functions. Fasting and reducing diets usually deplete the vitamin B6 supply unless it is supplemented. Usually within eight hours, much of the excess is excreted through the urine; some B6 is stored in muscle. It is also produced by the intestinal bacteria.\nSources: Vitamin B6 in its several forms is widely available in nature, though not many\nfoods have very high amounts. Since it is lost in cooking and in the refining or processing of foods, it is not the easiest B vitamin to obtain in sufficient amounts from the diet, especially if we eat much processed food, as it is not one of the vitamins replaced in\n“enriched” flour products such as cereals and pastries.\nThe best sources of vitamin B6 are meats, particularly organ meats, such as liver, and the whole grains, especially wheat. Wheat germ is one of the richest sources. Besides meat, good protein sources of B6 include fish, poultry, egg yolk, soybeans and other dried beans, peanuts, and walnuts. Vegetable and fruit sources include bananas, prunes, potatoes, cauliflower, cabbage, and avocados. As examples of how easily vitamin B6 is lost in the processing of food, raw sugar cane has a good amount, while refined sugar has none; whole wheat flour contains nearly 0.5 mg. of pyridoxine (wheat germ and wheat flakes have much more), while refined wheat flour has almost none, and even whole wheat bread has lost nearly all of its vitamin B6.\nFunctions: Pyridoxine and its coenzyme form, pyridoxal-5-phosphate, have a wide\nvariety of metabolic functions in the body, especially in amino acid metabolism and in the central nervous system, where it supports production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Many reactions, including the conversion of tryptophan to niacin and arachidonic acid to prostaglandin E2 require vitamin B6. The pyridoxal group is important in the utilization of all food sources for energy and in facilitating the release of glycogen (stored energy) from the liver and muscles. It helps as well in antibody and red blood cell production (hemoglobin synthesis) and in the synthesis and functioning of both DNA and RNA. By helping maintain the balance of sodium and potassium in the body, vitamin B6 aids fluid balance regulation and the electrical functioning of the nerves, heart, and musculoskeletal system; B6 is needed to help maintain a normal intracellular magnesium level, which is also important for these functions. The neurotransmitters norepinephrine and acetylcholine and the allergy regulator histamine are all very important body chemicals that depend on pyridoxal-5-phosphate in their metabolism. Also, the brain needs it to convert tryptophan to serotonin, another important antidepressant neurotransmitter.\nPyridoxine is especially important in regard to protein metabolism. Many amino acid reactions depend on vitamin B6 to help in the transport of amino acids across the intestinal mucosa into the blood and from the blood into cells. By itself and with other enzymes,\npyridoxal-5-phosphate helps build amino acids, break them down, and change one to another and is especially related to the production and metabolism of choline, methionine, serine, cysteine, tryptophan, and niacin.\nThe body has a high requirement for vitamin B6 during pregnancy. It is important for maintaining hormonal and fluid balance of the mother and for the developing nervous system of the baby. Pyridoxine may somehow be related to the development and health of\nthe myelin covering of the nerves, which allows them to conduct impulses properly.\nUses: With its many functions, there is also a wide range of clinical uses of vitamin B6,\nclearly being most helpful when symptoms and diseases are related to a pyridoxine/pyridoxal-5-phosphate depletion or deficiency. Recently there has been widespread use of higher doses of B6, usually from 50-200 mg. per day (though some studies use 500 mg. per day of pyridoxine in time-release form) for premenstrual symptoms, especially water retention, which can lead to breast soreness and emotional tension. Pyridoxine has been very helpful in this role, probably because of its diuretic effect through its influence on sodium-potassium balance and its mysterious influence on the hormonal system. Vitamin B6 also helps with the acne that often develops premenstrually, as well as with dysmenorrhea, or menstrual pain; magnesium is usually used as well in all of these menstrual-related problems. In pregnancy, B6 has been helpful in many women for controlling the nausea and vomiting of morning sickness, which some authorities feel is highly related to vitamin B6 deficiency.\nLinda B., a 33-year-old wife and mother of two, came to see me complaining of premenstrual irritability along with severe breast swelling and pain, all of which interfered with her life. She began a simple supplement regimen that included vitamin B6 50 mg.\nthree times daily. She felt remarkably better during her next two menstrual cycles. Follow-up care included some diet shifts, weight loss, and a continued supplement program. She began feeling better throughout the month, and her well-being has continued for years. My office still receives thank-you notes from her.\nIt seems that whenever there are increased levels of estrogen in the body, more B6 is required. This occurs not only in pregnancy but also for women who take birth control pills and those postmenopausal women on estrogen treatment as well. It is likely that some of the emotional symptoms experienced by many women on the pill, such as fatigue, mood swings, depression, and loss of sex drive, may be related to a deficiency of B6 and thereby helped by supplementation.\nVitamin B6 is used for people with stress conditions, fatigue, headaches, nervous disorders, anemia, and low blood sugar or diabetes, and in men for prostatitis, low sex drive, or hair loss. Pyridoxal-5-phosphate (P5P) is occasionally used in formulas or as an individual supplement for certain conditions. As the active coenzyme of pyridoxine, P5P can go more directly into the metabolic cycles and does not have to be converted; thus, it may be more helpful than pyridoxine alone in such problems as fatigue, allergies, viral disease, chemical sensitivities, mental illness, and cancer. Pyridoxine supplementation is also used for a variety of skin problems–dandruff, eczema, dermatitis, and psoriasis. In regard to the nervous system, vitamin B6 has been supportive in cases of epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and neuritis. Vitamin B6 therapy, from 100-300 mg. daily for 8-12 weeks, appears to reduce carpal tunnel syndrome and increase the ability to use the hands in most patients.\nPyridoxine is a natural diuretic and is often helpful not only for the previously mentioned premenstrual problems but also in overweight and fluid-retaining people and as an adjunct to blood pressure control. Vitamin B6 (along with magnesium) has received some note in regard to preventing the formation of kidney stones or the recurrence of stones in those who have had them. In his book Nutrition and Vitamin Therapy (Grove Press, 1980), Michael Lesser, M.D., states that in a study reported in 1974 by the Journal of Urology, 10 mg. of vitamin B6 and 300 mg. of magnesium oxide prevented recurrence in about 80 percent of patients with a long history of kidney and urinary tract stone formation. Dr. Lesser also noted that the B6-magnesium combination helps in some hyperactive kids and those with fits or problems of autism. He states that pyridoxine in fairly large doses will stimulate dream activity as well as reduce the potential toxicity of barbiturate drugs, carbon monoxide and some other chemical exposures, and irradiation. Vitamin B6 works best when taken with magnesium, zinc, riboflavin, and brewer’s yeast or the other B vitamins.\nPyridoxine, probably more than the other B vitamins except folic acid, is supportive of healthy immune function. B6 deficiency can produce immune weakness, and B6 treatment may be helpful against infections and cancer. Recent studies have shown that pyridoxine can inhibit the growth of some cancer cells, specifically mice and human melanoma cells. Further research with B6 will likely find an even wider range of uses.\nDeficiency and toxicity: There is basically no toxicity with pyridoxine at reasonable daily\ndosages, though there has been some recent concern about this. Regular oral intake of 200 mg. and intravenous doses of 200 mg. have shown no side effects. Usually, the toxic doses are much higher, between 2Ð5 grams. Some recent reports in the medical literature show that regular usage of over 2,000 mg. per day, which some women especially have been taking, are correlated with episodes of peripheral neuritis. Although the experience of weakness or tingling of arms or legs has been transient and mostly correctable by decreasing the B6 dosage, this does warrant some concern about excessive use of B6, especially long-term use. Since part of the neuropathy problem comes from the liver’s inability to convert all of the pyridoxine to active P5P, this concern can be lessened by supplementing some of the B6 as pyridoxal-5-phosphate (as I have done in many of my programs), especially when the dose of vitamin B6 exceeds 200 mg. per day. In addition, using increased amounts of magnesium with the higher levels of vitamin B6 will reduce the occurrence of the peripheral neuritis.\nDeficiency, as usual, is a bigger concern with vitamin B6, as it is with all the B vitamins. So many functions are performed by pyridoxine that its deficiency affects the whole body. Most of these deficiency symptoms are fairly vague. Muscle weakness, nervousness, irritability, and depression are not uncommon. Many of the symptoms are similar to those of both niacin and riboflavin deficiencies; depression is common in all of them.\nMetabolically, pyridoxine deficiency has a dramatic effect on amino acid metabolism, with a decreased synthesis of niacin from\ntryptophan, a decrease in neurotransmitter chemicals, and a decrease in hemoglobin production. Fatigue, nervous system symptoms, and anemia are all influenced by deficiency. Further nerve-related problems include paraesthesia, incoordination, confusion, insomnia, hyperactivity, and, more severely, neuritis, electroencephalogram (EEG) changes, and convulsions. Other problems include dermatitis or cracks and sores at the corners of the mouth and eyes and visual disturbances.\nThere is special concern about deficiency during pregnancy, when vitamin B6 needs are higher, as it may cause water retention and the nausea and vomiting of morning sickness and has been correlated with a higher incidence of common problems of later pregnancy, such as toxemia (preeclampsia, high blood pressure, edema, and hyper-reflexes) and eclampsia (those same symptoms plus seizures). B6 deficiency in later pregnancy can be associated with birthing difficulties. There is also an increased likelihood of diabetic and blood sugar problems in pregnancy when vitamin B6 is deficient.\nOverall, vitamin B6 deficiency can cause a variety of nervous symptoms, skin problems, and amino acid/protein metabolic abnormalities. These can lead to the more common expressions–headache, dizziness, inability to concentrate, irritability and epileptic-type activity, labile depression, and weakness. Water retention is common. Nausea, vomiting, and dry skin, especially extensive dandruff and a cracked sore mouth and tongue are also more likely with vitamin B6 deficiency.\nRequirements: Vitamin B6 intake, though based on many factors, is determined primarily\nby protein intake, because it is so important to protein metabolism. The RDA for adults is a minimum of 2 mg. of B6 per 100 grams of protein consumed. In children, it ranges from 0.6-1.2 mg. per 100 grams of protein.\nHowever, the need for vitamin B6 increases in a variety of situations. During pregnancy and lactation and with birth control pill or estrogen use, higher levels are required. For those who eat a high-sugar or processed-food diet or a high-protein diet, requirements for B6 are greater and deficiencies or depletion are more common. When there is impairment of the digestive system, cardiac failure, or radiation use, or even just the aging process, needs for vitamin B6 are increased.\nDrugs that influence needs for B6 are oral contraceptives, isoniazid (for tuberculosis), hydralazine (for high blood pressure), amphetamines, reserpine (for high blood pressure), and some antibiotics. More B6 is utilized with an increased intake of the amino acid methionine. Adequate magnesium in the body is important to the functions of vitamin B6.\nA safe, basic intake for vitamin B6 is probably 10-15 mg. per day, though much higher daily amounts are easily tolerated. B6 should also be taken along with other B vitamins to prevent metabolic imbalance. For therapeutic purposes, amounts between 50-100 mg. (this is the quantity pyridoxal-5-phosphate usually comes in) are most common, and up to 200-500 mg. per day in time-release forms is used for some conditions, such as premenstrual problems and depression. With the current questions about neurologic side effects associated with megadoses of vitamin B6, particularly as pyridoxine hydrochloride, I suggest limiting regular daily intake to 500 mg. daily or 1,000 mg. for a short course of treatment, such as one to two weeks; also, take some additional magnesium, 200-300 mg, which may help reduce any neurologic concerns.","Vitamins and nutrients for insomnia\nInsomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders. According to estimates, up to 60 million Americans have trouble sleeping, and annual financial losses due to lack of sleep reach up to $ 63 billion. Treatment of sleep disturbance is complicated and, in addition to medications and lifestyle changes, a sufficient supply of some vitamins and nutrients may help you sleep better. Here is a detailed evidence-based article on vitamins and nutrients for insomnia and sleep disturbance.\nWhat is insomnia?\nInsomnia is a common name for a group of diseases that impair the quality and quantity of sleep.\nDepending on its duration, there is a short-term (acute), long-term (chronic) or transient insomnia.\nIn transient insomnia, sleep problems last several days and then they usually go away, while in acute insomnia you may have trouble sleeping for several weeks and in chronic insomnia, the sleep quality may be disrupted for months or years.\nThere are many causes of insomnia. Sometimes it is a disease on its own (primary insomnia) while other times it is associated with an underlying disorder, such as overactive thyroid, heartburn, asthma, heart failure, migraines, menopause, hot flashes, stroke or other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome or sleep apnoea (1).\nInsomnia is also a frequent symptom of other psychiatric disorders, such as the depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, etc.\nTreatment of insomnia is complex and involves both non-pharmacological and pharmacological options.\nNon-pharmacological practices include lifestyle changes or cognitive behavioral therapy.\nPharmacological methods include prescription drugs (hypnotics, antidepressants, Ramelteon) and OTC (over-the-counter) medicines, such as melatonin, valerian tea, L-tryptophan supplements or antihistamines.\nVitamins that help fight insomnia\nStudies suggest that some vitamins are useful in dealing with sleeplessness. In particular, deficiency of vitamins D, B, A and E may be a common cause of sleeping difficulty.\nHere is how individual vitamins may improve your sleep quality and quantity.\nVitamin B12 (cobalamin) is an essential water-soluble vitamin, which helps regulate many metabolic processes in the body, including red blood cell and DNA production.\nTherefore, maintaining healthy levels of vitamin B12 in your blood is very important for quality sleep.\nAnother study showed that supplementing high doses (3000 mg a day) of vitamin B12 to patients with persistent sleep-wake schedule disorders might improve the quality of sleep (7)\nVitamin B12 deficiency is common, especially in people over 50.\nRecommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin B12 for an adult is 2.4 mcg. Pregnant and lactating women should get slightly more (2.6 mcg and 2.8 mcg respectively) (8).\nThe best food sources of vitamin B12 are clams, beef liver, meat, fish (in particular trout and salmon) and dairy products (Swiss cheese or yogurt).\nVitamin B1 (thiamine) is an essential coenzyme in the synthesis of many bioactive substances, which are necessary for proper brain health. It also ensures correct functioning of cell membranes and may help cure insomnia.\nA study in women with premenstrual syndrome showed that vitamin B1 might help alleviate symptoms of sleep disorders and improve sleep quality (9).\nStudies suggest that a 250 mg daily dose of thiamine may help alleviate symptoms of anxiety, including insomnia (10).\nThe RDA for thiamine is 1.2 to 1.4 mg for an average adult (11).\nThe best food sources of vitamin B1 are thiamine fortified breakfast cereals, rice, eggs, pork, and trout.\nVitamin D is another nutrient that can improve sleep disturbance (12).\nIt is a fat-soluble vitamin, which is essential for your health.\nOver 1 billion people worldwide have vitamin D deficiency.\nSufficient vitamin D intake through food or dietary supplements may significantly reduce symptoms of insomnia because it is important for serotonin regulation.\nEnough serotonin means enough sleep.\nOne observational study in 1500 patients with sleep disturbance shows that maintaining blood vitamin D3 levels in the range of 60-80 ng/ml reduces insomnia (18).\nMost recently, a study in 89 participants received a dietary supplement with 50,000 IU of vitamin D every 2 weeks.\nStudy participants confirmed sleep quality improvement and reduced sleep latency (19).\nThe recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D is 600 IU (15 mcg) to 800 IU (20 mcg) per day (20).\nThe best dietary sources of vitamin D are swordfish, salmon, tuna and dairy products, including milk and yogurt.\nAlthough vitamin D is vital for proper sleep, its excess is toxic and as human body stores fat-soluble vitamins, which may build up to hazardous levels and cause life-threatening hypercalcemia and other issues.\nTherefore, do not exceed the RDA of vitamin D without the prior consent of your doctor.\nWhen taking a vitamin D supplement, never exceed the maximum daily dose shown on the product label.\nIf you have any doubts always get a proper medical advice before taking any supplement.\nVitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin, which is a strong antioxidant and is crucial for your eye health.\nIn nature, it occurs in two forms - retinol (vitamin A1) and 3-dehydroretinol (vitamin A2).\nIt is important not only for the health of your eyes but also contains retinoic acid, which is involved in the regulation of sleep (21).\nRetinoic acid also regulates the function of the pineal gland, which produces the hormone melatonin, which controls the circadian clock of the brain (e.g., tells your body when to sleep and when to be awake) (22).\nRDA for vitamin A is between 300 - 900 mcg RAE.\nRAE stands for retinol activity equivalent.\nThe human body converts all vitamin A into retinol. When you get your vitamin A from food, one mcg of retinol in the diet makes one mcg of retinol in the body. On the other and when you take dietary supplements containing vitamin A, only about 50% of retinol is used by your body (23).\nThe best dietary sources of vitamin A are sweet potatoes, spinach, carrots, peppers, broccoli and beef liver.\nJust like vitamin D, vitamin A is also soluble in fat and can accumulate in the body. Excess vitamin A causes osteoporosis and bone fractures, and it is detrimental to unborn babies.\nMainly pregnant women should avoid excess vitamin A!\nDo not exceed the RDA for vitamin A without the prior consent of your doctor.\nWhen taking a vitamin A supplement, never exceed the maximum daily dose shown on the product label.\nIf you have any doubts always get a proper medical advice before taking any supplement.\nVitamins C and E\nVitamins C and E are powerful antioxidants that neutralize free radicals in the body to protect cells from oxidative stress damage.\nOne of the common causes of insomnia in hemodialysis patients is the restless legs syndrome (RLS).\nStudies suggest that the combination of vitamins C and E helps alleviate the symptoms of RLS and improves the quality of sleep (24).\nBesides, vitamin C improves oxygen supply in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, yet another leading cause of sleep disturbance.\nIn one study, patients with obstructive sleep apnea were given an injection of 0.5 g of vitamin C daily.\nAntioxidant effects of vitamin C have vasodilatation effects on blood vessels, which reduces the oxidative stress and improves quality of sleep (25).\nThe RDA for vitamin C is between 13 to 90 mg a day, depending on your age. Pregnant and lactating women should get up to 120 mg a day (26).\nThe best dietary sources of vitamin C are citrus fruits, paprika, orange juice, strawberries, broccoli or kiwi.\nThe RDA for vitamin E is 6 to 16 mg a day depending on your age (27).\nThe best dietary sources of vitamin E are wheat germ oil, almonds, sunflower seeds and peanuts.\nOther nutrients that promote good sleep\nDo you know the saying 'You are what you eat'?\nThe food affects not only our health but also our sleep.\nIn addition to vitamins, other nutrients are also crucial for quality sleep and studies suggest that some foods and diets may help you sleep better (28).\nOmega-3 fatty acids\nOmega-3 fatty acids are essential not only for heart health but also for sleep regulation.\nIn one study participants ate 300 g of salmon three times a week for six months. The control group then consumed other types of meat, such as chicken, beef or pork.\nPeople who ate salmon had a higher level of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids in their blood than people in the control group and, according to their own words, they also slept much better (29).\nThe best sources of omega-3 fatty acids are mackerel, salmon, cod liver oil, anchovies, herring and oysters (30).\nMelatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which is responsible for controlling circadian rhythms.\nThe rise in melatonin levels promotes sleep.\nUnfortunately, the ability to produce melatonin decreases with age.\nTherefore, especially older people suffer from insomnia.\nMelatonin is added to some dietary supplements to improve sleep quality.\nEating some high melatonin foods can help treat insomnia and sleep disorders.\nMagnesium plays a vital role in sleep regulation because it increases blood melatonin levels and prolongs sleep time.\nIt also calms down your brain making it easier to fall asleep.\nResearch suggests that magnesium deficiency is associated with poor sleep and insomnia (32a).\nIt also improves symptoms of anxiety and depression, which are frequent causes of sleep problems (32b).\nOne study in older people with insomnia has confirmed that taking 500 mg of magnesium per day for eight weeks can improve the quality and length of sleep in older people (33).\nTo get enough magnesium you should consume foods, such as nuts, avocados or dark chocolate regularly.\nResearch suggests that the level of zinc in the blood affects the quality of sleep.\nOne study shows that reduced dietary intake of zinc leads to sleep quality and quantity deterioration (34).\nConsuming foods rich in zinc, such as oysters, beef, crab or fortified cereals, can help fight insomnia.\nIron is important for the proper functioning of serotonergic neurotransmitters that affect sleep processes.\nStudies suggest that adequate iron intake may prolong sleep time in children (35).\nConsuming sufficient iron-rich foods such as spinach, legumes, organ meats or beef can be helpful in the treatment of sleep disorders.\nCan vitamins and minerals cure insomnia?\nInsomnia and sleeplessness are common illnesses today. Their treatment is complicated, and it is always necessary to look for the cause of the problem.\nIf you have trouble sleeping, you should always seek medical attention.\nGet an appointment with a psychiatrist specializing in sleeping disorders, who will examine you and recommend appropriate treatment.\nSometimes you may need polysomnography (a study of sleep quality in a sleep laboratory).\nUnfortunately, it is usually not possible to cure insomnia or deal with your sleep trouble just by vitamin or nutrient supplementation.\nIf you want to cure insomnia, make sure you follow the advice of your physician and eat plenty of food containing vitamins D, B, E, C and A and magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids, melatonin, zinc and iron.\nDo not take any nutrient or vitamin-rich supplements without the prior approval of your doctor.\n|Written by:||Michal Vilímovský (EN)|\n|Education:||Medical student, 3rd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic|\nSee numbered peer-reviewed references in the article.\n|Published:||January 7, 2018 3:09 PM|\n|Next scheduled update:||January 7, 2020 3:09 PM|"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9efdfaee-7b5d-4e5e-9de9-d18351a9726b>","<urn:uuid:874696f3-2946-4501-904f-aab02b4b0c77>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a wildlife biologist, I want know - what is the difference between edge effects on biodiversity in MPAs versus forest fragments? Which system shows more positive effects for species diversity?","answer":"Edge effects impact biodiversity differently in MPAs versus forest fragments. In forest fragments, edges often increase biodiversity by creating varied environmental conditions that support both forest and open-habitat species. These areas particularly benefit species like white-tailed deer, elk, cottontail rabbits, blue jays, and shade-intolerant plants like shrubs and vines. However, in MPAs, edge effects generally reduce biodiversity, with population sizes at borders being 60% smaller than in core areas. This reduction is primarily due to fishing pressure at MPA boundaries. Forest edges can enhance primary production due to increased light availability, which supports more herbivorous insects and nesting birds up through trophic levels. In contrast, MPA edges show consistent patterns of population depletion occurring faster than population buildup. However, both systems can show negative effects - forest edges can lead to increased invasive species and fire susceptibility, while MPA edges can significantly reduce the effective protected area, particularly in smaller reserves.","context":["Fish on the edge: a meta-analysis reveals edge effects within marine protected areas\nEdge effects degrade the effectiveness of no-take MPAs on a global scale. Improving the planning and management of MPAs can increase their performance and benefits for surrounding fisheries.\nNo-take Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are a source of hope for our deteriorating oceans. The effectiveness of no-take MPAs in protecting and restoring marine ecosystems is documented in numerous field studies. However, these studies usually examine MPA effectiveness in a discreet manner, finding high biomass inside the MPA versus low biomass in adjacent fished area.\nBut the world is continuous, and MPAs are not fenced, unlike many terrestrial protected areas. So, what exactly happens across MPA borders? This question occupied my mind while reviewing the literature as part of my PhD research focusing on the process of fish spillover from MPAs. Spillover is the net export of fish or invertebrates (as egg, larvae, or adults) from within an MPA to its surrounding areas. Beyond conservation, spillover represents the ability of MPAs to benefit humans by contributing to the recovery of depleted fisheries.\nAs the last meta-analysis on spillover was conducted more than ten years ago, and since new field studies have been published in recent years, I decided that a new synthesis of cross-boundary size-estimates of marine populations would be interesting. Specifically, I wanted to know what exactly is the shape of the gradient from within to outside MPAs. Do fish really “spillover” from MPA boundaries? Does fisher strategy to often fish on the borders of MPAs (“fishing the line”) result in decreased fish abundances?\nI started to search the scientific literature for empirical studies with suitable data. There weren’t many. Cross boundary data on marine populations is very limited. The reason for this shortage is that these kind of field studies are generally very complicated, expensive, and time-consuming to conduct. I know this all too well from my own field research, where I am using both traditional underwater visual census methods and implementing new acoustic methods to identify fish abundance changes across the borders of no-take MPAs in Israel.\nEventually, I identified 24 studies suitable to include in my meta-analysis. These studies contained 1,619 population size estimates belonging to 147 unique samples, which represents the spatial patterns of 72 fish and invertebrate taxa across 27 no-take MPA borders, located in diverse marine realms.\nWhen I saw the results, I immediately understood that we are looking at a pattern of edge effect. Edge effect is a well-studied phenomenon in terrestrial protected areas, where the edges of the reserve experience elevated disturbance, which in turn reduces the size of natural populations. Consequently, edge effect causes a reduction in the actual effective size of the reserve with great implications for reserve planning and management. However, in the oceans, the magnitude of edge effects in MPAs had not been studied empirically.\nOur study not only revealed strong edge effect in MPAs, but also quantified the magnitude of this phenomenon on a global scale. The results suggest that the edge effect can reach up to 1-1.5 km within the MPA and that population sizes on the border are 60% smaller relative to the core areas.\nUsing the MPAtlas database, we also found that 40% of the no-take MPAs in the world are smaller than 1 km2, meaning that they most likely experience edge effect over their entire area! Overall, 64% of no-take MPAs are smaller than 10 km2 and may hold only about half (45-56%) of the population size implied by their area, making the global no-take MPA network significantly less beneficial than perceived.\nAn important point to highlight is that a pattern of edge effect does not mean that spillover from the MPA does not happen. Spillover and fishing most likely occur simultaneously on MPA borders to produce an edge effect pattern. Thus, despite prominent edge effect, spillover may occur, and fishers may still be benefiting from increased catch outside of the MPA boundaries. Nevertheless, the consistency of edge effect patterns implies that the depletion of populations at MPA peripheries is occurring at a faster rate than the buildup of populations outside of the MPA.\nOther evidence presented in the paper indicates that fishing pressure around the MPAs is probably the main cause of edge effect. In fact, when we examined different MPA characteristics, we found the no-take areas with buffer zones around them did not present edge effect but rather a pattern of spillover. In addition, MPAs that were well enforced presented a smaller edge effect than ones that reported some illegal fishing.\nThese findings are encouraging, as they mean that by applying a precautionary buffer zone with regulated fishing activities, and by improving enforcement, we can increase the effectiveness of existing no-take MPAs and increase the benefits they provide via spillover. When planning new MPAs, we recommend the no-take area targeted for protection to be at least 10 km2 and as round as possible, to reduce the proportional area of the total MPA size degraded by edge effect.\nAs the global community begins to implement the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, led by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), our findings provide hands-on, practical guidelines to improve MPA planning and management, so that we can do a better job of protecting our oceans.","|This article needs additional citations for verification. (November 2010)|\nIn ecology, edge effects refer to the changes in population or community structures that occur at the boundary of two habitats.:780 Areas with small habitat fragments exhibit especially pronounced edge effects that may extend throughout the range. As the edge effects increase, the boundary habitat allows for greater biodiversity.\n- Inherent—Natural features stabilize the border location.\n- Induced—Transient natural disturbances (e.g., fire or flood) or human related activities, subject borders to successional changes over time.\n- Narrow—One habitat abruptly ends and another begins (e.g., an agricultural field.)\n- Wide (ecotone)—Substantial distance separates border from point where physical conditions and vegetation do not differ from interior of patch.\n- Convoluted—Border is non-linear.\n- Perforated—Border has gaps that host other habitats.\nHeight can create borders between patches as well.\nEdge species (biodiversity)\nEnvironmental conditions enable certain species of plants and animals to colonize on habitat borders. Plants that colonize tend to be shade-intolerant and tolerant of dry conditions, such as shrubs and vines. Animals that colonize tend to be those that require two or more habitats, such as white-tailed and mule deer, elk, cottontail rabbits, blue jays, and robins. Some animals travel between habitats, while edge species are restricted to edges. Larger patches include more individuals and therefore have increased biodiversity. The width of the patch also influences diversity: a patch must be deeper than its border in order to develop interior conditions.[clarification needed]\nAnimals traveling between communities can create travel lanes along borders, which in turn increases light reaching plants along the lanes and promotes primary production. As more light reaches the plants, greater numbers and sizes can thrive. Increased primary production can increase numbers of herbivorous insects, followed by nesting birds and so on up the trophic levels.\nIn the case of wide and/or overgrown borders, some species can become restricted to one side of the border despite having the ability to inhabit the other. Sometimes, the edge effects result in abiotic and biotic conditions which diminish natural variation and threaten the original ecosystem. Detrimental edge effects are also seen in physical and chemical conditions of border species. For instance, fertilizer from an agricultural field could invade a bordering forest and contaminate the habitat. The three factors affecting edges can be summarized:\n- Abiotic effect—Changes in the environmental conditions that result from the proximity to a structurally dissimilar matrix\n- Direct biological effects—Changes in species abundance and distribution caused directly by physical conditions near the edge\n- Indirect biological effects which involve changes in species interactions such as predation, brood parasitism, competition, herbivory, and biotic pollination and seed dispersal\nHuman activity creates edges through development and agriculture. Often, the changes are detrimental to both the size of the habitat and to species. Examples of human impacts include:\n- Introduction of invasives/exotics\n- Higher severity and frequency of fires\n- Companion animals (pets) acting as predators and competitors\n- Pollution, erosion\n- Loss of foraging habitats\nWhen edges divide any natural ecosystem and the area outside the boundary is a disturbed or unnatural system, the natural ecosystem can be seriously affected for some distance in from the edge. In 1971, Odum wrote, 'The tendency for increased variety and diversity at community junctions is known as the edge effect... It is common knowledge that the density of songbirds is greater on estates, campuses and similar settings...as compared with tracts of uniform forest.'. In a forest where the adjacent land has been cut, creating an open/forest boundary, sunlight and wind penetrate to a much greater extent, drying out the interior of the forest close to the edge and encouraging growth of opportunistic species there. Air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, soil moisture, light intensity and levels of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) all change at edges.\nOne study estimated that the amount of Amazon Basin area modified by edge effects exceeded the area that had been cleared. \"In studies of Amazon forest fragments, micro-climate effects were evident up to 100m (330ft.) into the forest interior.\" The smaller the fragment, the more susceptible it is to fires spreading from nearby cultivated fields. Forest fires are more common close to edges due to increased light availability that leads to increased desiccation and increased understory growth. Increased understory biomass provides fuel that allows pasture fires to spread into the forests. Increased fire frequency since the 1990s is among the edge effects that are slowly transforming Amazonian forests. The changes in temperature, humidity and light levels promote invasion of non-forest species, including invasive species. The overall effect of these fragment processes is that all forest fragments tend to lose native biodiversity depending on fragment size and shape, isolation from other forest areas, and the forest matrix .\nThe amount of forest edge is orders of magnitude greater now in the United States than when the Europeans first began settling North America. Some species have benefited from this fact, for example, the brown-headed cowbird, which is a brood parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of songbirds nesting in forest near the forest boundary.\nAnother example of a species benefiting from the proliferation of forest edge is poison ivy. Dragonflies eat mosquitoes, but have more trouble than mosquitoes surviving around the edges of human habitation. Thus, trails and hiking areas near human settlements often have more mosquitoes than do deep forest habitats. Grasses, huckleberries, flowering currants and shade-intolerant trees such as the Douglas-fir all thrive in edge habitats.\nIn the case of developed lands juxtaposed to wild lands, problems with invasive exotics often result. Species such as kudzu, Japanese honeysuckle and multiflora rose have damaged natural ecosystems. Beneficially, the open spots and edges provide places for species that thrive where there is more light and vegetation that is close to the ground. Deer and elk benefit particularly as their principal diet is that of grass and shrubs which are found only on the edges of forested areas.\nEffects on succession\nEdge effects also apply to succession, when vegetation spreads rather than losing to competitors. Different species are suited either to the edges or to central sections of the habitat, resulting in a varied distribution. Edges also vary with orientation: edges on the north or south receive less or more sun than the opposite side (depending on hemisphere), producing varying vegetation patterns.\nThe phenomenon of increased variety of plants as well as animals at the community junction (ecotone) is also called the edge effect and is essentially due to a locally broader range of suitable environmental conditions or ecological niches.\nThe edge effect in scanning electron microscopy is the phenomenon in which the number of secondary and/or backscattered electrons that escape the sample and reach the detector is higher at an edge than at a surface. The interaction volume spreads far below the surface, but secondary electrons can only escape when close to the surface (generally about 10 nm, although this depends on the material). However, when the electron beam impacts an area close to the edge, electrons that are generated below an impact point that is close to an edge but that is far below the surface may be able to escape through the vertical surface instead.\n- Levin, Simon A.

{"question":"How do the matching principle and marginal costing differ in their approach to analyzing costs and revenues?","answer":"The matching principle dictates that companies must report expenses at the same time as their related revenues to match on the income statement, while marginal costing focuses on analyzing the impact on cost by adding one additional unit into production and is specifically useful for short-term economic decisions. Marginal costing helps management identify the impact of varying levels of costs and volume on operating profit, whereas the matching principle ensures temporal alignment of related revenues and expenses.","context":["Cost Accounting – Meaning, History & Types: Hi, Friends Today I am going to share some interesting information on the topic of Cost Accounting – Meaning, History & Types.\nPlease go through the article and enjoy reading it.\nCost Accounting – Meaning, History & Types\nIt is a form of managerial accounting. It aims to capture a company’s total cost of production. By assessing the variable costs of each step of production. As well as the fixed costs, like a lease expense.\nUnderstanding the Cost Accounting\nIt is used by a company’s internal management team. To identify all the variable and fixed costs that are associated with the production process. It will first measure and also record these costs individually.\nThen compare the input costs to output the results to aid in measuring the financial performance. Also making future business decisions. There are many types of costs that are involved in this type of accounting. Which are defined below as well.\nThe Types of Costs\nFixed Costs are costs that don’t change depending on the level of production. These are usually things like the mortgage or lease payment on a building. A piece of equipment that belittles at a fixed monthly rate. An increase or decrease in the production levels would cause no change in these costs.\nVariable Costs are costs that tied to a company’s level of production. For example, a floral shop provides a ramp-up of their floral arrangement inventory. Valentine’s Day will incur higher costs. When it purchases an increased number of flowers from the local nursery or garden center.\nOperating Costs are costs that are associated with the day-to-day operations of a business. These costs can be either fixed or changes depending on the unique situation.\nDirect Costs are Costs particularly related to producing a product. If a coffee roaster spends five hours roasting coffee. The direct costs of the finished product. That includes the labor hours of the roaster. And the cost of the coffee beans.\nIndirect Costs are Costs that cannot be directly linked to a product. In the coffee roaster example, the energy cost to heat the roaster would be indirect. Because it is inexact and also difficult to trace to the individual products.\nThe Cost Accounting vs. Financial Accounting\nWhile Cost Accounting is frequently used by the management within a company. To aid in the decision-making. Financial accounting is what the outside investors or creditors can typically see. Financial accounting presents a company’s financial position.\nAlso the performance to external sources through the financial statements. It includes information about its revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Cost accounting can be most beneficial.\nAs a tool for management in budgeting. In setting up the cost control programs. It can improve the net margins for the company in the future.\nOne key difference between cost accounting and financial accounting is that. But in financial accounting, the cost is classified which is depending on the type of transaction. Cost accounting classifies the costs according to the information.\nThe needs of the management. Cost accounting, because is used as an internal tool by the management. It does not have to meet any specific standard like generally accepted accounting principles. That is GAAP and, as a result, changes in use from the company to the company. Or department to department.\nStandard costing assigns standard costs. Rather than its actual costs. To its cost of goods that are sold COGS and inventory. The standard costs are based on the efficient use of labor and materials. To produce the good or service under the standard operating conditions.\nThey are essentially the budgeted amount. Even though standard costs are assigned to the goods. The company still has to pay the actual costs. Using the difference between the standard that is efficient cost. The actual cost incurred is called Variance Analysis.\nIf the variance analysis determines that the actual costs are higher than the expected ones. The variance is unfavorable. If it determines the actual costs that are lower than expected. The variance is favorable.\nTwo factors can contribute to a favorable or unfavorable variance. There is the cost of the input, like the cost of labor and materials. This is considered to be a rate variance. Additionally, there is the efficiency or quantity of the input that is used.\nThis is considered to be a volume variance. If, for example, XYZ company expected to produce 400 widgets in a period. But ended up producing 500 widgets. Then the cost of materials would be higher due to the total quantity produced.\nThe Activity-Based Costing\nActivity-based costing that is ABC identifies the overhead costs from each department. Assigns them to the specific cost objects, like goods, or services. The ABC system of cost accounting is based on the activities.\nWhich is any event, unit of work, or task with a specific goal. Like setting up machines for production, designing products, distributing finished goods, or operating the machines. These activities are also considered to be cost drivers. They are the measures that are used as the basis for allocating the overhead costs.\nTraditionally, overhead costs are assigned based on one generic measure, like machine hours. Under ABC, an activity analysis is performed where the appropriate measures are identified as the cost drivers.\nAs a result, ABC regularly to be much more accurate. It is helpful when it comes to managers reviewing the cost and profitability. Of their company’s specific services or products.\nFor example, the cost accountants using ABC that might pass out a survey to production line employees. Who will then account for the amount of time that they spend on different tasks?\nThe Lean Accounting\nThe main aim of lean accounting is to improve the financial management practices within an organization. Lean accounting is an extension of the philosophy of lean manufacturing and production. It has the stated intention of minimizing waste while making the best productivity.\nFor example, if an accounting department is able to cut down on the wasted time. The employees can focus that saved time more productively on the value-added tasks.\nWhen using lean accounting, traditional costing methods are replaced by value-based pricing. The lean-focused performance measurements. Financial decision-making is based on the effect on the company’s total value stream profitability.\nValue streams are the profit centers of a company. Which is any branch or division that directly adds to its net figure profitability.\nThe Marginal Costing\nMarginal Costing sometimes called cost-volume-profit analysis. It is the impact on the cost of a product by adding one additional unit into the production. It is useful for short-term economic decisions. Marginal costing can also help the management to identify the impact of varying levels of costs.\nAlso the volume on operating profit. This type of analysis can be used by the management to gain insight into potentially profitable new products, and sales prices to establish for the existing products. The effect of marketing campaigns.\nThe break-even point, which is the production level. Where the total revenue for a product equals the total expense. It is calculated as the total fixed costs of a company. Which is divided by its contribution margin.\nThe contribution margin, that is calculated as the sales revenue minus variable costs. It can also be calculated on a per-unit basis. In order to determine the extent to which a specific product contributes to the overall profit of the company.\nMany of the Scholars believe that cost accounting was first developed during the industrial revolution. When the emerging economics of industrial supply and demand forced the manufacturers. To start tracking their fixed and variable expenses in order to optimize their production processes.\nThe Cost accounting allowed railroad and steel companies. To control the costs and become more efficient. By the beginning of the 20th century. Cost accounting had become a widely covered topic in the literature of business management.\nSo, this is the important information on the topic of Cost Accounting. Here I have mentioned Cost accounting meaning, Its different types, and also the history of cost accounting.\nIf any Queries or Questions are persisting then, please feel free to comment on the viewpoints.","Accounting principles are the basic rules that a company follows when reporting financial information. These principles have been developed through common usage and as the basis for the complete suite of accounting standards.\n1. Revenue Recognition Principle\nThe revenue recognition principle gives a company a standard to follow for knowing when revenue is recorded and recognized as an item in the financial statements. Since revenue recognition is one of the areas that is often manipulated and biased, it is very important for a company to know when to record that information. Recording of revenue must meet these criteria:\n- There is a transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership.\n- The seller loses continuing managerial involvement or control of the goods sold.\n- The amount of revenue can be reasonably measured.\n- Collection of payment is reasonably assured.\n- The costs incurred can be reasonably measured.\nThe revenue recognition principle, a key feature of accrual-basis accounting, determines that companies acknowledge revenue as it is earned (not when they receive payment). Accurate revenue recognition directly affects the integrity and consistency of a company’s financial reporting, so it is essential to businesses.\n2. Matching Principle\nThe matching principle dictates that companies report expenses at the same time as the revenues the expenses are related to and that revenues and expenses are to match on the income statement.\n3. Historical Cost Principle\nWith the historical cost principle, the value of an asset on the balance sheet should reflect the initial purchase price as opposed to the market value.\n4. Full Disclosure Principle\nUnder the full disclosure principle, a company must include all relevant and necessary information for the understanding of a company’s financial statements in the public company filings.\n5. Cost Benefit Principle\nThe cost-benefit principle states that the benefits of an accounting system that help produce financial reports and statements should always outweigh its associated costs.\n6. Consistency Principle\nThe consistency principle helps to prevent manipulation in accounts by stating that all accounting treatments should be followed consistently throughout the current and future period unless required by law to change.\n7. Conservatism Principle\nThe conservatism principle in accounting is concerned with the reliability of the financial statements of an entity. It says that when there is an uncertain event, accountants should err on the side of caution and moderation.\n8. Objectivity Principle\nThe objectivity principle states that the financial statements of an organization should be based on solid evidence. This helps keep accounting departments of a company from producing financial statements that are planted by their opinions and biases.\n9. Economic Entity Principle\nThe Economic entity principle states that a business owner must maintain separate accounting records and bank accounts for each entity, and not intermix with the assets and liabilities of its owners and business partners.\n10. Accrual Principle\nThe accrual principle states that a company should record accounting transactions in the period in which they actually occur, rather than the period in which the cash flows related to them occur. It is a fundamental requirement of all accounting frameworks.\nWhat Is Accounting Principles?\nAccounting principles are common rules or guidelines for accounting financial transactions and for preparing financial statements. They are the foundational guidelines for recording and preparing financial statements. Accounting principles allow accountants to bring uniformity in preparing financial statements globally. These accounting principles are established in the field of accounting and are governed by a series of rules as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).\nThese basic accounting principles are often referred to as GAAP which stands for the generally accepted accounting principles.\nOn the whole, GAAP consists of three parts:\n- The basic accounting principles and guidelines\n- The rules and standards issued by FASB\n- The generally accepted industry practices\nThese accounting principles help to guarantee consistency in accounting reports and financial statements among all businesses. They help to protect business owners, consumers, and investors from fraud.\nWhat is the Importance of Basic Accounting Principles?\nThe basic accounting principles hold strict standards that companies and businesses must follow for financial reporting. These standards serve as a function to make sure that companies and organizations can’t mislead information in their financial reporting.\nWhy Is It Important to Understand Accounting Principles?\nIt is very important for a company or business owner to know and understand accounting principles to help keep their financial records accurate and organized. Accounting principles are an important part of keeping a business running properly.\nWhat Are Accounting Principles Used For?\nAccounting principles are the rules that businesses and companies follow to report their financial information. They can be used as references for stakeholders and other managing entities.\nWhen are Basic Accounting Principles Implemented?\nEach basic accounting principle has standards and rules that a company or business must follow when preparing its financial statements. These principles also state when a company should implement such rules and it is important to understand the nuances of each principle before setting up any accounting system.\nWho Establishes Basic Accounting Principles?\nAs mentioned before, the basic accounting principles were established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to help establish foundational guidelines for recording and preparing financial statements.\nHow Do you Apply Accounting Principles in Your Daily Work?\nMany of the basic accounting principles can be applied in a person’s daily work. When we check our finances, manage our bills, or even do something as simple as buying groceries, we are using accounting principles. That is why it is essential to learn more about basic accounting principles even if you are not a business owner or an accountant.\nIs the Basic Accounting Principle Beneficial?\nYes, as mentioned before, basic accounting principles set standards for businesses and companies to follow in order to have clean and reliable financial accounting statements. Basic accounting principles can even be applied in daily work when dealing with any type of financial transaction or management."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ff8f30b2-8d30-4801-b0cd-0575d92900bf>","<urn:uuid:25565e58-522b-494b-a941-507d5c92abfd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the structure of a horse's frog and what health conditions can affect it?","answer":"The frog is a structure visible on the bottom of the horse's hoof, alongside the sole, central sulcus, heel bulbs and collateral grooves. A common health condition that can affect the frog is thrush, which is a bacterial infection caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum in the frog's clefts. This anaerobic bacteria produces a black, foul-smelling discharge and can make the frog soft and sore. The condition typically develops in dirty, wet environments where bacteria can build up. To prevent such problems, it's essential to keep bedding clean and dry, and regularly pick out the hooves to allow oxygen penetration, as the bacteria causing thrush doesn't thrive in oxygen-rich environments.","context":["Anatomy of the lower limb and hoof\nBefore you can have a sensible conversation about hooves with your hoof care professional, you need to know and understand the names of the main structures of the hoof. Without this basic knowledge, your hoof care provider might as well be talking a foreign language.\nThe outside of the hoof\nThe outside of the foot is familar to horse owners.\nThere are only a few key structures that we really need to understand. From the outside, most of the hoof is surrounded by the hoof wall. Near the hairline, a slightly softer structure, called the periople is to be found. The periople functions much like our cuticles, protecting the new hoof wall for it’s first couple of months of growth. Just about where the hoof meets the hair is the coronary band. The coronary band is not visible in a live hoof, but can be felt when running your fingers around the hairline of the hoof.\nTo enable us to talk about the hoof and locations on the hoof, we divide it into three sections, the toes, the quarters and the heels (the diagram shows these divisions).\nThe bottom of the foot\nThe bottom of the hoof should be familar to all horse owners, but not everyone will have seen a nice healthly barefoot hoof. The image here is of one of my mare’s feet- she has never worn shoes. It is not perfect (we haven’t found the perfect hoof yet), but is well on the way and is capable of travelling across most surfaces.\nThe structures that are visible shod or not are the sole, frog, central sulcus, heel bulbs and collateral grooves. The bits that many horse owners have never seen are around the edge of the foot – the angle of the bars (heel), the outer and inner walls (the outer wall is often pigmented but the inner wall is normally a creamy colour and the white line (which when clean is often yellow, but in this image is filled with dirt). These structures have not just evolved randomly, they all have a specific part to play. If you would like to know more about the functions of the different areas of the hoof, have a look at this page.\nInside the leg and hoof\nThe anatomy inside the leg is likely to be much less familar to most horse owners.\nHorses have a single digit on their limbs (the hoof), this being equivalent to the middle finger or third toe of a human limb. In scientific terms the bones have the same names as the equivalent bones in humans, but for now, we will just look at the most common names used.\nStarting just below the fetlock joint is the long pastern bone, this connects to the short pastern bone which together form “the pastern”. The bottom of the short pastern is just below the top of the hoof wall. The short pastern sits above the pedal bone (AKA coffin bone in America), just behind this joint is where the navicular bone can be found.\nThe pedal bone is attached to the hoof capsule by laminae. Sensitive laminae grow from the pedal bone interleaved with the insensitive laminae of the hoof wall. It is these laminae that are affected during a laminitis attack.\nAll the bones are firmly joined to each other by ligaments and the bones are joined to muscles via tendons. The main tendons in the lower leg of the horse are the digital extensor tendon that runs down the front of the leg and the superficial and deep digital flexor tendons that run down the back of the leg. The extensor tendon and deep flexor tendon both attach to the pedal bone and respectively extend and bend the whole lower leg. The superficial flexor tendon attaches to the top of the short pastern bone.","The old saying 'no foot, no horse’ still holds true today and whilst as an owner you can’t do much mechanically to the hooves, daily care and observation are vital to avoid problems. Below is a list of actions you should perform regularly to ensure optimal hoof care.\n1. Keep bedding clean and dry\nDirty, wet bedding provides the ideal environment for bacteria to build up within the feet. This can lead to conditions such as thrush. Thrush is a bacterial infection, often caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum, which occurs in the clefts of the frog. The bacterium that is commonly involved is anaerobic, meaning it does not like oxygen. It produces a black, foul smelling discharge within the affected cleft of the frog, often making the frog soft and sore. Treatment involves moving the horse on to clean dry bedding and paring back affected tissues. Topical solutions should be applied to the area, as recommended by your vet.\n2. Pick out hooves at least once day\nPicking out the hooves is important in many ways and provides a vital opportunity to closely inspect all of the hoof structures.\nThe frog should be regularly inspected for damage, cuts and conditions such as thrush. The sole should be examined for puncture wounds and stones wedged beside the frog. The wall needs to be inspected for excessive growth or wear and the white line should be checked to ensure it is free from trapped grit which may cause opportunity for an infection if left.\nIf your horse has been out in damp muddy conditions and then brought in to a stable, it is important to pick out the feet, not only to carry out the checks previously described but also to remove the wet mud trapped in the underside of the hoof. Should this mud be allowed to remain in place it will leave the sole and frog damp for an extended period of time, which will result in the horn structures becoming soft and not as resilient as they should be.\nFurthermore, picking out your horses feet regularly allows oxygen to penetrate the underside of the hoof, reducing the risk of conditions such as thrush developing.\n3. Check the condition of the shoes\nIf shoes are fitted, assess their wear after two to three weeks (depending on the workload). If they are worn significantly, the next re-shoeing appointment should occur sooner or the workload on abrasive surfaces should be reduced. This will help to avoid shoes becoming loose or moving on the foot before the farrier’s regular visit.\nShoes should also be checked daily for any movement on the foot, as when horses move freely it is possible for them to catch their shoes. Typically, horses will often catch the front shoes with their hind shoes and either lose them completely or bend one heel up. This is a problem as it is possible for the nails in the shoe to be trodden back again which may puncture the sole.\nIf the shoe has moved dramatically and a punctured sole is suspected, professional advice should be sought immediately as any puncture wound can be problematic. Additionally, a deep puncture within the middle area of the hoof can be potentially fatal, if not dealt with correctly.\n4. Check the horse’s digital pulse\nFeeling your horse’s digital pulse is a very useful way of assessing conditions that may be occurring within the hooves.\nThis is only helpful if you know what the digital pulse feels like when all is well. Once you know what is normal for your horse you will be able to tell your veterinary surgeon or farrier when it is abnormal for your horse.\nOne of the best places to find the digital pulse is over the outside of the fetlock joint, slightly towards the back. Use your thumb and forefinger and apply gentle pressure. A horse’s pulse is slow at rest and often the fingers are moved away too quickly so make sure you wait patiently to feel the pulse.\n5. Use a registered Farrier\nRoutinely, an appropriately qualified farrier needs to attend your horse to undertake trimming and if necessary, shoeing. In the United Kingdom, registered farriers are governed by The Farriers Registration Act and overseen by the Farriers Registration Council.\nTo find a registered farrier in your area visit The Farriers Registration Council.\nBelow are a couple of frequently asked hoof care questions and answers.\n1. Should I wash my horse’s feet?\nMud is always a battle with horses and when they are standing in it daily it can cause many issues. It is best in most cases to wipe the feet clean with absorbent material rather than wash the feet, but if washing is the only way to rid the feet of mud, make sure they are thoroughly dried afterwards.\nDrying the feet is very important as when the horn structure (specifically the horn tubules) becomes oversaturated for long periods of time, its strength is compromised, which ultimately leads to broken and weak hoof walls.\nOnce the hooves are clean and dry a hoof dressing can be applied if required. There are many on the market and your farrier or vet is best placed to advise you on your horse’s individual requirements.\n2. Are my horse’s feet too dry?\nHoof horn is usually at its toughest when moisture content is low. As hooves get wetter, the horn becomes softer and more vulnerable.\nIt is rare in the UK for hoof structures to become too hard, so if the walls are cracking and splitting it is probably as a result of other issues.\nA regular application of a recommended conditioning product is more favorable and again your farrier or vet is best placed to advise on this."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:40a6e01c-ce1a-404c-accb-e47ce4a510d6>","<urn:uuid:e3899448-beb9-4560-bd73-fbb30b96e40d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the primary signs of vinegar syndrome in film, and what environmental conditions accelerate its progression?","answer":"The primary signs of vinegar syndrome include a distinctive vinegar smell from released acetic acid, film becoming brittle, warping and shrinkage up to 10%, separation between the emulsion and film base (channelling), appearance of crystalline deposits or liquid-filled bubbles, and sometimes pink or blue coloration in sheet films. Two main environmental conditions accelerate vinegar syndrome: heat and humidity. High temperatures speed up color fading and vinegar syndrome progression, while humidity levels above 50% RH significantly contribute to deterioration. The process is further accelerated when films are stored in sealed containers that trap the acidic vapors.","context":["Film Preservation Basics\nIf you have some old films, they deserve the proper care to save them for future generations.\nOf course, most of the films we have were meant to be shown and shared. A film sitting on a shelf doesn't serve its purpose.\nThe most common kinds of wear are perforation damage, base scratches. emulsion scratches and breaks. Perforation damage is usually caused by either a malfunctioning projector, a misthreaded projector, or a projector that has lost its loop. Base scratches appear as black lines and are on the side away from the emulsion. When duplicating a film, base scratches can be minimized by wet gate printing. Emulsion scratches are green or white lines scratched into the emulsion. There is no cure for emulsion scratches.\nThe most common problem with long term storage of film is color fading. With B&W film you only need to worry about base degradation (vinegar syndrome). Some film stocks fade very little, and others fade severely. Generally, cyan (blue-green) goes first, followed by yellow, ultimately leaving only magenta. Eastmancolor from the about 1953 through 1982 is the worst, though it can be quite variable. See my film stock identifier page (link). Heat is the main accelerating factor. The quality of processing also affects it, prints from some labs always fade severely, others hold up much better under the same storage conditions.\nVinegar Syndrome is a breakdown of the acetate base. When deterioration occurs, acetic acid vapors are produced, creating a distinctive vinegar aroma. The acid produced accelerates the process. Keeping the film in a sealed can traps the vapors, accelerating it further. Vinegar Syndrome causes the film to warp, shrink and become brittle. High humidity and high temperature speed the process. I suspect that residual processing chemicals are a significant factor. Polyester base film is immune to vinegar syndrome. The earlier diacetate film (before the mid 1940s) is less prone to vinegar syndrome, but often emits a camphor or \"mothball\" smell due to the plasticizers used. Agfa stock emits a peculiar odor, which should not be confused with vinegar syndrome.\nEnemies of film:\nAlways keep the film path on your projector squeaky clean. Naphtha, Filmrenew or alcohol on a cotton swab work well for this purpose. When you acquire a projector, run a loop of blank film through the projector several times to be sure that there are no burrs that might scratch the film.\nHeat is the main contributing factor to color fading, and accelerates Vinegar Syndrome. Keep film as cool as possible. Never store film in an attic. I try to keep most of my films below 60 deg. F (15 C) as much as possible. At the extreme, freezing film will preserve it almost indefinitely, but care must be taken to prevent condensation on the film.\nHumidity is the main contributing factor to Vinegar Syndrome. Never store films (especially acetate) above 50% RH. Air conditioning units help reduce humidity, and stand-alone dehumidifiers are readily available. Extremely low humidity isn't good either, storage below 20% RH can make the film brittle.\nNever clean film with water or a water based cleaner. It is best to use a cleaner made for film. I usually use Filmrenew which is a cleaner with lubricant and conditioner. It is relatively cheap and can help warped or brittle film. Naphtha can also be used, as can pure alcohol, avoid rubbing alcohol as it often contains water. All of these cleaners must be used under adequate ventilation, as the fumes are hazardous. Film cleaner can be applied with a clean soft cloth such as an old T-shirt.\nFilm preservation resources:\nThe Home Film Preservation Guide, an excellent resource for the novice in film preservation:\nConservation On Line at Stanford University, a great list of articles on film preservation:\nImage Permanence Institute at the Rochester Institute of Technology:\nNational film Preservation Foundation:\nHome Movie Day, dedicated to the preservation of home movies on film:\nVideo transfer resources at Home Movie Day:\nUrbanski Film, source of film cleaner, editing supplies and Molecular Sieves in smaller quantities (Larry specializes in providing supplies to the amateur as well as to professionals):\nEastman Kodak's recommendations for film storage:\nPlease contact me if you have any suggestions for improvements to this page.\nCopyright 2004-2015, Paul Ivester. Please do not copy without permission.\nBack to Paul's 16mm Film Page","Cellulose acetate film\nCellulose acetate film, or safety film, is used in photography as a base material for photographic emulsions. It was introduced in the early 20th century by film manufacturers as a safe film base replacement for unstable and highly flammable nitrate film.\nBeginning with cellulose diacetate in 1909, this innovation continued with cellulose acetate propionate and cellulose acetate butyrate in the 1930s, and finally in the late 1940s, cellulose triacetate was introduced, alongside polyester bases. These less flammable substitutes for nitrate film were called safety film.\nThe motion picture industry continued to use cellulose nitrate supports until the introduction of cellulose triacetate in 1948, which met the rigorous safety and performance standards set by the cinematographic industry. The chemical instability of this material, unrecognized at the time of its introduction, has since become a major threat for film collections.\nDecay and the \"vinegar syndrome\"\nThe first instance of cellulose triacetate degradation was reported to the Eastman Kodak Company within a decade of its introduction in 1948. The first report came from the Government of India, whose film was stored in hot, humid conditions. It was followed by further reports of degradation from collections stored in similar conditions. These observations resulted in continuing studies in the Kodak laboratories during the 1960s.\nBeginning in the 1980s, there was a great deal of focus upon film stability following frequent reports of cellulose triacetate degradation. This material releases acetic acid, the key ingredient in vinegar and responsible for its acidic smell. The problem became known as the \"vinegar syndrome.\"\nThe progression of degradation\nIn acetate film, acetyl (CH3CO) groups are attached to long molecular chains of cellulose. With exposure to moisture, heat, or acids, these acetyl groups break from their molecular bonds and acetic acid is released. While the acid is initially released inside the plastic, it gradually diffuses to the surface, causing a characteristic vinegary smell.\nThe decay process follows this pattern:\n- Acetic acid is released during the initial acetate base deterioration, leading to the characteristic vinegar odor. This signal marks the progression of deterioration.\n- The plastic film base becomes brittle. This occurs in the advanced stages of deterioration, weakening the film and causing it to shatter with the slightest tension. These physical changes happen because cellulose acetate consists of long chains of repeating units, or polymers. When the acetic acid is released as these groups break off, the acidic environment helps to break the links between units, shortening the polymer chains and leading to brittleness.\n- Shrinkage also occurs during this process. With the cellulose acetate polymer chains breaking into smaller pieces, and with their side groups splitting off, the plastic film begins to shrink. In advanced stages of deterioration, shrinkage can be as much as 10%. A 1% reduction in size renders motion picture film unusable.\n- As the acetate base shrinks, the gelatin emulsion of the film does not shrink, because it is not undergoing deterioration. The emulsion and film base separate, causing buckling, referred to by archivists as 'channelling.' Sheet films are often severely channelled in the later stages of degradation.\n- Crystalline deposits or liquid-filled bubbles appear on the emulsion. These are evidence of plasticizers, additives to the plastic base, becoming incompatible with the film base and oozing out on the surface. This discharge of plasticizers is a sign of advanced degradation.\n- In some cases, pink or blue colors appear in some sheet films. This is caused by antihalation dyes, which are normally colorless and incorporated into the gelatin layer. When acetic acid is formed during deterioration, the acidic environment causes the dyes to return to their original pink or blue color.\nTesting for degradation\nA testing product developed by the Image Permanence Institute, A-D, or \"acid-detection\" indicator strips change color from blue through shades of green to yellow with increasing exposure to acid. According to the test User's Guide, they were \"...created to aid in the preservation of collections of photographic film, including sheet and roll films, cinema film, and microfilm. They provide a nondestructive method of determining the extent of vinegar syndrome in film collections.\"  These tools can be used to determine the extent of damage to a film collection and which steps should be taken to prolong their usability.\nPreservation and storage\nCurrently there is no practical way of halting or reversing the course of degradation. While there has been significant research regarding various methods of slowing degradation, such as storage in molecular sieves, temperature and moisture are the two key factors affecting the rate of deterioration. According to the Image Permanence Institute, fresh acetate film stored at a temperature of 65°F (18°C) and 50% relative humidity will last approximately 50 years before the onset of vinegar syndrome. Reducing the temperature 15°, while maintaining the same level of humidity, delays the process by 150 years. A combination of low temperature and low relative humidity represents the optimum storage condition for cellulose acetate base films, however, in practice temperatures of 55°F (12°C) and a relative humidity of 35% are now being used.\nMicroenvironments—the conditions inside an enclosure—can also have an impact on the condition of cellulose acetate film. Enclosures that are breathable or that contain an acid absorbent are instrumental in reducing the rate of decay due to vinegar syndrome. Sealed metal containers can trap the decay products released by the film, promoting the spread of vinegar syndrome.\nRescuing damaged film\nDuring early stages of decay, the film content can be rescued by transferring it to new film stock. Once the film becomes brittle it cannot be copied in its entirety. Because the gelatin emulsion usually stays intact during the degradation process, it is possible to save the image on sheet film using solvents to dissolve the emulsion away from the shrunken base. Once the emulsion has been freed from the shrunken support, it can be photographed or transferred to a new support. Because of the solvents used, this is a delicate and potentially hazardous procedure and is an expensive process for a large collection. Degraded motion picture film cannot be restored in this way, but sheet films often can.\nWhile digitization would be an ideal way to preserve the contents of cellulose acetate film, current standards do not allow for scanning at sufficient resolutions to produce a copy of the same picture and sound quality as the original. Currently, the National Film Preservation Institute advocates film-to-film transfer as the best method for film preservation, with the copies stored in proper environmental conditions.\nCellulose acetate film is also used to make replicates of materials and biological samples for microscopy. The techniques were developed for metallographic needs to examine the grain structure of polished metals. Replication can be used to understand the distribution, for example, of different types of iron in carbon steel samples, or the fine distribution of damage to a sample subject to mechanical wear.\n- ^ National Film Preservation Foundation.

{"question":"My insurance network is limited - can you compare the cost of emergency rooms versus urgent care facilities for treating a minor fever?","answer":"Urgent care usually costs less compared to emergency care. Emergency rooms are equipped with expensive state-of-the-art machines and specialists for life-threatening situations, making them more costly. While both hospital ERs and Freestanding ERs can handle everything an urgent care can, that 'one-stop shop' convenience usually comes with a hefty price tag. Urgent care centers often offer cash-pay options for uninsured patients and are typically in-network with major insurance plans, meaning they have contracts with insurance companies to avoid surprise billing battles later.","context":["The need for urgent care arises from time to time. It’s a medical health need that doesn’t require emergency room speed but should be assessed within a day or two. While Dr. Michelle Hamidi and the team at Associates in Family Medicine in Clairemont, San Diego, California isn’t an urgent care facility, they set aside time for their patients with urgent service needs. Call or click as soon as possible to make an appointment.\nAssociates in Family Medicine is not an Urgent Care Facility; however, we do reserve a few time-slots each day for patients who need urgent services. These would be people who have symptoms such as earaches, coughs, aches & pains, etcetera.\nIn general, urgent care means you have health issues which need to be addressed somewhat quickly (within 24 hours) but not immediately. If it is during normal business hours, call our office to make a same-day appointment. If it is after hours, use your judgment to determine if you wish to wait until our office is open, or if you wish to see an urgent care center with extended business hours, or if you wish to go to the emergency room.\nSpeed: We recommend that you consider urgent care before going to the emergency room. Urgent care is often quicker compared to that of a busy emergency room where you may be placed at a lower priority compared to someone with a life-or-death situation. Emergency care will almost always service life-threatening situations before they handle non-emergency issues.\nCost: Urgent care usually cost less compared to emergency care. As you might expect, emergency rooms are armed with state of the art machines and specialists whose purpose is to save lives. These services and facilities cost money, thus a trip to the emergency room may hurt your wallet more than if you went to an urgent care facility.\nCourtesy: Emergency care is designed for emergency situations such as heart attacks, severe car accidents, or excessive blood loss due to open wounds. Entering an emergency room for minor health issues results in a full waiting room where everyone must wait a little longer before they are attended to.\nExamples: When you or a member of your family is sick, it can be difficult to decide whether a condition is “urgent” or “emergency”. Some examples of non-emergency conditions are:\nEmergency care is needed when you think a person or unborn baby could die or be permanently disabled if medical help is not provided immediately.\nSome situations are clear-cut: loss of limb or body parts, gunshot or knife wounds, unconsciousness, extremely high fever, or excessive vomiting. However, there are many situations where it is unclear whether emergency care is required or not. In these cases, you can call someone to get a second opinion.\nAsk Someone: Calling your doctor or a nurse practitioner for advice would be best. Otherwise even talking to a family member, a neighbor, or friend can help put some perspective on the situation.\n– Can this wait till the morning?\n– Is this as bad as I think it is?\nKeep in mind that if you go to the emergency room and your condition is not critical, you will be cared for after they have served those who are in critical condition. Such a trip may result in a 4 or 5-hour wait in the emergency room, a substantial hospital bill, and treatment that is the same as what you would have received from an urgent care facility.\nSafety First: On the other hand, if you feel that you need emergency care, then you should proceed to the nearest hospital and seek medical attention. It is always better to be safe than sorry. Sometimes peace of mind is worth paying for.\nExamples: Some examples of situations where you would want to call 911 or proceed to emergency care:","Hospital ER, Freestanding ER, or Urgent Care- How to choose the right care.\nLet’s say your child has a high fever, things are getting worse and you need quick medical attention. Where do you take them?\nIf you go to urgent care your provider might suggest you be transferred to an ER for higher level of care. You can’t afford to pay for two sets of bills, but your child needs medical attention now. What do you do?\nMany people base their decision on cost. Both hospitals and Freestanding ERs can handle everything that an urgent care can, but that “one-stop shop” convenience usually comes with a hefty price tag.\nWhile there are many sides to this debate, there are some solid guidelines that can help you determine which venue is best for your acute medical need.\nChoosing Between an ER and Urgent Care\nFreestanding ERs and Hospital ERs both provide great emergency care. The biggest decision is when to choose an ER versus an urgent care. Really, price can’t factor into this call. The decision should be driven only by the severity of the medical problem. If there is a definite medical emergency call 911 or go to your nearest emergency room. Serious bleeding, head injuries, major fractures, ingestion of poison, chest pain, stroke like symptoms – these types of conditions all need immediate and serious attention and there is no substitute for the ER in these circumstances.\nHospital ERs are a trusted and reliable choice, but as we know they are not always convenient and they definitely are not cheap. The good news is that According to an independent survey, only 1/3rd of people attending an E.R needed actual emergency care! If you know loss of a limb or life are not on the line, spare your pocket book. There are better choices out there.\nSo What are Urgent Care Centers For?\nUrgent Care Centers bridge the gap between the services provided in an emergency room and services provided in a primary care physician office. They treat a broad range of acute, but minor medical conditions. Examples include, cough, fever, sore throat, urinary infections, and ankle sprains. They often provide flu shots and school physicals as well. The majority of urgent care centers are open 7 days per week and appointments are not required. Wait times vary, but are generally shorter than at a hospital ER. Most all are open until 8 or 9 pm and some as late as 11pm. They are usually staffed by mid-level providers or family care physicians. They can provide most of the same services available in a local physician’s office with the addition of onsite labs and x-ray machines. They usually do not have the specialized medical equipment or emergency trained doctors needed for life-threatening medical conditions. Cost is the biggest benefit here. They often offer cash-pay options if you do not have insurance and most are in-network with major insurance plans. This means they have a contract with your insurance company so there are no surprise battles to fight later.\nFreestanding versus Hospital Based ERs\nWhether you have a cold or have suffered a gunshot wound, both facilities are capable of providing quality and emergency care 24 hours a day. While people understandably want convenient access to medical care whenever they need it, both types of ERs should really be reserved for real emergencies. This is especially true for hospital ERs where the same ER doctors treating coughs and urinary infections are usually simultaneously entrenched treating heart attacks, strokes, and trauma victims. Those critical patients will require the physician’s attention and may cause you to wait longer to be seen if you are more stable.\nBecause of the myriad of complaints and their sheer volume hospitals they have to use a strict triage system to decide who gets seen first. Time is important to everyone. In order to judge if a freestanding may be a better alternative, it is helpful to understand the hospital’s triage system. Triage usually consists of 5 levels based on severity. Level 1s are the most critical patient’s who can die without immediate life-saving interventions. This includes acute cardiac arrest patients who are receiving CPR. Their hearts have actually stopped beating and all the hospitals resources are brought to bear in the attempt to save the patient’s life. They garner the immediate attention of everyone on the team. Level 2s are the next most critical patients who should receive some medical attention within the first 15 minutes of arriving to an ER. These patient’s usually have abnormal vital signs or life threating complaints like chest pain and shortness of breath. Without quick treatment, these patients have the potential to become level 1s! They go to a room as soon as possible. Level 4s and 5s are much less sick and the most stable patients. These patients usually require no more than 1 X-ray or 1 lab test. Examples include ankle sprains, flu symptoms and bug bites. These are shuffled to the ER’s ‘fast track’ area where wait times are typically around an hour. Basically 1s, 2s, and even 4s and 5s all get seen pretty quickly. The problem is the guys in the middle – the dreaded level 3s. These are the abdominal pains, high fevers, headaches, complex lacerations, broken bones, concussions, dehydration and asthma exacerbations. Abdominal pain could be something serious like appendicitis, but it could also be constipation or gas. An asthma attack can turn deadly serious but the patient may just need a breathing treatment or a med refill. When everyone needs the doctor ‘now’ triage is the answer and Level 3s go to the back of the line and they wait the longest. They are too sick for an urgent care or the fast track area, but not sick enough to get sent quickly to a room. Getting triaged to Level 3 means going to the purgatory of the ER. Put simply, if there is a four hour wait, and you are designated a ‘level 3’ you will wait in the lobby for the entire four hours.\n“So, what do I do if I may be a level 3?”\nOne option is a freestanding ER (preferably with a board-certified ER doctor who has trained in hospital ERs). Many Freestanding ERs employ the same board-certified ER doctors as the major hospitals, and they can provide the same initial stabilization and treatment of most anything that walks through their door. They have CT scanners, Ultrasounds, X-ray and on-sight, hospital-quality labs. They can test for heart attacks and meningitis. They can safely sedate patients for painful procedures like setting broken bones. They are even equipped to place someone on temporary life support in preparation for transport to a hospital if needed. If someone needs admission to a hospital they can often have them transferred directly to a room in that hospital faster than if they had gone to that hospital’s own ER. In-short they are a great solution for the level 3s.\nThe primary concern with freestanding facilities is that they bill similar to hospital ERs and some are located in shopping centers and get mistaken for retail urgent care facilities. The trick is to look for the word “Emergency” on the building and to use them for emergencies only. Level 3s are true emergencies. They can turn into fatal situations and no one plans for these.\nAnother complaint is that the freestanding facilities are often out of network with insurers. Fortunately, insurers are required by law to cover all legitimate ER visits under their in-network plans regardless of whether the visit was at a freestanding ER or located in a hospital. It is important to note that many hospitals and/or their ER doctors are ‘out-of-network’ as well. Insurance companies and the state government recognize that no one has time to check the network status of an ER in the middle of an emergency.\nTo make it even easier, some freestanding ERs actually partner with an on-site urgent care that provides both services under one roof taking out ALL of the guess work.\nIf you have questions about your local freestanding ER, give them a call. Ask if their doctors are board-certified in emergency medicine. Ask if they balance bill. Ask if they have an urgent care on site for minor complaints.\nIn summary, all three types of facilities address the need for quick medical assistance. If you would typically visit your doctor, but they are unavailable due to the time or day, then urgent care is usually the next best place to seek medical assistance quickly. If you think you may have a level 3 complaint give your local freestanding ER a try. If you know you or your loved one needs immediate lifesaving care call 911.\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL FOR MORE RELEVANT,\nLOCAL HEALTH INFORMATION"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:67fb395a-1361-4fde-97db-86b406657996>","<urn:uuid:9a678d9e-ed7c-4734-afb9-eebab14aa212>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the installation process and cost considerations differ between vinyl and aluminum siding options for home exteriors?","answer":"Vinyl and aluminum siding differ in both installation complexity and cost factors. Vinyl siding installation is relatively straightforward, while aluminum installation can be more challenging due to the material's flexibility. Cost-wise, aluminum siding is typically more expensive upfront but can be a better long-term investment due to its durability. Vinyl siding is generally more affordable initially and offers a good balance of durability and aesthetics. According to market data, vinyl siding recoups about 75% of its cost upon home sale, demonstrating its value-retention. The cost consideration should also factor in maintenance expenses - vinyl requires minimal ongoing costs, while aluminum may need periodic repainting and repairs, which can add to its long-term cost.","context":["We want to help you make more informed decisions.

Projects like refurbishing a patio — or replacing a garage door — can improve your day-to-day experience in your home and boost its value too.\nIn fact, many Americans have spent their time at home over the past few months tackling DIY renovations. Quarterly earnings reports from big box home improvement chains Lowe’s and Home Depot both showed year-over-year improvement from 2019, even as overall consumer spending fell by record amounts amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe upward trend isn’t just a result of recent stay-at-home orders. According to the 2019 State of Home Spending Report from HomeAdvisor, Americans spent an average $7,560 on home improvement in 2018, a 17% increase from the previous year.\nHere’s how to find the right home renovation project that fits your budget, makes you happy — and would make a future buyer happy, too.\nDeciding on a Project\nAs you determine what projects to take on, consider those that will bring you the biggest returns on your investment if you decide to resell.\nYou don’t have to spend thousands of dollars or dedicate months of work on pricey renovations to increase your home’s value. Even small DIYs can have a significant impact when it’s time to list.\nThe best way to get the most return for your money is by focusing on where you spend the most time, such as the kitchen. That’s where potential buyers will likely spend their time, too, and will pay the most attention while viewing.\nAccording to the 2020 Cost vs. Value Report from Remodeling Magazine, an industry trade publication, renovations that saw the most significant costs recouped upon a home’s sale include minor kitchen remodels (78%), siding replacement (78% for fiber-cement and 75% for vinyl), and wooden deck additions (72%).\n|Project||Average Cost||Average Value at Sale||Cost Recouped|\n|Manufactured Stone Veneer (Exterior)||$9,357||$8,943||96%|\n|Garage Door Replacement||$3,695||$3,491||94%|\n|Minor Kitchen Remodel||$23,452||$18,206||78%|\n|Siding Replacement (Fiber Cement)||$17,008||$13,195||78%|\n|Siding Replacement (Vinyl)||$14,359||$10,731||75%|\n|Window Replacement (Vinyl)||$17,461||$12,761||72%|\n|Deck Addition (Wood)||$14,360||$10,355||72%|\n|Bathroom Remodel Midrange||$21,377||$13,688||64%|\n|Major Kitchen Remodel Midrange||$68,490||$40,127||59%|\n|Master Suite Addition Midrange||$136,739||$80,029||59%|\nPersonal Tastes: A Balancing Act\nAccording to Will Rodgers, a real estate agent based in Virginia, it’s OK to get a little creative with your design choices. Just don’t go overboard.\n“Don’t put something in that you’re going to hate,” he says. “But don’t put in something so unique that it’s going to turn 90% of buyers away.”\nReach out for a second opinion from a friend or neighbor before choosing anything drastic or highly custom, such as dark tiles in the bathroom or several bright paint colors.\n“You want to find the sweet spot: something you enjoy that reflects your taste but is not so custom and loud that it turns buyers off in two or three years,” Rodgers says.\nBefore you head to your local home improvement store or call your contractor, consider these projects to help boost your home’s value when it’s time to sell.\nAs many Americans prepare to spend more time at home long-term, either due to extended social distancing or changing remote work circumstances, outdoor space is more appealing than ever.\n“The top features home buyers want in the age of coronavirus are a quiet property or neighborhood, followed by more outdoor space, such as a yard or patio,” says Andrina Valdes, executive sales leader and COO of Cornerstone Home Lending, Inc. in Texas.\nWhether you’re working with several acres of land or just a couple hundred square feet of balcony space, spending your renovation resources on outdoor living space can make a significant difference for potential buyers.\nSome examples may include updating light fixtures, improving railings on the front porch, installing an outdoor ceiling fan to keep cool, or even an outdoor fire pit or fireplace for your backyard. For bigger renovations, home additions, new porches, and fence installations remain popular choices, according to the State of Home Spending Report.\n“A lot of people spend the most time in the kitchen, and I think it’s the best value dollar for dollar,” Rodgers says.\nAccording to the 2019 Remodeling Impact Report from the National Association of the Remodeling Industry (NARI) and the National Association of Realtors (NAR), real estate agents ranked “complete kitchen renovation” and the less-expansive “kitchen upgrades” as the two projects most likely to appeal to buyers and bring the most resale value to a home.\nIn fact, 20% of real estate agents say completing a kitchen upgrade played a part in closing a home sale.\nRemodeling a kitchen can be an expensive undertaking, but there are ways to complete the project on a budget while still adding value.\n“Gutting and doing expensive remodels will never give a seller a dollar-for-dollar profit,” says Deborah Baisden, a real estate agent based in Virginia. “Paint cabinets, put in new countertops and appliances, take down wallpaper, and paint trim.”\nAnd don’t forget about smaller changes to make a big difference. Changing light fixtures and cabinet knobs can have an impact on your space for comparatively little impact on your budget.\nBeyond the kitchen, the place a potential buyer is most likely to value an upgrade is the master bath.\nThe Remodeling Impact Report suggests you can recover 50% of the resources spent on a master bathroom remodel upon the sale of your home.\nRecouping value can be especially dependent upon how much you account for potential buyers in your design choices for both kitchen and master bathroom renovations.\n“Certainly, there are design trends that have wide appeal among a range of homeowners,” the Cost vs. Value Report from Renovation Magazine states. “But because of the vast differences in aesthetic tastes, one person’s elegant new kitchen or bath will be viewed by a range of other prospective buyers as tacky and outdated and in desperate need of a reset.”\nConsider a neutral color scheme (think white or light gray), updated fixtures, and popular trends like subway tiles for broad appeal.\nAccording to the Remodeling Impact Survey, flooring is one of the best ways to recover costs by adding value. The survey suggests homeowners who install new wood flooring could recoup 106% of what they spend in increased home value, while refinishing hardwood floors could recover 100% of the cost when it’s time to sell.\nIf you don’t have hardwood flooring already and aren’t quite ready to commit to the cost of new wood installation, consider vinyl or laminate alternatives, according to Rodgers.\n“It looks like real wood, but it’s super scratch-resistant, unlike wood,” he says. “For the general home buyer, it’s more economical, it’s more durable, and it’s mostly waterproof, which is nice.”\nIf you already have hardwood floors, consider waiting to refinish them until you’re closer to a list date, as they can easily get scratched up or worn again.\nClean and declutter\nIt may not be the most exciting project on your list, but completing a thorough deep clean and declutter of your home is a great place to add value.\nClear out each of your closets and drawers, donating any items you no longer need. You can even try to earn a few bucks in the process by listing items on sites like Craigslist, eBay, or Facebook Marketplace. Localized resale apps, such as Letgo, OfferUp, or VarageSale are also great options.\nThen work on cleaning harder-to-reach places attentive buyers may also examine, such as the baseboards or inside the oven.\n“Walk through the house with a critical eye and see what your eyes are drawn to,” Baisden says. “If the home is too full of the current family, a new family will not be able to see themselves in it. Start packing things away and consider having a stager in to help advise.”\nIf you’re planning on listing your home anytime soon, you’ll thank yourself for getting rid of things you don’t need in advance of the moving process, and presenting a clean, organized space to potential buyers can be key to scoring a deal.\n“We cannot help but judge a book by its cover,” Rodgers says. “When a buyer is walking up, and they’re seeing the grass isn’t cut, and the plants are all overgrown, they make that judgment instantly.”\nYour home’s curb appeal is its first chance to make a good impression on a potential buyer — or leave them with a bad taste in their mouth from the start.\n“Freshly mulched and edged flower beds and a well-manicured lawn will make the phone ring for showings,” Baisden says. “Stand at the front door and look at the porch for missing mortar or cracks. Is the door freshly painted and a pleasing color? Is there room for a burst of color in pots on the porch or in the flower beds? Are there spider webs?”\nThe impact a first impression makes on a potential buyer is critical and can influence the price a buyer is willing to pay for your home or even the closing of a deal altogether.\nRepairs and updates\nMinor repairs make for a productive but relatively inexpensive weekend project that easily adds value to your home.\nLook for small things easy to overlook when you’ve lived in your space for a long time: cracked windows, holes in walls, doors that don’t quite close all the way.\nAccording to the Cost vs. Value Report, of 22 projects evaluated, several minor renovations were among those that saw the most value recouped when it came time to sell, including garage door replacement (94% recouped), window replacement (72%), and entry door replacement (69%).\nThese small repairs (in addition to bigger repairs like a new roof or siding) are signs you’ve maintained your home well over time.\nBuyers are looking for a space that’s been taken care of, not left in disarray or damaged, and preparing a home completely move-in ready can have real value.\nAnother emerging trend among buyers that can help you decide where to devote your resources is efficiency.\nThe most recent What Home Buyers Really Want Report from the National Association of Home Builders shows, among home buyers surveyed, 89% ranked Energy Star windows as either “essential” or “desirable,” while 86% said the same about Energy Star appliances. Eighty-one percent of home buyers said it was essential or desirable for their entire home to be energy efficient.\nAccording to data from Energy Star, the average American household, which spends $2,000 annually on energy bills, can save about $575 or 30% each year by switching to energy efficient products. In addition to saving you money on utility bills in the short term, an already energy-efficient home can be a great selling point for buyers, especially those who may be debating between new construction (which is more likely to have efficiencies built-in) and an older home.\nDo Your Research\n“Go find a new construction community and walk inside,” Rodgers says. New home builders “spend a lot of money and time investing in figuring out what people want and what the latest trends are. They can buy any materials they want, so they take time to figure out the right ones.”\nDon’t just spend your research time on design trends, though. Scrutinize your budget too. Make sure the changes you want to make fit within your means, without enough left over emergency savings. You can’t rely on potential resale value to fund your investment in a project; this mindset could lead to debt and negative effects on your credit and overall financial health.\nIf your project can’t be completed with your current savings, consider postponing it until you have a bit more to spend on the things you really want, or find ways to reduce costs in a way that will still leave you (and a potential buyer) satisfied with the final result.","If you’re considering having siding installed on your home, you may be wondering if aluminum or vinyl is the better option. Both materials have their pros and cons, but in the end it comes down to personal preference. In this article, we will take a closer look at both aluminum and vinyl siding, so that you can make an informed decision about which material is right for you!\nWhat Is Vinyl Siding?\nVinyl siding is a popular choice for homeowners because it’s relatively inexpensive and comes in a variety of colors and styles. Vinyl siding is made from PVC, or polyvinyl chloride, which makes it extremely durable. It’s resistant to moisture, won’t rot or mold, and will last for many years if properly maintained. One downside to vinyl siding is that it can be prone to fading over time when exposed to direct sunlight. If you live in an area with extreme temperatures, you may want to consider another material. \nThe Look & Maintenance of Vinyl Siding\nVinyl siding is available in a wide range of colors and styles, so you can customize the look of your home without much effort. The cost to install vinyl siding is also relatively low compared to other materials. It requires little maintenance, aside from regular cleaning with a garden hose or mild detergent solution.\nVinyl Siding Installations in Varying Climates\nWhen considering which material to use for your home’s siding, climate should factor heavily into the decision. While both aluminum and vinyl are low-maintenance and relatively durable options, they may hold up differently in different climates.\nIn wetter climates prone to moisture, mold and mildew, vinyl is typically recommended because of its resistance to water damage. The nonporous surface of vinyl makes it harder for moisture or dirt to penetrate the siding and cause discoloration or other damage over time. Additionally, since most forms of vinyl siding are insulated, these types of sidings can provide an extra layer of protection from the elements and limit energy loss from the home—making it a more energy efficient option than aluminum.\nOn the other hand, in dry climates prone to extreme temperatures—both cold and hot—aluminum siding may be a better option because it is more heat resistant than vinyl. This can help keep your home cooler in hotter months and reduce energy costs associated with cooling the home. Additionally, aluminum resists fading more effectively than vinyl due to its paintable surface, which allows you to customize your siding to fit your home’s aesthetic while also ensuring that it will maintain its pigment over time even when exposed to direct sunlight. \nThe Durability of Vinyl Siding\nVinyl siding is made of polyvinyl chloride, often referred to as PVC. This is a type of plastic that is particularly resistant to weather and temperature changes, so it stands up to rain and snow very well. It’s also not prone to rusting or corroding like aluminum siding can be. Vinyl siding comes in many different colors and styles, so you have lots of options when choosing what look you want for your home.\nOn the downside, vinyl siding is not as strong as aluminum and can become warped from exposure to excessive heat or cold, although this effect is minimal. Also, if you live in an area with frequent hailstorms or other high-impact weather events, vinyl siding may not be the best choice as it is more prone to cracking or breaking.\nWhat Is Aluminum Siding?\nAluminum siding is a popular choice for many homeowners. It is lightweight, yet strong and durable, making it an ideal material for exterior cladding. Aluminum siding comes in a variety of panel styles, colors, and textures that can help you create a unique look for your home. It is also designed to resist dents and scratches, so it will stay looking good over time. Additionally, aluminum siding is low maintenance – all you need to do is rinse it down with a garden hose occasionally to keep it clean. \nThe Look of Aluminum Siding\nAluminum siding has been a popular choice of exterior cladding for homes since the 1950s. It comes in a variety of colors and textures, with an authentic painted metal look that’s often preferred over vinyl. Aluminum siding is also relatively lightweight, making it easy to install.\nHowever, aluminum siding does require some maintenance — it can dent easily if hit by hard objects or hailstones; and over time, it may become discolored due to exposure to the elements. Homeowners must be sure to check their siding periodically for any signs of rust or corrosion.\nUsing Aluminum in Varying Climates\nAluminum siding is considered to be more durable and heat resistant than vinyl, making it the preferred choice in areas with extreme temperature variations. Additionally, aluminum siding is paintable, which allows for a customized look that can last for years.\nOn the flip side, aluminum does not offer as much insulation as vinyl and is prone to corrosion over time—especially near ocean or saltwater locations. For this reason, vinyl may be the better option for wetter climates prone to mold and mildew growth. \nThe Durability of Aluminum\nAluminum siding is strong and durable, making it an ideal choice for those with homes in climates prone to extreme temperatures. It can withstand hot and cold temperatures without warping or cracking like vinyl siding may do. Additionally, aluminum siding is rust-resistant and doesn’t require much maintenance—just an occasional rinse with a garden hose will keep it looking good.\nMaking Your Choice\nWhen it comes to choosing between aluminum and vinyl siding there is no clear-cut answer. Both materials have their advantages and disadvantages, so the final decision really depends on your particular needs, budget, and preferences.\nAluminum is often seen as a more traditional choice that still offers robust protection for homes. It’s a durable material that can last for decades with proper maintenance, but may not be the best choice in locations prone to extreme weather conditions because of its susceptibility to rusting and other forms of corrosion. Aluminum also requires regular painting and caulking to keep it looking its best over time.\nIn addition to choosing between aluminum and vinyl siding, you’ll also have to decide on a color scheme for your home. A dark or light shade of siding can greatly affect the overall look of your house. If you choose a lighter color, it will help reflect heat away from the building in the summertime. Darker colors tend to absorb more heat, however, which could lead to higher energy bills in hot climates.\nThe first aluminum siding was developed in the 1930s and quickly became a popular choice among homeowners. It has since become one of the most common types of exterior cladding due to its durability and aesthetic appeal. Vinyl siding gained popularity in the 1970s as it offered an alternative to aluminum that was less expensive, easier to install, and more energy-efficient.\nWhen it comes to durability, aluminum siding typically lasts longer than vinyl — up to 30 years with proper care and maintenance. Vinyl is more prone to cracking, fading, and other forms of damage due to its plastic composition.\nAluminum siding is a great choice for those who want the look of traditional wood siding but need the durability of metal. It’s rust-resistant and can be painted to match any color scheme you have in mind. Vinyl, on the other hand, comes pre-colored so you don’t have to worry about painting or staining it yourself.\nVinyl siding is often seen as the more energy-efficient option due to its insulation properties. It’s able to resist heat transfer better than aluminum, helping to keep your home cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. Aluminum may not be as efficient but it is still an effective way of reducing air infiltration into your home.\nWhen deciding between aluminum and vinyl siding, there are a few things to keep in mind. Consider your budget, climate, and maintenance requirements. Also ponder the aesthetic appeal of each material and decide which one best fits with the style of your home. Whichever you choose, both types of siding can offer excellent protection for your house against the elements and help make it look great for years to come.\nOne of the biggest differences between aluminum and vinyl siding is the amount of maintenance they require. With aluminum siding, you will need to keep an eye on any dents or scratches that may occur over time. Periodically, these areas should be repaired to prevent further damage from occurring. Additionally, aluminum siding requires repainting every few years to maintain its look and protect it from the elements.\nVinyl siding is much easier to maintain than aluminum siding as it does not require regular painting or repair for minor dings or scratches. However, if there is any chipping or cracking in the vinyl material then it must be replaced promptly before further damage occurs. Additionally, if strong winds have shifted your vinyl siding, you may need to check periodically to make sure it has not moved out of place.\nWhen choosing between aluminum and vinyl siding, it is important to consider their environmental impacts. Aluminum is a durable material that can be recycled for reuse. However, the production process for aluminum does involve energy-intensive practices such as smelting.\nVinyl siding can be significantly more harmful to the environment due to its plastic composition and non-biodegradable components. Additionally, most vinyl products contain chemical softeners that have been linked to health problems in humans and animals when released into waterways or soil.\nFinally, the cost of both materials should be taken into consideration when deciding between aluminum and vinyl siding. While aluminum may be slightly more expensive upfront, its longevity often makes it a better investment in the long run. Vinyl is usually cheaper but will most likely need to be replaced after 20 years or so due to its susceptibility to damage from heat and cold temperatures.\nAluminum vs. Vinyl Siding: Understanding the Differences\nWhen choosing siding for your home, comparing materials like aluminum and vinyl is essential.

{"question":"What are the key differences in system efficiency between single phase and three phase power supply when considering power factor and equipment size?","answer":"Single phase and three phase power supplies have several efficiency-related differences. For the same load, three phase equipment is more efficient overall than single phase equipment. However, single phase motors have a higher power factor compared to three phase motors of the same rating, output and speed. Regarding equipment size, single phase motors need to be larger than three phase motors for the same load capacity. Additionally, single phase motors require an auxiliary winding to achieve the necessary starting torque, while three phase motors don't need any auxiliary means. In terms of power transmission, three phase is more economical as it uses about 3/4th the weight of copper compared to single phase at a given voltage and distance. This efficiency in transmission becomes particularly important when considering power factor, as poor power factor requires larger conductor cross-sections and bigger equipment sizes to handle the same power load.","context":["If you’re running an industrial or commercial facility, you’ve likely heard of “power factor” and its importance to your operations. Whether you’re a seasoned engineer or a new business owner, understanding the disadvantages of low power factor can help you improve your facility’s efficiency, reduce energy costs, and prevent equipment damage. So let’s get started!\nThe power factor is the percentage of electricity that is being used to do useful work. It is defined as the ratio of “active or actual power” used in the circuit measured in watts or kilowatts, to the “apparent power” expressed in volt-amperes or kilo volt-amperes.\nThe power factor is usually expressed as Cos Phi. (Ø) and can get values in the range from 0 to 1. The value of the power factor can never be more than 1.\nPower factor can be calculated by using the below formula:\nPower factor = cos ϕ = P(kW) / S(kVA)\nP= Active power (kW) does the real work of running the motor.\nQ= Reactive power (kvar) is the power used for magnetization, etc.\nS= Apparent power (kVA) is the geometrical or vector sum of kW and kvar\nDisadvantages of Low Power Factor\nDisadvantages of low power factor are:\n1. Large conductor cross-sections\nAt the low power factor, for transmitting the same quantity of useful power, a larger cross-section of the conductor is required. Because of the low power factor, more current is required to fulfill the useful power demand of consumers.\nThis is one of the reasons why power companies strive to maintain a high power factor in their power systems. By improving the power factor, the same amount of useful power can be delivered with less current, which reduces energy losses and improves the efficiency of the system.\n2. Big equipment size\nThe electrical machinery (e.g., alternators, transformers, switchgear) is always rated in kVA. kVA rating of the electrical equipment increases due to the low power factor as the power factor is inversely proportional to the KVA rating of the equipment. This increases the size and cost of the equipment such as transformers, alternators, and switchgear.\nFor example, if a motor has a power rating of 100 kW and a power factor of 0.8, its apparent power would be 125 kVA (i.e., 100 kW/0.8 PF). However, if the power factor is reduced to 0.6, the apparent power would increase to 166.67 kVA (i.e., 100 kW/0.6 PF), which would require larger and more expensive electrical equipment to handle the increased current.\n3. Copper loss\nAt a low power factor, the current drawn by the load is very high, which results in high copper losses. This results in poor efficiency.\nWhen the power factor is low, the reactive power component is high, which means that the current drawn by the load is high even though the real power being used may be relatively low. This leads to higher copper losses, which reduce the efficiency of the system. To improve the power factor and reduce copper losses, various techniques such as power factor correction using capacitors can be employed.\n4. Poor voltage regulation\nVoltage regulation becomes poor at low power factor. Current at a low lagging power factor causes a greater voltage drop in alternators, transformers, and transmission lines causing have low power supply at the receiving end. To keep the receiving end voltage within permissible limits, extra equipment (i.e., voltage regulators) is required that increases the overall cost of the system.\n5. Low handling capacity\nThe handling capacity of the equipment decreases because the reactive component of the current prevents the full utilization of the installed capacity. This is because the reactive component of the current creates additional strain on the system and reduces the effective power available for useful work.\n6. High cost\nA consumer has to pay electricity charges for his maximum demand in KVA plus the units consumed. If the consumer does not improve the power factor, then there is an increase in the maximum KVA demand and consequently, there will be an annual loss due to demand charges.\nTo avoid this increase in demand charges, consumers need to improve their power factor by using power factor correction techniques, such as installing capacitors or other power factor correction equipment. By improving the power factor, consumers can reduce their apparent power demand and consequently, their maximum KVA demand which leads to lower electricity charges and annual savings.\n7. Capacity reduction in the power station\nA generating station is as concerned with power factor improvement as the consumer. The generators in a power station are rated in KVA but the useful output is depending upon KW output. As station output is:\n𝐾𝑊 = 𝐾𝑉𝐴 × 𝐶𝑂𝑆∅\nTherefore, the number of units supplied by it depends upon the power factor. The greater the power factor of the generating station, the higher the KWh it delivers to the system. This leads to the conclusion that the low power factor decreases the earning capacity of the power station.\n8. Negative effect on equipment\nIf the power factor of a system is low, it uses more power than it needs to do the work. This can result in:\n- Excessive heat is generated, which can damage or shorten the life of the equipment.\n- Extra maintenance costs.\n- Power loss.\n- The potential for fires in extreme situations.\nLow voltage conditions result in:\n– Sluggish motor operation.\n– Dim lights (and the resulting quality and safety problems).\nAll this leads to high and periodic maintenance costs.\n9. Negative effect on the environment\nThe generation and transfer of electrical energy can severely degrade the environment. Low power factor causes electromagnetic pollution and air pollution due to the inefficiency of low power factor systems.\nImproving power factor and overall electrical system efficiency can help reduce energy waste and the associated environmental impacts. This can be achieved through the use of more efficient equipment and technologies, as well as through better design and maintenance of electrical systems.\nIn conclusion, low power factor can lead to many disadvantages such as large conductor cross-sections, big equipment size, copper loss, poor voltage regulation, low handling capacity, high cost, capacity reduction in the power station and negative effects on equipment. Understanding the concept of power factor and its disadvantages can help industrial and commercial facility managers to improve their facility’s efficiency, reduce energy costs and prevent equipment damage. Improving power factor can lead to lower energy losses, reduced equipment size, and better voltage regulation, ultimately increasing the earning capacity of the power station and improving the overall efficiency of the system.","Single Phase & Three Phase Supply\nAn electricity generating plant produces 3 phase supply on particular voltage such as 11KV, 16.5KV etc. This 3 phase supply is transmitted from Power stations to the load centers (cities & industrial areas) & distributed inside cities & industrial areas. Transmission of power is done on a higher voltage such as 66KV, 110KV, 132KV, 220KV, 400KV, 765 KV than generating voltage. Distribution of power is done at lower voltage such as 33KV (generally for industrial area) & 11KV (in city area). This distribution voltage 11KV & 33KV is further reduced to 415V. Some loads are in industries which are designed to run on 11KV supply while mostly loads are designed to operate on 415V & 230V. Generally, 230V is called single phase supply & 415V is called 3 Phase supply.\n( Note– We must know the voltage level of 3-phase supply before doing any work )\nTHREE PHASE SUPPLY–\nThree phase supply uses 3 wires for transmission & distribution. These Three wires are identified by their colors. These 3 wires are identified as Red phase, Yellow phase & Blue phase. The voltage difference between any two phases is the voltage at which power is being used such as 415V or 11KV etc. Overall voltage across 3 phase supply is 415V or 11KV etc. Let us understand 3 phase system. There two types of 3 phase system – A) 3phase 3 wire system & 3phase 4 wire system –\n- 3 phase 3 wire supply system – In this system, 3 wires are used for electrical system. As generating plant produces 3phase electrical power which is received & transmitted through 3 wires. It is called 3phase 3 wire system.This system is suitable for transmission of 3 phase supply because it is more economical as compared to 3-phase 4 wire system. The switchgears & equipment used in transmission are also designed for 3 phase 3 wire system.\nPower transmission is done at high voltagesby 3phase 3 wire system. Step up transformer is used for transmission of power because when voltage increases the current decreases as power input to transformer is equal to power output. Hence two major advantages of 3phase 3 wire system over 3phase 4wire –\n- It is economical as equipment & switchgears are designed for 3 wires only (not for 4 wires),\n- It is economical as current decreases when power is transmitted on high voltage. It means less material will be used for power transfer as diameter of conductor is proportional to the current.\n- 3 phase 4 wire supply system – This system is suitable for distribution purpose. Generally distribution of power is donein the city at 11KV & this voltage is further reduced to 415V by distribution transformer. A distribution transformer is installed to feed a particular area & whole city is fed through these distribution transformers installed at different location. Now 415V supply with 4 wires is available outside our housewhich provides both 3 phase & single phase supply. The requirement of 3 phase & single phase supply depends on the load of a particular house.\nAlso 11KV (or 33KV) distribution supply is available outside the premisesof industries/commercial buildings (for bulk load). This 11KV (or 33KV) supply is further reduced to 415V supply with help of distribution transformers inside the building premises for various types of load which are designed either for 415V or 230V.\nAdvantage of 4th wire in distribution system–\n- Single phase supply can be obtained (use any one phase & neutral wire from 3phase system). Neutral wire is obtained from star point of star connected windings of transformer.\n- Neutral (or 4th wire) allows unbalanced current to pass through it which helps to improve performance,\n- Neutral wire helps in detection of unbalanced current or fault.\n- As neutral is fixed & remains at ground voltage value, it helps to get better voltage regulation in fault condition in black out condition.\n(Note- Output terminals of a transformer decide 3 wire or 4 wire system. If output winding is delta connected, it provides 3 wires system whereas star winding provides 4 wire system)\nSINGLE PHASE SUPPLY –\nGenerally single phase supply is 230V AC between two wires. It is used for lighting & domestic equipment purpose. There are two wires used for single phase supply, one wire is called phase wire and second wire is called neutral wire. When load is connected with single phase supply, the current flows from phase wire passes through load & returns through neutral to complete the current cycle.\nOne more wire is used which is connected with the body of equipment or device to prevent user from electrical shock if there is leakage of current from wire to body of equipment or device (due to failure of insulation). This third wire is called earth or ground wire.\nSingle phase supply is taken from three phase supply by using any one phase (R or Y or B) & neutral.\n(Note: Neutral wire should be properly connected with the equipment. If it is not so, then it becomes very dangerous for the equipment because loose neutral or without neutral, the voltage across the equipment starts increasing. How it happens, is explained below-\nWe must remember that voltage across each phase is 415V with reference to other phase while voltage across any one phase with respect to neutral (star point) is 230V. It means it is neutral which helps to get reduced voltage i.e. 230V. Therefore, if neutral is loosely connected with the equipment or at source end, the voltage across equipment will increase from 230 V & the equipment will get damaged when voltage crosses a certain value as equipment is designed for a particular voltage. For ex – single phase voltage equipment is designed for 230V±10% variation.)\nWhat happens when a single phase equipment or lamp comes across higher voltage then its design voltage?\nLet’s understand this by Ohm’s Law –\nAccording to this law – V άI (Voltage is proportional to Current).\nOhm’s law says when V increases, I will also increase. So, in our case when voltage increases, current will also increase. Now let’s understand this by examples –\nEx-1 – Supposea lampis designed for 230V & when lamp is ON, it draws a particular current& accordingly insulation on current carrying parts is done. The filament of the lamp is designed to carry this current. If current increases than design value & crosses a particular limit, the filament will get melted & lamp will be fused.\nEx-2– Suppose A Motoris designed for 230V & Its ON, the motor will draw a particular current & accordingly insulation on current carrying parts is done. The winding of motor is insulated for a particular current. When current increases beyond a particular limit, the temperature of winding will increase & this high temperature weakens the insulation between winding turns & may lead to short circuit.\nAbove two examples clearly indicates that loose neutral connection is harmful to the equipment.(Note- All equipment/lamps are design to operate on 5-10% higher voltagethan its design voltage.)\nDifference between single & three phase supply\n|S. No||SINGLE PHASE SUPPLY||THREE PHASE SUPPLY|\n|1||Two wires are used in single phase supply, one is phase wire & other is neutral wire.\nEarthing wire is laid separately for earth fault protection.\n|3-ph, 3 wire & 3-ph, 4 wire system are used in 3 phase supply.

Both areas also have mussels, which are mentioned as blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) in New Jersey and as bait/prey for sheepshead in Florida.","context":["New Jersey’s coastal bays and rivers offer many recreational opportunities, such as fishing, boating and kayaking. However, one activity that is often overlooked is recreational shellfishing for hard clams or “clamming.” Many locals and visitors to the New Jersey coastal region enjoy eating these succulent treats, but may not realize that great clamming opportunities exist from the Navesink River south to the small bays and sounds of Cape May County. As with fishing, there is always a great sense of accomplishment that comes with “catching your own,” especially while enjoying a day on the water with family.\nNew Jersey has a storied history for harvesting shellfish that dates back centuries, with Native Americans harvesting shellfish for sustenance, later evolving into a commercial industry around colonial times. Recreationally, catching clams and oysters was a popular pastime that has, over the decades, seen a decline in the number of participants.\nContributing to this decline in participation are various factors such as loss of shellfish harvest areas closed due to poor water quality, overharvest and shellfish habitat loss from coastal development. Over the last several decades, improvements in water quality have expanded areas available to harvest, while tougher coastal development regulations have preserved existing shellfish habitat. Although shellfish populations have not yet returned to the numbers seen during the “glory days” of the past, there are still many good places to harvest shellfish.\nBy far, the majority of shellfish harvesters in New Jersey target hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria). Clamming can be a relatively inexpensive activity; all that’s needed to get started is a recreational shellfish license and a pair of old shoes or booties. Since clams are predominantly found in sand/mud bottoms and are buried just below the surface, the easiest way to start clamming is with the technique commonly known as treading. The harvester wades on a shallow water flat and probes the bottom with their feet or hands. Once a clam is found, you simply pull it out of the bottom.\nBe sure to check your tides though; low tide is the ideal time to harvest. This is critical to the success of your trip as treading in head-high water will only make you a better swimmer!\nAnother popular method is using a scratch rake; a gardener’s hand rake will also work fine. Simply pull the rake along the bottom until you hear and feel a clink, indicating a clam has been located. Use the rake to pull the clam out of the bottom.\nMost shellfish harvesters utilize boats or kayaks to find areas to shellfish. However, there are many public access areas along the coast, such as Island Beach State Park, for those without access to a boat.\nA great way to find clamming areas is to visit a local bait and tackle shop.\nHard clams can be found in a wide range of substrates and depths. For those who wish to expand their opportunities, a long handled shinnecock rake or tongs can be used off a boat in deeper waters inaccessible to treading. As you gain more experience, you will start to fine-tune your harvesting technique and become more efficient.\nOther species of shellfish such as oysters (Crassostrea virginica), soft clams (Mya arenaria), blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), bay scallops (Aequipectin irradians), surf clams (Spisula solidissima) and other bivalve mollusks can also be harvested under the recreational shellfish license. Periodic oyster tonging seasons are set dependent upon current oyster bed conditions. New Jersey’s tonging areas are the Maurice River Cove in Delaware Bay and in Great Bay near the mouth of the Mullica River in Atlantic County.\nA recreational shellfish license costs $10 for residents, $20 for non-residents and $2 for a juvenile under 14 years of age. Seniors over 62 years old that are New Jersey residents may obtain a free lifetime recreational shellfish license (initial $2 application fee). Licenses may be purchased at a shellfish license agent or online at New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife’s Web site at WildlifeLicense.com/NJ.\nThe recreational license allows for the harvest of 150 shellfish (in aggregate for all shellfish species) per day. Hard clams have a minimum size limit of 11⁄2 inches in length. Shellfish harvest is permissible between sunrise and sunset. Shellfishing is not permitted on Sunday (except for in the Navesink and Shrewsbury rivers). For more detailed information, see shellfish regulations.\nAll shellfish must be harvested in waters classified as “Approved” for shellfish harvest or within the open harvest period of “Seasonally Approved” waters (usually between Nov. 1 to April 30 of each year). Shellfish Growing Water Classification Charts may be obtained at shellfish license agents or viewed online at the NJDEP’s Bureau of Marine Water Monitoring Web site at nj.gov/dep/bmw/waterclass.htm. Shellfish harvesters must avoid shellfish aquaculture lease grounds. These grounds are used privately for the cultivation of shellfish and are typically delineated with cedar or PVC poles.\nIn an effort to provide more shellfish harvest opportunities in New Jersey, both recreationally and commercially, Fish and Wildlife has made significant efforts to enhance and restore New Jersey’s natural shellfish beds. Popular programs such as the hard clam seeding behind Island Beach State Park and on the flats in Great Bay near Seven Islands have been successful, as they have provided excellent recreational harvest opportunities. Partnering with Rutgers University, various federal agencies, local municipalities and organizations such as ReClam the Bay, Fish and Wildlife’s Bureau of Shellfisheries has initiated numerous programs designed either to enhance existing shellfish beds or to restore extant or remnant beds.\nThese programs have included the purchase and planting of clam and oyster “seed” (young shellfish raised beyond the larval stage) from hatcheries plus the purchase and planting of clean clam and oyster shell to provide excellent cultch material (growing substrate) for the setting of oyster larvae. These programs have been successful, providing excellent harvest opportunities in addition to the ecological benefits.\nThe enjoyment of exploring New Jersey’s coastal waters while finding your own “clamming hotspot” and feasting on your bounty at the end of the day are the best rewards of all. With tens of thousands of acres in New Jersey’s back bays and tidal rivers available to harvest shellfish, why not give it a try?\nTo stay up to date on important news and events related to shellfish, sign up for our shellfish and marine fisheries e-mail Listservs. Visit Fish and Wildlife’s\nWeb site at NJFishandWildlife.com/lstsub.htm.","Sanibel Fishing & Captiva Fishing, December 8, 2017: Sheepshead!\nCaptiva Fishing Report, Friday, December 8: Sheepshead, Structure, Catch & Release; Red Tide Report (Caloosahatchee freshwater runoff may be lessening a bit; some Red Tide but it has broken up and largely dispersed); more fishing reports from other areas and Captains below.\nFriday, December 8: Sheepshead, In The Passes & On The Docks; Pompano & Bluefish schools running inshore, Snook in the passes, Seatrout on grass flats, Redfish on oyster bars, and Grouper on the structure.\n“Archosargus probatocephalus, the sheepshead, is a marine fish that grows to 76 cm (30 in), but commonly reaches 30 to 50 cm (10 to 20 in). It is deep and compressed in body shape, with five or six dark bars on the side of the body over a gray background. It has sharp dorsal spines. Its diet consists of oysters, clams, and other bivalves, and barnacles, fiddler crabs, and other crustaceans. It has a hard mouth, with several rows of stubby teeth – the frontal ones roughly resembling human teeth – which help crush the shells of prey.\nThe sheepshead is found in coastal waters along the western Atlantic, from Nova Scotia to Brazil, but the greatest concentration is around southwest Florida. Although the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn, in New York City, was named after the fish, it is now rarely found that far north.\nAs sheepshead feed on bivalves and crustaceans, successful baits include shrimp, sand fleas (mole crabs), clams, fiddler crabs, and mussels. Sheepshead have a knack for stealing bait, so a small hook is necessary.Locating sheepshead with a boat is not difficult: Fishermen look for rocky bottoms or places with obstructions, jetties, and the pilings of bridges and piers. The average weight of a sheepshead is 1.4 to 1.8 kg (3 to 4 lb), but some individuals reach the range of 4.5 to 6.8 kg (10 to 15 lb). Please see more information here.\n|Regulations||Gulf State Waters||Atlantic State Waters|\n|Daily Bag Limit||15 per person|\n- Legal Gear: hook and line, cast net, seine, spear or gig\n- Illegal Gear: Harvest prohibited by or with the use of any multiple hook in conjunction with live or dead natural bait; Snatching prohibited\nHabitat and Fishing Tips: Sheepshead are commonly found in brackish water river mouths, bays, estuaries, and tidal creeks and especially near oyster bars, buoys, channel markers, piers and bridge piles where food is plentiful. Sheepshead feed primarily on crustaceans, mollusks, barnacles and small fish.\nAnglers typically use light to medium weight spinning tackle with shrimp, sand fleas or small crabs as bait. Using their specially adapted (human-like) incisors and crushing molars, sheepshead can be difficult to hook and have an uncanny ability to clean a hook without you knowing anything happened.\nWhen targeting sheepshead, it is very important to keep your line tight and be ready for the bite because you often get one, and only one, chance to set the hook. The food quality of sheepshead is very good, and they are one of the only fish that can smile back at you during the picture!\nCan oysters and barnacles be used as bait or chum for sheepshead Oysters and barnacles are very, very different when it comes to regulations.\nOysters have closed seasons, bag limits, size limits and can only be legally harvested in specific shellfish harvesting areas that are classified as “approved” or “conditionally approved” and in the “open” status. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Division of Aquaculture manages these shellfish harvesting areas.\nBarnacles, on the other hand, do not have size limits or specified bag limits, which means that you can harvest up to 100 pounds per person per day with a recreational saltwater fishing license and you can use them to chum sheepshead. You can also simply scrape them off bridge piles and allow them to sink and attract sheepshead. Do not scrape barnacles from private docks or other private structures without permission of the property owner.\nState Record: 15 lb 2 oz, caught near Homosassa.” Please see more information here.\nWe’re located in Castaways Marina, Santiva, Sanibel Island, just before the Blind Pass bridge to Captiva Island.\nAfter a fierce storm, Turner Beach, the beach adjoining the Pass, is frequently covered with a bounty of shells from Olives to Fighting Whelks to the more common Conchs. The fishing is also renowned for sharks in the summer, tailing redfish on the bayside flats and snook under and off the Blind Pass bridge.

{"question":"What are the two main methods for preserving plant species today - both in gardens and through seed storage?","answer":"There are two key approaches to plant preservation: botanical gardens and seed banking. Botanical gardens have shifted their focus to conserving biodiversity and restoring degraded ecosystems across the planet, though they face challenges with climate change affecting both garden conditions and natural habitats. For more secure long-term preservation, seeds can be stored in genebanks under carefully controlled conditions (-18°C to -20°C) to maintain viability, while specially prepared in vitro samples are stored in liquid nitrogen at -196°C. This ex situ conservation in artificial conditions is considered more efficient and effective than in situ conservation in natural habitats.","context":["The hidden battle behind formal gardens\nWith a third of the world’s plants facing extinction, the leading botanic gardens have shifted focus to make restoring degraded ecosystems their primary goal in the 21st century\nWHAT USE ARE botanic gardens? Most people might respond, reasonably enough, that they are delightful places to walk at weekends, and oases of colour and calm in stressed urban contexts. Gardeners will, of course, be aware that they provide information and inspiration for their hobby (sorry, for their passion).\nOn reflection, many people would probably add that their national or local gardens play a role in horticultural research and education in general. So it may come as a surprise to learn that many leading botanic gardens today, from Kew to Guangzhou, see their great mission in the 21st century as conserving biodiversity, though they still embrace their more traditional roles. And they are talking not only about preserving rare plants within their collections but about restoring degraded ecosystems across the planet, so that the plants in their collections will survive in the wild.\nThat’s a tall order in a world where, as one botanist put it recently, “even common is becoming rare”. But that is precisely what has prompted this shift in botanic gardens’ policy: an increasing awareness that a third of plants face extinction in the near future and that a few specimens in gardens, with a very limited genetic stock, will not guarantee a species’ survival.\nThat policy shift has itself been ratcheted up several gears by recent predictions from climate-change scientists, and this is leading into uncharted territories. “Climate change suggests that many plants are not going to survive at all where they are now,” says Peter Raven, outgoing director of Missouri Botanical Garden, and widely regarded as one of the greatest living botanists (and a tireless advocate of combining conservation with poverty relief). “The model of building up plant populations in botanic gardens and then putting them out in nature to help the species survive is threatened at both ends,” he says.\n“You don’t know what conditions are going to be like where you put the plants out – but you also don’t know what conditions you are going be able to maintain in your garden in the future,” he continues, outlining a scenario that threatens to turn his own lifetime’s experience upside down. Raven sees the recent development of highly sophisticated seed banks at a number of gardens as a positive response to this dilemma. We can stockpile the seeds from most species until the climate stabilises again and we have some idea where they might prosper.\nScience fiction on our doorstep, you might say. But it is depressing rather than exhilarating to think that many of the plants that now delight us – and provide us with invaluable services – may exist only in a sealed drawer for the next few generations. In the meantime, Raven insists, we must continue with restoration initiatives, but he concedes that the outcomes will be increasingly unpredictable.\nBotanists from around the world gathered in Dublin last month for the fourth Global Botanic Gardens Congress. The event was hosted by Peter Wyse-Jackson, currently director of the National Botanic Gardens of Ireland, in Glasnevin, but soon to replace Raven – a great, but no doubt daunting, honour – at Missouri. Wyse-Jackson co-wrote the ground-breaking International Agenda for Botanic Gardens in Conservation,published in 2000, which the congress reassessed in the light of subsequent developments.\nPerhaps the most radical update on the table now is the concept of “assisted migration”, a benign phrase that just might be the key to keeping many trees, shrubs and flowers in the landscape – and out of the chilled filing cabinets. But it is a concept that also raises as many problems as it proposes to lay to rest. As with animals, plants migrate to find the best living conditions, but plants do it slowly, over generations. Trees, with their very long life spans, are especially slow. Earthworms are sprinters by comparison.\nTen thousand years ago, as the ice sheets retreated from the North American Midwest, trees migrated up the continent at the rate of about 100km per century, until the global climate settled into relative stability – the condition we thought of as normal until very recently. Global change models suggest that climate “envelopes” will soon be moving north at speeds of 1,000km per century. So, if the models are right, this is a race that trees are certain to lose.\nMorton Arboretum, in Chicago, with its majestic woodlands and quiet lakes, feels like a place where time has stood still for many years, though its exquisitely restored prairie tells an eloquent story of great changes over the past two centuries. In any case, its chief executive, Gerard T Donnelly, knows that things are on the move even there, so he proposes that we must consider moving trees north of their current ranges at a rate that corresponds to changes in climate. Otherwise we will lose entire forests, he says, and probably many species.\nDonnelly knows all too well that this leaves him open to the charge of hubris – of “gardening the wild”. He knows that conservationists, himself among them, have spent the past 40 years combating any wild (and many domestic) introductions of non-native plants, because they can become invasive and wipe out unique local species and plant communities. Now he is proposing that introductions may often be the lesser evil.\nHe knows that the best outcome of assisted migration will involve the disintegration of cherished and valuable communities of plants and animals. Whatever novel communities will emerge may be poorer, or even richer, in biodiversity than what we know today, but they will certainly be different. However, he argues soberly that assisted migration must be among our options for “managing long-lived trees for an uncertain future”.\nRestoration used to be about attempting to return ecosystems to a past (and more biodiverse) state, but the wild card of climate-change is pushing restoration science towards the creation of new systems, with the proviso that maintaining biodiversity is still the target.\nRestoration at this level requires a knowledge of the workings of ecosystems that is often beyond current science. But, the theory goes, science will learn more through the large-scale real-time experiments involved in restoration. Let’s hope so.\nTo see restoration in practice in this country you can’t do much better right now than visit Kilmacurragh, the Co Wicklow arboretum that has just been granted National Botanic Garden status. Wild-flower meadows have been restored there after decades of close lawn-mowing, and have revealed a wealth of biodiversity simply by being allowed to grow back with minimal management, and no new planting at all. Dozens of native species have emerged from long dormancy in the seed bank, or simply blown in. The meadows are currently studded with hundreds of orchids (of four species) that you might be hard put to find elsewhere in such profusion.\nStrolling among them is a good, if alas temporary, cure for climate-change headaches, as well as a time-honoured use for a botanical garden.\nAn international agenda\nBotanic Gardens Conservation International\nGlobal Strategy for Plant Conservation\nUBC Botanical Garden and Centre for Plant Research\nNational Botanic Gardens at Kilmacurragh\nRestoring the Future","Plant Genebanking: Investing Seeds for the Future\nFor many years, the agricultural sector has worked on the continuous development of sustainable practices to provide sufficient food and medicine supply for a growing population. Among the many challenges they aim to resolve are the issues inflicted by plant disease outbreaks and upsurge, pests, and climate change. The conservation and increase of diversity of plant species are recognized feasible solutions to attain sustainability—and this is where genebank plays a part.\nA plant genebank is a type of biorepository that preserves genetic materials from various plants. The banked seedlings, cells, tissues, or other forms that contain genetic information are used by researchers, breeders, and farmers alike for the research and development of crops and medicines. As global climate changes, this approach is vital for plant varieties to withstand unprecedented weather and natural disasters.\nA Glance at Genebanking Process\nAfter the sample acquisition, a unique identification number is assigned to every material. This allows genebanks to properly manage and document their samples the moment they enter the process up to the time they are distributed.\nThe samples are prepared for conservation wherein methods differ per sample type. Seeds undergo cleaning, drying, moisture content determination, and packing. As for plant materials to be used in tissue culture or cryopreservation, extraction and disinfection are done.\nThe seeds’ and plant materials’ quality are tested to ensure that they are viable and free of pests and diseases.\nThere are two types, the in situ and ex situ. In in situ, germplasms are conserved and maintained in their natural habitat. This type is not deemed to be the best option. On the other hand, ex situ conservation offers an efficient and effective solution. Materials are placed under artificial conditions in a controlled environment such as cold storage. Seeds are stored at -18°C to -20°C to maintain viability and specially prepared in vitro culture samples are stored long-term at -196°C, usually in liquid nitrogen.\nThe expression of highly heritable characters ranging from morphological or agronomical features to seed proteins or molecular markers in plant germplasm is determined. This is done by growing a representative number of plants in the field.\nThis is done to increase the number of initial samples and replenish stocks. This process is very tedious as it requires careful adherence to special requirements to prevent loss of genetic integrity.\nThe preserved samples are made available for germplasm users, breeders, researchers, and farmers.\nThe seeds are investments that are soon to bear the fruits of labor. As the global demands for genebanking continue to increase, this calls for the utilization of engineering controls that are up-to-date and efficient. Taking part in guarding diversity, Esco Scientific innovates its products to help combat undernutrition, discover novel drugs and climate-proof crops, and ultimately, supply food to every table.\nA Horizontal Laminar Flow Cabinet is used to provide sample protection in preparing explants and media for tissue culture.Learn More Request for Quote\n Genebank Procedures Overview.

{"question":"What are the four essential components that make up a rolling contact bearing system and how do they function together?","answer":"A rolling contact bearing consists of four main parts: 1) inner race, 2) outer race, 3) rolling elements (which can be balls, rollers, or needles), and 4) a cage. The cage holds the rolling elements together and ensures they are evenly spaced around the periphery of the shaft. These components work together to create rolling motion between the fixed and moving surfaces, resulting in low starting and running friction.","context":["In this blog, we will discuss the basic concepts related to bearing, types of bearings: Radial bearing, thrust bearing, sliding contact bearing, and rolling contact bearing. Also, we will discuss the types of rolling contact bearing which include deep groove ball bearing, angular contact ball bearing, self-aligning ball bearing, thrust ball bearing, cylindrical roller bearing, tapered roller bearing, and spherical roller bearing.\nWhat is Bearings?\nBearing is a mechanical element that permits relative motion between two parts, such as shaft and housing, with minimum friction. Or in simple language, we can say that bearings are machine elements that support a moving element (axle or shaft) with minimum friction.\nFunction of Bearing\n- The bearing ensures free rotation of the shaft or the axle with minimum friction.\n- The bearing supports the shaft or the axle and holds it in the correct position.\n- The bearing takes up the forces that act on the shaft or the axle and transmits them to the frame or the foundation.\n- Axial Load: Axial load acts along the length.\n- Radial Load: Radial load acts perpendicular to the length.\nTypes of Bearing\nBearings can be classified in different ways. Depending upon the direction of force that acts on them, bearings are classified into two types – Radial bearings and thrust bearings. A Radial Bearing supports the load which is perpendicular to the axis of the shaft. A thrust bearing supports the load, which acts along the axis of the shaft.\nWe can classify bearings depending upon the type of friction, bearings are classified in two categories- Sliding Contact bearings and Rolling Contact bearings. Sliding Contact bearings are also known as Plain bearings, journal bearings, or sleeve bearings. The Relative motion between the shaft and the support is sliding motion in the case of sliding contact bearings.\nDue to sliding friction, wear and heat generation is very high, hence lubrication is required. Sliding contact bearings are used in crankshaft bearings in petrol and diesel engines, centrifugal pumps, large size electric motors, steam and gas turbines and concrete mixers, rope conveyors and marine installations.\nRolling Contact Bearings\nRolling Motion between the fixed and the moving surfaces. Low starting and running friction, hence they are also called Anti-Friction Bearings. However, this is a misnomer. There is always friction at the contacting surfaces between the rolling element and the inner and outer cages.\nA rolling contact bearing consists of four parts- inner and outer races, a rolling element like ball, roller, or needle, and a cage that holds the rolling element together and spaces them evenly around the periphery of the shaft.\nImportant points related to rolling contact bearings\n- More noisy at very high speed\n- More initial cost\n- Less maintenance cost\n- Rolling contact bearings are used in machine tool spindles, automobile front and rear axles, gear boxes, small size electric motors and rope sheaves, crane hooks and hoisting drums.\nTypes of Rolling Contact Bearings\n- Point Contact\n- Load carrying capacity is less due to less contact area.\n- Line Contact\n- Load carrying capacity is higher than the ball bearing due to more contact area.\n- Needle bearings are used where space between shaft and support is very less.\n- Needle bearings are characterized by cylindrical rollers of very small diameter and relatively long length. They are also called ‘quill’ bearings. The length to diameter ratio of needles is more than four.\nTypes of Ball Bearing\nDeep Groove Ball Bearing\n- It is the most common type of bearing, The most frequently used bearing is the deep groove ball bearing. It is found in almost all kinds of products in general mechanical engineering.\n- It can support both radial and axial loads.\n- (Fr/Fa)>1 or Fr> Fa\n- Deep Groove ball bearing can bear more radial load compared to axial load.\n- It has a high load carrying capacity due to the relatively large size of the balls.\n- It has less friction due to point contact.\n- It generates less noise due to point contact.\n- The deep groove ball bearing is not self-aligning.\nAngular Contact ball bearing\n- In an angular contact ball bearing, the grooves in inner and outer races are so shaped that the line of reaction at the contact between the balls and races makes an angle with the axis of the bearing.\n- Due to angular contact, it can support both axial and radial loads.\n- (Fr/Fa)<1 or Fr<Fa\nSelf Aligning Ball bearing\nIt can adjust with the mis-alignment of shaft.\nThrust Ball bearing\n- Designed to support only axial load (no radial load)\n- It cannot support radial load.\nTypes of Roller Bearing\nCylindrical Roller Bearing\n- It can only support radial load. The length to diameter ratio of needles is less than four.\n- Due to line contact between rollers and races, the radial load carrying capacity of the cylindrical roller bearing is very high.\n- Cylindrical roller bearing is more rigid than ball bearing.\n- Its coefficient of friction is low and frictional loss is less in high-speed applications.\n- In general, cylindrical roller bearing cannot take thrust load.\n- They are not self aligning. It cannot tolerate misalignment.\n- It generates more noise.\nTapered Roller Bearing\n- The taper roller bearing consists of rolling elements in the form of a frustum of cone.\n- Taper roller bearing can take heavy radial and thrust load.\n- Taper roller bearing has more rigidity.\n- It is very costly.\n- It cannot tolerate misalignment.\nSpherical roller bearing\nThey are also self aligning bearing. As compared to self aligning ball bearing, spherical roller bearing can carry relatively high radial and thrust loads."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ae3e52af-189a-488c-a25a-8ba6fddc4faf>"],"error":null}

It can also be an extremely dangerous pastime as you walk through a treacherous terrain where it is easy to lose your way, and filled with wild animals. When you are in the woods, you must keep in mind that you are traveling through the animal’s territory. It’s their home and we should all respect it. Therefore, when you choose to hike in an area that is known for snakes, don’t be surprised if you come across one. What would you do if you encountered a snake and it wasn’t so friendly, maybe even aggressive, so aggressive you were attacked and bitten?\nFirst, Don’t Panic\nOut of the 3,000 known snake species in the world, less than 10% have a bite that is truly venomous. So, there is a good chance that the snake that bit you wasn’t poisonous. On the other hand, that less than 10% amount still leaves a few hundred varieties that could be dangerous.\nIt is always best to prevent a snakebite from happening before you go out hiking. You can do this by wearing heavy boots that cover your ankles, watch your step in tall grass, and be careful when reaching underneath rocks or piles of wood where snakes tend to hide.\nIf you are bitten by a snake, stay calm. When you begin to panic after a bite, your heart rate elevates and the increase of blood flow will promote the absorption of venom, which puts you at a greater risk of developing a serious or fatal injury.\nThe Top 5 Deadliest Snakes in North America\n- Also known as a water moccasin or a water pit viper\n- A strong swimmer and is located throughout the Southeastern United States\n- You can also find them on the remote islands of the Gulf of Mexico\n- Has powerful cytotoxic venom that can eat away flesh leading to amputations if the victim survives\n- They often hide in water and attack when you least expect it\n- Timber Rattlesnake\n- Large with long fangs and potent venom\n- They can pump a large amount of their venom into prey at once\n- They have a mild temperament and a well-known rattle warning\n- Timber rattlesnakes are the most patient of their kind and give lengthy warnings that let you know to stay away\nNatural Medicine: The Ultimate Painkilling Tincture\n- Black Diamond Rattlesnake\n- Has 7 different sub-species\n- Can have highly toxic venom that attacks the nerve endings\n- Their venom requires a very high dosage of antivenom\n- Found throughout the western half of North America\n- Tiger Rattlesnake\n- Earned its name because of its pattern of vertical stripes\n- It has the smallest head of any rattlesnake\n- Has very potent venom that by the amount of toxicity, makes it the most dangerous of all snakes in the Western Hemisphere\n- However, it only injects a small amount of venom per bite, making fatalities from a Tiger Rattlesnake bite rare.\n- Located in a small area near the Arizona/Mexico border.\nEncounter Snakes Often?

If you can, take a picture of it so that you can show a doctor or other medical staff the type of snake it is.\n- Remove anything you are wearing that could constrict blood flow to the bite area such as tight clothing, jewelry, or shoes.\n- Clean the area using water and bandage it with any sanitary material to help reduce the bleeding. However, avoid tourniquets, ice packs, or any suction devices. And do not consume any caffeine or alcohol.\n- Get medical assistance as soon as possible while you keep the affected area immobile and elevated above your heart.\nSuggested Article: “Unexpected Survival Items You Should Stock up on”\nHopefully, you will never need these tips for your adventures in the wilderness, but it can be easy to accidentally tread in an area known for snakes.

{"question":"How does pollination process compare avec seed dispersal methods in terms of complexity?","answer":"Pollination is generally more complex than seed dispersal processes. Pollination involves multiple precise steps: pollen must land on the stigma, grow a tube down the pistil to reach the egg, release sperm cells, achieve fertilization through sperm-egg fusion, and then develop into seeds within the ovary. The process requires specific timing and conditions, and can occur through either cross-pollination or self-pollination. In contrast, seed dispersal methods are more straightforward mechanical processes - whether by wind carrying light seeds with parachute-like structures, water floating seeds, animals transporting seeds either by eating fruits or carrying burrs in their fur, or explosive mechanisms where pods simply split open to release seeds. While both processes are essential for plant reproduction, pollination involves more complex biological interactions and cellular processes.","context":["The process by which seeds are formed is almost unbelievable. The flowers in this picture are grown to make a garden look attractive. However, their main purpose is to contain the sex organs for the plant.\nThis is a fuchsia plant in flower.\nLet’s look more closely at flowers, as this is where all the action happens for sexual reproduction in plants.\nHere is a cross-section diagram of a fuchsia flower.\n- For seeds to be produced, the male sex cells in the pollen and female sex cells in the ovary need to get together. The first part in this process is pollination. Pollination is when the pollen lands on the female part of a flower. In most plants the stigma needs to receive pollen from another flower.\n- Cross pollination occurs when pollen from a flower lands on the stigma of a different flower of the same species.\n- Self-pollination occurs when the pollen from a flower lands on the stigma of the same flower.\nThere are two main ways that pollen gets from one flower to another:\nWhen insects like bees or flies visit flowers and pollen sticks onto their hairy legs. When they visit another flower the pollen rubs off on its stigma.\nInsect pollinated flowers may have large brightly coloured petals, large pollen grains, and be scented.\nThe wind carries pollen from one plant to another. Wind pollinated flowers may have small petals, no scent, a lot of small light pollen grains on long, droopy stamens.\nGrass pollen is carried by wind. Grass has feathery stigmas to catch the pollen.\nA few plants, for example, cucumbers, have separate male and female flowers on one plant.\nKiwifruit have male and female flowers on separate plants. These are called dioecious plants. This means a male plant must be grown alongside female plants for pollination to occur.\nOnce pollination has taken place fertilisation can occur. Fertilisation is the joining of a male and female sex cell. This is what happens:\n- a pollen grain grows a tube down the middle of the pistil (via the style) to the egg inside the ovary\n- when the tube reaches the female sex cell (egg), the tip dissolves. The male sex cell (sperm) is released\n- the sperm and the egg join in the ovule\n- once these cells are joined, the ovules turn into seeds inside the ovary\n- if there is more than one egg in the ovule then more than one seed forms as in a pea pod if each egg is fertilised by a separate sperm\n- the ovary develops into a fruit and surrounds the seed.\nThe seeds will have characteristics from the two different parent plants. Just like you, they will be individuals and in some way different from their parents.\nThe development of seeds\nSeeds contain a food store and a tiny plant inside a protective coat.\nThe food store is called the cotyledon.\nMonocotyledon seeds, such as corn, have one cotyledon to store food for the developing seed. Some seeds such as bean seeds have two cotyledons. These are called dicotyledons.\nThe tiny plant is called the embryo, and the protective coat covering the seed is called the testa.\nUnderstanding the structure of seeds will help you propagate plants more successfully from seed.\nThis is a diagram of the inside of a split lupin seed.\nHere is a cross-section diagram of a corn seed.\nIt has one cotyledon. It is called a monocotyledon seed. The cotyledon’s role in a monocotyledon is slightly different from that of a dicotyledon. The cotyledon transfers food to the embryo.\nWhen fertilisation is complete, the ovary surrounding the seeds develops into a fruit. The fruit helps to protect the seed. Some fruit is dry like gorse or lupin pods and some are juicy like an apple.\nThis is the scattering of seeds away from the parent plant. Seeds need to be dispersed to reduce the competition from the parent plant and germinating seedlings.\nWhen the pod of the lupin dries it splits open explosively to scatter the seeds away from the plant.\nSeeds can be dispersed by the wind, on animal hair or bird feathers, in bird and animal faeces or they can float in water.\n- The process of pollination and fertilisation in plants explains why plants grown by seed show some variation.\n- Pollination takes place when the pollen grains are transferred from the male anther to the female stigma.\n- Fertilisation is the joining of the female ovule and male pollen.\n- The new plants will be slightly different because all ovules and pollen grains are slightly different genetically.\n- A monocotyledon is a plant with one cotyledon in its seed.\n- A dicotyledon is a plant with two cotyledons in its seed.\nGo to: 3 Seed germination.","This is the time of year we see a lot of seeds on the move! Much like parents pushing their children out of their house, plants want to spread their seeds, or their genes, as far as possible. Seed dispersal is a technique used by plants to distribute their seeds. Different species of plants have some clever ways of transporting their seeds. Watch out for these whenever you see seeds on the move.\nWant these articles delivered right to your inbox every week? Click here to sign up!\nPerhaps the most common method of seed dispersal is wind. Some plants we all know and love use wind to disperse their seeds. Thistle, maples and dandelion are some common species that use this method. Thistle and dandelion seeds are attached to a fluffy parachute that carries the plant far away. Maple seeds have little wings that have been nicknamed ‘helicopters,’ however the botanical term for them is a schizocarp. The seeds fly through the air using their ‘wings’ in hopes of spreading far from the parent tree.\nOther species rely on animal transport to disperse their seeds. There are two types of animal transport, active and passive. In active transport, some plants we enjoy eating, such as blueberries and strawberries, trick us into eating their seeds by wrapping them with sweet fleshy fruits. We consume the seeds along with the fruit, and then our bodies digest the fruit, removing the protective layer on the seed called the seed coat. Once the seed coat is removed, the seed can absorb valuable nutrients and start to grow! Additionally, the seed may travel far from the parent plant depending on the amount of time digestion takes.\nAnother method of animal transport is called passive transport. Some plants like to slyly attach their seeds to our pant legs or to the fur of animals. A species found locally that is guilty of this is called hound’s tongue. When you walk by a hound’s tongue plant, the seed has small hooked fibers, called a burr (similar to Velcro) that attaches to our clothes or to animal fur. Once the human or animal has walked around, the burr will fall off and be dispersed in a new area. One thing to note about hound’s tongue is that it is an invasive species. An invasive species is a species not native to the area that can take up valuable habitat from native species. If you find any hound’s tongue attached to your pants or to your dog, make sure to throw the burrs in the trash to stop the spread of this species.\nWater is another way plants transport their seeds. Plants such as water lilies who grow in water will typically use this method of dispersal. Their seeds have the ability to float. The water will carry the seed until it reaches an area where it can be planted.\nThe last, and most exciting method that seeds are dispersed by is through a method called explosive dispersal. Some species of plants, such as lupine or jewelweed, eject their seeds multiple feet away using gravity. When the seed pod is touched or ripens, the two halves of the seed pod holding the seeds peel back and eject the seeds. This is one of the more entertaining methods of seed dispersal!\nSince plants cannot move, they have to find creative ways of moving their species to new growing locations. As the summer comes to an end, try to catch a glimpse of some of these creative types of seeds on the move!\nRachel Holland is a naturalist intern at Walking Mountains Science Center in Avon, CO.

{"question":"What parallels exist between historical wartime espionage and modern cyber warfare, considering Schindler's intelligence activities and current network attack methods?","answer":"Schindler's pre-war espionage activities for the Abwehr (German military intelligence) and modern cyber warfare share notable similarities. In 1935-1938, Schindler engaged in counterintelligence operations that led to his arrest and death sentence in Czechoslovakia, demonstrating how intelligence gathering could threaten national security. Similarly, modern network attacks involve sophisticated forms of intelligence gathering and infiltration, including packet sniffing (passive surveillance), IP spoofing (identity deception), and DDoS attacks (infrastructure targeting). Just as Schindler used his network of contacts and false identities for intelligence purposes, modern attackers use techniques like masquerading and spoofing to gain unauthorized access. Both contexts highlight the critical importance of authentication and trust verification in protecting sensitive information and infrastructure.","context":["Oskar Schindler, (born April 28, 1908, Svitavy [Zwittau], Moravia, Austria-Hungary [now in the Czech Republic]—died October 9, 1974, Hildesheim, West Germany), German industrialist who, aided by his wife and staff, sheltered approximately 1,100 Jews from the Nazis by employing them in his factories, which supplied the German army during World War II.\nSchindler was the eldest of two children born to a farm machinery manufacturer and his wife. Svitavy, where the family lived, was located in the Sudetenland, and, though the region passed from the Austrian Empire to Czechoslovakia in 1918, the Schindlers were ethnically German. After leaving school in 1924, Schindler sold farm equipment for his father, during which time he met his future wife, Emilie, whom he married in 1928. He took a variety of odd jobs, including running a driving school, before enlisting for a stint in the Czechoslovak army. Schindler then briefly lived in Berlin before returning to Czechoslovakia to start a poultry farm, which he soon abandoned. A self-professed sybarite, he spent much of his time drinking and philandering.\nIn 1935 Schindler joined the pro-Nazi Sudeten German Party (Sudetendeutsche Partei; SdP) and the next year began collecting counterintelligence for the Abwehr, the German military intelligence agency. In 1938 he was arrested by Czechoslovak authorities on charges of espionage and sentenced to death. After the annexation of the Sudetenland by Germany late that year as part of the Munich Agreement, Schindler was pardoned by the Reich and rose through the ranks of the Abwehr. His application for membership in the Nazi Party—thought to have been submitted out of pragmatism rather than ideological affinity—was accepted in 1939. That year, on the heels of the German invasion and occupation of Poland, Schindler journeyed to Kraków, where he became active in the emerging black market. Thanks to the network of German contacts he had arranged through liberal bribes, he secured the lease of a formerly Jewish-owned enamelware factory. He renamed the facility Deutsche Emaillewaren-Fabrik Oskar Schindler (known as Emalia) and commenced production with a small staff. Three months later he had several hundred employees, seven of whom were Jewish. By 1942 nearly half of the workers at the expanded plant were Jewish. (Ostensibly “cheap labour,” Schindler paid their salaries to the SS.)\nIn the fall of that year the Płaszów work camp opened nearby, and by February 1943 it was under the command of the notoriously sadistic SS officer Amon Göth, who would be executed after the war. Capitalizing on the officer’s appetite for drink and other luxury items available mainly on the black market, Schindler cultivated his friendship by ensuring a constant stream of them to the villa from which he oversaw the camp. Schindler thus managed to prevail upon Göth to create a separate camp for his Jewish workers, where they were free of the abuses suffered at Płaszów. Though Schindler’s motivations prior to this point are unclear, many scholars interpret his efforts to extricate his workers from Płaszów as indication that his concern for them was not purely financial.\nWhen in August 1944 his factory was decommissioned, Schindler successfully petitioned to have it moved to Brnĕnec (Brünnlitz) in the Sudetenland, close to his hometown. Schindler and his associates composed a list of Jewish workers that he deemed essential for the new factory and submitted it for approval to the Jewish labour office. (With several versions of the list known, it is difficult to determine how many people were ultimately selected.) Though those chosen were diverted for a time to other concentration camps, Schindler intervened, ensuring that 700 men and 300 women eventually arrived at Brnĕnec. They were later joined by 100 more Jews who had been transported from another concentration camp by the Nazis and abandoned in train cars in Brnĕnec. Those who reached the camp spent the remaining months of the war manufacturing munitions that were rigged to fail. A final head count compiled at this time listed 1,098 Jews at the camp.\nOn May 8, 1945, the war in Europe ended, and the next day Schindler and his wife fled the country with the help of several of the Schindlerjuden, as the Jews he saved came to be known. Schindler was wanted for war crimes in Czechoslovakia due to his earlier espionage activities. In 1949 they settled in Argentina with several of the Jewish families they had saved. Having spent the bulk of his profiteering fortune on bribes, Schindler unsuccessfully attempted to farm. He went bankrupt in 1957 and the next year traveled alone to West Germany, where he made an abortive entry into the cement business. Schindler spent the rest of his life supported by donations from the Schindlerjuden. He was named a Righteous Gentile by Yad Vashem in 1962 and was interred in the Catholic cemetery on Mount Zion in Jerusalem.\nSchindler’s story remained largely the province of Holocaust scholars until the publication in 1982 of Schindler’s Ark, a Booker Prize-winning novelization by Thomas Keneally. The novel, which became a canonical text of Holocaust literature, was later used as the basis for Steven Spielberg’s film Schindler’s List (1993), which starred Liam Neeson as Schindler and Ralph Fiennes as Göth.\nLearn More in these related Britannica articles:\nHolocaust: The extermination campsThe most famous was Oskar Schindler, a Nazi businessman, who had set up operations using involuntary labour in German-occupied Poland in order to profit from the war.

Many individuals also rely on the internet for many of their professional, social, and personal activities. But behind all this utility and excitement, there is a dark side, a side where “bad guys” attempt to wreak havoc in our daily lives by damaging our internet-connected computers, violating our privacy, and rendering inoperable the internet services on which we depend.\nThe field of network security is about how the bad guys can attack computer networks and about how we, soon-to-be experts in computer networking, can defend networks against those attacks, or better yet, design new architectures that are immune to such attacks in the first place. Given the frequency and variety of existing attacks as well as the threat of new and more destructive future attacks, network security has become a central topic in the field of computer networking. One of the features of this course is that it brings network security issues to the forefront.\nSince we don’t yet have expertise in computer networking and internet protocols, we’ll begin here by surveying some of today’s more prevalent security related problems. This will whet our appetite for more substantial discussions in the upcoming modules. So we begin here by simply asking, what can go wrong? How are computer networks vulnerable? What are some of the more prevalent types of attacks today?\nInjecting Malware Into Your Host Through The Internet\nWe attach devices to the internet because we want to receive/send data from/to the internet. This includes all kinds of good stuff, including web pages, e-mail messages, MP3s, telephone calls, live video, search engine results, and so on. But, unfortunately, along with all the good stuff comes malicious stuff-collectively known as malware – that can also enter and infect our devices. Once malware infects our device it can do all kinds of devious things, including deleting our files; installing spyware that collectors our private information, such as social security numbers, passwords, and keystrokes, and then sends this (over the internet of course!) back to the bad guys. Our compromised host may also be enrolled in a network of thousands of similarly compromised devices, collectively known as a botnet , which the bad guys control and leverage for spam e-mail distribution or distributed denial-of-service attacks against targeted hosts.\nMuch of the malware out there today is self-replicating : once it infects one host, from that host it seeks entry into other hosts over the internet , and from the newly infected hosts, it seeks entry into yet more hosts. In this manner, self-replicating malware can spread exponentially fast. Malware can spread in the form of a virus or a worm. Viruses are malware that require some form of user interaction to infect the user’s device. This classic example is an e-mail attachment containing malicious executable code. If a user receivers and opens such an attachment , the user inadvertently runs the malware on the device. Typically, such e-mail viruses are self-replicating : once executed, the virus may send an identical message with an identical malicious attachment to, for example, every recipient in the user’s address book. Worms are malware that can enter a device without any explicit user interaction. For example, a user may be running a vulnerable network application to which an attacker can send malware. In some cases, without any user interaction, the application may accept the malware from the internet and run it creating a worm. The worm in the newly infected device then scans the internet, searching for other hosts running the same vulnerable network application. When it finds other vulnerable hosts, it sends a copy of itself to those hosts. Today, malware, is pervasive and costly to defend against. As you work through this course, we encourage you to think about the following questions: What can computer network designers do to defend internet-attached devices from malware attacks?\nAttacking Servers and Network Infrastructure\nAnother broad class of security threats are known as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. As the name suggest, a DoS attack renders a network, host, or other piece of infrastructure unusable by legitimate users. Web servers, e-mail servers, DNS servers and institutional networks can all be subjected to DoS attacks. Internet DoS attacks are extremely common, with thousands of DoS attacks occurring every year. Most internet DoS attacks fall into one of three categories:\n- Vulnerability attack : This involves sending a few well-crafted messages to a vulnerable application or operating system running on a targeted host. If the right sequence of packets is sent to a vulnerable application or operating system, the service can stop or worse, the host can crash.\n- Bandwidth flooding : The attacker sends a deluge of packets to the targeted host – so many packets that the target’s access link becomes clogged preventing legitimate packets from reaching the server.\n- Connection flooding : The attacker establishes a large number of half-open or fully open TCP connections at the target host. The host can become so bogged down with these bogus connections that it stops accepting legitimate connections.\nLet’s now explore the bandwidth-flooding attack in more detail. Recalling our delay and loss analysis discussion in section 1.4.2, it’s evident that if the server has an access rate of R bps, then the attacker will need to send traffic at a rate of approximately R bps to cause damage. If R is very large, a single attack source may not be able to generate enough traffic to harm the server. Furthermore, if all the traffic emanates from a single source, an upstream router may be able to detect the attack and block all traffic from that source before the traffic gets near the server. In a distributed DoS (DDoS) attack, illustrated in figure 1.25, the attacker controls multiple sources and has each source blast traffic at the target. With this approach, the aggregate traffic rate across all the controlled sources needs to be approximately R to cripple the service. DDoS attacks leveraging botnets with thousands of compromised hosts are a common occurrence today. DDoS attacks are much harder to detect and defend against than a DoS attack from a single host.\nWe encourage you to consider the following question as you work your way through the course: what can computer network designers do to defend against DoS attacks? We will see that different defences are needed for the three types of DoS attacks.\nMany users today access the internet via wireless devices, such as WiFi-connected laptops or handheld devices with cellular internet connections. While ubiquitous internet access is extremely convenient and enables marvellous new applications for mobile users, it also create a major security vulnerability – by placing a passive receiver in the vicinity of the wireless transmitter, that receiver can obtain a copy of every packet that is transmitted! These packets can contain all kinds of sensitive information, including passwords, social security numbers, trade secrets, and private personal messages. A passive receiver that records a copy of every packet that flies by is called a packet sniffer .\nSniffers can be deployed in wired environments as well. In wired broadcast environments, as in many Ethernet LANs, a packet sniffer can obtain copies of broadcast packets sent over the LAN. As described in section 1.2, cable access technologies also broadcast packets and are thus vulnerable to sniffing. Furthermore, a bad guy who gains access to an institution’s access router or access link to the internet may be able to plant a sniffer that makes a cop of every packet going to/from the organization. Sniffed packets can then be analysed offline for sensitive information\nPacket-sniffing software is freely available at various web sites and as commercial products. Professors teaching a networking course have been known to assign lab exercises that involve writing a packet-sniffing and application-layer data reconstruction program.\nBecause packet sniffers are passive – that is, they do not inject packets into the channel – they are difficult to detect. So, when we send packets into a wireless channel, we must accept the possibility that some bad guy may be recording copies of our packets. As you may have guessed, some of the best defences against packet sniffing involve cryptography.\nMasquerading as Someone You Trust\nIt is surprisingly easy (you will have the knowledge to do so shortly as you proceed through this article) to create a packet with an arbitrary source address, packet content, and destination address and then transmit this hand-crafted packet into the internet, which will dutifully forward the packet to its destination. Imagine the unsuspecting receiver (say an internet router) who receives such a packet, takes the (false) source address as being truthful, and then performs some command embedded in the packet’s contents (say modifies its forwarding table). The ability to inject packets into the internet with a false source address is known as IP spoofing, and is but one of many ways in which one user can masquerade as another user.\nTo solve this problem, we will need end-point authentication, that is, mechanism that will allow us to determine with certainty if a message originates from where we think it does. Once again, we encourage you to think about how this can be done for network applications and protocols as you progress through the modules in this course.\nIn closing this section it’s worth considering how the internet got to be such an insecure place in the first place. The answer, in essence, is that the internet was originally designed to be that way, based on the model of “a group of mutually trusting users attached to a transparent network”- a model in which there is no need for security. Many aspects of this original internet architecture deeply reflect this notion of mutual trust. For example, the ability of one user to send a packet to any other user is the default rather than a request/granted capability, and user identity is taken at declared face value, rather than being authenticated by default.\nBut today’s internet certainly does not involve “mutually trusting users.” Nonetheless, today’s users still need to communicate when they don’t necessarily trust each other, may wish to communicate anonymously, may communicate indirectly through third parties and may distrust the hardware, software, and even the air through which they communicate. We now have many security-related challenges before us as we progress through this course: We should seek defences against sniffing, end-point masquerading, man-in-the-middle attacks, DDoS attacks, malware, and more. We should keep in mind that communication among mutually trusted users is the exception rather than the rule.

{"question":"As an architect studying acoustic designs, could you compare the acoustic features of the Inuksuit outdoor performances with those of the Mariinsky II indoor venue?","answer":"The acoustic designs of these venues are quite different. Inuksuit is specifically conceived for outdoor performances where there is no 'best seat in the house' - listeners can move freely to discover individual listening points, with the music gradually expanding to fill the outdoor site. In contrast, the Mariinsky II has carefully engineered indoor acoustics with specific features: an 18000 m3 hall volume, sound-absorbing wooden structures separating the floor from concrete foundations, solid wood balustrades for sound diffusion, and 2-3 meter pieces of concave plaster throughout the auditorium to better disperse sound. The sound in Mariinsky II is described as clear and well-blended, with prominent winds and brasses that don't overwhelm the strings, though it can seem somewhat distant.","context":["“…to act in the capacity of the human”\nJohn Luther Adams is one of the 21st Century’s most important composers. He has written a lot of extraordinary music for chamber ensembles, orchestras, solo instruments and specifically percussion ensembles. Most of his music draws inspiration from the outdoors, especially the landscapes of his home in Alaska where he has lived since 1978. Inuksuit (2009) was premiered at the Banff Centre in the Canadian Rockies of Alberta and received it’s US premiere on the campus of Furman University in South Carolina.\nI am fortunate to be performing the West Coast premiere at the 2012 Ojai Festival under the direction of Steven Schick. Over the past couple of months, I have been building a resource guide for percussionists who will be presenting future performances of Inuksuit. This guide is in no way complete. If you know of other resources, please let me know and I will add the links and resources to the site.\nJohn Luther Adams: The Music of a True Place\nInuksuit, with an introduction from composer John Luther Adams (Furman Concert)\nDoug Perkins Discusses the Individual Parts\nThanks to Dan Savell for letting me know about these videos. Highly recommended!\nNYC Park Avenue Armory’s Performance\nWQXR Interview, JLA, Douglas Perkins and Adam Sliwinski\nProgram Note (From Armory Performance)\nMy music has always been rooted in the earth. For over thirty-five years I’ve composed music inspired by the outdoors, to be heard indoors. After hearing my percussion cycle Strange and Sacred Noise performed in the Anza-Borrego desert, the New England woods, and on the tundra of the Alaska Range, I was moved to create a large-scale work conceived specifically to be performed outdoors.\nInuksuit is inspired by the stone sentinels constructed over the centuries by the Inuit in the windswept expanses of the Arctic. The Inuktitut word translates literally: “to act in the capacity of the human”. This work is haunted by the vision of the melting of the polar ice, the rising of the seas, and what may remain of humanity’s presence after the waters recede. How does where we are define what we do and who we are? How do we understand the brevity of our human presence in the immensity of geologic time? What does it mean to act creatively with and within our environment? The musicians of Inuksuit are dispersed over a large area. Listeners, too, are invited to move around freely and discover their own individual listening points. There is no preferred listening point, no “best seat in the house”. Rather, every listening point is potentially the best seat. You may choose to root yourself in a central location for the entire performance, listening as the music gradually expands to fill the site. Or you may choose to wander freely, following wherever your ears may lead you, discovering musical moments and spaces that no other listener may ever hear.\nInuksuit has been performed at the Banff Centre in the Canadian Rockies, on the campus of Furman University in South Carolina, and at the Round Top Festival in Texas. This performance at Park Avenue Armory, the first ever to be presented indoors, features seventy-two percussionists— fifty-four in the drill hall and eighteen in the smaller rooms on the west end of the building. Microphones located around the exterior bring the sounds of the surrounding streets into the space, turning the Armory inside out, as Inuksuit becomes part of the never-ending music of this singular city. —John Luther Adams\nOriginally posted on DrumChattr.com on June 4, 2012.\nThe photo in this post is used under the Creative Commons License: Attribution – NonCommercial – ShareAlike 2.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0) by thewoodenshoes’ on Flickr.com.\nYou must log in to post a comment.","We all hope that the opening of the Mariinsky II will once again confirm and strengthen the great traditions of our theatre, opening the path to a future where it will be possible to stage the most contemporary works and innovative productions, productions of which we could not even have dreamed before.\nThe repertoire of Mariinsky II aims to demonstrate the supreme art of the performers in our companies and our wonderful stage, linking the history of the Mariinsky Theatre with contemporary audiences and with contemporary works from the diverse genres of opera, ballet and symphonic music.\nThe artistic opportunities available to the whole theatre – the opera and ballet companies, chorus and orchestra – will expand exponentially. After all, the Mariinsky II, the historic building and the Concert Hall together form a unique cultural complex. The new building with its main stage equipped with the very latest technology, and its three chamber venues, will create the most amazing conditions in which to bring to life daring artistic ideas and educational projects as well as chamber vocal and instrumental programmes.\nWe will be able to expand our audience base to tens of thousands, and millions more people will be able to see broadcasts of performances and concerts across Russia’s regions and throughout the world. We will be broadcasting special programmes for schools, libraries and cultural centres throughout the country, reaching the most far-flung corners. These broadcast projects are aimed, first and foremost, at children and young people.\nThe new theatre opens up new and incredible possibilities for us all. I truly believe that.\nValery Gergiev, Artistic and General Director of the Mariinsky Theatre\nThe Mariinsky II in the world press:\nMariinsky II is a good thing. With its 2,000 seats and carefully engineered acoustics, the theatre offers impressive technical flexibility. (The Economist)\nThe auditorium is excellent: like Glyndebourne’s bigger brother, with light wood balconies, fine acoustics and superb sightlines. Backstage the theatre is a city in itself: linked by various passages, the stages, workshops and rehearsal rooms accommodate the entire staff of the Mariinsky (2500 people) with ease. Here it is possible to work on five productions at the same time or with the click of a mouse bring huge sets onstage. (The Times)\nThe prime mover behind St Petersburg’s shiny new opera house, Mariinsky II, had put his fabled drive and energy to the test by conducting five shows in three days. Thursday’s exhausting opening gala was well chosen and brilliantly played, sung and danced. The brisk, brilliant two-hour tour de force was the perfect calling card for the new venue but turned out to be just a warm-up for a three-day musical marathon. (The Telegraph)\nWithin the airy interior are beige marble and Swarovski crystal lights, with backlit walls of translucent onyx and picture windows affording city views (...) The auditorium is a magnificent horseshoe creation of beech and oak, with scalloped ceiling and slatted box fronts edged with crystal to leaven the solidity of the whole. (The Telegraph)\nThe new theater, while generic from the street, has a restrained glamour in its public spaces, dominated by the glowing onyx exterior wall of the auditorium. Inside the mood is coolly elegant, the theater’s blond wood far simpler than the opulent old Mariinsky without seeming plain.\nIt seems to have, as Mr. Gergiev predicted before the opening, acoustics that are more platinum in color than the warm, immediate gold of the old house. The sound in Mariinsky II can seem a bit distant, but it is clear and well blended, with prominent winds and brasses that manage not to swamp the strings. (The New York Times)\nMariinsky II Fact Sheet\nThe building, covering 79114 m2, is one of the largest theatre and concert venues in the world. The auditorium seats up to 2000 people at full capacity. There new theatre has seven storeys above ground and three below. There is the main stage, a rehearsal stage and backstage premises; rehearsal rooms for the ballet company, the opera company and the orchestra; premises for 1000 various members of staff; chamber venues and premises in the foyer which house educational projects for children and young people; a rooftop amphitheatre which is to be a venue for the Stars of the White Nights festival; and underground car parking for staff.\nAlongside the historic building of the Mariinsky Theatre, built in 1860, and the Concert Hall which opened in 2006, the Mariinsky II forms part of this theatre and concert complex, unique in its artistic and educational capabilities. This complex reiterated the status of the Mariinsky Theatre as one of the world’s most important cultural institutions.\nThe exterior of the building is made of beige Jura limestone, interspersed with syncopated floor-to-ceiling windows of various sizes, and a metal roof. These windows will afford, from outside, a view of the theatre’s inner foyer and, from the inside, of the Kryukov canal. A glass and steel canopy extends over the main entrance to the theatre (the corner of Dekabristov St and the Kryukov Canal).\nThe main foyer, with its two levels, features rear-lit onyx stone walls that surround the auditorium and Emperador marble floors. Jura beige limestone walls frame the various windows that look onto Dekabristov Street and the Kryukov canal. Thanks to the surrounding glass façade, the foyer will be illuminated during the day by an abundance of natural light. For evening performances, custom-designed Swarovski chandeliers will illuminate the space. The main foyer provides unique views of the Mariinsky Theatre across the canal.\nPublic areas have been designed as an integral and complementary component of the building and create a sense of dramatic arrival and fluid movement. A variety of staircases thread through the foyer, including a dramatic 33-metre architectural glass staircase that traverses the north side of the foyer, connecting every above-ground level of the building. The foyer is split into several individual spaces of various sizes.\nThe lobby amphitheatre, located on the 3rd floor, will serve as an additional space for educational projects, interactive programmes for children and young people, chamber music concerts and artistic exhibitions.\nWhile the auditorium is a contemporary hall, its principles are those of famous 18th and 19th century opera houses, with a horseshoe shape and three balcony levels. This configuration has proved to be ideal for intimacy, acoustics, sightlines, audience comfort and overall cohesion of the hall.\nThe sculptured beech balcony fronts are shaped by acoustical demands. The use of three balconies instead of four allows for more height between levels and creates better sound dispersion, especially for the rows located farther back.\nThe production lighting meets the latest demands of artistic productions while Swarovski accent lights are studded in the balcony fronts and are designed to give sparkle to the hall, as small candelabras once did in old theatres.\nCarefully selected with acoustic considerations in mind, the floors of the auditorium are oak parquet on a wooden substructure with gypsum perimeter walls and ceilings.\nAuditorium seats are fabricated by Estel Group in Italy. The fabric was manufactured by Danish Art Weaving.\nThe VIP box contains beech wood balcony fronts, leather walls and a Swarovski chandelier.\nThe new hall will have a main stage and a rehearsal stage, along with ample supporting areas divided by acoustic doors and curtains. The three stage areas can merge to become a single stage or be used independently, depending on the scale and technical requirements of the performance.\nThe stage machinery selected for the new theatre means that it will be utterly unique. The theatre can offer an essentially endless series of performances, rehearsals and installations of productions. The stage machinery has been designed and installed specifically to ensure this endless working process as well as the greatest possible functionality.\nWhen developing the concept of the stage space, the most exemplary contemporary analogies were used, as have been the best practices of recently built or recently renovated theatres throughout the world. The reconstruction practices and greatest technical solutions at London’s Royal Opera House, Copenhagen’s Royal Opera, Paris’ Théâtre du Châtelet and many other theatres have been employed.\nThe stage space has been broken down into individual zones, each of which fulfils its own strictly defined function. This includes the main stage, backstage, the side pockets, the rehearsal stage, the installation zone and the loading and unloading zone with its component assembly area. This division of space makes it possible to have the sets for at least four productions in the stage area at the same time. Moreover, at the same time, the main stage can be hosting the most technically demanding production in terms of sets, the rehearsal stage a full-scale rehearsal, the sets for the next performance can be assembled in the installation zone and other sets loaded or unloaded in the cargo dock.\nThe stage is equipped with a system of rolling platforms and compensators, rising and falling platforms and fixed point hoists. All machinery elements are automated and are used via a control panel. This means the theatre will be able to host incredibly bold productions and the company will be able to work without any technical limitations whatsoever.\nThe orchestra pit is equipped with a moveable acoustic wall developed to allow for varying orchestral and acoustic needs. At full capacity, the pit is 170 m2 and holds up to 120 musicians.\nThe pit is also equipped with three platforms: a smaller one in the rear and two larger ones in the front. These can be raised or lowered to different levels depending on the instrumentation and the desired sound.\nThe Mariinsky II has been designed to create ideal acoustic conditions. At about 18000 m3, the hall has an ideal volume and is comparable to the world’s most renowned opera houses.\nThe auditorium’s floor is separated from the concrete foundations by sound-absorbing wooden structures.\nSolid wood balustrades arranged in an overlapping sequence with embedded light fixtures are located throughout the auditorium to aid sound diffusion.\nUniquely designed 2 to 3 metre pieces of concave plaster have also been installed throughout the auditorium to disperse sound the sound better.\nThe modulated surfaces of these inclined wall claddings are a modern-day version of the decorative elements found in historic opera houses to improve acoustics.\nThe new theatre incorporates numerous spacious rehearsal areas, including ones for the ballet company, the orchestra and chorus as well as large multifunctional rehearsal rooms and additional individual rehearsal rooms. Rehearsal room walls and ceilings are clad in special veneered and sound-absorbing panels.\nDuring summer, starting one hour before performances commence, it is possible to visit the roof terrace of the Mariinsky-II, from which patrons may see beautiful panoramic views of the historic centre of St Petersburg. Excursion tickets are available at the box-office of the Mariinsky-II or from the duty administrator one hour before the start of a performance on presentation of a valid ticket for that performance."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1b3be39a-a159-45eb-ab68-33e02f62df5b>","<urn:uuid:d4ef553d-977a-40aa-ad4a-b13e4f3f224e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a nature photographer, I'm curious about native plants and their seeds - how do they spread 自然传播, and what risks do non-native species pose to local ecosystems?","answer":"Native plant seeds spread through multiple mechanisms: some float on wind (like maple trees and asters), some have hooks to attach to clothes/fur (like burdock), some explode from pods (like wild petunia shooting seeds up to 10 feet), and some are spread through animal droppings after eating fruits (like oak acorns and dogwood). However, when non-native species are introduced to ecosystems, they can pose severe risks. They often reproduce rapidly, have few natural predators, and can outcompete native species for resources. This disrupts natural communities, food chains, and can lead to extinction of native species. According to estimates, 42% of threatened species are at risk due to invasive species, making them the second biggest threat to biodiversity after habitat loss.","context":["How are native plant seeds spread? Do they parachute on the wind, hitchhike on clothes or fur, or explode like a cannonball?\nAll of the Above!\nSome seeds are light and float on the wind. Examples of plants around the pond with these types of seeds are maple trees, swamp milkweed, New England asters, goldenrods, and prairie smoke.\nSome seeds are sticky, or have hooks and barbs which attach to people’s clothes, an animal’s fur or a bird's feather. The burrs you pick up on your clothes after a walk in the woods are an example. None of the plants deliberately placed around the pond have this type of seed. This type of seed is more common in weedy types of plants, some of which may find their way to the pond area. Examples of plants with these types of seeds are burdock and teasel.\nSome plants form seeds and then the seed pod “explodes”, sending out the seeds. Wild petunia and wild geranium are examples of plants with this type of seed. Wild petunias can shoot seeds up to ten feet from the plant.\nIn addition, some seeds are contained in fruits which are eaten by birds or other animals. The seeds pass through the bird or animal, and are deposited in droppings some distance away from the parent plants. Examples of plants around the pond with these types of seeds are swamp white oaks (squirrels eat the acorns, or bury them), pasture roses, gray dogwoods, and pagoda dogwoods.\nHow do the plants and wildlife found in this wetland interact and support each other?\nSome insects and wildlife use plants as their home, or use parts of plants to create their shelter (birds use dried parts of plants to make their nests; beavers take down trees to build their lodges; some birds will use the hollow in a tree for shelter)\nPlants create oxygen through photosynthesis, which animals and insects need to breathe.\nInsects spread pollen from plant to plant, enabling the plants to reproduce.\nSome animals help spread the seeds of plants by eating fruits and dropping the seeds elsewhere, or when sticky seeds stick to their fur and drop off somewhere away from the original plant.\nSome animals break open the seeds of plants, so they can germinate.\nThe leaves of some plants are shaped to hold water, which allows birds, butterflies, dragonflies, insects and animals to obtain a drink.\nPlants filter storm water, cleaning it before it is used by wildlife.\nPlants clean the air by absorbing pollutants, making the air cleaner for animals and other wildlife.\nPlants at the water’s edge help hold the soil in place, making the water cleaner for fish and wildlife that use the water.\nPlants at the water’s edge provide cover for fish from predators, and a place to lay their eggs.\nWhat types of plants and wildlife do you see in this wetland?\nView the complete Plant List (PDF) showing all plants around the pond, including Latin names\nNew England aster\nDragonflies: Black saddlebags, blue dasher, common green darner, common whitetail, dot-tailed whiteface, Halloween pennant, twelve-spot skimmer\nDamselflies: Eastern forktail, familiar bluet\nButterflies: Cabbage white, Monarch\nHydroporous water beetle\nBirds: American goldfinch, American robin, great blue heron, mallard ducks, redwing blackbird, sparrows, white egret\nWash your car at a commercial car wash instead of on your driveway, to save water and keep soap from going down the storm drains and into our streams OR be sure to use biodegradable or marine-safe cleaning products to wash your car, and wash it on your lawn so the water is filtered by the grass before it goes to the streams.\nHave a swimming pool? Make sure there is no chlorine left in the water before emptying the pool.\nPlant native plants in your garden. They need less water, are drought tolerant and can soak up large amounts of storm water, protecting our important native pollinating insects.","Invasive species pose a severe risk to the natural environment. They can cause significant harm and devastate ecosystems, resulting in substantial economic impacts.\nAccording to the World Conversation Union, invasive species are the second most significant threat to biodiversity after habitat loss. Approximately 42% of threatened or endangered species are at risk because of invasive species.\nThe following article will explore invasive species in more detail and unpack why they are dangerous to the environment.\nWhat are Invasive Species?\nAn invasive species is an animal or plant organism that has the potential to cause ecological or economic harm in a new region or environment where it is not native and does not belong.\nWith that said, not all non-native species are invasive. For example, most food crops grown in the United States, such as wheat and rice, are not native to the region.\nThere are specific characteristics that make a species invasive.\nTo be invasive, a species must easily adapt to its new region or environment, reproduce quickly and harm property, the economy, or native plants and animals.\nIn their new ecosystem and environment, invasive species often become predators, competitors, parasites, hybridizers, and diseases to native plants and animals.\nHence, they are difficult to control and contain because they are free of predation and disease, two of the significant factors that keep native plant and animal populations in balance.\nInvasive species can completely disrupt the food chain, related ecosystems, and the natural environment.\nCommon characteristics of invasive species include:\n- High reproduction rate\n- Rapid growth and maturity\n- High dispersal ability\n- Few natural predators\n- Ability to thrive in distinct habitat types and climate regions\n- Ability to out-compete native species\n- High cost to remove or control\nWhy are Invasive Species Dangerous to the Environment?\nInvasive species are dangerous to the environment. They represent one of the most potent, persistent, and widespread threats to the natural environment.\nInvasive species can harm natural resources (fish, wildlife, plants, and ecosystem health) because they disrupt natural communities and ecological processes and threaten human use of resources. This can cause substantial economic impacts and the distribution of ecosystems.\nFor example, if an invasive plant species is introduced, this can lead to several problems for existing crops.\nInvasive plant species can introduce new diseases and attract new crop pests, which can cause a reduction in crop yields and require an increased need for pesticides. Invasive plants can interfere with regeneration and growth.\nThis can cause serious harm to native species within that ecosystem because they are suddenly competing with new species for the same resources (food, water, shelter). Invasive species typically thrive under these conditions because they have no predators, unlike native species, to help maintain the population.\nWhen invasive species are introduced, the ecosystem often becomes much less diverse. A less diverse ecosystem is far more susceptible to further disturbances like diseases, climate change, and natural disasters.\nOnce an invasive species become established in its new environment, it becomes very costly and challenging to eradicate. This can lead to irreversible impacts on the local ecosystem.\nInvasive species have a range of impacts that affect the environment, society and economy, and biodiversity.\nInvasive species can cause immense damage to the natural environment.\nEnvironment impacts can:\n- Leading to the extinction of native species (plants and animals)\n- Negatively impact biodiversity\n- Permanently alter habitats\n- Lead to native species competing for limited resources\n- Cause species extirpation\n- Cause soil degradation and erosion\n- Alter fire cycles\n- Displace native plant communities\n- Disrupt the food chain\n- Destroy the quality understory habitat in forests\n- Decrease the quality and amount of range for wildlife\n- Introduce parasites\nInvasive species can potentially be a significant threat to the income and livelihood of the local people. They can also impact human health.\nSocial impacts can:\n- Cause disease\n- Cause human or animal suffering\n- Reduce land and water recreational opportunities\n- Lead to reduced income\n- Increase food insecurity\n- Pose a risk to human and animal health\n- Increase social challenges\n- Reduced water quality and quantity\n- Loss of traditional food and medicinal plants\n- Export and import trade restrictions imposed\nInvasive species affect the economy in several ways, such as agriculture, forestry, and fishing. According to Environment and Climate Change Canada, the estimated annual cumulative lost revenue caused by just 16 invasive species is between $13 and $35 billion dollars.\nEconomic impacts can:\n- Lead to a higher cost of controlling and managing pests, weeds, and diseases\n- Reduce productivity in forestry, agriculture, and fishing\n- Cause export and import trade restrictions\n- Reduce land and property values\n- Lower crop productivity\n- Harm livestock\n- Degrade soil quality\nWhy are Invasive Species Introduced?\nMany invasive species are introduced into their new environment by accident. However, that is only sometimes the case, as some species are purposefully introduced.\nThe accidental introduction of invasive species usually occurs through ship ballast water, recreational boaters moving between bodies of water or pets that escape or are released into the wild.\nMost of the time, invasive species are introduced on purpose as a form of pest control, while other times, they are brought in as pets and are accidentally released, or plants are brought in for decorative purposes (e.g. in a garden).\nWhen invasive species are introduced intentionally, the ramifications are not considered or anticipated. It is hard, even for scientists, to know how a species will adapt to a new environment.\nExample of Accidental Introduction\nZebra mussels are an invasive species that are native to freshwater environments in Eurasia. In the Great Lakes of North America, Zebra mussels are now considered an invasive species. In their new environment, they filter out algae that native species need for food and attach to and incapacitate native mussels.\nThey essentially out-compete with other filter feeders and starve them. Zebra mussels were accidentally introduced to North America via ships that traveled between the two regions.\nExample of Purposeful Introduction\nIn 1949, five cats were brought to Marion Island (South Africa) in the Indian Ocean as a form of pest control. The idea was that the cats would help control the mice population. However, by 1977 over 3,400 cats were living on the island. Since cats hunt more than just mice, the local bird population was at risk.\nHow do Invasive Species Spread?\nInvasive species are most commonly spread through the movement of people. More than ever, especially because of globalization, people and goods travel worldwide at a high rate, and occasionally they pick up uninvited guests along the way.\nInvasive species can enter a ship’s ballast water or attach themselves to the propellers of a smaller boat.\nAnother way invasive species spread is through equipment used at different sites in various regions.\nClimate change will also enable invasive species, predominantly plants, to move into new areas.\nHow Can You Help?\nIt may not seem like it, but there are a few simple ways to help combat invasive species at an individual level.\nVolunteer at your local park, refuge, or other wildlife areas to help identify and remove invasive species. This is also an excellent opportunity to learn and educate others about the risks associated with invasive species and how to stop the spread of invasive species.\nPurchase plants and flowers for your home or garden that are not invasive. An even better environmental decision would be to buy plants that are native to your region.\nNever release pets or non-native species into the wild. If you own an exotic or non-native pet, take measures to prevent an accidental escape.\nWays to Prevent the Spread of Invasive Species:\n- Clean your hiking and fishing gear when moving between regions and bodies of water\n- Don’t move firewood between ecosystems\n- Fish using native bait\n- Clean your boat thoroughly before changing bodies of water\n- Don’t take animals, plants, shells, or food from different ecosystems\n- If you see something unusual, report it\n- Check your pet’s paws\nGovernments and conservation authorities are working diligently to educate the public about invasive species to prevent the accidental transportation or introduction of new species.\nHave you ever wondered why border agents and customs officers are so strict about plants, fruits, and meats at the airport? Invasive species are one of the main reasons.\nGovernments want to prevent any introduction of new species, seeds, plants, or related diseases as they pose a massive threat to the environment, society, and economy.\nGiven the potential impact, environmental groups and government agencies are concerned about the harm that is being done by invasive species.\nDid you find this article helpful?

{"question":"I've been diagnosed with hemolytic anemia as a premature infant - how does vitamin E supplementation help with this condition?","answer":"Studies show that vitamin E supplementation can help treat hemolytic anemia in premature babies. In this condition, red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be produced, leading to many immature red blood cells. Treatment with supplemental vitamin E can help overcome some degree of anemia and reduce the immature red blood cell count.","context":["Health Problems And Diseases Caused By Vitamin E Deficiency\nHealth Complications Caused By Vitamin E Deficiency\nA vitamin E deficiency, though rare in developed countries, may result from malnutrition or fat malabsorption. Health issues associated with it include neurological problems, muscle weakness, and bone abnormalities. Peripheral neuropathy, hemolytic anemia, eye problems and gastrointestinal problems are also a possibility. So are disorders like ataxia and abetalipoproteinemia.\nVitamin E includes a group of eight fat-soluble nutrients – four tocopherols and four tocotrienols – that occur naturally in many plant foods and are added to some fortified foods. While all the nutrients are biologically active, the human body largely utilizes and retains the alpha-tocopherol version of vitamin E.\nVitamin E features prominently in the arsenal of vitamins your body counts on to stay healthy. This wonder vitamin has a critical role to play in nerve, muscle, and immune function. It also has antioxidant properties that help protect the body from damage caused by free radicals. To ply your body with enough vitamin E, most adults require 15 mg of vitamin E daily as per the recommended daily allowances (RDA) suggested by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB). Nursing mothers need around 19 mg a day.1 And considering the vital role vitamin E plays, a deficiency of this vitamin can indeed throw the body out of whack.\nSevere vitamin E deficiency is usually rare, especially in developed nations, but may happen as a result of malnutrition. Vitamin E also requires some amount of fat for efficient absorption and transportation, so a diet with minimal fat intake can also be a trigger. Non-dietary deficiency is usually connected with health conditions that hamper digestion and absorption of fat. Conditions like liver or gallbladder disorders, pancreatitis, and cystic fibrosis can, for instance, lead to fat malabsorption.2 Newborn babies, especially premature babies, may also be prone to vitamin E deficiency since only small quantities of vitamin E can cross the placenta. The risk slowly decreases as babies start getting enough vitamin E from milk. Growing children (even the picky eaters) and adults, on the other hand, are rarely vulnerable to vitamin E deficiency since they can store large quantities in fat tissue. Even with a deficiency because of fat malabsorption problems, the effects are more pronounced among infants than in adults.3 But if your body is deprived of vitamin E, it can translate to many health problems, some quite critical. Here’s what you need to watch out for.\n1. Weakened Immunity\nGet your fill of vitamin E every day! Some of the best sources of vitamin E are oils such as sunflower, safflower, canola, and wheat germ; nuts such as almonds, peanuts, and hazelnuts; and seeds such as sunflower seeds. Green vegetables such as broccoli, collard greens, and spinach are good sources too. Some foods such as fruit juices, breakfast cereals, spreads, and margarine are often vitamin E fortified.4 5\nYour immune system needs a healthy dose of vitamin E to function efficiently. It is present in cellular membranes and body tissues of all cells. A deficiency, in turn, results in a weakened immune system, leading to frequent infections and illnesses. From colds and cough to other respiratory illnesses and urinary infections, this can manifest in different ways. A vitamin E-rich diet and vitamin E supplementation are known to improve disease resistance and also address the problem of decreased immunity observed in vulnerable groups like the aged or whose immunity is impaired, for instance, those with AIDS.6 7\n2. Gastrointestinal Issues\nAlthough individuals with Crohn’s disease are known to have low amounts of vitamin E, there is no established direct connection between vitamin E deficiency and Crohn’s disease. The condition is most likely linked to fat malabsorption seen in people with Crohn’s.8\nWhen linked to poor fat absorption, severe vitamin E deficiency can often cause gastrointestinal problems like diarrhea, vomiting, swollen abdomen, and bulky foul-smelling stools. Infants are especially prone and may, consequently, not gain weight or grow as expected.9 10\n3. Muscle Wasting\nAnimal studies show that vitamin E deficiency can also affect skin health, leading to problems with collagen metabolism and wound healing and causing skin ulceration. Human studies are needed to confirm this link and the exact cause for it, though.11\nMuscle wasting is another repercussion of severe vitamin E deficiency. Studies show that without vitamin E, a torn cell membrane cannot heal properly. And since muscle cell membranes can tear just from normal use, not healing can be a problem. Muscle cells that are not repaired for long periods of time can lead to muscle wasting. Physical trauma of any kind, muscular dystrophy, or muscle weakness because of diabetes are conditions that cause muscle cell damage. Vitamin E deficiency is also evident in the frailty syndrome seen in the elderly, making them weak and unsteady on their feet.12\n4. Eye Problems\nVitamin E protects the eyes from free radicals that damage healthy eye tissue. Unmitigated free radical damage can increase your risk of age-related macular degeneration and cataract formation. Which is what happens if you suffer from vitamin E deficiency. A deficiency can also weaken eye muscles and lead to involuntary eye movements.13\n5. Hemolytic Anemia\nVitamin E is essential for the development of the nervous system and any deficiency can have adverse effects on it, especially among babies and children. Among children with low levels of vitamin E at birth, irreversible neurologic symptoms are not uncommon.14 Coordination issues and impaired reflexes are two common repercussions of vitamin E deficiency.\nPremature babies who are deficient in vitamin E often grapple with hemolytic anemia, which is a disorder that causes red blood cells to be destroyed faster than they can be produced. The bone marrow unsuccessfully tries to replace the lost cells, leading to a lot of immature red blood cells. Studies show that infants treated with supplemental vitamin E can overcome some degree of anemia and also bring down the immature red blood cell count.15 16\n6. Peripheral Neuropathy\nVitamin E deficiency can cause damage to muscles and nerves, leading to loss of feeling in the arms and legs and sensations such as burning, numbness, or tingling. Studies confirm that low amounts of nerve tocopherol can cause nerve injury. Timely introduction of vitamin E therapy may help reverse or at least arrest the neuropathy.17 18 19\n7. Spinocerebellar Ataxia\nProlonged and severe deficiency of vitamin E can lead to spinocerebellar ataxia or spinocerebellar degeneration of structures in the brain. The spinal cord and the cerebellum degenerate if you have this condition. Since the cerebellum controls voluntary movements, any degeneration causes loss of muscle coordination.20\nSuch complications show up anytime between 2 and 20 years of age and affect coordination and control of voluntary movements. Other symptoms of ataxia are muscle weakness, tremors and tics, speaking difficulties, and slower reflexes. In some cases, there are physical and mental developmental delays too. Early vitamin E therapy has been found to delay, and sometimes even prevent, the development of some of these neurological problems.2122 23\nAbetalipoproteinemia or Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that hampers fat absorption by the intestine and fat transportation by the liver. This leads to the deficiency of essential vitamins and lipids, vitamin E deficiency being one. The signs and symptoms of ABL mirror those of vitamin E deficiency. They include progressive neurological deterioration, hemolytic anemia, muscle weakness, and sometimes degeneration of the retina of the eyes. This is a strange cycle. While ABL is one of the causes of vitamin E deficiency, it is also one of the results of vitamin E deficiency.\nABL often begins in infancy. The chances of recovery from ABL, are more often than not, rather poor. Treatment involves high doses of vitamin E supplemented by dietary fat and other fat-soluble vitamins.24 25\n9. Skeletal Abnormalities\nWhile not directly linked to a vitamin E deficiency, in health conditions like cystic fibrosis, chronic cholestasis, and Peyronie’s disease, supplementation with vitamin E has been seen to bring relief to patients. On the other hand, the connection between vitamin E and conditions like heart disease or Alzheimer’s disease, though speculated widely, is at best tenuous.\nTests have shown that patients with ataxia, liver problems like ABL, and low vitamin E levels may develop skeletal abnormalities. Muscle imbalances during bone development may cause skeletal abnormalities such as clubfoot, backward or sideways curvature of the spine, or a highly arched foot. All of these can cause problems with walking or even standing.26 27\nThe bottom line? Get your vitamin E from a wide variety of food sources and you should be fine. If you suspect a deficiency, talk to a doctor about appropriate supplementation. It is possible to have side effects, some severe, from excessive doses so steer clear of self-medicating.\nReferences [ + ]\n|1.||↑||Vitamin E.

{"question":"Which features differ between Wakelet and HTML5 Video Player when managing educational videos - customization options vs SEO capabilities?","answer":"Wakelet is primarily a content curation tool that allows direct linking from YouTube, Twitter, Flipgrid and other platforms, with the ability to embed guides on school websites for sharing. Meanwhile, HTML5 Video Player offers SEO-focused features including support for custom video titles and descriptions, as well as meta data output to help videos get properly indexed by search engines. The HTML5 Video Player also provides additional customization through player size control, skins, loop settings, and video player templates while maintaining compatibility across major browsers.","context":["Tech tools and tips librarians can’t live without\nCreative and fun ways to use Clubhouse, Flipgrid, Green Screen and other tools with students and teachers.\nSLJ montage using app icons and artwork from Getty Images\nLouisiana teaching librarian Amanda Jones pulls out a tech tip to get families to visit the Live Oak Middle School library during her school’s open house. She creates photos with Green Screen by Do Ink. The photo of students with their families includes their names, school name and year. Jones then directs families to the library’s Facebook and Instagram accounts, where they can find their photos to upload.\nJones’ image project not only introduces families to the library, but also familiarizes them with school technology and gives them an ongoing connection to the library through social media.\n“School libraries should be places of innovation,” says Jones. “It is worth investing our time in teaching our students the latest edtech tools and the responsible use of these tools. A school library program should include a balance between promoting the enjoyment of reading and collaborative lessons using the best edtech tools available.\nSo what are the best tools for librarians today, and how are they using them? We asked a few tech-savvy librarians to share the tools everyone needs to know.\nThe tools librarians use the most fall into four main categories: content curation, design, increased engagement, and collaboration support. Wakelet is everyone’s favorite tool for resource conservation, according to the FLS short poll, with Padlet a close second. canvas and Twitter followed closely as tools librarians use most often.\nWakelet and Padlet digital curation charts are gaining popularity as tools for library resource guides, whether for parents, teachers, or students. Links can be added directly from YouTube, Twitter, Flipgrid or other platforms, and guides can be easily embedded on the school website for sharing.\nThe canvas is the design tool that many turn to when it’s time to promote the book fair or announce new books. It is also useful in tandem with other tools. Jones uses it to make his Instagram posts livelier or design headers for Google Classroom or Wakelets.\nKC Boyd, Library Media Specialist at Jefferson Middle School Academy in Washington, DC, has students use Canva to create their own celebrity “Read” promotional posters. “My students are also celebrities, so I put their posters on Twitter, and the kids are going crazy,” Boyd explains.\nFlipgrid is another longtime favorite that librarians can’t live without.\n“I use [Flipgrid] in various ways with my elementary students,” says Lauree Moore, Media Specialist at Earhart Environmental Magnet Elementary School in Wichita, KS. “They create lesson reflections, chat and respond to each other, connect with other schools, make videos for their teachers, review books and discuss favorites, make book recommendations, identify facts about topics , teach each other about topics they’ve become an expert on, and more.\nIt’s no secret that school librarians have a great social media presence to connect with the wider school community and promote their libraries. Overall, Twitter was the most mentioned platform in the survey, with active librarian communities on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Clubhouse.\nTexas College Librarian Media Specialist Karina Quilantán-Garza, also known online as Cue the Librarian, suggests librarians take social media inspiration from Librarian of Congress (LOC) Dr. Carla Hayden. When Hayden Live-Tweeted the Musical hamiltonevery few minutes she posted a main LOC resource related to something in the musical.\nQuilantán-Garza adds that librarians don’t need to master the latest tool to have an impact; it is more important that they know how to use it well. “Try to master one tool at a time before picking up another,” she says. “Just because it’s popular doesn’t mean you have to use it. Everyone’s libraries are different.\nTo connect with each other, librarians are also turning to social media. Clubhouse, Twitter and Facebook are favorites. Boyd hosts his show “Boss Librarian” on Clubhouse. This audio social networking app allows people to host real-time group conversations.\n“If you want to stay up to date with what’s happening in the field and connect with people who are doing dynamite work in their field, [social media] that’s where they hang out,” Boyd said.\nHannah Fjeld, Library Media Specialist at Neshobe School in Brandon, VT, wishes there was a better tool to help elementary students understand information literacy. She was among the 40% of respondents who want to find better tools for finding and reading information to help teach these life skills.\nFor news literacy, Quilantán-Garza recommends Pear Deck’s Be Internet Awesome, which offers interactive courses in English and Spanish. Resources has a library of lesson plans and templates that provide scenarios and activities.\nPennsylvania librarian Beth Cohen uses Nearpod’s Time to Climb feature with her ninth and tenth graders to assess their understanding before and after a lesson. She also asks students to respond to specific scenarios on a whiteboard or asks them to vote on whether a social media post or news story is real.\n“I’ve found that they’re much more willing to share their use of technology and their opinions about online content when they can do so anonymously,” she says.\nBoyd recommends the News Literacy Project’s (NLP) Checkology site, which provides real-world examples of social media and news resources to help students understand what’s right and wrong. Boyd, an ambassador for NLP News Literacy, also enjoys the weekly NLP Sift newsletter as a real-time tool that offers examples, lessons, and discussion questions on hot topics. NLP also has an app, Informable, and a podcast, Is it a fact?\nJones uses Do Ink for creative spaces, video making, podcasting, photo projects, and student lectures. Since Do Ink can include images from up to three different sources, Jones uses a template created in Canva and records the children’s book discussions in front of a green screen. Then she uses Do Ink to add images of the book and the author in the background. For students who are reluctant to share their poetry with others, she hosts a sock puppet poetry cafe. The children use the sock puppets in front of the green screen, with Do Ink in the background.\nScreencastify is a useful tool for creating videos with students who need a little help with presentations, says Amanda Hunt, library media specialist at Oak Run Middle School in New Braunfels, TX. Screencastify allows students to record, edit and share; it also allows users to manipulate the screen while talking. Students can then pitch projects without the pressure of in-person public speaking. For students who prefer podcasting, Streamyard allows users to record or live stream to Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or other platforms.\nHunt also loves Mote, a Chrome app or extension that lets him embed voice feedback for students into Word documents, Google Forms, or spreadsheets.\n“In our digital world, characters get a bit lost in translation,” she says. “Children don’t always receive humor or sarcasm when writing. When they hear me say exactly what I want them to do, they’re able to make those adjustments a little easier with that voice ability.\nFor librarians looking for tools to make learning more fun and engaging, Hunt suggests Edpuzzle. Educators can create their own videos or embed videos from Khan Academy, YouTube, or other resources, making this a great resource for flipped teaching.\nQuilantán-Garza students are very interested in esports, organized multiplayer video game competitions. Minecraft for education is another favorite. A well-established gaming community provides a sense of belonging to many of its students.\nWhile school libraries are often technology hubs in schools, the benefits will go far beyond the library, Boyd says.\n“As librarians, we need to be in the driver’s seat in our school to support innovation,” she says. “It’s going to take time out of all of our schedules to learn and master these apps so kids and teachers can be ready to use them. The big picture is that I have a more informed school community thanks to the information I have passed on to them. Get on board and don’t be left behind.\nJennifer Snelling is an education journalist who focuses on the transformative power of technology to engage students.","Video content is taking the lead in the visual-first marketing strategy. No matter whether you want to create a playlist of video tutorials or an inspiring brand video – both can have a measurable impact on your business’ bottom line. But after the creative part of the job is done, you need to find the best way to add videos to your WordPress website.\nDefault WordPress functionality allows you to embed videos without extra plugins and customize them by adding very basic attributes. However, if you need more flexibility and features, the best way to go is to use a WordPress video player plugin.\nYou are spoiled for choice because there is a bunch of free and paid solutions that are ready to put your video to work.\nBut which one is the most appropriate for your needs? Before we introduce to the best video player plugins for WordPress, let’s firstly create a checklist of the things to consider when choosing a WordPress video player. It pays to pay attention to details of a plugin from the get-go!\nLet’s make things easier by breaking it down into several sections.\nWhat sort of WordPress video player plugin do I need?\nGood question. There are several types:\n- A fairly simple WordPress video player suitable for featuring several key brand videos. For example, an overview of your product or service on the website landing page. In this situation, any video player plugin with a good reputation and price-performance ratio will do.\n- A rather complex WordPress video gallery plugin for building average and massive video directories: tutorials, game reviews, course playlists. In this scenario, you may not only need a well-structured gallery layout to organize your videos, but more advanced functionality like video search, filters, an ability to add custom details to each video (description, length, author), a highly flexible video gallery customization toolkit or even an option to let users download your videos. These are all key things to assess when choosing a plugin.\n- E-commerce functionality to sell your videos. When this is the case, you might not be able to get by with a dedicated WordPress video gallery plugin but will need a specific WooCommerce plugin like WooCommerce Product Table or a video plugin with e-commerce integration.\nFYI: If you are looking to embed a background video, we’d recommend you searching for a WordPress theme that supports this option out of the box. For the vast majority of WordPress websites, this is a more seamless solution than connecting any third-party video player plugin.\nWhere to host your WordPress videos\nAlong with images, videos are the heaviest asset of any website. No surprise, cumbersome videos, and video galleries can be slow to load.\nIf you opt for self-hosted videos (stored on your WordPress website server), well-trusted WordPress video player plugins should be high on your list.\nSince it’s a general recommendation to put extra efforts into optimizing your WordPress website for playing self-hosted videos, the hosting and video player plugin should be reliable in the first place.\nRemember that self-hosted videos in WordPress is not the best option for continuously added quality videos that tremendously eat up your server space.\nIf you host your videos offsite with the popular services like YouTube or Vimeo, lots of problems vanish at once. First off, you don’t need to worry too much about performance as your videos are hosted elsewhere. Moreover, those hosts automatically re-encode your videos to work on all modern devices and across all browsers (something you might need to go about manually with self-hosted videos). So your task is easier – to rather choose a specific functionality you need in a WordPress video player plugin and not wrack your brain around tech stuff.\nHowever, if you need to embed just a couple of brand videos, self-hosted videos may be a better way to go since they are unbranded and don’t distract website visitors with annoying ads.\nThe vast majority of WordPress video player plugins support both of these types.\nA quick checklist of things to consider when choosing a WordPress video player plugin\n- Make sure a WordPress video player comes with a great range of customizable skins to be integrated beautifully into your WordPress theme. You should be able to have a good level of control of how the videos look and work.\n- If you need to embed only specific type of videos hosted offsite (e.g. YouTube), going with a dedicated plugin like Yottie (one of the most used YouTube gallery WordPress plugins) might be a better option. Such plugins are packaged with dozens of options related to just one video host and not force you to bear a burden of tons of never used extra features.\n- Consider SEO capabilities of the video player or the WordPress video gallery plugin. It’s important that the plugin allows you to write video descriptions, titles, output the needed meta data, author and every piece of into that helps your videos get indexed properly by the search engines.\n- If you need a user-friendly lightbox pop-up functionality instead of just playing videos on a page, make sure that it’s supported by default. Some vendors offer this option as an extra addon, but with other, you can get with a base plugin.\n- Put yourself in a client-facing role – is a player speedy enough and intuitive in use? If possible, try to play with plugin demos or perform a stress testing if the plugin is free.\n- For self-hosted videos, check whether social sharing integration is supported. If there are lots of videos and you want to make viewers to easily share individual ones across their accounts, make sure the WordPress video player plugin supports this feature. Basically, if each video is played in an individual WordPress post, there should not be such a problem. But if you are working with a custom gallery and lightbox pop-up, you might need to double-check this option for availability.\n- Want to show the number of views indicator with each video? Note that far from the vast majority of video gallery plugins provide this option by default.\n- For offsite hosted content, check for easy connection with video hosts API for automatic playlist updates and the whole bunch of options.\n- Look for advanced video options: multiple video quality, private and password-protected videos, support for subtitles, etc.\n- A general rule of thumb is to pay special attention to regular updates and good reviews of the plugin.\nHopefully, we’ve managed to help you sketch out your own checklist!

{"question":"What are the key differences between the financial costs of a data breach for small medical practices versus large organizations?","answer":"The financial impact varies significantly between small and large organizations. For small medical practices, costs include basic elements like encryption software licenses, IT technician hours, server maintenance, and potential equipment trade-offs (like choosing between security software or new medical equipment). For larger organizations, the costs are much more extensive, including merchant processor fines ($5,000-$50,000), card brand compromise fees ($5,000-$500,000), forensic investigations ($12,000-$100,000), QSA assessments ($20,000-$100,000), credit monitoring ($10-30/card), card reissuance penalties ($3-10/card), security updates ($15,000+), legal fees ($5,000+), breach notification costs ($1,000+), and technology repairs ($2,000+).","context":["A dental practice in Florissant (a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri) has revealed that a recent data breach could involve 10,000 people. The medical data breach was possible because patient data encryption software was not used to secure laptops that were stolen during a burglary.\nAccording to stltoday.com, an attorney that is representing the orthodontist's office has confirmed that \"extensive investigation[s]\" had to be performed to see who was affected by the burglary, although he did mention that \"most of the patient were probably teenagers,\" which makes sense when you consider who generally gets orthodontic treatment (think: braces).HIPAA rules do not discriminate based on age, however: since the computers were not protected with disk encryption software – but only with password-protection, which is easily \"crackable\" – Olson & White are forced to report the data breach not only to patients but the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In this case, because more than 500 are affected, the HHS has to be contacted immediately. Furthermore, certain other rules may apply, such as having to contact a media outlet to get the news out.Why does the use of encryption software give a medical organization a way out from report a data breach? Legally, it's because the Breach Notification Rule (found under the HITECH amendments to HIPAA) offers safe harbor from reporting a medical data breach if encryption is used.From a technical standpoint, it's because encryption offers one of the best ways of protecting digital information. The use of strong encryption software – like AES-256 – is considered to be unbreakable with modern computing tools. Testing by cryptologists, that continues today, has upheld this theory so far. Under the circumstances, chances are that PHI encryption can easily prevent data on stolen or lost laptops from falling into the wrong hands.\nSimply put, medical organizations will demur at the use of encryption because of cost. Not only financial cost – like actually paying for the encryption licenses – but also for other costs, such as opportunity costs. For example, if facing a tight budget, money diverted towards non-performing expenses like security software could mean having to give up on hiring a dental technician or the latest x-ray machine that could speed up consultations and treatment.Furthermore, there is the added problem of hidden cost when deploying encryption: most encryption providers only list the cost of licenses (usually per machine or device to be protected, sometimes per user, regardless of how many devices are involved) but the encryption budget needs to cover things like central management servers, the software that is required to ensure such servers can to their job (the underlying operating system, for example), space for the server in a data center, etc. Hidden costs can also include the hours worked by an IT technician as well as any ongoing operational and maintenance costs.Since data breaches may not affected a medical organization for an extended period of time, many myopically decide to forego encryption, possibly thinking that it won't happen to them, or promising that they'll do it \"soon.\"Of course, it doesn't have to be that way. AlertBoot FDE complies with HIPAA encryption requirements (namely, it's a FIPS 140-2, NIST validated solution) and states all costs upfront.","Data breaches can cost your club in a variety of ways – namely in\nrevenue and member confidence. The costs of fines, credit card replacements, legal fees and audits can all add up pretty quickly.\nThe frequency of data breaches — the theft, loss or mistaken release of private information — is on the rise and is happening more and more. And it’s not just a big business problem.\nSmall and mid-sized businesses with fewer data security resources are particularly vulnerable.\nHeard about the recent Equifax data breach? This data breach is among the worst ever because of the amount of people affected and the sensitive type of information exposed. The company estimates that as many as 143 million people in the United States were involved in this monumental hit. Credit card numbers for about 209,000 U.S. customers were compromised, in addition to “personal identifying information” on about 182,000 U.S. customers.\nHere’s a list of the average costs your business could sustain in a data breach:\n- Merchant processor compromise fine: $5,000 – $50,000\n- Card brand compromise fees: $5,000 – $500,000\n- Forensic investigation: $12,000 – $100,000\n- Onsite QSA assessments following the breach: $20,000 – $100,000\n- Free credit monitoring for affected individuals: $10 – 30/card\n- Card re-issuance penalties: $3 – $10 per card\n- Security updates: $15,000+\n- Lawyer fees: $5,000+\n- Breach notification costs: $1,000+\n- Technology repairs: $2,000+\n- Loss of member confidence: health clubs often lose 40% of members after a breach.\nAll in all, the total cost of a data breach could ultimately spell the financial end to your business.\nAs a result, it’s important for even small & medium-sized health clubs to take steps to protect against a data breach.\nHere are 3 easy steps:\n#1: Train Your Staff\nWhen it comes to PCI compliance and your health club, a trained staff is the golden foundation on which your compliance status rests upon. It’s as simple a task as it is daunting.\nEmployee training is the first step to ensuring your club’s security. Nobody spends more time in and around your system as much as your employees do. It is extremely important for them to get a good grasp of what their role is as it relates to your member’s credit card data security.\nWhen it comes to employees, the health club industry has a high rate of turnover. In order to ensure standardized security protocols throughout your club, you can establish a PCI Security Awareness training as part of your onboarding process.\nDepending on the role of a particular employee, the trainings can range from foundational to intensive – based off of that employee’s proximity to credit card data. You can learn more about roles and standardization by clicking here for a PCI Security Awareness best practices sheet.\nAnother option you can look into is an investment in software training via your club management software provider. You’ll find that alot of times, there are processes or “ways of doing things” at your club that, while successfull, are not necessarily secure methods that allow you to get the most out of your software. An investment in software training can help you streamline the process of training your staff, while allowing you to maximize on your software investment.\nNo employee wants to be the source of a security breach. If you spend just 1 hour per year on security awareness for your employees you will begin to see improvement year over year. Annually, that’s just .0005% of their time.\nHere’s the bottom line: if you hope to become PCI compliant, a trained staff is the first and most important step towards achieving it.\n#2: Restrict Unnecessary Access\nSecurity always starts with control. And it’s hard to have control when many people at your organization have administrative privileges. When I say administrative privileges, I mean the highest level of permission granted to a computer, system, environment, network, or server user. In short, admins have more privileges than normal users.\nAdministrative privileges allow the user to (among other things)\n- Turn on and off their anti-virus scanning\n- Add new users\n- Turn on/off event logging\n- Download and install new programs\n- Gain access to OS or system software\n- Pretty much do anything they want…\nSo what’s the problem with allowing users more rights?\nWhen an attacker enters a network, one of the first things he does is try to escalate his user privileges. Typically, attackers can more easily extract sensitive information from a system, and move through a network easier if they have administrative privileges.\nSee how this could have the potential to be destructive? Poorly managed administrative privileges make privilege escalation easier. Reducing privileges among staff helps prevent your system from being broken, and broken-into…intentionally or unintentionally.\nIf you reduce the number of people who have admin rights, you reduce your risk.\nGood rules of thumb for assigning privileges\n- Only trusted people at your club should have administrative privileges, such as IT administrators.\n- Limit highly privileged accounts to only log on to secure systems. That way it reduces the chance of exposing credentials to higher risk computers. In other words, don’t use the same admin login credentials for critical servers and office workstations.\n- When logged in as an administrator, don’t use your email account. Limit your access to the Internet to known trusted sites. This reduces the risk of accidental malware installation, phishing attacks, etc.\n- The best way to give the right people the right permissions is through role-based access. In a nutshell, it means users are only allowed the bare minimum access that their job requires. That way they don’t have access to anything they don’t need.\n#3: Keep Your Club Management Software Up to Date\nOur third aspect of control we need to discuss is software patching. Software developers will never be perfect. They will regularly release updates to patch security holes. Security is the #1 reason to update your club management software.\nWhy? Once a hacker knows he can get through a security hole, he passes that knowledge on to the hacker community who then exploits it.\nWhere should you install updates?\n- Operating systems\n- Club management software\n- Internet browsers\n- POS terminals\n- Other critical software\nBe vigilant about consistently updating the your club management software. Keep in mind, some software and browsers can become so outdated, the creators stop supporting it (e.g. January 12, 2016, Microsoft stopped providing technical support and security updates for older versions of Internet Explorer, Jonas Fitness will soon stop providing technical support and security updates for V2, V3 & V4) In cases like these, the best option is to update to the latest browser.\nBecause hackers have an unlimited amount of time to find vulnerabilities, they can and do find and exploit vulnerabilities. That’s why it’s important to update your systems and applications to reduce the likelihood of exploitable vulnerabilities.\nDon’t forget about other critical software installations like credit card payment applications. In order to maintain Payment Card Industry PA DSS compliance, your payment applications must be properly configured and have the latest updates and patches. This same principle relates to POS terminals as well (Find out more about PCI Compliance).\nAll of these systems and applications have notification lists and some have forums you can participate in to receive notifications on security updates. Talk to your club management software provider about how often they release updates and try to get on a notification list. You should never have to search for these updates; you should always be notified when they are available.\nPublished updates often contain essential security enhancements that will correct vulnerabilities in existing versions.\nMake it so….\nNow that you understand some of the best data security best practices that increase organizational security and can prevent future data breaches, go implement them! If any of these tips seem overwhelming, make a plan to implement or check that they are correctly implemented by the end of the year. If you simply don’t know how, contact your IT vendor, or speak with one of Tier 2 technical consultants."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a4306039-84e3-4f7d-baed-440566702f72>","<urn:uuid:abfde4f3-9b9b-455a-9022-82a2f52f1fd8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between data and information in database systems, and how do Teradata's error handling capabilities ensure information accuracy?","answer":"Data and information have distinct characteristics in database systems. While data is raw facts represented by characters (alphabets, numbers, special characters), information is organized records with significant value to receivers. Teradata's error handling capabilities ensure information accuracy through robust restart capabilities and error classification systems. The database identifies and corrects errors in a timely manner, classifies them appropriately (as system errors, application errors, or data errors), and provides features to restart operations after interruptions. This helps maintain information accuracy, which is a critical characteristic of information as it must be free from errors and bias for effective decision-making.","context":["A high-availability system must have the ability to identify and correct errors, exceptions and failures in a timely and reliable manner to meet challenging service level objectives. The Teradata database and the utilities and components (used to both load and access data) provide capabilities to implement reliable error and exception handling functionality. These capabilities combined with a well designed high availability architecture allow a Teradata Active Enterprise Intelligence (AEI) system to meet the service level objectives required to support mission critical business processes.\nThis series of articles focuses on the error handling functionality and restart capabilities of the Teradata database and the Teradata data load utilities.\nExamples of error and restart handling for the following utilities are included in this series:\nIn most cases a load utility job for each of these utilities can be re-started after a database failure and reset, a load process error or failure or a load utility client platform failure after the underlying problem has been corrected.\nAn Active Enterprise Intelligence Ecosystem consists of not only the Teradata database subsystem but all of the surrounding subsystems that require service from the database subsystem and provide services to the database subsystem. The following diagram illustrates the major subsystems in an AEI Ecosystem.\nEach subsystem must have error and failure handling capabilities. This series covers the capabilities and approaches to handle database, data integration and application integration errors and failures. This series will focus on handling errors, exceptions and failures in a Data Integration subsystem that is implemented with Teradata load utilitities.\nA system can encounter multiple types of errors and failures. Error and failure handling processes must execute the following steps:\nThe first step is to identify that an error or failure has occurred. In most cases a failure of the database will be detected by either a data load client or a data access client during a database operation. In this case the error must be classified and reported by the database client. In other cases the client may fail during a database operation. In each case the error must be classified.\nErrors in the database or a database client can be classified as:\nThe ability to restart Teradata load utility operations that are interrupted by an error or exception is a key feature of these utilities. Care must be taken to identify the error properly to determine whether a restart is possible and to configure the utility scripts properly for restarts.\nIt is critical that errors and exceptions be identified and classified. This is necessary to determine whether the problem can be isolated and the system returned to service automatically using Teradata high availability features or if the error requires intervention. In the case of intervention the type of error will determine whether the intervention is by a DBA, programmer or Teradata support personnel.\nTeradata load utilities have robust error handling and restart capabilities. This allows a database operation that is interrupted by a system error or by excessive data errors to be restarted and not have to be completely re-executed. A data integration operation may be interrupted by database errors, script errors, data errors or failures of a client process or platform. The Teradata load utilities provide the capability to restart a load operation in all of these cases.\nData integration operations are usually implemented as jobs that contain a series of steps. The steps may be defined in a single Teradata load utility script or as series of steps that execute load utilities or SQL scripts. In each case the job should be step restartable. That means that after an error the job should be able to be restarted at the point or step that was executing when the error occurred. In addition, each step should be able to be restarted or re-run. A restarted step will not re-execute the database interactions that occurred before the error. A step that is re-run will re-execute all database interactions in that step and continue with succeeding steps.\nJobs can be defined and executed using job scheduling and control systems (eg. Control-M, Tivoli, AutoSys), data integration systems (eg. Informatica, Oracle ODI, DataStage), or with scripts (eg. shell scripts, perl). In each case the job scheduling and control system should allow a job to be started at a step that was executing when an error occurred and it should allow a step to either be restarted or re-run.\nTeradata utilities allow steps defined within the utility scripts to start at the step where an error occurred or to be rerun completely. They also allow a job interrupted by a database reset to continue automatically once the database is back in service.\nThe utilities allow checkpoints to be established to prevent the re-execution of database operations that have completed before an error caused an interruption.\nEach of the load utilities allows parameters to be set that control:\nAll of the Teradata load utilities provide a return or completion code to the operation system or program that executed the utility. All job control definitions should check the return codes and take the appropriate action based on the return code. The Teradata utilities return the following completion codes:\nIn each case the specific database error must be found in the output log of the load utility to determine the next course of action (fix, re-start, re-run). A job control system can parse the output logs to determine and classify the database errors (beyond the scope of this series of articles). In all cases the underlying error must be identified, classified, fixed and then the job restarted at the appropriate step.\nIn the following series of articles we will describe how to use the features of Teradata load utilities to handle database and client errors and failures.","- DBMS Tutorial\n- What is Database Management System (DBMS)?\n- Components of DBMS\n- Applications of DBMS\n- Three Schema DBMS Architecture\n- Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?\n- Difference between File Oriented System and DBMS\n- Types of Data Models\n- DBMS Schema and Instances\n- Data Independence and Data Abstraction\n- Database Users and Administrator\n- DBMS Languages and Interfaces\nDBMS ER Model\nDBMS Relational Data Model\nDatabase Management System (DBMS) tutorial is all about handling and maintaining the record efficiently. Our DBMS tutorial is creating for learners as well as professionals.\nWhat is Data?\nData can be defined as the description of facts, concepts, or information in a distribute manner applicable for transmission, interpretation, or processing by the human or electronic device. Data is described with the help of characters like Alphabets (A-Z, a-z), numbers (0-9) or special characters (+, -, /, *, <,>, =etc.)\nWhat is Data Item (Field)?\nA set of character which is used together to represent a specific data element, e.g., name of the student in a class is represented by the data item, say, NAME.\nWhat is Record?\nA record is a group of associated data elements, e.g., Payroll data for an employee include such data fields as name, age, qualification, sex, Basic Pay, DA, HRA, PF, etc.\nWhat is Data File?\nFile is a collection of related data, e.g., a payroll file might consist of the employee pay record for a company.\nExample: Consider the STUDENT File.\nWhat is Information?\nIt is an organized or confidential record that has some significant value to the receiver.\nData Processing defines manipulating the data (raw data) to make it more helpful.\nData manipulation consists of such functions as classification, sorting, estimation & summarization.\nCharacteristics of Information\nFollowing are the characteristics of information are as follows:\nInformation should be accurate. It defines that information should be free from errors & clear. Accuracy also defines that the information is free from bias. Wrong data given to management would output in wrong decisions. As the manager’s decisions are based on the data provided in MIS documents, all managers require accurate information.\nInformation is of value if it is supported to the user in the form. It is useful and best understood by him. For example, in a business enterprise, top management may require information on key matters in a summarized form and the operation managers in a detailed form.\nIt defines the current utility of data in decision-making or problem-solving.\nIt means that information should be made feasible when it is required for a specific purpose and not before and in any case, not after.\nThe record which is given to a manager must be complete and should meet all his requirements. Incomplete data may output in wrong decisions and thus may prove expensive to the organization.\nInformation must have a purpose at the time it is communicated to a person or machine, otherwise, it is simply data.\nThe information should be reliable and externally forced relied upon indicated.\nIt measures the closeness of the information to the purpose.\nNeed of Information\n- Information is useful for making decisions.\n- Information helps managers in lowering the level of uncertainties where they have to make a choice among several available alternatives.\n- The information helps the users in tackling problems relating to their respective functional areas.\n- Information is used by top management to plan the objectives of the organization and to access whether the objectives are being met in practice.\nWhat is Database?\nA database is an organized group of associated data of an organization saved in a formatted way, which is shared by multiple users.\nCharacteristics of Database\nFollowing are the characteristics of the database are as follows:\nA database framework permits several customers to get the database together. To answering different questions from different clients with the similar (base) data is an essential form of an information system. Such a concurrent requirement for data hike the economy of an organization.\nStructured and Described Data\nA significant characteristic of the database strategy is that the database application does not contain only the data but also the complete description and definition of these data. These definitions are general analysis about the extent, the architecture, the type, and the format of all data and the relationship among the data. This type of saved data is called a metadata (“data about data”).\nSeparation of Data and Applications\nApplication program does not require any information about physical data like encoding, design, storage place, etc. It only directs with the administration framework for a database (DBMS), i.e., standardized interface with the support of a standardized language like SQL. The create of the data and the metadata is done by the DBMS. In this method, all the functions can be done isolated from the data. Therefore, database internal reorganizations or development of flexibility do not have any power on the application programming.\nData integrity includes the assurance of the database from unauthorized access (confidentiality) and unauthorized changes.\nA transaction is an array of actions which are done inside a database to deliver it from one consistent state to the new consistent state.\nOne illustration of the transaction is the transmission of an amount of money from one bank account to other account. The debit of money from one account and the credit of it to another account develops together with the logical transaction. This transaction is also an atomic. The debit or credit alone will both get to an inconsistent state. After finishing the transaction (debit and credit), the innovations to both accounts develop into persistence, and the one who contribute the money now has less money on his bank account while the receiver now has a more significant amount.\nData persistence defines that in a DBMS, all record is managed as long as it is not removed unusually. The life period of data needed to be decided directly or indirectly by the customer and must not be dependent on system characteristics. Furthermore, data, once saved in a database, must not be lost. Changes of the database which are done by the transaction are determined. When a transaction is done, even a system crash cannot put the data in danger.\nEnroll Yorself in Live Training: DBMS Training"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ed0c645b-7caa-482e-ab81-4814cfb4bee2>","<urn:uuid:ac9b0deb-cf66-43f7-b178-bc31a891f572>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What maintenance requirements and daily operations does a heat pump system entail 热泵系统的日常操作和维护要求是什么?","answer":"Heat pumps require minimal daily maintenance and are convenient to operate. They don't need regular cleaning of smoke or ashes, and users don't need to make trips outside for wood or pellets, or to fill up gas bottles. When cooling or dehumidifying, there's no need to empty any water reservoir as the system is plumbed in with a permanent drain to the outside. The system can be safely left running while occupants are out or asleep, and operation is as simple as using a button on the wall, remote control, or control panel.","context":["What is a heat pump?\nWhat is a Heat Pump?\nTechnically, a heat pump is a mechanical-compression cycle refrigeration system that can be reversed to either heat or cool a controlled space. Installation for this type of system typically consists of two parts: an indoor unit called an air handler and an outdoor unit similar to a central air conditioner, but referred to as a heat pump. A compressor circulates refrigerant that absorbs and releases heat as it travels between the indoor and outdoor units.\nHow it works:\nThink of a heat pump as a heat transporter constantly moving warm air from one place to another, to where its needed or not needed, depending on the season. Even in air that's seems too cold, heat energy is present. When it's cold outside a heat pump extracts this outside heat and transfers it inside. When it’s warm outside, it reverses directions and acts like an air conditioner, removing heat from your home.\nHeat Pump Advantages\nHeat Pumps can be used for Heating. The most obvious benefit of a heat pump system is its ability to provide warmth. This can be achieved with the simple touch of a button: at the wall; or on the remote; and even from the comfort of your chair. Heat pumps can very quickly increase the temperature of a room.\nHeat Pumps can be used for Cooling i.e. Air Conditioning. The “reverse cycle” in the full name of a heat pump refers to its ability to work backwards. In addition to extracting heat energy from outside and bringing this in to your home, your heat pump also has the ability to extract heat from inside your home and transfer this outside (in exactly the same way as a fridge works). The term “Air Conditioning” is more commonly used for the cooling cycle or function of your heat pump.\nHeat pumps don’t create smoke, ashes, moisture or any other waste material for you to remove. There are no trips required outside in the cold and rain for wood or pellets or to the petrol station to fill up your gas bottle. When cooling or dehumidifying your home there is no need to empty the reservoir of water as your heat pump is plumbed in and has a permanent drain to the outside.\nHeat Pumps are safe. Unlike gas heating or wood burners, there are no flames or hot surfaces that children or pets can touch and burn themselves on. They can also be safely left on while you’re out or asleep.\nHeat Pumps do not burn oxygen. Gas heaters need oxygen in order for gas to burn and release its heat energy. This can cause stuffy rooms and condensation on windows. Heat Pumps on the other hand do not need oxygen as they merely transfer heat energy from one place to another. Heat Pumps enable you to create just the right indoor environment tailored to your own personal preferences.\nHeat Pumps improve air quality. Heat pumps don't create smoke or add any fumes to the air. Also, as your Heat Pump circulates the air in your room, the filters clean and purify the air removing dust, mold spores, odours, smoke and other particles. They are excellent for people who suffer from asthma and allergies.\nHeat Pumps add value $. As Heat Pumps become more popular, they are adding value to your home. A warm, dry, comfortable environment with the addition of air conditioning will always be first choice over a house without such sought after benefits.\nHeat Pumps save space. Unlike a fire your heat pump does not need centre stage or to become a focal point in your room (taking up valuable floor space). Also there is no need to sit near the unit in order to benefit from the heat as the air in the room is warmed and circulated for the benefit of all.\nHeat Pumps are very energy efficient. Heat Pumps are currently the most cost-effective form of heating using electricity and most good quality systems achieve average COP (Coefficient of Performance) figures of four or more. This means that to achieve four kilowatts of heating or cooling power, they use an average of less than one kilowatt of electricity. A conventional heating system such as an electric fire or gas boiler has a COP of less than one. This means that it burns more than one kilowatt of power to produce a kilowatt of heating power. The higher the COP the cheaper a heating appliance is to run. In comparison to other forms of heating, Heat Pumps offer the most energy efficient heating with between 300% to 400% efficiency. The combustion process of wood burners causes fumes, soot and smoke which provide a major burden on the environment in terms of its carbon emissions. As the Heat Pump does not burn anything at the heat energy source, there are no additional carbon emissions other then the small amount of electrical energy required to run the compressor. Heat Pumps are environmentally friendly – most new heat pumps use R410A refrigerant which does not harm the ozone layer if released and is also more energy efficient.\nHeat Pumps reduce condensation. During summer, when you are using your heat pump for cooling, the room is automatically dehumidified as a function of the Heat Pump. As the warm air circulates through the unit moisture forms on the cold surface of the coil and then drains outside. During winter the heat pump prevents condensation forming on cold surfaces such as windows by circulating warm air around the room similar to demisting a car windscreen on a cold morning."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c348f4ed-4d12-454a-936b-ea1f2473292c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a European logistics manager, I need to understand: how does the transport infrastructure development approach differ between Europe's national planning and Hong Kong's port management?","answer":"The approaches are markedly different. European spatial planning is highly fragmented and nation-centric, with each country focusing on its own infrastructure (e.g., French roads leading to Paris, English roads to London). There is no true European-level planning authority, as the EU lacks formal authority for comprehensive infrastructure planning. In contrast, Hong Kong takes a market-driven approach with minimal government interference in port management. The Hong Kong Marine Department manages a unified deep-water port system that efficiently handles all vessel types through an integrated network of nine container terminals. This has made Hong Kong one of the world's busiest ports with streamlined operations, whereas Europe's fragmented national planning approach often results in disconnected infrastructure systems that reinforce existing national boundaries rather than creating an integrated continental network.","context":["The defects of European spatial planningGuidelines for spatial development of the whole European Union territory, were first set out in the studies 'Europa 2000' and 'Europa 2000+'. They defined macro-regions - in fact categories, clustering existing national regions under names such as 'Atlantic Regions'. None of these studies was a complete 'plan for Europe'. In fact they all show the first basic defect of 'European' spatial planning. It is a sum of national plans and national scenarios, it is not specifically European at all. The first 'plan for all Europe' was approved by the Council of Europe's planning ministers committee CEMAT, in September 2000 in Hannover.\nYou can see the existing 'Europe of the Nations' in any atlas: all the roads and railways in France lead to Paris, in England to London. In thousands of less obvious ways, the spatial structure of Europe follows the nation states. The proposed plans are so vague, and so limited, that they do not affect this - if anything they reinforced it. After 'Europe 2000+' came the European Spatial Development Perspective - ESDP, approved at Potsdam in May 1999. All EU spatial plans, can only include goals approved by a committee of the national ministers responsible for spatial planning. The EU has no formal authority, to even discuss these issues, let alone to make a Grand Plan for Europe. (More on this in the article by Andreas Faludi). The CEMAT has no planning authority at all, and its 'Hannover Document' relies on the goodwill of national governments. So this is the first thing a visitor from Mars would notice about European planning: there is no European planning.\nAnd this is exactly what does happen in reality, with a container in München or Bratislava, destination Shanghai. It will go via Le Havre, Hamburg, Rotterdam or Antwerpen, perhaps Genova or Marseille. But Shanghai is eastwards, through Rostov, Kazakhstan, Urumchi, Qashqar, and Xi'an.\nThe logic of the west-orientation is exactly the logic of the German political concept Westbindung. Europeans tend to associate 'West' with free trade, mobility, and global contacts, but it was Adolf Hitler who wanted to build a new railway, from Germany to Rostov. Those historical associations inhibit rational thought about spatial orientation. Any new railway project east from Germany will be associated with Hitler, Lebensraum, continental imperialism, anti-Americanism, closed societies, and totalitarianism. Any new railway westwards will be associated with democracy, internationalism, open society, liberalism and progress. Any spatial plan for eastern Europe, will probably be compared with Nazi planning for the 'Ostgebiete'.\nThis is a distortion with great consequences. Before '1989' it was cheaper to travel from London to New York, than to Kiev and Rostov. And now, after 1989, it is still the same. The enormous distortion in infrastructure has not been corrected. It is more fundamental and older than the Soviet Union. Between 1600 and 1800, western Europe turned its back to eastern Europe: the 'special relationship' Britain-USA is only an extreme case of a general pattern.\nSo the lack of land transport links to Asia, is a result of culture, not of economics. It is true that maritime transport is cheaper, but land transport has been faster, since about 1850. There are 5, perhaps 7, major land routes to Asia, but only two railways - the Trans-Siberian and the line through the Djungarian Gate. (A third route from the Fergana Basin to Qashqar, is now planned). High-capacity land transport is an alternative to maritime transport to Asia, but not to the USA. Two very different orientations are possible. A Europe trading by rail with China and India, would be different, from a Europe trading by sea with the United States. However, it would not necessarily be a prison camp.\nThe suspicion of eastern spatial alignment is paralleled by the general suspicion of any large-scale planning. The dominant political tradition in Europe, the liberal tradition, is historically anti-utopian. That bias against utopian designs, or any large plan, has been reinforced since the Second World War. The text below illustrates, better than any other I have seen, the liberal worldview - in which 'plan', 'totalitarianism', and 'megalomania' are fundamentally related concepts. It is from a joint French-Russian atlas project (1992-1995), the Atlas de la Russie et des Pays Proches. In this section Vladimir Kolossov, Tatyana Nefedova, and Andrej Trejevich introduce a map of Soviet gigantism and give their 5 selection criteria for the projects shown on it:\nGigantism in Soviet SpaceA fundamental trait in the spatial organisation of the USSR was the gigantism of construction projects, of regional economic development programmes for the new regions, or of reconstruction of the older populated regions.\nThis gigantism can not be explained by the size of the country, but rather by the organisational style of the USSR. An extreme concentration, in all areas of political and economic life, translated into a centralised organisation of production - and ultimately, of territory itself. The task of each new enterprise was seen in terms of the needs of the whole country: its products had to be sufficient for the whole USSR. This logically resulted in the creation of gigantically dimensioned factories and power plants, constructed by mobilising all the resources of the state. Official ideology continuously emphasised the giant projects under construction. Their glorification in the media illustrated the claimed \"irresistible advance of Soviet science and technology\". Propaganda presented these projects in all their spectacular glory, to the internal Soviet public and to the world outside. They became the heart of the ideological self-image, by which the regime legitimised itself.\nIn reality, this propensity to gigantism led at first to an extreme concentration of investment: ultimately it absorbed all investment, effectively freezing it....The implementation of these giant projects resulted in a significant extension of the network of settlement, with the accompanying mass migration to regions with harsh climatic conditions. The creation of giant production complexes, in places without sufficient local resources, often necessitated the movement of colossal qualities of raw materials, and caused an accelerated degradation of the environment......\n1. completion [of the project] effected a radical change (economic, social, ecological, political) at macroregional, national or even international level\n2. The projects in question were among the largest in Europe, or in the world - in terms of size, area, or production capacity.\n3. The project is unique in its type, by reason of what is produced, or the objective of the project, or the extreme natural environment.\n4. The completed or uncompleted projects are located in areas without any existing infrastructure: their construction is only possible with enormous investments, and intense and rigorous mobilisation of labour and resources - a mobilisation orchestrated across the whole USSR. This includes especially the use of \"shock construction brigades\". For such projects (for instance the BAM railway) intense propaganda was conducted by the youth organisation of the Communist Party. It was intended to encourage the Komsomols to spend several years of their life working on such a mega-project. And the use of political (and ordinary criminal) prisoners should not be forgotten.\n5. the project has been exploited for ideological reasons: used for official propaganda, as proof of the superiority of the socialist regime. This implies it was of a spectacular nature, suited for publicity purposes.\nSubstitute 'Europe' for USSR here, and you have a good caricature of the probable eurosceptic response, to European-scale planning. The general assumption, in political culture in Europe, is that mega-projects are only construed by autocrats and totalitarian societies. These labels are easily applied to anything that threatens national identity, yet the assumption is completely false in itself. The largest single construction project in history, the US Interstate Highway System, is entirely the result of free-market liberal democracy, anti-Communism, individual choice, and the American Way of Life. However the negative image has political results in Europe. The combination 'euro', 'mega' and 'project' is politically taboo - most politicians would reject any 'euro-mega-project' out of hand, without even knowing what it was.\nThe planning process itself is a problem. Spatial planning in Europe has two characteristics: it is the work of an elite, and this elite has a tendency to reproduce existing spatial structures. The planning elite in Europe - a sum of national planning elites - is inaccessible, over-specialised, and dependent on academic snobbery. There is for instance no critical or radical publication: so far as I know, all planning journals in Europe are mainstream academic publications. The national planning elites tend to come from the most mainstream, culturally conservative, section of the middle class. (And usually only from the national ethnic majority). Planning education is nationally organised, and few students take more than one course in European aspects of planning. There are clear consequences of this: the passive reproduction of existing spatial structure is the worst. Why do planners in the Netherlands endlessly repeat low-density family housing? Because most planning students grew up in such areas, and as planners they reproduce their childhood environment. Similar patterns limit innovation all over Europe.\nThe distinctions between spatial planning, geopolitics, and the state, should disappear. Spatial planning should facilitate possibilities, and therefore goals should be identified. There should be processes for realising these goals, and a necessary infrastructure for these processes. Readers familiar with political philosophy will recognise these principles as contra-liberal. Less abstractly: this means giving much more choice to people to migrate to areas of their choice - areas in some way prepared for them to live in.\nThe usual idea is, that a territory first has a state, then a government, then a planning ministry, then a plan. There is no reason not to reverse this order. That would mean that what is now the planning process (typically lasting 3 months to 10 years), would assimilate the state formation process (lasting up to 1500 years). So although the reversal sounds simple, it would fundamentally alter geopolitical structure.\nA second principle is that of facilitating possibilities. The inhabitants of Europe are used to living in states with one government, one parliament, one law and one army. The result is, inevitably, one spatial structure, with civil war as the only historical alternative. However, there is no reason to limit possible uses of territory to one national function.\nThat leads to the third principle: the identification of goals for these territories. The use of territory can be determined by philosophical, political, economic, or technological principles. (This is what liberalism would reject: liberal society is designed to include braking mechanisms, the 'checks and balances' of the US Constitution, for instance).\nIf a goal has been identified for territory, 'spatial planning' means the allocation of some territory to that goal. This principle leads to a fifth principle, linked to the first principle: some agency should provide the necessary minimum infrastructure to allow this allocation of territory. The absolute minimum is the ability to transport people from one area to another. In practice, most people will not relocate, unless they think the process facilitates their own ideals, or at least that they lose nothing by it. That also implies that the allocated territory must have a level of infrastructure close to the European average, so some agency must guarantee such minimum standards.\nI think it would be necessary to provide more 'infrastructure', than just water and sewage. It should be possible to do this, without limiting the territorial possibilities (the second principle). What would be necessary to maximise movement and allocation of territory in Europe? In general, the same basic facilities, which European nation states provide:\nSo, back to the starting point: the present reality of the Europe of the Nations. If national governments are reluctant even to admit on road signs, that the rest of Europe exists, then they will never produce any spatial plan for Europe. At least, nothing fundamentally different from the status quo.\nPrint sourcesEuropean spatial development perspective: towards balanced and sustainable development of the territory of the EU.

Its government has endorsed the ‘market-driven with minimal government interference' policy to create a business-friendly environment in the nation.\nThe Chinese mainland guides Hong Kong SAR, China's foreign and defense policies, but the territory maintains its own currency and customs status. The region is a major corporate and banking center as well as an outlet for China's flourishing exports.\nIf you are considering shipping to Hong Kong, here is everything you need to know about licenses, permits, financing, and more.\nWhat are Your Options for Shipping Freight To Hong Kong?\nShipping freight to Hong Kong can be conducted via ocean or air freight.\nOcean Freight To Hong Kong\nThe Port of Hong Kong is a deep-water port that deals with high volumes of trade in containerized manufactured products, raw materials, and passengers. It is managed by the Hong Kong Marine Department. The port is able to berth and handle all types of vessels, thanks to the deep waters and natural shelter of Victoria Harbour.\nIn terms of shipping movements, cargo handled, and passengers, this is one of the world’s busiest ports. It features nine container terminals, situated at Kwai Chung, Stonecutters Island, and Tsing Yi. The River Trade Terminal at Tuen Mun handles substantial container throughput.\nOcean freight to Hong Kong gives you two shipping options: less than container load and full container load. In LCL, your cargo will be consolidated with consignments from other sellers, to be shipped together in one container. In FCL, on the other hand, your goods will be shipped in isolation.\nAir Freight to Hong Kong\nDespite the global pandemic, air freight continues to remain a viable mode of shipping to Hong Kong. Several direct and indirect flights are operating from Hong Kong International Airport to the United States each week, along with select Middle Eastern destinations.\nAir freight is the best choice if you’re looking to ship to Hong Kong in a fast and flexible manner. The only downside is the extra costs as plane travel can be more expensive compared to ocean freight.\nHow Much Does it Cost to Ship Cargo To Hong Kong?\nThe cost of your shipment will differ depending on various factors. These include:\n- The type of goods you are shipping\n- Your chosen mode of shipment (ocean freight or air freight)\n- The weight and volume of your cargo\n- The size/ dimensions of your cargo\n- The distance between your origin country and Hong Kong\n- Specific movement types, i.e. door-to-door, port-to-door, door-to-port, port-to-port\nYour freight forwarder can provide you with a more accurate estimate of your shipping costs.\nHow Long Does it Take to Ship Cargo to Hong Kong?\nHow long your shipment will take will depend on factors such as your chosen mode of shipment, whether the ship or plane is direct or has multiple stops, and the distance between your origin country and Hong Kong. Here are estimated transit times:\nOcean Freight to Hong Kong\nOrigin Country|Transit Time LCL|Transit Time FCL| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |----------: Australia|27 days|19 days Bangladesh||16 days Canada||37 - 42 days China|5 - 7 days|4 - 6 days France||33 - 39 days Germany|38 - 41 days|39 days India|19 days|19 - 22 days Indonesia|19 days|15 - 31 days Italy|41 days|32 - 36 days Japan|9 - 10 days|10 days Korea||10 - 11 days Malaysia|10 - 13 days|13 - 21 days Netherlands |39 days|34 days Philippines|12 days|17 days Poland||47 days Singapore|11 days|11 days Spain|32 days|26 - 34 days Thailand|0 - 21 days|21 days Turkey||24 days UAE||20 days UK||37 - 40 days USA|16 - 48 days|19 days Vietnam|7 days|24 days\nAir Freight to Hong Kong\nOrigin Country|Transit Time| ---------------- | ---------------- |----------: Australia|3 - 8 days Bangladesh|4 days Canada|7 - 8 days China|2 - 3 days France|8 days Germany|2 - 5 days India|3 - 8 days Indonesia|3 - 8 days Italy|4 days Japan|2 - 3 days Korea |2 days Malaysia|3 - 4 days Netherlands|1 day Oman|3 days Philippines|2 - 8 days Poland|6 days Saudi Arabia |3 days Singapore|2 - 8 days Spain|5 - 8 days Switzerland|3 days Thailand|3 - 8 days UAE|2 - 7 days UK|3 days USA|1 - 8 days Vietnam|8 days\nImport Licenses and Permits\nDepending on the type of goods you intend to import, a valid import license must be obtained from the relevant government departments in Hong Kong.\nImport license for dutiable goods\nIf you plan to import dutiable goods, you should obtain an import license from the Customs and Excise Department of Hong Kong. According to the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, dutiable goods include:\n- Alcoholic liquors\n- Tobacco products\n- Hydrocarbon oils\n- Methyl alcohol\nImport license for optical disc mastering and replication equipment\nIf you wish to import optical disc mastering and replication equipment, an import license is needed from the Customs and Excise Department of Hong Kong.\nImport license for controlled chemicals\nIf you wish to import controlled chemicals, you must acquire an import license from the Customs and Excise Department of Hong Kong.\nImport license for the import of animals or birds\nYou must get an import license from the Import and Export Division, Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department in order to import animals or birds into Hong Kong. For the import of endangered animals, plants, or species, an import license from the Endangered Species Protection Division, Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department must be garnered.\nFurthermore, an import permit must be obtained in order to import live mammals, birds, or reptiles.\nImport license for pharmaceutical products, medicines, and dangerous drugs\nIf you wish to import pharmaceutical products, medicines (including Chinese medicine), and certain dangerous drugs, you must obtain an import license from the Pharmaceuticals Import Control Unit, Pharmaceutical Service, Department of Health.\nThe common types of dangerous drugs are stimulants, hypnotics, tranquilizers, and sedatives. Some examples include opium, morphine, heroin, cannabis, cocaine, and amphetamines.\nFor the import of Chinese herbal medicines, the import license must be obtained from the Chinese Medical Council of Hong Kong.\nImport license for Food Items\nImporting frozen confectionery\nIn order to import frozen confectionery, you must obtain prior permission from the Center of Food Safety, Food, and Environmental Hygiene Department. Note that importation is allowed only from approved sources of manufacture.\nImporting frozen or chilled meat and poultry\nImporters of frozen or chilled meat and poultry must apply for an import license from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department’s Import Registration Office.\nImport of milk or milk beverages\nIn order to import milk or milk beverages, you must obtain prior permission from the Center of Food Safety, Food, and Environmental Hygiene Department. Note that importation is allowed only from approved sources of manufacture.\nImport license for hazardous chemicals\nAn import license is required in order to import scheduled chemicals. At present, non-pesticide hazardous chemicals include chemicals that are subject to regulation under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants or the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade.\nImport license for pesticides\nIf you wish to import pesticides, you must obtain an import License from the Plant and Pesticides Regulatory Division, Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department.\nImport license for plants\nIf you wish to import plants into Hong Kong, you must first obtain a Plant Import License from the Plant and Pesticides Regulatory Division, Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department.\nHowever, the import of plants produced in mainland China is exempted from the licensing requirement. The exemption also applies to the import of cut flowers, fruits, and vegetables for consumption, from mainland China and other countries.\nImport license for rice\nRice is a staple food in Hong Kong and is therefore scheduled as a reserved commodity under the subsidiary regulations of the Reserved Commodities Ordinance. If you wish to import rice into or from Hong Kong, you must apply for an import license under the Trade and Industry Department’s Rice Control Unit.\nImport license for rough diamonds\nThe import of rough diamonds must be covered by valid Kimberley Process Certificates issued by the Director-General of Trade and Industry.\nImport license for strategic commodities\nAlthough Hong Kong is a free trade port, certain commodities are subject to control. The import of such controlled commodities requires a specific import license, issued by the Strategic Trade Controls Branch of the Trade and Industry Department.\nControlled goods that are in transit i.e. goods that at all times remain in the vessel or aircraft throughout their passage through Hong Kong are normally not required to be covered by a license, except for particularly sensitive items such as nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons.\nStrategic commodities include arms and ammunition, explosives, high precision machine tools, high-performance computers, sophisticated communication systems, nuclear materials, high speed, and high-density integrated circuits.\nImport license for textiles\nThe import of textiles (including the export of non-Hong Kong origin textiles) must be covered by a valid import license, issued by the Director-General of Trade and Industry unless specifically exempted.\nNote that the licensing requirements vary for sensitive markets and non-sensitive markets. Sensitive markets include imports from mainland China.\nAccording to the Import Regulations, every person who imports any goods or articles (except exempt goods/articles) must file an Import/ Declaration with the Commissioner of Customs and Excise, within 14 days after the goods or articles have been imported. The declaration can be filed electronically via service providers that are appointed by the Government.\nImport Clearance Procedures\nIn order to clear imported goods, the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department will thoroughly inspect all import-related documents. The Customs Department may also undertake a physical examination of the cargo, as and when it deems fit.\nIn order to clear imported dutiable goods, the importer must submit a ‘Removal Permit’ to the Customs Department. A permit holder should take note of the following points when dealing with dutiable commodities:\n- The goods must be removed within the approved removal date and time;\n- The goods must be removed from the releasing place and conveyed directly to the designated receiving point; and\n- The description, quantity, and packing of the goods must match with what is mentioned in the permit.\nDocuments required for import clearance\nThe documents that are required for import clearance include:\n- Bill of lading, airway bill, or any other similar document,\n- Invoice or packing list, and\n- Other documents such as import/export license, removal permit, etc.\nImport Fees and Taxes\nHong Kong is a free port and does not impose any customs fees on imports.\nVAT or GST\nHong Kong does not impose any value-added tax or goods and services tax.\nHong Kong imposes excise duty on only four types of goods, irrespective of whether they are imported or locally manufactured. The goods that are subject to excise duty are liquors, tobacco, hydrocarbon oil, and methyl alcohol.\nFor tobacco, hydrocarbon oil, and methyl alcohol, duties are charged at specific rates per unit quantity. For liquors, duty is assessed at different percentages based on the alcoholic strength of the liquor.\nWith the growth of international trade, the importance of trade finance has also increased. At present, there are a number of financing options available for trading companies in Hong Kong. The major trade finance instruments that facilitate trade in Hong Kong include:\nLetters of Credit\nThe Letter of Credit is the most widely used trade finance instrument and is an effective means for banks to finance import trade. A Letter of Credit is a letter issued by the buyer’s bank and guarantees payment to the exporter.\nAlmost all major banks in Hong Kong offer short-term finance options to trading companies. Some of the short-term financial products include term loans, overdrafts, revolving loans, import loans, etc.\nShipping To Hong Kong: FCL or LCL?\nIf ocean freight is your chosen mode of shipment, you need to select between FCL or LCL. In order to make the best decision, consider your priorities, as well as the particulars of your cargo.\nLess than Container Load To Hong Kong\nYou should choose LCL if your cargo is:\n- Small in size and quantity\n- Suitable for consolidation with cargo from other sellers\n- Not expected in Hong Kong at a specified time\n- Suitable for frequent handling and movement\n- Not perishable, fragile, or delicate\nFull Container Load To Hong Kong\nOn the other hand, FCL may be a better choice if your cargo is:\n- Large, bulky, and oversized\n- Better of shipped in isolation\n- Expected in Hong Kong at a specified time\n- Not suitable for frequent handling and movement\n- Perishable, fragile, or delicate\nPort of Hong Kong\nHong Kong is one of several hub ports serving the South-East and East Asia region and is an economic gateway to mainland China. Hong Kong set a record in its container throughput in 2007 by handling 23.9 million TEUs (20-foot equivalent units of containers), maintaining its status as the largest container port serving southern China and one of the busiest ports in the world.\nSome 456,000 vessels arrived in and departed from Hong Kong during the year, carrying 243 million tons of cargo and about 25 million passengers. The average turnaround time for container vessels in Hong Kong is about 10 hours. For conventional vessels working in mid-stream at buoys or anchorages, it is 42 and 52 hours respectively.\nThe Hong Kong Airport\nHong Kong International Airport (IATA: HKG, ICAO: VHHH) is Hong Kong's main airport, built on reclaimed land on the island of Chek Lap Kok. The airport is also referred to as Chek Lap Kok International Airport or Chek Lap Kok Airport, to distinguish it from its predecessor, the former Kai Tak Airport.\nHaving been operational since 1998, the Hong Kong International Airport is an important regional trans-shipment center, passenger hub, and gateway for destinations in China (with 45 destinations) and the rest of Asia. The airport is the world's busiest cargo gateway and one of the world's busiest passenger airports.\nTop Commodities Imported to Hong Kong (2018)\n- Integrated Circuits - 24.6%\n- Broadcasting Equipment - 7.66%\n- Office Machine Parts - 5.62%\n- Gold - 4.12%\n- Diamonds - 3.08%%\nTop Tradelanes to Hong Kong\n- China 44.4%\n- South Korea 7.02%\n- Chinese Taipei 6.61%\n- Singapore 6.55%\n- United States 5.29%\nOcean and Air Shipping From Hong Kong: Why Choose Shipa Freight?\nShipa Freight is a digital-first freight forwarder that offers you all the functionalities of traditional freight forwarding but with the convenience of modern technology.

{"question":"What are the recommended screening frequencies for blood pressure and PSA tests, and what conditions can cause elevated PSA levels?","answer":"Blood pressure tests should be performed at least every two years, and more frequently if blood pressure is high. For PSA tests, men should discuss prostate cancer screening with their doctor starting at age 50 (or earlier for high-risk groups like African-American men). Both benign and cancerous conditions can cause elevated PSA levels, including prostatitis and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), which is a non-cancerous prostate enlargement common in older men.","context":["Original source: https://pennstatehershey.netreturns.biz/HealthInfo/Story.aspx?StoryId=32a654d8-1370-4d02-91c6-92c71af34e1f#.Wx_iRVyplBw\nScreening tests can catch serious diseases in very early stages, before they do major damage to your health.\nYou may think of the doctor’s office as someplace you go when you’re sick. But it’s important to have an occasional visit when you’re well too.\nAll men should have a few routine screening tests. These tests can help catch health problems early, before they’ve progressed enough to cause symptoms. And treatment in these early stages is more likely to be fully effective.\nYou can get screened for lots of diseases, but most men only need screening for a few. The diseases you need screening for, and how frequently you should be screened, varies according to your health and risk factors. The following tests are recommended for most men:\n- Blood pressure tests\nA number of health organizations, such as the American Heart Association (AHA), recommend blood pressure checks at least every two years and more often if it is high. Keeping your blood pressure at safe levels will reduce your risk of heart disease, the leading killer of American men.\n- Cholesterol screening\nThe AHA recommends cholesterol checks once every four to six years starting at age 20.\nHigh blood cholesterol is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease.\n- Colorectal cancer screening\nRegular screening for this cancer should start at age 45, and maybe sooner if you’re at high risk.\nYour doctor can help you decide on the best type of screening test for you.\n- Prostate exams\nThe American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends talking to your doctor about prostate cancer screening when you turn 50 years old. The prostate specific antigen (PSA) test and digital rectal examination (DRE) can uncover this cancer at an early stage. But screening has drawbacks, too, and some groups don’t recommend routine screening for this cancer. Your doctor can help you decide if it’s right for you.\nFor men at high risk, such as African-American men and men with a close family member who had prostate cancer at an early age, the ACS recommends the discussion with your doctor start at age 45 or earlier.\n- Blood glucose testing\nAll men age 45 and older should think about getting screened for diabetes, says the National Institutes of Health. A simple blood test can reveal if you have diabetes or its precursor, prediabetes. Identifying and treating these conditions in their early stages helps prevent serious damage to organs all over the body.\nThis test is even more important for men with risk factors such as a family history of diabetes, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol or high body weight. You’re also at higher risk if your family background is African American, American Indian, Asian American, Pacific Islander or Hispanic.\n- Skin exams\nThe ACS recommends monthly self-exams to look for growths or changes that could be skin cancer. Signs to look for include any type of change in a mole or freckle, or a growth with uneven colors, borders or shape, or that is larger around than a pencil eraser. Check your whole body, head to toe, and consult your doctor about anything suspicious.\n- Depression screening\nScreening for this serious, treatable disease should be a part of everyone’s regular healthcare, according to Mental Health America.\nIf you’ve felt down, hopeless or uninterested in the things you usually enjoy for two weeks straight, it’s even more important to ask your doctor about screening for depression.","Prostate Cancer Screening\nProstate canceris one of the most common cancers in the United States. It is a cancer of the prostate gland, which is only found in men. This gland sits below the bladder. In most cases, men with prostate cancer are over 65 years of age, but it can occur in younger men.\nIn its early stages, prostate cancer has no symptoms. It is often a slow-growing cancer. In fact, it may take years to develop. As the cancer gets larger or spreads, it may cause problems. This may include impotence, urinary problems, and pain in your back, hip, or thighs. To help detect cancer in its early stages, your doctor may recommend a prostate specific antigen test (PSA) and a digital rectal exam (DRE).\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) do not recommend PSA tests to screen for prostate cancer in men of any age. Other organizations, such as the American Urological Association, recommend that it be a decision a man can make after discussing the risks and benefits with his doctor. The changes made to screening guidelines in 2012 led to controversy, especially since the PSA test was widely used to screen for cancer. Take the approach that you feel most comfortable with. It is important to know your history, your family's history, your risk, and your comfort level.\nPSA is made by the prostate gland. A PSA test measures the level of the antigen in your blood. It is done with a sample of blood, which can be taken at your doctor’s office during a regular physical exam. It is normal for healthy males to have some PSA in their blood. Levels sometimes increase when prostate cancer is present. There are other conditions which may increase the PSA. They include prostatitis or benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). BPH is a benign (non-cancerous) prostate enlargement. It is often found in older men. If your PSA increases, your doctor may order further tests.\nPSA may also be checked in people who have already been diagnosed with cancer. PSA may be used to check the progress of cancer or to evaluate treatment.\n- Both benign and cancerous conditions can cause elevated PSA levels.\n- The blood test can only measure the levels, not the cause. Further testing would need to be done to find the cause.\n- Prostate cancer does not always increase PSA levels. A test that shows normal levels does not mean you are cancer-free. Do not ignore symptoms common to prostate cancer because you had a normal PSA test. This could lead to a delay in treatment.\nDigital Rectal Exam\nThe digital rectal exam (DRE) may be done during a routine physical exam. The prostate gland lies next to the rectal wall. Normally, the prostate is roughly the size of a walnut. The doctor will use a gloved finger to feel the prostate through the rectum. This exam is done to find lumps or changes to the prostate gland.\n- The DRE may not be able to determine if the lump is cancerous or not. A positive test will lead to further testing.\n- Some lumps may not be found through this exam. Very early stage cancer is difficult to detect with DRE. A clear test (where the doctor does not detect any lumps) may again encourage men to ignore symptoms common to prostate cancer. This could lead to delays in treatment.\nBased on the results of one or both tests, your doctor may recommend a prostate biopsy. A needle is used to remove a sample of the prostate. The sample will then be examined under a microscope for cancer cells. A biopsy is the only way to confirm the presence of cancer.\nA biopsy does have some degree of risk. It can lead to problems with bleeding or infections. A biopsy can also be an uncomfortable process.\nSince the increased PSA levels do not always mean cancer, some men will end up with unnecessary biopsies. Undergoing any exam for cancer can be a stressful process. For some people, though, identifying cancer at an early stage can be a life-saving step.\nMost prostate cancers are slow-growing. Some are so slow that men with prostate cancer often die from other causes without knowing they had it. Your age, cancer risk factors, DRE, and PSA results will all play a role in treatment decisions. One option is to simply wait and monitor changes in the cancer. The PSA levels can be used to track any changes.\nSome may be uncomfortable with having untreated cancer. However, cancer treatments have risks of their own. Treatments may cause impotence or trouble with leakage of urine.\nThe benefit of a screening test is measured through its ability to save lives. While prostate cancer screening remains a controversial issue, a large trial involving 20,000 men found that PSA screening did slightly reduce the death rate from prostate cancer. However, many other studies have not shown this connection. Also, research has failed so far to show a link between prostate cancer screening and lower overall mortality in men.\nIf you are aged 50 years or older, PSA and DRE tests may be offered to you. If you are at high risk for prostate cancer, screening can start even earlier. Talk to your doctor about the test options. Ask about the benefits and risks of prostate screening for you. Life expectancy, family history, age, and current health will all play a role in your screening plan for prostate cancer."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ac181618-d61b-4838-a2e9-9f1c5de579e6>","<urn:uuid:92cd6a2d-a65d-48f7-babc-a79248d024ee>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do ADHD and OCD differ in their impact on a person's daily routine and behavior patterns?","answer":"ADHD and OCD impact daily routines and behaviors quite differently. ADHD is characterized by difficulty paying attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, with affected individuals struggling to start and finish tasks and manage their time. They often need movement and have trouble sitting still. In contrast, OCD involves persistent, unwanted obsessive thoughts and compulsive, repetitive behaviors designed to cope with those thoughts. OCD behaviors are excessive and time-consuming, involving specific rituals like hand washing or checking locks repeatedly. While ADHD patients benefit from structure and routine to stay focused, OCD patients perform ritualized behaviors in a structured way to manage their anxiety.","context":["Remote Learning and ADHD: 6 Strategies for Success\nSchool looks a lot different this year, as many American students learn from home. While distance learning can be difficult for any child, it can be extra challenging for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), also called attention deficit disorder (ADD).\nTips to make remote learning easier for children with ADHD\n\"Kids who are unaffected by ADHD that have to spend extensive time in front of a computer screen will have a difficult time,” says UCLA Health child and adolescent psychiatrist James McGough, MD. “For students with ADHD, the struggle is heightened.”\nADHD is a behavior disorder. A child with ADHD likely will have one or more of these attributes:\n- Inattention: Has difficulty paying attention, is forgetful or easily distracted\n- Impulsivity: Struggles to take turns, interrupts or doesn’t think before acting\n- Hyperactivity: Is frequently moving or can’t sit still and is often talkative\n“ADHD can impact learning because kids tend to have difficulty starting and finishing tasks and managing their time,” says Dr. McGough. “Kids with ADHD thrive when there is order and routine in their day. Online learning that is less structured can be problematic because teachers expect children to be more self-motivated. Lack of structure can even increase ADHD symptoms in children.”\nIf your child has ADHD and participates in a virtual learning environment, these six tips may make schooling easier this year and beyond, Dr. McGough says:\nSet up an ideal virtual learning environment\nChildren with ADHD may have difficulty paying attention to a computer screen without personal interaction to keep them on track. To make it easier for them, set aside a dedicated learning space free from distractions such as toys, siblings or pets.\n“Parents have their own demands. But if possible, set aside dedicated time to offer hands-on support to your child,” says Dr. McGough. “Parents can help by answering questions or reinforcing concepts their child learned online.”\nStick to a schedule\n“You can help your child succeed by establishing a consistent routine. Create a visual schedule that includes learning time, meals and other breaks,” says Dr. McGough. “Your child may be more motivated knowing what comes next, especially if it includes a break.”\nBreaks such as jumping rope or scootering around the block can meet a basic need of children with ADHD — the need to move. Visual checklists are another great way to stay on track.\nReinforce good behavior\nHelp your child repeat behaviors you wish to see through positive reinforcement. Depending on your child’s age and interests, rewards could be as simple as a star chart or it could be the chance to play a video game.\n“Movement rewards are especially powerful because they help children burn off their excess energy,” says Dr. McGough. “Incorporating visual cues for rewards they can earn may help them stay focused.”\nFidgeting is fine\nBecause many children with ADHD are hyperactive, they have an innate desire to fidget and move. “Make available things to keep their hands busy, like fidget spinners or squeeze balls. You might also consider a ball chair so they can bounce a little while working,” says Dr. McGough.\nAdjust to their online learning style\nDon’t be afraid to lobby for adjustments that will help your child succeed with virtual learning. “Work with his or her teacher to modify lessons so they are more experiential in nature or use a format better suited to their style of learning, such as software that reads the material to the student,” says Dr. McGough. “If necessary, work with the school to develop an Individualized Education Program (IEP) so they get the support they need.”\nGet medical support\nKids with ADHD may not be effective at expressing themselves verbally. Behavioral cues such as acting out or withdrawing could indicate they are struggling. When this happens, reach out to his or her provider, who may want to reevaluate if additional support — including medication or changes to an existing medication regimen — are needed. “But keep in mind, this is tough. There is likely no way to medicate our way out of this,” says Dr. McGough. “Doing our best is enough this year.”\nWhat if you suspect your child has undiagnosed ADHD?\n“If you are spending time with your child while they are learning virtually and notice he or she has one or more ADHD attributes, don’t fret,” says Dr. McGough. “Not all children who are hyperactive or impulsive have ADHD. Remote learning may challenge your child because they are used to more movement throughout their day or more interaction with friends and teachers.”\nIf you’re concerned, it’s best to talk with a pediatrician who can rule out other causes for impulsive or hyperactive behavior such as:\n- Depression or anxiety\n- Online bullying\n- Sleep struggles\n- Vision difficulty\nIf you’re concerned about how your child is navigating remote learning, contact his or her pediatrician or primary care provider.","Do I Have OCD?\nObsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD, causes obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors designed to cope with those troubling thoughts. Many people have some degree of disturbing thoughts and repetitive behaviors, but to truly be diagnosed with OCD they must be excessive, time-consuming, and they must interfere in a significant way with several aspects of a person’s life. Only a mental health evaluation can determine if someone truly has OCD.\nOCD stands for obsessive-compulsive disorder, a mental illness characterized by disturbing, unwanted, and persistent obsessive thoughts and compulsive, repetitive, and ritualized behaviors used to stop the thoughts or relieve the anxiety they cause. If you have OCD, these thoughts and behaviors will be extreme, excessive, and time-consuming. They interfere with your life in significant ways.\nMany people experience some of the signs of OCD without meeting the criteria to be diagnosed. It is not uncommon to sometimes obsess over disturbing things or to engage in ritualized actions as a way to cope. Doing this occasionally is not OCD. To know if you do have this serious mental illness, you need to be evaluated by a mental health professional. Only with this evaluation will you get an accurate diagnosis and access to effective treatment.\nWhat is OCD?\nOCD is a mental illness that causes obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. The obsessive thoughts cause anxiety and distress; they are unwanted; and they are persistent and difficult if not impossible to stop. The compulsions are repetitive OCD behaviors that the person uses to reduce anxiety, to stop the obsessive thoughts, or to prevent something bad from happening. These compulsions could involve any type of behavior, such as hand washing, ordering items, or switching lights on or off.\nWhile OCD was once categorized as a type of anxiety disorder, it is now part of a group of mental illnesses called obsessive-compulsive and related disorders that also includes body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, and hair-pulling and skin-picking disorders. Data from surveys indicate that about one percent of U.S. adults have been diagnosed with OCD in the last year, while more than two percent struggled with OCD at any point in their lives. More than one quarter of all adults have experienced obsessions and compulsions but did not meet all the criteria for an OCD diagnosis.\nSigns You May Have OCD\nSome studies have found that up to 80 percent of people have experienced intrusive and unwanted disturbing thoughts and that nearly 50 percent have engaged in ritualized, repetitive behaviors. So, if you do have some elements of OCD, you are not out of the ordinary. To truly have OCD you must spend a lot of time and energy on these thoughts and behaviors and experience difficulties in your life because of them. Here are some signs you may be struggling with OCD:\n- You have disturbing thoughts, usually that follow a common theme, which you cannot stop, no matter what you do.\n- The troubling thoughts tend to intrude when you are trying to do something or think about something else.\n- You try to rid yourself of the troubling thoughts by engaging in some kind of ritual, like turning the lights on and off a certain number of times, not stepping on cracks in the sidewalk, or re-checking locked doors multiple times when you leave the house.\n- You feel compelled to do these rituals, and they tend to be excessive, taking up a lot of time.\n- You do the behaviors to manage your anxiety or to rid yourself of the disturbing thoughts, but they aren’t really connected. For instance, counting words you see helps ease the anxiety of thoughts that your loved ones will get hurt.\nThese OCD behaviors and symptoms typically begin in the teenage years or in the early 20s, and for most people they vary in intensity and severity. You may have periods of time when you don’t have the signs, or they are mild, and other times when they become severe and all-consuming. For many people with OCD the symptoms intensify during periods of increased stress.\nDiagnostic Criteria for OCD\nThere is no OCD test, and only a mental health professional can tell you if you really have OCD after conducting a thorough psychiatric evaluation. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals use criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to determine if a patient can be diagnosed with a condition like OCD.\nThe first criterion is that you have obsessions, compulsions, or both. The obsessions are persistent and unwanted thoughts that cause you a significant amount of distress or anxiety. You try to stop the thoughts or neutralize them. The compulsions are repetitive behaviors that are used to relieve the anxiety or to stop something bad from happening. They are excessive and usually unrelated to whatever negative thoughts you are trying to stop.\nThe obsessions and compulsions are the characteristic signs of OCD, but there are additional criteria that have to be met to make a diagnosis:\n- The obsessions and compulsions must cause significant impairment in a person’s life, take up an excessive amount of time, or cause significant distress.\n- The thoughts and behaviors cannot be caused by substance abuse or a medical condition.\n- They also cannot be better explained by another mental illness, like anxiety disorder, depression, hoarding disorder, or any others.\nCall for a Free Confidential Assessment.877-727-4343\nTypes of OCD\nStrictly speaking, there is only one type of OCD. However, there are some common types of compulsions that can be used to classify people with this condition. It is important to remember that the obsessions and compulsions may be anything, but there are some general topics and types that are seen more often than others:\n- Contamination. Many people with OCD have obsessive thoughts about germs and being contaminated. Their compulsions are usually related to this and may include excessive hand washing or cleaning.\n- Harm. Obsessive thoughts may be related to a fear that harm will come to oneself or loved ones. These are kept at bay and the harm is prevented by checking compulsions, like repeatedly checking that the space heater is turned off before leaving the house because of fears about fire.\n- Sin and doubt. When the obsessive thoughts are shameful and related to moral issues, religion, or sexual compulsions, the person with these thoughts may engage in non-visible compulsions, like counting words or silently reciting repetitive phrases or prayers.\n- Order. Some people are obsessed with order and symmetry and having everything arranged just so. They obsessively rearrange and line objects up in the “correct” way. Or, they may count things or have superstitions about patterns or numbers.\nOther patterns that may be seen with OCD include magical thinking and superstitions, obsessive thoughts about specific relationships, obsessions and compulsions related to the body, such as repetitive blinking, and thoughts of harming other people. Hoarding was once considered a type of OCD, but it is now considered a separate, but similar, disorder, characterized by obsessions over things and a fear of throwing anything away.\nConditions Related to OCD\nThere are several mental and behavioral health conditions that are similar to OCD and cause symptoms that may be confused for those of OCD. This is why it is so important to have a mental health professional evaluate you to make an accurate diagnosis. Anxiety disorder is more common than OCD but can mimic the obsessive symptoms. Depression can also cause a person to obsess over things, which may seem like OCD. Tourette syndrome causes tics, which may look like the repetitive behaviors caused by OCD. Certain conditions that cause psychotic symptoms, including delusions, may also seem like OCD. The obsessive thoughts caused by OCD may seem irrational, but they are not typically delusional or psychotic.\nCommon Co-Occurring Disorders\nIf you do have OCD, there is a good chance you may have other co-occurring disorders or mental health issues. Several mental illnesses and behavioral conditions commonly co-occur with OCD, although why this is the case is not fully understood. It may be due to the fact that they have common risk factors and similar symptoms and personality traits. Some common co-occurring issues with OCD include:\n- Anxiety disorders\n- Eating disorders\n- Body dysmorphic disorder\n- Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n- Tic disorder\n- Hair-pulling or skin-picking disorder\n- Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, which is not the same as OCD\n- Poor impulse control\n- Suicidal thoughts and behaviors\nOCD is a serious mental illness because it can interfere with your life in significant ways. It may cause you to withdraw from friends or family or to stop engaging in other activities you enjoy because you spend so much time on your obsessions and compulsions. It can cause problems in relationships, in school, and at work. To find out if you have OCD, and to get the treatment you need, be sure to get an evaluation by a mental health professional. If you aren’t sure where to turn, see your regular doctor for a recommendation of someone who can help."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d4c07da2-53b1-4dc8-95f3-67a1f83ba6fc>","<urn:uuid:9c80dae0-452c-4b91-9467-1e5d700ef8a7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the compatibility considerations when using oil-based paints for outdoor signs versus indoor surfaces?","answer":"For outdoor signs, oil-based paints are specifically not recommended because they are difficult to clean up, have a strong smell, and dry slowly. For indoor surfaces, oil-based paints (also called oil paint) are considered one of the main types of interior paint and while they take longer to dry, they offer more durability compared to other interior paint types. This makes oil-based paints more suitable for indoor use where slow drying time is less problematic, rather than for outdoor sign-making where quick-drying properties are important.","context":["STEP ONE: GATHER SUPPLIES\n- Cardboard (Large pieces are better)\n- Utility knife and extra blades\n- Cutting mat (or surface for using utility knife)\n- Acrylic or latex paint\nOld latex house paint works great for cardboard signs. You can also use acrylic paint (the kind artists use, and available in most art shops). Don’t use oil-based paints because they are difficult to clean up, they smell badly, and they dry slowly. Tempera paints aren’t good either, because they aren’t permanent and will run and wash away if the sign gets wet.\n- Paintbrushes (have a variety of sizes, and make sure they are in good shape, i.e., not frayed)\n- Yogurt containers for water and paint (with lids, if available)\n- Drop cloth\n- Masking tape (the wider rolls are better; don’t get the cheapest tape as it often lacks effective adhesive)\n- Wood glue or white glue\n- Sticks or poles (Between 1 – 2.5 m, 3-8 feet – based on how tall you want the signs)\nSTEP TWO: DRAW AND CUT OUT SHAPES\n- Design your image on scrap paper and then scale and draw it on the cardboard. Use the ruler for straight lines and even distances. For circles you can draw around a big bucket, a lid, or use a pencil tied to a string like a compass.\n- Draw and cut out the first side, and then trace the shape onto another piece of cardboard for the second side. (This makes the two sides symmetrical as you’ll later attach them back-to-back.) Keep any text or images printed on the cardboard on the inside of the sign and the clean side of the cardboard to the outside of the sign.\n- Cut the cardboard out with a utility knife with a sharp blade with a cutting mat underneath, or some heavy duty scissors.\n- If you are making many signs you can keep tracing the original.\n- If you are making something like sunflowers the pole can act as the stem and you can add cardboard leaves partway down the pole.\nThese are the steps for double sided signs, which are great because the message can be read from both the front and the back and the signs are sturdier. Cardboard signs can also be made single sided which is faster and simpler, so decide based on the amount of time you have and if you will reuse the signs often. Here is a demo in this video starting around 1:25. https://vimeo.com/161333820\nSTEP THREE: GLUE AND TAPE\n- First glue your two pieces of cardboard together. Put white glue or wood glue near edge of the shapes and sandwich two cut-outs together. Leave about 5 cm/ 2 inches at the bottom of the shapes unglued– this will be your opening to slide in a stick. Make a pencil mark on the outside of the sign so you know where the unglued section is.\n- Next use masking tape (2 inch/5cm width) to tape around the glued edges, leaving the unglued part untaped for the pole. Put half of the tape on one side, folding the other half over to the other side of the sign. Cut the masking tape with scissors instead of ripping it to help the edges look clean.\nSTEP FOUR: PAINT BACKGROUND\n- Paint background with acrylic or latex paint. Paint both sides and the edges. Depending on the paint quality and opacity, you may need two coats of paint.\n- Semigloss paint can handle rain best!\n- You can also paint the poles so they are colorful too!\nSTEP FIVE: ADD LETTERING AND DETAILS\nAfter the background is dry paint the text and any missing details, like messaging you’re using, or detail in the object. Draw your design out on paper first. Both painting and stenciling work well on cardboard signs. Decorate both sides of the sign so it can be read in both directions.\nAim for high contrast between background and text colors to help make the text visible. Keep all slogans or phrases short and bold.\nIf you are making many signs that are the same size and with the same message(s), you can make a stencil for your design. You can then spray paint or use a roller to stencil the design onto your signs.\nSTEP SIX: ATTACH TO POLE\n- You can use any length of flat or round pole, but taller is great for getting the signs above heads in a crowd.\n- To attach the pole gently pry open the un-glued, untaped bottom of the sign and slide the pole between the layers, all the way to the top of the sign. If it the tape tears or the pole won’t slide in easily, you can cut the top of your pole into a 45 degree point and/or put duct tape over the tip so the sign slides on easily. If you are attaching leaves to the pole, you can staple and glue them on.\n- You can staple the poles in place if they feel loose at all, but if you want to be able to take the poles out easily (for transport or re-use) don’t staple them in until you are ready to use them.\n- You can leave some signs to be hand held without a pole for variety, depending on the event.\nSTEP SEVEN: CARRY!\n- Have all your signs ready to go for your event. It looks good to have a group of people carrying the signs close together for a strong visual impact.\n- Make sure you get some good photos of the signs to share on social media!","You have probably noticed that, every now and then, there’s an unused portion of exterior paint sitting in the back of the vehicle or down in the garage. Perhaps you have even considered making use of that leftover paint on your wall, your front lawn, or in a certain room in your house.\nIs Exterior Paint Suitable for Interior Painting?\nYou can, but you shouldn’t necessarily. Are you interested in making use of external paint or indoor painting? Here the tips for the answer you’re looking for.\nWhen it comes time to paint the inside or outside of your home, the type of paint you use is an important decision. You want a paint that will last and look great for years. But can exterior paint be used indoors?\nThe answer is yes, but there are a few things you need to consider before you start painting. Check this post for detailed answer for your query.\nFirst, What are the main types of interior and exterior paint?\nThere are many different types of interior and exterior paint to choose from. Knowing the difference between them will help you select the right type of paint for your project.\nInterior paints are typically divided into two categories: latex and oil-based. Latex paints are water-based and more environmentally friendly, while oil-based paints are more durable and can be used on a variety of surfaces.\nThere are four main types of interior paint: latex, acrylic, enamel and oil. Latex paint is the most common type; it is water-based and easy to clean. Acrylic paint is a newer type of paint that is made with plastic resins; it dries quickly and is resistant to fading. Enamel paint is a type of oil-based paint that dries to a hard finish; it is good for high-traffic areas. Oil paint is the oldest type of interior paint; it takes longer to dry but is more durable than other types of interior paint.\nExterior paints are also typically divided into two categories: latex and oil-based. Latex paints are less expensive and easier to apply, while oil-based paints offer better protection against the weather.\nIt is important to choose the right type of paint for your project, as using the wrong type can lead to problems like peeling or bubbling. Consult with a professional if you’re not sure which type of paint is best for your needs.\nCan You Use Exterior Paint Indoors?\nThere are a lot of myths out there about paint. One of them is that you can’t use exterior paint indoors. But is that true? Can you really use exterior paint indoors without causing any problems?\nThe answer is yes, you can use exterior paint indoors. However, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, make sure the interior surface is clean and dry before painting. Second, use a primer if the surface isn’t already primed. Finally, avoid using too much paint – it’s thicker than interior paint and might not spread as well.\nIn fact, exterior paint is often the best option for homeowners looking to coat interior walls. The main reason is that exterior paint is formulated to withstand adverse weather conditions, such as high heat and rain. It also contains a higher concentration of pigment than interior paint, which makes it more durable. Lastly, exterior paint typically contains a higher level of moisture resistance than interior-grade paints. This prevents the paint from being damaged by humidity and moisture in the air.\nPoint to be considered for using Exterior paint for Indoor use\nThe first is the climate. If your home is in a dry climate, exterior paint may not be suitable for indoor use. It can be too harsh on your walls and cause them to crack or peel.\nIf you live in a humid climate, however, exterior paint can be used indoors without any problems. Just make sure the walls are properly prepared and sealed before you start painting. Exterior paint is designed to withstand weather conditions, so it will be more durable than interior paint when used indoors.\nIf you follow these tips, you should be able to successfully use exterior paint indoors without any problems.\nCan You Use Interior Paint Outdoors?\nInterior paint is not typically designed to be used outdoors, as it is less heat resistant and may not hold up in direct sunlight. If you are looking for a paint to use on an outdoor surface, it’s best to opt for an exterior paint that is specifically made for the elements. However, if you are determined to use interior paint outdoors, make sure to pick a color that isn’t too light – as it will likely fade in the sun. Additionally, avoid using a high gloss finish, as it will reflect the sun’s rays and cause the paint to overheat.\nThese are a few things to keep in mind. First of all, interior paint is not as heat resistant as exterior paint, so it’s best to avoid direct sunlight. Secondly, since interior paint is designed to be used in a controlled environment, it may not hold up as well in extreme weather conditions. So if you’re planning on painting an outdoor surface that will be exposed to severe weathering, it’s best to use an exterior paint specifically designed for that purpose."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f622b5f3-7091-4c2e-bf95-9faa7effb76f>","<urn:uuid:f1a4b466-762b-4d76-be6e-c32264ba323f>"],"error":null}

Ismail Bukhary|","Addiction Treatment Therapies\nThose who need treatment for substance use disorders may be unaware of what the whole rehabilitation process entails—including the full range of potential therapeutic offerings.\nSome people may equate rehab with some form of medical detox, but detox alone is not a substitute for more comprehensive, longer-term addiction treatment.1 Continued treatment can help prevent relapse and lower relapse-related risks, such as overdose.1,2 Ongoing addiction treatment is likely to consist of several therapeutic approaches combined with the intention of increasing treatment engagement, changing maladaptive behaviors, and ultimately helping people achieve long-term abstinence.1\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\nWhile originally utilized to treat depression, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was later adapted to help prevent relapse in people with substance use disorders such as alcoholism and cocaine addiction.3,4 The treatment method, and its application in addiction medicine, is based on the theory that individuals can best modify their substance use behavior by identifying learned patterns linking specific contexts, thoughts, and feelings as they relate to maladaptive behaviors (in this case, drug and/or alcohol use).4\nIn recognizing these patterns, people may begin to “unlearn” them. They may work toward these ends through the development of better coping skills—such as by avoiding high-risk situations, places, people, or other triggers, as well as by improving their ability to manage cravings and more-positively react to negative thoughts/moods.3,4\nRecovering from addiction isn’t just about working on the issues that brought someone to treatment, but about managing ones yet to emerge in the future. Patients need to be prepared for what awaits them post-treatment, and CBT techniques can help with that. While it would be ideal to altogether avoid triggers and other stressors, it’s not always possible. Armed with a set of improved coping skills learned through cognitive-behavioral approaches, individuals leaving treatment may be better prepared, should they encounter a new trigger, to take a step back and think about how to proceed before they act. That’s really what CBT is all about—retraining a potentially maladaptive pattern of thoughts and behaviors to a more healthy, positive one.\nMotivational Interviewing (MI) approaches clients in a manner that allows them to come to terms with the reasons they are in treatment and what they need to address on their own to make progress in recovery. This guided process uses specific methods of questioning clients so they can come to terms with what has been stopping them from moving forward with the changes they desire to make.\nIn many cases, continuing to drink or use drugs and getting help for the underlying substance use disorder(s) represent opposing desires for individuals in treatment. Using motivational interviewing techniques, therapists work with their patients to help resolve this ambivalence in favor of reinforcing the resolve and recovery efforts made to quit.3 There are four core principles of motivational interviewing. They are:5\n- Express empathy—Rapport may be better developed with the patient in recovery by demonstrating empathy. Therapists repeat patients’ statements back to them through reflective listening in order to convey that they are present and understand how they feel in terms of ambivalence to treatment.\n- Develop discrepancy—Therapists subtly point out how current patient behaviors may interfere with the positive changes they want to see happen in their lives. The perception of this discrepancy can motivate change\n- Roll with resistance—Therapists use compassion and empathy in the face of resistance, rather than confrontation or demands.\n- Support self-efficacy—Therapists can boost self-esteem and self-confidence of the individual in treatment. Believing in one’s own ability to make healthy changes helps motivate them to realize their goals.\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is a type of psychotherapy for people with post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. Its therapeutic potential comes from its ability to reduce the emotional distress associated with certain traumatic memories.6 Such a therapeutic effect may also be helpful when applied to cases of co-occurring substance use disorder and trauma-related mental health conditions.\nThrough EMDR, patients in recovery work to replace negative emotional reactions to specific problematic memories with less-charged ones or, even, positive ones.6 The person in treatment will be asked to recall specific traumas while performing a pattern of repetitive eye movements (or, in some cases, sequences of finger tapping or musical tones), and this “dual stimulation” helps that individual to work against the negative feelings that the trauma evokes.6\nA positive, replacement thought becomes the focus while the client engages in the repeated behavior for 20-30 seconds or however long the therapist deems necessary. After this process is complete, the client discusses the experience with the therapist. The EMDR process is then repeated as long as negative feelings remain present in an effort to retrain the mind in how to respond to the initial traumatizing thoughts.\nDialectical Behavioral Therapy\nDialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) is a cognitive-behavioral treatment approach initially developed to help decrease the self-harming and self-defeating behaviors commonly encountered in individuals with borderline personality disorder. This therapeutic approach has since been adapted to treat people with various other mental health issues, including substance use disorder.3,6 DBT combines the emotional regulation of CBT with the teaching of mindfulness skills, distress tolerance, and improved interpersonal effectiveness with the goal of decreasing continued substance use.3\nExpressive, Holistic and Complementary Therapies\nArt therapy and music therapy are both forms of expressive therapy used at some treatment centers to complement some of the more standard approaches to substance abuse rehabilitation. Neither require the client to be artistically inclined. Rather, individuals learn different art techniques through classroom sessions that focus on giving participants healthy and positive ways to relieve stress while doing something they enjoy.\nThese therapies are less about the end product—the musical performance or the finished artwork—and more about the creation process. Oftentimes, various feelings and issues may come up in the creation process that may be further explored in individual therapy.\nOther complementary approaches that may be encountered at certain treatment centers:\n12-Step Facilitation / Recovery Groups\nActive participation in peer support or self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, or other 12-Step program varieties is an important element of many long-term treatment strategies. 12-Step facilitation, as a therapeutic intervention, strives to motivate acceptance of the need for abstinence and foster a willingness to actively engage with 12-Step fellowship programs as a means of lasting recovery.3,7\n12-Step meeting attendance provides support for those in recovery from substance abuse and behavioral addictions. These and other mutual support groups (e.g., SMART Recovery) are common components of many individuals’ aftercare routine, following completion of formal, comprehensive rehabilitation.\nIndividual, Group and Family Therapy\nBehavioral therapies—a grouping that may encompass the modalities outlined on this page as well as additional ones not covered here—are the most commonly utilized forms of substance abuse treatment.8 While individual treatment program designs will vary, these types of therapies are likely to be administered in some combination of individual, group, and/or family counseling settings.\nIndividual therapy provides important one-on-one time with a therapist or counselor. Solo sessions with a therapist or counselor create a safe space to share personal issues, and can further serve as opportunities to more closely evaluate recovery progress and allow adjustments to be made to the treatment plan, when needed. In addition, coping skills that will help the client to avoid relapse beyond the treatment period can be honed during these sessions.\nGroup settings may constitute much of the total time spent in therapy while completing a rehab program. The group dynamic avails the wisdom gained by others on similar recovery journeys and can facilitate better interpersonal interaction as a recovering individual prepares to enter the “real world” at the completion of the treatment period.\nThere are many ways family members can give and receive support during their loved one’s treatment experience, and family therapy is one of them. Attending sessions together allows the family unit to begin healing broken relationships and build a solid foundation of trust once again.\nAddiction treatment pharmacotherapy—sometimes referred to as medication-assisted treatment (MAT)—constitutes the standard of care for certain types of substance use disorders, including opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder. MAT combines FDA-approved pharmacotherapies (and, in some cases, off-label uses for other medications) with some combination of behavioral therapeutic interventions (such as the others mentioned throughout this article) to help people with long-term abstinence in recovery.\n- National Institute on Drug Abuse.

{"question":"What was the size and composition of the British Expeditionary Force in 1914, and how did they perform in their first major engagement against German forces?","answer":"The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) initially consisted of approximately 80,000-100,000 men, equipped with 315 guns and accompanied by 30,000 horses. In their first major engagement at the Battle of Mons, they faced significantly larger German forces - around 160,000 German soldiers with 600 guns. Despite being outnumbered, the BEF performed remarkably well due to two key advantages: their professional training and exceptional rifle skills. When the Germans attacked on August 23, 1914, the British troops inflicted heavy casualties on the German infantry, who were advancing in close formation. The BEF held their position along the Mons-Conde canal for 6 hours before being forced to retreat due to the enemy's overwhelming numbers. They suffered 1,600 casualties during this engagement but managed to execute an organized fighting retreat toward Maubeuge and Le Cateau.","context":["Just a matter of weeks after declaring war on Germany, 80,000 members of the BEF, along with 30,000 horses and 315 guns of assorted size were in France and unwittingly marching straight towards an enemy who had already passed through Luxembourg and was now putting Belgium to the sword. The Schlieffen plan was working beautifully.\nOn the 22nd August, a forward patrol of the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards encountered the Germans for the first time. While conducting a reconnaissance along the road heading out from Maisières, four enemy cavalrymen of the 2nd Kuirassiers emerged from the direction of Casteau. They were spotted by the British and turned around, whereupon they were pursued by the 1st Troop under Captain Hornby and the 4th Troop. Corporal E. Thomas of the 4th opened fire near the chateau of Ghislain, the first British soldier to do so in the Great War. He was uncertain whether he killed or wounded the German soldier that he hit. Meanwhile, Hornby led his men in hot pursuit and charged the Germans, killing several. He returned with his sword presented, revealing German blood.\nMeanwhile, to the rear, having got an inkling that things were about to get a bit heavy, the BEF decided to dig in a loose line along the Mons-Conde canal. They didn’t really know how many Germans were on the other side of the canal, but they would find out soon enough. Suffice to say, it would not be a fair fight; less than 80,000 British troops with 300 odd guns, against around 160,000 German soldiers and 600 guns. Ouch.\nAlthough they were facing huge numbers of men and guns on the other side of the canal, the BEF did have two distinct advantages: Firstly, they were professional soldiers, highly skilled and probably the best exponents of the noble art of rifle fire on the planet. Secondly, the German 1st Army, whom they were facing, were under strict orders not to risk outflanking the British, thus potentially losing touch with the German 2nd Army, so they had to launch a more difficult frontal attack. Which they duly did at dawn on the 23rd August 1914. The war was most definitely on.\nThe artillery opened up at dawn and at 9am the first waves of German infantry attacked, their objectives were the bridges that crossed the canal leading them to the British lines. They advanced across open country in close formation and made a perfect target for the trained British riflemen. It was carnage. The Germans suffered terribly, and by noon had made next to no progress at all.\nThe BEF held on for 6 hours before the sheer numbers of the enemy meant they had no choice but to blow the bridges over the canal and retreat to a pre-established second line position a few miles away. The Germans were tired and disorganised and failed to press home any advantage despite their huge numerical advantage. German reserves were called up and massed for a new attack in the evening, It was here that the British commanders finally realised the size of the enemy, and they promptly ordered the retreat. They had already lost 1,600 men and didn’t fancy losing too many more, so the men were organised, rounded up and the order was given: a fighting retreat towards Maubeuge and then down the road from Bavai to Le Cateau almost 20miles away.","The Beginning of the War for Britain\nBritain in 1914\nBritain at the start of World War One, was a much different place than today. Britain in 1914 ruled the largest empire in history, through industrial might, commercial prowess and maritime supremacy. Britain through its colonies, dominions, protectorates and mandates, controlled about a quarter of the World’s land surface and some 435 milion people, or 20% of the world’s population. Half of these people were Hindus. The legal, linguistic and cultural influence of Britain was worldwide and immense.\nBritain was the wealthiest country in the world and had the largest and most powerful navy. Britain built 50% of the world’s tall ships, and 40% of the all the world’s merchant fleet flew the British flag. Only Germany produced more than Britain economically. Unchallenged at sea, Britain adopted the role of global policeman. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, Britain’s dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many countries, such as China, Argentina and Siam. British imperial strength was underpinned by new technologies, like the steamship and telegraph, which allowed it to control and defend the empire.\nBritain’s population was about 46 million and it was considered very overcrowded. From 1900, one in twenty British citizens emigrated to the colonies for a better life. In 1912, 300,000 people left Britain. The majority moved to the United States, Australia and Canada.\nLife in Britain could be very poor. About 80% of the British people were ‘working class’ and 90% rented their homes, rather than owned them. One percent of Britiain’s richest people owned 70% of the wealth. The average weekly wage was only £1.40. Life expectancy for a wealthy man was 55 years. Most people in poorer parts of Cities were lucky to live beyond 30 years old. Beer was 2p a pint.\nIt was only compulsory to attend school until the age of 12. Many children left school early to work and support their families. Only 6% of children remained at school over the age of 16. Five million women worked, mostly as maids, cooks and servants, but they did not have the vote and there were no female Members of Parliament. Only half of men could vote. The First World War would change Britain.\nEurope in 1914\nIf Britain was the worlds’ Superpower, Europe in 1914 was the most wealthy and powerful continent on earth. While past civilisations might have built great cities, invented gunpowder or algebra, nothing could compare to Europe’s material and technological culture. Europe was integrated more then, than it had ever been, intrinsically linked by flows of goods, money and people. Europe was an engine room of enterprise and innovation, densely interconnected and criss-crossed by railway lines and telegraph wires. Europe represented the summit of interdependence, with each country relying on its neighbours for resources, markets or access to the rest of the world. The GDP of Europe before the First World War was not equalled again until 1970. Empire was Europe’s supreme product. Imperialism expressed National prestige and superiority and was seen as a legitimate way of organising and improving the world. Little thought was given to the exploitation of indigenous people. Even Europe’s smaller nations like Denmark, Portugal, Belgium or the Netherlands, had empires in the Caribbean, south east Asia or central Africa. Only Austria and Hungary had no colonial empire. However, the slaughter and barbarism of the First World war ended Europe’s credibility as a civilising force. Europe had squandered its wealth fighting the war and many of its nations were in debt. The war and the peace that followed, would change and challenge Europe’s dominance. While London and Paris remained the capital cities of the world largest empires, the Versaille Treaty, signalled a new world order of Nation States running affairs, rather than Empires. The German Kaiser would flee to exile in Holland, his empire would become the German Republic. The German capital city would be moved from Berlin to Weimar. The Austrian- Hungarian empire, built up over centuries, would after four years of war, be carved into the new states of Czechoslovakia. Both Austria and Hungary would be reduced in territory. Austria which was almost completely German speaking, would be forbidden from uniting with Germany again. The once grand imperial capital of Vienna would become an oversized capital of a much smaller Austria. In eastern Europe’, Poland re-emerged as a new country. The Balkans became Yugoslavia. Russia wracked by revolution and civil war, became a Soviet Union of states. The Tsar and his family were shot. The Russian capital was moved from Petrograd to Moscow. At the end of the Great war, the Ottoman Empire was dismantled and a new country called Turkey was created. Arab territories fell under the political influence or direct control of Britain and France, with London replacing Constantinople as the ultimate master of Jerusalem. The Great War was the beginning of the end for Europe’s predominance in world affairs, and for its claim to civilisational superiority. The only countries to emerge from the Great war, stronger, richer and more influential, were Japan and the United States.\nThe British Expeditionary Force (BEF)\nUnder the 1839 Treaty of London, Britain was duty bound to protect Belgium. When Germany invaded Belgium on 4th August 1914, and refused a British ultimatum to withdraw, Britain mobilized the BEF. To a meticulously planned, pre war timetable, the BEF arrived in Belgium within 12 days to halt the German advance. This mobilisation of the BEF was phenomenal. One division alone, contained 19,000 men, 5,600 horse, 75 guns, and 650 wagons. It occupied in column, ten miles of road and required 90 trains to transport. Britan transferred 4 divisons in just 12 days, with the 2nd Corps operating near La Bassee, and 3rd Corps, based at St Omer, in just the first 3 days.\nContrary to popular belief, the BEF were not Britain’s best troops. The majority, were relatively recent enlistments, with a high proportion having less than two years service. The more experienced soldiers, were reservists who had left the army years ago, and their standard of fitness and miltary knowledge varied considerably. However, the quality of Britain’s military training was good and the majority of its Officers and NCO’s were experienced and battle hardened. The British Battalion system was also an excellent way of bonding troops into an effective fighting force.\nThe Four Divisions of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), sent to France in 1914, numbered approximately 100,000 men. Although outnumbered by the Germans by at least ten times, the BEF halted the German advance from 23rd August 1914, at Mons, Le Cateau, and then along the River Marne.\nThese first three weeks of the war were a critical period, in which the German plans to end the war at a stroke were stopped. While the BEF was successful in holding the Germans at bay, much of the Army was destroyed in the fighting. Between 5th August and 30th November 1914, the BEF suffered 86,237 casualties. These represented a large core of the Professional British Army. To replace these numbers and commanders, Britain had to quickly recruit and train New Armies.\nThereafter, the ‘Western Front’ developed into a line of opposing trenches, stretching 460 miles, from the North Sea to Switzerland. There were 25,000 miles of trenches, enough to wrap around the entire planet – front line trenches, reserve and support trenches, connected by communication trenches. This ‘front line’ barely moved for more than two years. Both sides were evenly matched and although they produced deadly new weapons, like tanks, aircraft, and gas attacks, to break the deadlock, these were soon countered, to create a tactical stalemate The civilian population from France and Flanders was evacuated and the occupying forces settled into the long, grinding routine of trench warfare. The Germans were quick to seize the high ground and dug their trenches in deep, taking advantage of the better soil conditions. This gave them a great defensive advantage over the attacking allies.\nIn the first two weeks of October 1914, the BEF was moved from the central sector of the front to Ypres and Flanders. This move shortened its lines of communications which ran through Dunkirk, Calais and Boulonge. Britain was able to protect these ports which were vital to its own supplies and reinforcements, and to the Royal Navy’s command of the Channel. The Battle of Neuve Chappell between the 10-13th March 1915, was an indication of things to come. Britain’s Royal Flying Corps was used for the first time to take observation photos of the German defences. This innovation allowed the BEF artillery to accurate target the Germans and blow a six mile hole in the German front line. However, British telephone cables had been broken by the German shell fire and poor communications with the artillery meant that the BEF infantry could not advance until the barrage stopped. This delay alowed the Germans to regroup. When the BEF 1st Army, eventually attacked, the Germans were ready for them. Some 200 German troops from the Jager 11 Battalion, armed with two Maxim machine guns, firing 600 bullets a minute, held 9,000 British and Indian Troops, at bay for 90 minutes. They could not be moved, as the British artillery was running low on shells. A counterattack by the 16,000 Germans was similarly mowed down by machine guns, but pushed the British back to almost where they began. The battle killed 21,000 men, some of the BEF’s best troops (Ten Victoria Crosses were awarded), but achieved tactically nothing It did however expose the futility and costly stalemate of trench warfare,- massive artillery bombardments, followed by calamitous infantry assaults and costly counter attacks, with little gain. A pattern to be repeated across the entire front line, for next three years.\nOver the next four years the BEFs strength rose to 50 Divisions, and 12 overseas Commonwealth Divisions. This comprised troops from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Newfoundland and the British West Indies.\nThe British and Commonwealth forces fought a number of bloody battles in the defence of the Ypres salient. Other major battles, like the Somme, Messines, Cambrai, Arras and Passchendaele took place across the entire front line during the course of the war.\nIn March 1918, following the earlier capitulation of Russia in the East, Germany with over a million extra troops, began their great offensive on the Western Front aiming to finish the war. Their sweeping advances reclaimed all of the ground the Allies had won before. However, by August 1918, the Germans were a spent force. They had lost many of their best troops in the offensive. The pitted battlefields meant their supply lines were overstretched and slow. German troops became hungry, exhausted and disillusioned. While the German offensive had made large advances, their land gains were not strategic, and did not threaten the allied ports and supply lines. Stiff allied resistance, boosted by fresh American troops arriving on the Western Front, eventually halted the German attacks. The Allies then retook the offensive and through August and September 1918, counter attacked across the old battlefields and beyond.\nThe British Army during the First World War was the largest military force, that Britain had ever put into the field up to that point. Over the course of the war 5,399,563 men served with the BEF, the maximum strength being 2,046,901 men. On the Western Front, the BEF ended the war as the strongest fighting force, more experienced and bigger than the American Army and with better morale than the French Army.\nThe cost of victory was high. The official “final and corrected” casualty figures for the British Army, including the Territorial Force, were issued on 10 March 1921. The losses for the period between 4 August 1914, and 30 September 1919, included 573,507 “killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes” and 254,176 missing (minus 154,308 released prisoners), for a net total of 673,375 dead and missing. Casualty figures also indicated that there were 1,643,469 wounded.\nPhotos: Courtesy of The Imperial War Museum Collection\n1.

{"question":"Can you explain how time dilation affects both space travel near light speed and proximity to massive objects like black holes?","answer":"Time dilation occurs in two ways: through relative motion and through gravity. When traveling at very high speeds, time moves more slowly compared to someone moving at a different speed - this is necessary to keep the speed of light constant at 186,000 miles per second. Similarly, gravity warps space and time, causing time to move more slowly near massive objects. While Earth's gravity creates only minor time dilation effects, objects like black holes create extreme time dilation - the closer you get to a black hole, the more dramatically time slows down relative to observers farther away. This is why in the 'Twin Paradox', if one twin took a 10-year space journey at near light speed, they would return to find their Earth-bound twin had aged much more.","context":["13) What is Time Dilation? Time dilation is counter-intuitive and seems to be totally nonsensical when taken to its logical conclusion. Basically what Einstein discovered was that time is not a constant! It depends on how fast you are travelling. The faster you travel the less you age! The ‘Twin Paradox’ says that if one twin flew off in a hypothetical space ship at close to the speed of light, on a 10 year round-trip to another star system, his brother, who had stayed behind on earth, would have died of old age when he got back! This is not mumbo jumbo, but scientific fact! The Sat-Nav in your car has to take time dilation into effect or you would end up miles from your desired destination!\n13) Are we alone in the universe?\nThere is a very strong tendency among people to believe what they want to believe rather than what is demonstrably true. Many, myself included, would love to believe that flying saucers are real and that we are not alone in the universe, but wanting to believe can cloud your judgement. There has to be more concrete evidence than a few blurred photographs, some indentations in the ground, crop circles and stories of abduction before we can conclude that aliens really have visited us. You could ask yourself, ‘If a race of intelligent beings was advanced enough to build spacecraft, capable of transporting themselves trillions of miles across the galaxy and taking thousands of years to do so, would they really come all this way to our little planet just to make some fancy impressions in wheat fields? Does that strike you as being particularly intelligent? Scientists lean towards a premise known as ‘Occam’s Razor’ which roughly states: ‘The simplest explanation is most likely to be the correct one.’ As Richard Dawkins explains, ‘ It really comes down to parsimony, economy of explanation. It is possible that your car engine is powered by psychokinetic energy, but if it looks like a petrol engine, smells like a petrol engine and performs like a petrol engine, the sensible hypothesis is that it is a petrol engine!…If you hear the clip-clop of hooves in the street it could be a zebra or even a unicorn, but before you assume that it is anything other than a horse, you should demand a minimal standard of evidence! …By all means let us be open-minded, but not so open-minded that our brains drop out!’\nInvoking Occam’s Razor should lead us to the very strong likelihood that crop circles are man-made and not indications of visitations by extra terrestrials from some planet trillions of miles away!\nSome of these UFO enthusiasts even insult our intelligence (and demonstrate their own appalling ignorance) by claiming that the aliens have travelled from another galaxy! Our galaxy, the Milky Way, (comprising around 200,000 million stars), is part of a cluster of galaxies called the Local Group. This stretches the term ‘local’ to the limits because some of the others in this group are more than two million light years away from us. (One light year being the distance a beam of light, travelling at 186,000 miles per second, would cover in a year. About 6 million, million miles.) So even if they could travel at the speed of light (which they couldn’t) it would take them two million years to get here! And if they arrived at the opposite side of the Milky Way from us, it would still take them another thousand centuries just to cross our galaxy!\nSome people argue, ‘If these aliens are very advanced they might well be able to travel at (or above) the speed of light. The very idea that there are limits in nature is abhorrent to many. After all, they argue, the speed of sound was a barrier once, but these days most jet fighter aircraft can exceed it. However, I’m afraid there really are limits in nature. There is an absolute lowest temperature of minus 273 degrees centigrade and nothing can be colder. The speed of light is also finite and cannot be exceeded. Only particles with no mass, such as photons, neutrinos etc can travel at the speed of light. Anything with mass, i.e. a spaceship, would need more energy than there is in the universe to accelerate it to light speed!\nAlthough nothing can travel through space faster than the speed of light, space itself can expand faster. Currently the best theory for the origin of the universe postulates that there was an inflationary period of expansion of the universe, after the big bang, which was well above light speed. This concept is difficult to grasp, but Stephen Hawking’s book, ‘The Universe in a Nutshell’ explains it very well.\nIt is of course possible to travel faster than light relativistically. The American astronomer Edwin Hubble (after whom the space telescope is named) proved that the universe is expanding in all directions. By definition, the further away the other stars and galaxies become the faster they appear to be travelling, relative to us here on earth. Eventually their relative speed exceeds 186,000 miles per second and they disappear from our view. This means that there is an ‘edge’ to the universe beyond which we can never see! The Hubble telescope was pointed at a blank, dark area in space, where nothing was visible and the Ultra Deep Field viewer turned on. What it saw was incredible. There were millions of primitive galaxies looking as they did just a billion years after the big bang. When we look deep into space we see the stars not as they are now, but as they were when their light set off on its journey toward us, hundreds, thousands or millions of years ago! Hubble can see more than half way to the edge of the observable universe and most of the distance back to the beginning of time!\nWe live in exciting times in the exploration of space. In just the last few years we have found over 400 new planets orbiting stars other than our own sun! We always suspected that other star-systems would have attendant planets in orbit around them, but we couldn’t be sure until now. How these planets were found is a resounding triumph for science, because trying to see an ‘extra-sol’ planet, (a planet around another star) is like trying to see a firefly perched on the rim of a searchlight beamed straight at you!\nNo one has yet actually seen one of these planets, but we know they are there because of their dance with their parent star. Each causes the other to wobble as they circle each other and that wobble tells astronomers a great deal about the planet. They can deduce its size, mass, orbital radius and even the length of its year. Much of this information has been ratified by measuring the reduction in the amount of light radiating from the star as the planet crosses in front of it. In one instance they found not just one planet, but three orbiting the parent star! Although we have not yet seen such a planet, we are hopeful that we will soon be able to. Scientists are even now working to build a Hubble-style orbiting interferometer that will damp down the glare from these stars and actually allow us to see these new planets directly. Up to now the only planets we have identified have been Jupiter-sized giants in close orbits. These are highly unlikely places for life to exist, but when the interferometer is up and running, we hope to see earth-like planets that could harbour life, and possibly even intelligent life!\nIt would be egotistical in the extreme to suppose that amongst all those zillions of planets, around all those trillions of stars, in all those billions of galaxies ours is the only one with intelligent life.\nRecently, however, a disturbing theory has been put forward as to why we have still not made contact with ET, even after SETI (The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) has spent years scanning the radio waves from space. The theory is that Hypernovas may be sterilising all planetary life in their parent galaxies! A hypernova is the biggest explosion since the universe was formed by the big bang. Previously the greatest explosions known to astronomers were the Supernovas. When a massive star has burned most of its hydrogen fuel the internal pressure can no longer withstand the star’s huge gravitational attraction and the monster implodes! This triggers an explosion of staggering intensity, momentarily brighter than an entire galaxy, hurling matter light-years out into space and seeding the universe with heavy metals, elements and the ingredients of life. The corpse of the dead star is a bizarre object indeed; a rotating neutron star called a pulsar. It is like a giant atomic nucleus. Its immense magnetic field focuses its radiation into twin beams, from the star’s poles, like a cosmic lighthouse sweeping through space.\nThe discovery of the, even bigger, Hypernovas is worth a mention. In the 60’s and 70’s U.S. satellites, checking for Russian A-bomb explosions in space, detected hundreds of gamma-ray bursts coming from very distant galaxies, billions of light-years away. The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, in orbit around the earth, is detecting more every day. These explosions are so powerful that they briefly outshine every star and galaxy in the whole universe combined! These are the Hypernovas. If one went off in our own galaxy it would strip away the atmospheres of every planet, including the earth, and we would all be roasted by the intense radiation. Perhaps this is why we are listening to a silent cosmos!\nThe best guess as to what generates these incredible events is that a super-massive star collapses so catastrophically that it forms not a pulsar, but a huge black hole.","What is Time Dilation? – With Special Guest Dr. Brian Koberlein\nOne of the strangest implications of Relativity is the concept of time dilation; how people moving at different speeds will experience different amounts of time. Dr. Brian Koberlein helps us figure it out.\nBrian’s last answer is here:\nSupport us at:\nMore stories at:\nFollow us on Twitter: @universetoday\nFollow us on Tumblr:\nLike us on Facebook:\nTeam: Fraser Cain – @fcain\nJason Harmer – @jasoncharmer\nChad Weber – [email protected]\nCreated by: Fraser Cain and Jason Harmer\nEdited by: Chad Weber\nMusic: Left Spine Down – “X-Ray”\nOne of the most interesting topics in the field of science is the concept of General Relativity. You know, this idea that strange things happen as you near the speed of light. There are strange changes to the length of things, bizarre shifting of wavelengths. And most puzzling of all, there’s the concept of dilation: how you can literally experience more or less time based on how fast you’re traveling compared to someone else.\nAnd even stranger than that? As we saw in the movie Interstellar, just spending time near a very massive object, like a black hole, can cause these same relativistic effects. Because mass and acceleration are sort of the same thing?\nHonestly, it’s enough to give you a massive headache.\nBut just because I find the concept baffling, I’m still going to keep chipping away, trying to understand more about it and help you wrap your brain around it too. For my own benefit, for your benefit, but mostly for my benefit.\nThere’s a great anecdote in the history of physics – it’s probably not what actually happened, but I still love it.\nOne of the most famous astronomers of the 20th century was Sir Arthur Eddington, played here by a dashing David Tennant in the 2008 movie, Einstein and Eddington. Which, you should really see, if you haven’t already.\nSo anyway, Doctor Who, I mean Eddington, had worked out how stars generate energy (through fusion) and personally confirmed that Einstein’s predictions of General Relativity were correct when he observed a total Solar Eclipse in 1919.\nApparently during a lecture by Sir Arthur Eddington, someone asked, “Professor Eddington, you must be one of the three people in the world who understands General Relativity.” He paused for a moment, and then said, “yes, but I’m trying to think of who the third person is.”\nIt’s definitely not me, but I know someone who does have a handle on General Relativity, and that’s Dr. Brian Koberlein, an astrophysics professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology. He covers this topic all the time on his blog, One Universe At A Time, which you should totally visit and read at briankoberlein.com.\nIn fact, just to demonstrate how this works, Brian has conveniently pushed his RIT office to nearly light speed, and is hurtling towards us right now.\nDr. Brian Koberlein:\nHi Fraser, thanks for having me. If you can hang on one second, I just have to slow down.\nWhat just happened there? Why were you all slowed down?\nIt’s actually an interesting effect known as time dilation. One of the things about light is that no matter what frame of reference you’re in, no matter how you’re moving through the Universe, you’ll always measure the speed of light in a vacuum to be the same. About 300,000 kilometres per second.\nAnd in order to do that, if you are moving relative to me, or if I’m moving relative to you, our references for time and space have to shift to keep the speed of light constant. As I move faster away from you, my time according to you has to appear to slow down. On the same hand, your time will appear to slow down relative to me.\nAnd that time dilation effect is necessary to keep the speed of light constant.\nDoes this only happen when you’re moving?\nTime dilation doesn’t just occur because of relative motion, it can also occur because of gravity. Einstein’s theory of relativity says that gravity is a property of the warping of space and time. So when you have a mass like Earth, it actually warps space and time.\nIf you’re standing on the Earth, your time appears to move a little bit more slowly than someone up in space, because of the difference in gravity.\nNow, for Earth, that doesn’t really matter that much, but for something like a black hole, it could matter a great deal. As you get closer and closer to a black hole, your time will appear to slow down more and more and more.\nWhat would this mean for space travel?"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:52756b4a-8d66-44b0-9f3e-91aa6eb76807>","<urn:uuid:b38a31dc-d491-452a-987f-bb0913402cc2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"When was Broad Street Station demolished and what replaced it?","answer":"Broad Street Station was demolished in 1953 (30 years after surviving a fire in 1923). It was replaced by a modern office high-rise called 6 Penn Center, which became the corporate home of the railroad and its successors until Conrail's split in 1999.","context":["This week’s World’s Greatest Hobby travels take us to the City of Brotherly Love. Over the city’s long and rich history, railroads have been as much a part of Philadelphia’s character as the Liberty Bell and cheese steaks. From the 1830s through today, Philadelphia has been as central to the history of railroads as the railroads have been to the city.\nIt is not by accident, luck or coincidence that the long-time offices of the Pennsylvania Railroad (and later Penn Central and Conrail) were located right across the street from City Hall. The Pennsylvania’s political influence upon the city and Commonwealth were perhaps only overshadowed by its economic contributions.\nFrom 1894 to 1952, the Pennsylvania’s corporate offices were held in the upper floors of the magnificent Broad Street Station. The monumental edifice survived fire in 1923 but couldn’t escape the wrecking ball 30 years later. With most of the through passenger trains calling on the newer 30th Street Station (a monument in its own right), Broad Street was raised – its tracks lowered below the valuable city real estate, and a new modern office high-rise erected in its place.\n6 Penn Center remained the corporate home of the railroad and its successors until Conrail’s split in 1999. Just across the Delaware River, Conrail remains an important player in the region in the form of the South Jersey Shared Assets Area – a terminal operation serving both Norfolk Southern and CSX as it serves local industry and short lines.\nWhile much of the Pennsy’s passenger infrastructure remains in use today by Amtrak and regional commuter carrier SEPTA (South Eastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority), the railroad’s historic freight routes continue to feel the daily rumble of freight trains of Norfolk Southern, short lines and others operating on trackage agreements into the busy port city.\nThe Pennsylvania was far from the only major railroad to call Philadelphia home. With the inclusion of its coal operations, the Reading at one time claimed itself the largest corporation in the world – ahead of even the mighty PRR.\nLike the Pennsy, the Reading erected a passenger terminal to span the ages in the heart of downtown. In addition to the crack passenger runs like the Crusader and the Wall Street, Reading Terminal hosted dozens upon dozens of commuter trains every day. Today the tracks are gone, but Reading Terminal survives as a bustling downtown market where you can go and enjoy some of the city’s other fine hallmarks.\nThe Reading’s freight routes north and west out of downtown remain an important artery. Conrail diverted its traffic to the former Reading and Lehigh Valley mainlines in the 1980s and off of the Pennsylvania’s electrified routes. Those traffic patterns remain in place today.\nThe Baltimore and Ohio\nHeld at bay by the political might of the others, the B&O was always forced into a distant third-place standing in Philadelphia. It finally reached the city through its own subsidiary the Baltimore and Philadelphia in 1884. Connections with the Central of New Jersey would help the B&O compete for traffic further north and east. Construction and rate competition with the PRR helped put the B&O in bankruptcy and the route was forever in the shadow of the Pennsylvania’s neighboring line (and in many places, close enough to be literally in its shadow.)\nToday however, with this historic route in the hands of CSX, competition for Philadelphia’s freight traffic remains viable. With Amtrak trains dominating the former PRR Northeast Corridor, the old B&O has been a more accommodating route for freight."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4a585f1b-a7d4-4e2a-9e04-df234f7420f8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the relationship between NPTX2 protein levels and cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease, and what are the early warning signs of the condition?","answer":"Low levels of NPTX2 protein in the brains of Alzheimer's patients can significantly impact cognition, with levels reduced by up to 90% compared to normal brains. When NPTX2 is reduced while amyloid accumulates, it disrupts brain circuit adaptations and neural rhythms essential for memory processing. Early warning signs of Alzheimer's include difficulty performing complex tasks like balancing checkbooks, language problems such as trouble remembering names of familiar objects, getting lost on familiar routes, personality changes, loss of social skills, and misplacing items. Additionally, people may experience mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as an early stage, showing symptoms like difficulty performing multiple tasks simultaneously and taking longer to complete difficult activities.","context":["Low levels of the protein NPTX2 in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s may change the pattern of neural activity, leading to learning and memory loss.\nLow levels of ‘memory protein’ linked to cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s Disease\nNew research has discovered that low levels of the protein NPTX2 in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may change the pattern of neural activity in ways that lead to the learning and memory loss that are hallmarks of the disease.\nWorking with an international research team led by Johns Hopkins Medicine, the researchers say that the consequences of their discovery, described online in the 25 April edition of eLife, will lead to important research and may one day help experts develop new and better therapies for Alzheimer’s and other forms of cognitive decline.\nAD currently affects more 850,000 people in the UK and more than five million Americans.\nClumps of proteins called amyloid plaques, long seen in the brains of people with AD, are often blamed for the mental decline associated with the disease. But autopsies and brain imaging studies reveal that people can have high levels of amyloid without displaying symptoms of AD, calling into question a direct link between amyloid and dementia.\nThis new study shows that when the protein NPTX2 is “turned down” at the same time that amyloid is accumulating in the brain, circuit adaptations that are essential for neurons to “speak in unison” are disrupted, resulting in a failure of memory.\nDr Mick Craig, of the University of Exeter Medical School, who was part of the team, said: “Researchers have long known that a protein called amyloid accumulates in the brains of those with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but large amounts of amyloid in the brain do not necessarily cause the problems in memory that are most associated with AD.\nOur collaborators found that another protein, called NPTX2, is significantly reduced in AD patients and, importantly, the degree of reduction was related to the severity of memory impairment. NPTX2 is a protein that adjusts how certain types of brain cells, called fast-spiking interneurons, respond to activity in the brain’s circuits.\n“We found that reduced levels of NPTX2 in combination with increased levels of amyloid protein was sufficient to disrupt the ‘rhythms’ of electrical activity in the brain. These rhythms, called neuronal oscillations, are essential for normal processing of information, so their disruption is likely to be the mechanism through which reduced levels of NPTX2 contribute to memory loss disruption in AD.”\n“These findings represent something extraordinarily interesting about how cognition fails in human Alzheimer’s disease,” said Professor Paul Worley, a neuroscientist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the paper’s senior author. “The key point here is that it’s the combination of amyloid and low NPTX2 that leads to cognitive failure.”\nSince the 1990s, Professor Worley’s group has been studying a set of genes known as “immediate early genes,” so called because they’re activated almost instantly in brain cells when people and other animals have an experience that results in a new memory.\nThe gene NPTX2 is one of these immediate early genes that gets activated and makes a protein that neurons use to strengthen “circuits” in the brain.\n“Those connections are essential for the brain to establish synchronized groups of ‘circuits’ in response to experiences,” says Worley, who is also a member of the Institute for Basic Biomedical Sciences. “Without them, neuronal activation cannot be effectively synchronized and the brain cannot process information.”\nProfessor Worley said he was intrigued by previous studies indicating altered patterns of activity in brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s. His group wondered whether altered activity was linked to changes in immediate early gene function.\nTo get answers, the researchers first turned to a library of 144 archived human brain tissue samples to measure levels of the protein encoded by the NPTX2 gene. NPTX2 protein levels, they discovered, were reduced by as much as 90 percent in brain samples from people with AD compared with age-matched brain samples without AD. By contrast, people with amyloid plaques who had never shown signs of AD had normal levels of NPTX2. This was an initial suggestion of a link between NPTX2 and cognition.\nPrior studies had shown NPTX2 to play an essential role for developmental brain wiring and for resistance to experimental epilepsy. To study how lower-than-normal levels of NPTX2 might be related to the cognitive dysfunction of AD, the team examined mice bred without the rodent equivalent of the NPTX2 gene.\nTests showed that a lack of NPTX2 alone wasn’t enough to affect cell function as tested in brain slices. But then the researchers added to mice a gene that increases amyloid generation in their brain. In brain slices from mice with both amyloid and no NPTX2, fast-spiking interneurons could not control brain “rhythms” important for making new memories. Moreover, a glutamate receptor that is normally expressed in interneurons and essential for interneuron function was down-regulated as a consequence of amyloid and NPTX2 deletion in mouse and similarly reduced in human AD brain.\nProfessor Worley said that results suggest that the increased activity seen in the brains of AD patients is due to low NPTX2, combined with amyloid plaques, with consequent disruption of interneuron function. And if the effect of NPTX2 and amyloid is synergistic — one depending on the other for the effect — it would explain why not all people with high levels of brain amyloid show signs of AD.\nThe team then examined NPTX2 protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 60 living AD patients and 72 people without AD. Lower scores of memory and cognition on standard AD tests, they found, were associated with lower levels of NPTX2 in the CSF. Moreover, NPTX2 correlated with measures of the size of the hippocampus, a brain region essential for memory that shrinks in AD. In this patient population, NPTX2 levels were more closely correlated with cognitive performance than current best biomarkers — including tau, a biomarker of neurodegenerative diseases, and a biomarker known as A-beta-42, which has long been associated with AD. Overall, NPTX2 levels in the CSF of AD patients were 36 to 70 percent lower than in people without AD.\n“Perhaps the most important aspect of the discovery is that NPTX2 reduction appears to be independent of the mechanism that generates amyloid plaques. This means that NPTX2 represents a new mechanism, which is strongly founded in basic science research, and that has not previously been studied in animal models or in the context of human disease. This creates many new opportunities,” said Professor Worley.\n“One immediate application may be to determine whether measures of NPTX2 can be helpful as a way of sorting patients and identifying a subset that are most responsive to emerging therapies,” Worley says. For instance, drugs that disrupt amyloid may be more effective in patients with relatively high NPTX2. His group is now providing reagents to companies to assess development of a commercial test that measures NPTX2 levels.\nMore work is needed, Worley adds, to understand why NPTX2 levels become low in AD and how that process could be prevented or slowed.\nRead the full paper, NPTX2 and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer’s Disease.\nOther authors on the study are Meifang Xiao, Desheng Xu, Chun-Che Chien, Yang Shi, Juhong Zhang, Olga Pletnikova, Alena Savonenko, Roger Reeves, and Juan Troncoso of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; Kenneth Pelkey and Chris McBain of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Susan Resnick of the National Institute on Aging’s Intramural Research Program; David Salmon, James Brewer, Steven Edland, and Douglas Galasko of the Shiley-Marcos Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the University of California San Diego Medical Center; Jerzy Wegiel of the Institute for Basic Research in Staten Island; and Benjamin Tycko of Columbia University Medical Center.\nTo find out more about dementia research at Exeter, visit: http://www.exeter.ac.uk/dementia/\nDate: 9 May 2017","Alzheimer diseaseSenile dementia - Alzheimer type (SDAT); SDAT; Dementia - Alzheimer\nDementia is a loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. It affects memory, thinking, and behavior.\nThe exact cause of Alzheimer disease is not known. Research shows that certain changes in the brain lead to Alzheimer disease.\nYou are more likely to develop Alzheimer disease if you:\n- Are older -- Developing Alzheimer disease is not a part of normal aging.\n- Have a close relative, such as a brother, sister, or parent with Alzheimer disease.\n- Have certain genes linked to Alzheimer disease.\nThe following may also increase the risk:\n- Being female\n- Having heart and blood vessel problems due to high cholesterol\n- History of head trauma\nThere are two types of Alzheimer disease:\n- Early onset Alzheimer disease -- Symptoms appear before age 60. This type is much less common than late onset. It tends to get worse quickly. Early onset disease can run in families. Several genes have been identified.\n- Late onset Alzheimer disease -- This is the most common type. It occurs in people age 60 and older. It may run in some families, but the role of genes is less clear.\nAlzheimer disease symptoms include difficulty with many areas of mental function, including:\n- Emotional behavior or personality\n- Thinking and judgment (cognitive skills)\nAlzheimer disease usually first appears as forgetfulness.\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the stage between normal forgetfulness due to aging, and the development of Alzheimer disease. People with MCI have mild problems with thinking and memory that do not interfere with daily activities. They are often aware of the forgetfulness. Not everyone with MCI develops Alzheimer disease.\nSymptoms of MCI include:\n- Difficulty performing more than one task at a time\n- Difficulty solving problems\n- Forgetting recent events or conversations\n- Taking longer to perform more difficult activities\nEarly symptoms of Alzheimer disease can include:\n- Difficulty performing tasks that take some thought, but used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing complex games (bridge), and learning new information or routines\n- Getting lost on familiar routes\n- Language problems, such as trouble remembering the names of familiar objects\n- Losing interest in things previously enjoyed and being in a flat mood\n- Misplacing items\n- Personality changes and loss of social skills\nAs Alzheimer disease becomes worse, symptoms are more obvious and interfere with the ability to take care of oneself. Symptoms may include:\n- Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night\n- Delusions, depression, and agitation\n- Difficulty doing basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, and driving\n- Difficulty reading or writing\n- Forgetting details about current events\n- Forgetting events in one's life history and losing self-awareness\n- Hallucinations, arguments, striking out, and violent behavior\n- Poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger\n- Using the wrong word, mispronouncing words, or speaking in confusing sentences\n- Withdrawing from social contact\nPeople with severe Alzheimer disease can no longer:\n- Recognize family members\n- Perform basic activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, and bathing\n- Understand language\nOther symptoms that may occur with Alzheimer disease:\n- Problems controlling bowel movements or urine\n- Swallowing problems\nExams and Tests\nA skilled health care provider can often diagnose Alzheimer disease with the following steps:\n- Performing a complete physical exam, including a nervous system exam\n- Asking about the person's medical history and symptoms\n- Mental function tests (mental status examination)\nA diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is made when certain symptoms are present, and by making sure other causes of dementia are not present.\nTests may be done to rule out other possible causes of dementia, including:\n- Brain tumor\n- Long-term (chronic) infection\n- Intoxication from medicines\n- Severe depression\n- Increased fluid on the brain (normal pressure hydrocephalus)\n- Thyroid disease\n- Vitamin deficiency\nThe only way to know for certain that someone has Alzheimer disease is to examine a sample of their brain tissue after death.\nThere is no cure for Alzheimer disease. The goals of treatment are:\n- Slow the progression of the disease (although this is difficult to do)\n- Manage symptoms, such as behavior problems, confusion, and sleep problems\n- Change the home environment to make daily activities easier\n- Support family members and other caregivers\nMedicines are used to:\n- Slow the rate at which symptoms worsen, though the benefit from using these drugs may be small\n- Control problems with behavior, such as loss of judgment or confusion\nBefore using these medicines, ask the provider:\n- What are the side effects? Is the medicine worth the risk?\n- When is the best time, if any, to use these medicines?\n- Do medicines for other health problems need to be changed or stopped?\nSomeone with Alzheimer disease will need support in the home as the disease gets worse. Family members or other caregivers can help by helping the person cope with memory loss and behavior and sleep problems. It is important to make sure the home of a person who has Alzheimer disease is safe for them.\nHaving Alzheimer disease or caring for a person with the condition may be a challenge. You can ease the stress of illness by seeking support through Alzheimer disease resources. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nHow quickly Alzheimer disease gets worse is different for each person. If Alzheimer disease develops quickly, it is more likely to worsen quickly.\nPeople with Alzheimer disease often die earlier than normal, although a person may live anywhere from 3 to 20 years after diagnosis.\nFamilies will likely need to plan for their loved one's future care.\nThe final phase of the disease may last from a few months to several years. During that time, the person becomes totally disabled. Death usually occurs from an infection or organ failure.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall the provider if:\n- Alzheimer disease symptoms develop or a person has a sudden change in mental status\n- The condition of a person with Alzheimer disease gets worse\n- You are unable to care for a person with Alzheimer disease at home\nAlthough there is no proven way to prevent Alzheimer disease, there are some measures that may help prevent or slow the onset of Alzheimer disease:\n- Stay on a low-fat diet and eat foods high in omega-3 fatty acids.\n- Get plenty of exercise.\n- Stay mentally and socially active.\n- Wear a helmet during risky activities to prevent brain injury.\nKnopman DS.

{"question":"What role does employee involvement play in implementing workplace safety training versus ISO 14001 environmental management systems?","answer":"In workplace safety training, employee involvement is considered critical for success - workers are encouraged to voice concerns and ask questions during hazard analysis, participate actively in training sessions and discussions, and provide honest feedback for program evaluation. For ISO 14001 EMS implementation, while employee involvement is addressed through training and competence requirements, the focus is more on leadership aspects and communicating EMS aspects across the enterprise through a structured framework. Both systems require clear documentation and evidence of implementation, but workplace safety places greater emphasis on direct worker participation and feedback compared to ISO 14001's more top-down management approach.","context":["Workplace safety training programs are a necessity across all industries. In addition to reducing the amount of injuries in the workplace, businesses will benefit from fewer worker’s compensation claims (which will result in less paperwork and lower insurance premiums), as well as higher employee productivity and morale. And, of course, these programs are required by law.\nStill, creating effective workplace safety training programs like these can seem like a daunting task for many business owners. They require a lot of time and effort, but the payoff is well worth it. And in reality, the overall process is the same, regardless of your specialty or size. If you follow these steps, you’ll have a consistent training program that keeps your workers safe and your business running smoothly.\nStep 1: Determine Your Needs\nThe first thing to realize is that not all safety hazards can be eliminated, even with the highest level of safety training. Some threats simply cannot be addressed with training. But you can better prepare your employees to deal with these hazards properly. To do that, you need to assess the causes of the safety issues within your work environment.\nTraining won’t necessarily make a difference if there’s a physical equipment defect that presents itself. Therefore, you may need to invest in ways to fix these defects in addition to training. But many accidents can be attributed to a lack of employee knowledge when operating equipment, especially when it comes to proper safety procedures. In addition, a poor attitude or lack of personal motivation among your employees could contribute to accidents. While training can tackle many of these issues, you may also need to focus on improving your company culture to get to the root of the problem.\nStep 2: Analyze Your Hazards\nYou won’t be helping your employees or your business by including irrelevant training or leaving out vital information. Your training program needs to address the specific hazards your employees face. This is why a job hazard analysis is key. This analysis will determine what those particular threats are and where the knowledge gaps lie within your own workforce. A job hazard analysis will identify possible hazards during each step your employees take in completing their given tasks. This analysis will be turned into a document or spreadsheet, which will serve as the foundation of your training program. It will outline where your employees experience issues with safety or where they simply don’t have the information they need. You can use this document to see which areas need to be given high priority within your training.\nIn addition, this analysis lets your employees know that you’re taking safety procedures seriously. It introduces your workers to the concept and allows them to voice their concerns and ask questions. Since getting your employees involved is critical to the success of any workplace safety training program, you should encourage and carefully consider their input throughout the creation process.\nStep 3: Develop Your Materials\nIt’s important to keep your audience (i.e., your employees) in mind when designing your training program. The way in which you present these training materials depends greatly on the type of work you do, the problems you face, and on how your business is structured. Training materials used for construction crews serve different needs than those used for those working at an IT company. Some training can be better conveyed with large groups, but other procedures may be better explained with one-on-one training sessions. You’ll need to assess which methods will be the most effective for the material at hand, as well as who receives the presentation. Keep in mind that hands-on presentations with opportunities to demonstrate and practice are often most effective.\nYou’ll also need to consider who is best equipped to present this information. While a business owner or supervisor may be well-suited to instruct in certain cases, an outside instructor may be a better choice for other businesses.\nUltimately, regardless of presentation or material type, these training sessions need to be relevant to the jobs and situations your employees will encounter on the job. You neither want to waste your employees’ time nor leave out information that could keep them safe.\nStep 4: Schedule Your Training\nNow that your materials have been developed, you can start scheduling these sessions. Regardless of whether you run them yourself or hire someone outside the company, the information you present needs to be organized, clear, and relevant. Provide real-life examples that your employees can relate to and encourage their participation in both the training itself and discussions you hold afterwards. You’ll also want to be sure to follow up in the days before and after to reinforce everything that’s covered.\nDuring training, make it clear that safety is everyone’s concern. Employees and managers on every level have an equal responsibility to maintain a safe work environment. While you may provide them with equipment and training to help them stay safe, your employees are responsible for using that equipment and putting their knowledge to good use. You should have a zero-accident goal, so make sure your employees understand there is no such thing as an “acceptable loss.”\nStep 5: Evaluate Your Results\nIn reality, providing these training sessions is just one part of the program. You need to make sure the program you’ve devised is actually effective. One way is to ask your employees for their honest feedback. This can be done through anonymous surveys or through discussions. You’ll also need to check in regularly with your supervisors to see whether behaviors and attitudes have shifted since these sessions were held.\nIn the end, the proof is in the pudding. Your long-term safety data provides the ultimate evidence as to whether conditions have improved. If your accident rates or “near miss” reports have decreased, you’ll know you’re onto something.\nStep 6: Continue Your Efforts\nEven if your training program has showed positive results, you’ll need to implement it as a regular part of your company routine. And along the way you’ll undoubtedly find ways to improve as new problems emerge and new employees are hired. If you don’t stay on top of these things, then the safety of your environment can fall by the wayside due to equipment amendments or employee turnover.\nTherefore, you need to continue your employee training and ensure that everyone within the company is on the same page. Evaluate how you can make these sessions even more impactful. Refer back to your job hazard analysis and other data you have at your disposal. Expect that your program will change over time; eventually, it won’t require drastic alterations -- just small tweaks here and there.\nRemember that employee culture and habits won’t change right away. But if you analyze the situation carefully, get your employees on-board, and keep a watchful eye on the problems to which your environment is prone, you can create a workplace safety program that will benefit your business in countless ways.\nThis guest post was contributed by Transportation Safety Apparel for Workplace Safety Group","The Basics of Meeting the New ISO 14001 EMS Requirements\nISO 14001 is an international standard that forms part of the larger ISO 14000 series of standards dealing specifically with issues of environmental management and responsibility.\nThe ISO 14001 requirements are separated into four clauses, of which the forth clause further sub-divides into sub-clauses that cover the specific requirements for setting up and managing and Environmental Management System. It is imperative to meet all the general requirements, as well as the requirements for the environmental policy, planning, implementation, operation, checking, and management review. Note that the first three clauses in ISO 14001 only deal with the standard’s scope, terms and definitions and the references.\nMore on the General Requirements\nThe first section of Clause 4 covers the general requirements such as the scope and documentation of the EMS.\nWhat the Environmental Policy is About\nThe environmental policy section is specifically focussed on what is needed for the setting up of the policy, which ultimately becomes the main aim of the environmental management system. This sub-clause is for the executive management of the company and one of the requirements is to include the outline and details of the company’s commitment to environmental responsibility such as pollution prevention and compliance with the country’s legal requirements.\nEmphasis of the Planning Sub-Clause\nThe sub-clause highlights the importance of assessing how the enterprise processes impact and interact with the surrounding environment and how the firm plans to ensure on-going compliance with the various legal requirements surrounding these. Planning must include the objectives and goals of the environmental management system.\nRequirements for Implementation\nOperation goes along with implementation and this forms the bulk of the sub-clauses in the forth clause. It stipulates the resources, authorities, and role requirements in addition to EMS training, competence and awareness. A part of the section covers the setting up and controlling of the relevant documentation. It also covers preventative requirements for dealing with environmental emergencies, as well as steps to prevent recurrences and minimising impact of incidents on the environment.\nAssessment and Checks\nNo policies and processes should go unchecked. With this section, the monitoring and measurements of the various processes and compliance with legal requirements are covered. It includes aspects such as non-conformity in the processes, the relevant corrective actions to take and steps to prevent risks from escalating into real-life and environmentally threatening situations.\nIdentification of potential problems and proper safekeeping of the relevant EMS documents and records are essential as evidence of the functionality of the EMS. Internal auditing systems must be in place for reviewing the EMS and identifying areas, which has to be improved to ensure conformity with the ISO 14001 requirements and compliance with legal frameworks.\nManagement review forms an integral part of EMS management. Regular reviews must be done to ensure that sufficient resources are used for the environmental management system to achieve optimal functioning. In essence, the management reviews can be seen as the on-going maintenance programme for continued improvement.\nWhat are the Challenges?\nThe main challenge for an enterprise is to make sure that the EMS meets the enterprise needs whilst making provision for on-going improvement, as this will eliminate the risk of stagnation while the environmental risks change.\nWho Develops the ISO 14000 Series?\nThe International Standards Organisation’s Technical Committee and its related sub-committees develop this standards series. It is an internationally accepted series of standards that helps to standardise how firms set up and regulate their interaction with the environment in a responsible and sustainable manner. The series is relevant to any size enterprise regardless of the industry in which it operates.\nRevision of ISO 14001\nThe revision of ISO 14001:2004 became known as ISO 14001:2015. The standard provides the requirements to be met if a company wants their EMS to be ISO 14001:2015 certified. The ISO standards are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure relevancy to the enterprises operating in the current and future markets.\nThe changes that were made to ISO 14001:2004 include more focussing on leadership aspects and more focus on the growing importance of EMS within the enterprise’s strategy developments. An additional step that can be taken for environmental protection, and that has been included and the new standard, is an increased focus on resource usage to limit contribution to climate change. It includes a lifecycle approach regarding impact and requirements for improving the enterprise’s performance as related to the EMS. The new standard also provides the framework for setting up a strategy to communicate the various aspects of the EMS across the enterprise.\nThe revised standard includes more information on control and documentation, as well as competence requirements. It also addresses the general impact of the setting up and implementing of the internal auditing process. The revised ISO 14001 follows the same structure as the other updated standards such as ISO 9001 to ensure better integration of the various ISO-compliant management systems and thus cost savings in setting up and managing these.\nBenefits of Complying with ISO 14001 Requirements\nEnterprises that comply with the ISO 14001 requirements benefit from improved usage of resources and the overall reduction of waste. In addition, the companies benefit from lower costs because of more efficient processes. With compliance and certification, companies obtain the necessary proof of their commitment to environmentally sustainable practices.\nWith an increase in international pressure to reduce the human impact on the environment and the economical footprint, trading partners and clients alike prefer doing business with ISO 14001-compliant firms.\nCompliance furthermore helps companies to meet the legal requirements of their countries while also improving on their standing with clients and stakeholders. Compliant enterprises gain a competitive edge in the international arena over non-compliant firms, as international trade partners often only want to do business with compliant firms.\nWith well over 290 000 certifications already done regarding ISO 14001 in more than 168 countries across the globe, it becomes clear that non-compliant firms will eventually have to get in line to ensure on-going competitiveness in the marketplace.\nWWISE assists firms wanting to become compliant in several ways including preparation for certification, integration of the EMS with other ISO management systems, training, internal and external audits and consultation services."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d6e7c599-f3cc-4e6d-ba6e-05baf96300b1>","<urn:uuid:9365edd9-ba78-4ef3-b257-c72895a746ae>"],"error":null}
{"question":"根系形态学特征 (root morphological characteristics) comparison: What distinguishes switchgrass hybrid roots from typical fibrous root systems in terms of structural adaptability?","answer":"Switchgrass hybrids show adaptive root traits that vary based on location and environmental conditions, as demonstrated through community garden testing across different latitudes, with genetic contributions from both lowland and northern upland ecotypes affecting their performance. In contrast, typical fibrous root systems have specific standard characteristics - they lack leaves, nodes, internodes and buds, have a protective root cap at the tip, lack pith, and contain distinctive endodermis and pericycle features. While fibrous roots generally store less starch than taproots, they are typically more efficient at absorption from shallow sources and are easier to transplant.","context":["Switchgrass community gardens help distinguish genetic bases of fitness traits from climactic influence.\nTo better understand the genetic basis of local adaptation, researchers established community gardens of switchgrass plants in 10 different field sites on a north-south gradient across the United States. Hundreds of the switchgrass plants in these gardens are clonally propagated crosses between southern lowland and northern upland ecotypes. Early results from these large-scale field tests conducted over two years reveal fewer tradeoffs in plant fitness and adaptation than expected.\nThe perennial grass switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a candidate bioenergy feedstock, with deep roots that allow it to access nutrients easily from a variety of soils and a higher tolerance for extreme water conditions. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is interested in finding ways of increasing the plant’s biomass yield to develop sustainable biofuels. By field-testing the adaptability of switchgrass hybrids in a wide range of environmental conditions, researchers hope to eventually develop a “generalist” switchgrass that would thrive and produce high levels of biomass in various regions.\nIn plant nurseries, the plants often have tags that note their best growing conditions such as full sun, infrequent watering, and even favorable growing regions within the country. These notes highlight local adaptation, or how a plant has adapted to thrive within a specific set of environmental conditions. In the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a multi-institution team led by Tom Juenger at the University of Texas at Austin, and including researchers at the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center and the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI), a DOE Office of Science User Facility, conducted a large-scale field experiment to uncover the genetic basis of local adaptation in switchgrass.\nCollaborating with a community of switchgrass researchers, Juenger’s team developed switchgrass hybrids, more than 400 of which were then clonally propagated and sent to 10 field sites in multiple states, representing 17 degrees of latitude within the country. Having the same plants growing at these community gardens – a method previously applied to poplar, one of the JGI’s Flagship Plant Genomes – allowed researchers to consider how the plant’s genes interact with the environment, and look at the genes involved in specific fitness traits such as biomass production and flowering time with the aid of a method called quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. Samples were regularly collected at the sites over two full years, with sequencing and analysis assistance through the JGI’s Community Science Program. The switchgrass genomes are available on the JGI’s plant portal Phytozome.\nAmong the team’s findings: location determined when the switchgrass plants flowered and emerged in spring (green up); gardens further south flowered earlier than those in the north. Additionally, they found that contrary to expectations, they had fewer tradeoffs in the genetic contributions to local adaptation across the geographic range of the study. For example, variants of genes from the lowland ecotype increased biomass production at many of the field sites, or were neutral compared to the variants of genes from the northern upland ecotype. These results are helping them sort out the traits and underlying genes to help develop a switchgrass cultivar with high biomass production in multiple planting zones.\nRamana Madupu, Ph.D.\nBiological Systems Sciences Division\nOffice of Biological and Environmental Research\nOffice of Science\nUS Department of Energy\nThe University of Texas at Austin\nThis research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research award numbers DE-SC0014156 (to TEJ) and DE-SC0017883 (to DBL; USDA-DOE Plant Feedstocks Genomics for Bioenergy).

Ballon","The plant root system constitutes the major part of the plant body, both in terms of function and bulk. In terrestrial plants, the root system is the subterranean or underground part of the plant body while the shoot is the aboveground part. Roots are branching organs which grow downward into the soil, a manifestation of geotropism. Branching occurs irregularly and not from nodes as in stems.\nIn contrast to shoot, the plant root has no leaves, nodes, internodes and buds. With rare exception, roots also lack stomata. Other morphological and anatomical features which are distinct to this plant structure are: (1) a hard, protective root cap at the tip of the root; (2) absence of the pith; (3) presence of endodermis; and (4) presence of pericycle next to the endodermis. These features are found in the root apex which is divided into three regions: (1) a region of cell division which includes the apical meristem protected by the root cap, (2) a short region of cell elongation where individual cells elongate and force the root tip to move forward through the soil, and (3) a region of cell differentiation and maturation.\nIn general, the plant root system either consists of a taproot system (with primary root) or fibrous roots (adventitious roots) with attached branch roots and finer rootlets having root hairs close to the tip.\nRoots are so massive that their total dry weight may exceed that of the entire plant body. Quantitative investigation revealed that a single rye plant (Secale cereale) that was 4 months old had a total root length of 387 miles (623 km) or an average root growth of about 3 miles (4.83 km) per day. It consisted of some 14 million separate branch roots, with more than 14 billion root hairs. All the roots and root hairs convert to an equivalent total absorptive surface area in contact with the soil of almost 640 sq meters, all contained within a limited volume of about 2 cu ft (0.057 cu. meter) of soil. (Went and The Editors of Life 1963; Feininger 1968; Mader 1993).\nRoot length may also exceed shoot length many fold. The roots of corn (maize), sugar beets, and cotton may extend downward up to a depth of 5-6 feet (~1.5-1.8 meter) (Chevron Chemical Company 1984). A five-year old breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) with a height of 7 meters can have lateral roots up to 200 meters in length. However, coconut trees which can grow to heights of 20-25 meters have roots which are only 8-10 meters (Farm forestry News 1992, 5(2):1 in Agroforestry Seeds Circular, March 1993. p. 30).\nAs reviewed by Gomez and Prado (2007), coconut roots usually grow to a depth of close to 0.80 m with 60-90% found in the top 0.5 m of the soil. In 10-year old dwarf coconut grown under rainfed conditions, the effective root zone of absorption was at 1.4 m from the trunk. Coconut has no root hairs but it produces plenty of roots with a large quantity of rootlets (biodiversity.org, accessed December 7, 2010).\nDespite being inconspicuous because they are normally hidden underground, the plant root system performs various functions which are essential to growth and development. The extent of underground expansion of this plant structure serves as limitation in the growth of the plant. Thus potted plants usually exhibit slow growth but once the roots leak out from the bottom of the pot and penetrate into the ground, growth rate accelerates.\nThe functions of the plant root system include:\n1. Anchorage and support. The plant root system anchors the plant in the soil and provides physical support. Redwood trees (a gymnosperm) about 100 meters tall have stood erect for thousand years only because millions of individual fibrous roots dig into the ground, even though the depth of penetration is only up to about 5 meters. In general, however, taproot system provides more effective anchorage such that they are more resistant to toppling during storms.\n2. Absorption and conduction. The plant root system absorbs water, oxygen and nutrients from the soil in mineral solution, mainly through the root hairs. They are capable of absorbing inorganic nutrients in solution even against concentration gradient. From the root, these are moved upward. Plants with a fibrous root system are more efficient in absorption from shallow sources.\nIn the desert plants called phreatophytes like the mesquite, the roots seek permanent underground water reserves. These plants are water indicators and knowledge of such plants has been put to use by digging wells where they grow (Went and The Editors of Life 1963).\n3. Storage. The root serves as storage organ for water and carbohydrates as in the modified, swollen roots of carrot, sweet potato (camote) and yam bean (sinkamas). Fibrous roots generally store less starch than taproots. Some roots are capable of storing large amounts of water; the taproots of some desert plants store more than 70 kg of water (Moore et al. 2003). (Click to read Starchy Root Crops, Tuber Crops and Corm Crops)\n4. Photosynthesis. Some roots are capable of performing photosynthesis, as in the epiphytic orchids and aerial roots of mangrove.\n5. Aeration. Plants that grow in stagnant water or other watery places have modified roots called pneumatophores to which oxygen from the air diffuses.\n6. Movement. In many bulb- and corm-forming plants, contractile roots pull the plant downward into the soil where the environment is more stable.\n7. Reproduction. The plant root system also serves as a natural means of perpetuating a species. In mature agoho or horsetail tree (Casuarina equisetifolia) and certain plants, clonal seedlings or offshoots are commonly seen growing profusely around the trunk from horizontally growing roots. Likewise, new plants emerge from left-over tuberous roots after harvest in fields grown to sweet potato (Ipomaea batatas) and yam bean (Pachyrhizus erosus). As a rule, plants with a fibrous root system are easier to transplant than those with tap roots. (click here for more examples of plants that can be propagated by root cuttings).\n(Ben G.

{"question":"As an architectural historian, I'm curious about how temple design principles influence human experience - what are the spiritual design elements of Hindu temples, and how do they compare to broader architectural philosophies about human needs?","answer":"Hindu temples incorporate specific design elements to facilitate spiritual connection - including the garbagriha (a cave-like sanctuary that's small, dark and unadorned to encourage meditation), domes and pyramids that reshape space for energy transformation, and layouts that guide movement from open spaces to confined areas, light to darkness. The temples follow Vastu Shastra principles to focus human energy on the divine. This spiritual approach contrasts with yet complements general architectural philosophy, which recognizes that buildings evolve from basic human needs like shelter and security. While vernacular architecture focuses on practical needs, temple architecture specifically aims to dissolve boundaries between humans and the divine, considering both practical and transcendent human requirements. Both temple and general architecture have evolved to consider environmental sustainability and human behavioral needs, though temples maintain their distinct focus on spiritual transformation.","context":["From Hindupedia, the Hindu Encyclopedia\nTemples are places of focus for all aspects of life - religious, cultural, educational and social. A temple allows visitors to transcend the world of man and to connect with God.\nA temple is a place where you can approach God and realize divine knowledge. Temples are constructed to help aspirants in their journey to enlightenment and liberation. The principles of design and construction and the forms of architecture and decoration were all designed with this principle in mind. All of these are described in detail in the Agama and the Vastu shastra texts. These texts describe how architecture and decorations should be created to help focus human energy on the Divine. Vastu Shastra has a section explicitly devoted to the design of temples.\nTemple are designed to dissolve the boundaries between man and the divine. A temple is not considered to simply be the abode of God, but also is God. God and therefore by implication the whole universe is identified with the temple's design and actual fabric. The ground plan, site location (and its relation to shade and water), its vertical elevation relating to mountains, etc are all important aspects to a temple.\nThe Puranas state that \"The gods always play where groves are near rivers, mountains and springs\". Sacred sites are therefore usually associated with water, shade and lakes are often considered to be sacred and certain lakes have healing and purifying powers. Certain rivers, such as the Ganga, have descended from the heavens and their sacred waters are needed in the temple tank.\nCaves are places of great sanctity. Most of the earliest surviving shrines are rock cut caves. In later temples the garbagriha was designed to resemble a cave and as such was small and dark and the surfaces of the walls were unadorned and massive. The garbagriha is a place that encourages meditation which is possible only in solitude. Approaching the shrine is a movement from open spaces to a confined small space; from light to darkness, from a profusion of visual form and decoration to the visual simplicity of the cave. From this sanctuary the implied movement is vertical, to the symbolic mountain peak directly above the image of the god. This movement upwards is linked to the idea of enlightenment which is identified with the crowning finial of the temple - the amalaka or sikara.\nThe concept of spirituality in the system of sacred architecture in India is something that goes beyond the mere static relations between inert objects and space as found in other architectural traditions. The relationship of objects with one another and space in India's sacred architecture extends to include higher entities said to be in charge of various aspects of universal affairs, all of whom carry out their work in accordance with the will of God.\nMost ancient stone temples were the result of royal patronage and built to benefit of the whole community, they were expressions of the devotion and piety of the ruler and his people.\nThe temples were maintained through donations from royal patrons and private individuals. They were given money, gold, silver, livestock and income from grants of land which sometimes included whole villages.\nHow temples shape and transform energy\nThe purpose of all rituals is directed towards reshaping of human psyche, transformation of individual perception into universal perception, and radical changes in personal thoughts, desires, and ambitions. The space or sky is reshaped in temple architecture through domes, pyramids, various shapes and forms to provide maximum rhythmic response to achieve the desired results.\nAll religious rituals have a definite aim - transformation of the lower energy formats in the human being into the energy form of the outer spaces, or the sky, or the universal being that is immensity. A suitable medium is provided by the sky as shaped by the domes and pyramids. A deity in the temple is a medium to absorb all the individual desires suitably transformed by rituals. The Deep Mala (fire pillar) in the line of the deity's vision in the outer space of the temple serves as the bridge linking the inner vessel of collective desires represented by the deity with outer space or sky that is universal immensity. This fire pillar has a characteristic shape, which points towards the sky. A divine fire, which is the purifying factor in the temples, is lit using ghee made from cow's milk. Through this fire circulates a rhythmic ascending energy form. Deity's vision is normally aligned to the North or the East directions, which are the sources of Jaivik Urja or positive energies.\nTemple architecture represents the concept of evolution and radical changes. The complex energy forms and finer elements are intertwined with deities, trees, plants, colors, shapes and forms in the temple architecture. Different deities in the temple represent body, mind, intellect and the sub-components. These deities are then linked to the cosmos by associating them with specific directions. This philosophy establishes a chain of relationships between micro level elements and the macro level existence. The mandalas available in temples are essentially charts of existence, transformations, and energetic.\nTemple Architecture and Pranayam\nPavan or wind is the bridge for the mind to ascend to the sky. The holistic concept of evolution is defined in terms of the medium - the wind. Wind represents both, the Sound and the sky. Therefore, primordial sounds are the keys to reinforcing the bond between the mind and the sky. Controlling the wind element at individual level is called pranayam. We can say that the temple architecture provides a natural stage of pranayam, not with any definite individual efforts, but through various forms, shapes, rituals, and sounds. These parameters establish a unique path for correlating the wind and the sky. Domes and pyramids in the temple transform the sound into the mandalas. The echo of this rhythmic primordial sound takes the wind to the sky. The Gurutatva is described as 'Akhand Mandalakaram'. This means that the rhythmic mandalas created by the echo of primordial sounds activate the gurutatva in the human mind.\nIn other words, temple architecture creates a space for holistic atmosphere of natural Pranayam suitable for any individual. Echo of primordial sounds enters the limitless finer circles beyond the audible range and helps the mind to transcend maya to reach the Absolute.\nTemple Design Manuals\nThe Agamas and the Vastu Shastra texts are the scriptural authorities on temple architecture. They give precise details and formulas prescribing how to design, carve and assemble a temple. The resulting structure and its relationship with its surroundings create a subtle, sublime atmosphere in which ceremonies performed by priests easily lift the veil between this world and the world of the Gods and Devas so their blessings can pour forth to gathered devotees.\nIn fact, temple architecture is a specialized subject in Vaastu Shastra. Right from selection of site, to defining the dimensions of the structure, to placement of water source or pond and deep mala, to determining the exact form and proportions of the idol is described in great detail.\nThe temple should be built at a suitable place, like a Tirtha. The ideal location is a a beautiful place where rivers flow, on the banks of a lake or by the seashore; on hill tops, mountain slopes, or in a hidden valley. The site of the temple may be selected in a forest, a grove, or in a beautiful garden. Temples should also be built in villages, towns and cities or on an island, surrounded by water.\nThe temple itself should always face east since that is the most auspicious direction. From the east appears the rising sun, the destroyer of darkness and the giver of life.\nSignificance of Prakrima\nWhen in a temple, it is customary to circumambulate the deity.\nWhen a temple is established and life is infused into the deity through a proper pran pratistha ceremony, divinity enters the deity. This divinity is in the form of magnetic waves starting from the central point of the base of the deity and spreads around in a circle. The vibrations are the strongest near the deity and gradually weaken as the circle becomes larger. The positive vibrations influence a person walking around the deity.\nThe magnetic field moves in a clockwise direction, therefore, it is essential that one walks around the deity clockwise. By moving along the magnetic field of the deity one can benefit from the positive vibrations one receives. These vibrations are a blessing that strengthen the worshipper and protect him/her from all kinds of problems and calamities. After completing prayers and offerings, it is therefore customary to walk around the deity.\nThe longer one walks around the deity, the greater the benefit from the vibrations. It is customary to walk 5 to 11 times around a deity.\nReligious texts direct that when going around the deity of Shankar one should not cross the line where the offering of milk and water flows. For this reason, one takes only half a round around Shankar. One returns and then does the other half because the vibrations around Lord Shankar move both clockwise and anti-clockwise.\nWhen one walks anti-clockwise, the divine vibrations that move clockwise counter the individual's personal vibrations, gradually destroying them. Therefore, the anti-clockwise movement is prohibited. The harmful effects vary according to the Deity being circumambulated.\nThere are four kinds of rituals conducted in a temple: nitya (daily), naimittika (occasional), kamya (optional) and prayaschitta (expiation).\nMore about Temples\nTemples throughout India\nTemples of Andra Pradesh\nTemples of Karnataka\nTemples of West bengal\n- Kalighat Temple\n- Dakshineshwar Temple\nTemples of Gujarat\n- Somnath Temple\n- Dwarkadhish Temple\n- Dakor Temple\nTemples of Jammu & Kashmir\n- Vaishno devi Temple\nTemples of Tamil Nadu\n- Thiru Aayarpaadi Sri Kari Krishna Perumal\n- Pallikondeswara Swamy Surutapalli Devasthanam\n- Vasishteswaraswamy Temple\n- Sri Naganathaswamy Temple Thirunageshwaram\n- Sri Balasubramanya Swamy Temple Ayikudi\n- Sri Dharbarenyeswarar Temple Thirunallaru\n- Sri Swedaranyeswarar Temple Thiruvengadu\n- Sri Kalyanavaradharaja Perumal Temple Paruthiyur\n- Karungaali Sri Chinthaamaneesarar\n- Thiruverkaadu Sri Karumaari Amman\n- Thiruverkaadu Sri Vedhapureeswarar\n- Kettavarampalayam Sri Ramar\n- Madhuraanthakam Eri Kaatha Sri Raamar\n- Vallakkottai Sri Subramanyar\n- Thiruninravur Sri Hridhayaaleeswarar\n- Thiruninravur Sri Bhakthavatsala Perumal\n- Thirumazhisai Sri Othaandeswarar\n- Thirusoolam Sri Thirusoolanaadhar\n- Singaperumal Koil Sri Ugra Narasimhar\n- Chettippunyam Sri Varadharaja Perumal\n- Thirukkachur Sri Kachabeswarar\n- Thirukkachur Sri Oushadheeswarar\n- Hanumanthapuram Sri Agora Veerabadhrar\n- Chenganmaal Sri Chenganmaaleeswarar\n- Thiru Idaichuram Sri Gnanapureeswarar\n- Sembakkam Sri Jambugeswarar\n- Cherappanancheri Sri Veemeeswarar\n- Thirumalai Vaiyaavoor Sri Prasanna Venkatesa Perumaal\n- Ezhuchur Sri Nallinakkeeswarar\n- Ariyathurai Sri Varamoortheeswarar\n- Thiruvidandhai Sri Nithya Kalyaana Perumaal\n- Kolappaakkam Sri Agatheeswarar\n- Somangalam Sri Somanaadheeswarar\n- Gerugambaakkam Sri Neelakandeswarar\n- Porur Sri Ramanaadheswarar\n- Kunrathur Sri Naageswarar\n- Maangaadu Sri Velleeswarar\n- Poondhamalli Sri Vaidheeswarar\n- Kovur Sri Sundhareswarar\n- Maangaadu Sri Vaikunda Perumaal\n- Nandhambakkam Sri Kothandaramar\n- Pozhichalur Sri Agatheeswarar\n- Aathur Sri Muktheeswarar\n- Koyambedu Sri Kurungaaleeswarar\n- Semmancheri Sri Srinivasa Perumaal\n- Vyasarpadi Sri Raveeswarar\n- Pon Vilaindha Kalathur Sri Munkudumeeswarar\n- Ponpadhar Koodam Sri Chathurbuja Kothandaraamar\n- Manimangalam Sri Dharmeswarar\n- Manimangalam Sri Kailaasanaadhar\n- Vallam Sri Vedhaantheeswarar and Sri Giri Varadharaaja Perumaal\n- Kaaladi Sri Aadhi Sankarar","Building first evolved out of the dynamics between needs (shelter, security, worship, etc.) and means (available building materials and attendant skills). As human cultures developed and knowledge began to be formalized through oral traditions and practices, building became a craft, and “architecture” is the name given to the most highly formalized and respected versions of that craft.\nIt is widely assumed that architectural success was the product of a process of trial and error, with progressively less trial and more replication as the results of the process proved increasingly satisfactory. What is termed vernacular architecture continues to be produced in many parts of the world. Indeed, vernacular buildings make up most of the built world that people experience every day. Early human settlements were mostly rural. Due to a surplus in production the economy began to expand resulting in urbanization thus creating urban areas which grew and evolved very rapidly in some cases, such as that of Anatolia and Mohenjo Daro of the Indus Valley Civilization in modern-day Pakistan.\n“A house in Japan is considered differently from one in Europe. It is more transient, sits more lightly on the ground”\nThey grew out of harsh conditions the devastation of war, privations of the aftermath, recurrent earthquakes, shortage of land but then often chose to add voluntary challenges of their own. There are houses where the rooms are separated by courtyards, such that you have to expose yourself to the weather to pass from one to another, or where unusable voids are inserted into already cramped locations, or where normal expectations of privacy, comfort, cosiness, domesticity, beauty and shelter are, with careful deliberation but for reasons not completely explained, challenged.\nThen there are the full-sized constructions, the hut-on-stilts and the white boxes, one the work of the idiosyncratic reviver of traditional craft, the other a recreation of the house of 2005 by the Pritzker prize winner. The latter is conceived as a series of small pavilions connected by courts, recreated here with books, music, films and personal objects recalling the life of its owner. Lighting rises and falls in imitation of the cycle of day and night, accelerated to 60 minutes. When it is darker you can see films projected against the exterior of the building, which is something he likes to do. It is as immersive as the other material is restrained, creating an alternate version of the original rather than a perfect simulacrum.\nThe architecture of different parts of Asia developed along different lines from that of Europe; Buddhist, Hindu and Sikh architecture each having different characteristics. Buddhist architecture, in particular, showed great regional diversity. Hindu temple architecture, which developed around the 3rd century BCE, is governed by concepts laid down in the Shastras, and is concerned with expressing the macrocosm and the microcosm. In many Asian countries, pantheistic religion led to architectural forms that were designed specifically to enhance the natural landscape.\nWith the emerging knowledge in scientific fields and the rise of new materials and technology, architecture and engineering began to separate, and the architect began to concentrate on aesthetics and the humanist aspects, often at the expense of technical aspects of building design. To satisfy the contemporary ethos a building should be constructed in a manner which is environmentally friendly in terms of the production of its materials, its impact upon the natural and built environment of its surrounding area and the demands that it makes upon non-sustainable power sources for heating, cooling, water and waste management and lighting.\nIn the late 20th century a new concept was added to those included in the compass of both structure and function, the consideration of sustainability, hence sustainable architecture.\nWe shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us.\nLandscape architecture is the design of outdoor public areas, landmarks, and structures to achieve environmental, social-behavioral, or aesthetic outcomes. It involves the systematic investigation of existing social, ecological, and soil conditions and processes in the landscape, and the design of interventions that will produce the desired outcome.\nA system architecture can comprise system components that will work together to implement the overall system. There have been efforts to formalize languages to describe system architecture, collectively these are called architecture description languages (ADLs).\nBusiness architecture is defined as “a blueprint of the enterprise that provides a common understanding of the organization and is used to align strategic objectives and tactical demands.” People who develop and maintain business architecture are known as business architects.\nTo restrict the meaning of (architectural) formalism to art for art’s sake is not only reactionary; it can also be a purposeless quest for perfection or originality which degrades form into a mere instrumentality”. Among the philosophies that have influenced modern architects and their approach to building design are rationalism, empiricism, structuralism, poststructuralism, and phenomenology.\nThere was also the rise of the “gentleman architect” who usually dealt with wealthy clients and concentrated predominantly on visual qualities derived usually from historical prototypes, typified by the many country houses of Great Britain that were created in the Neo Gothic or Scottish Baronial styles.\nForests were the first temples of God and in forests men grasped their first idea of architecture.\nSince the 1980s, as the complexity of buildings began to increase (in terms of structural systems, services, energy and technologies), the field of architecture became multi-disciplinary with specializations for each project type, technological expertise or project delivery methods. In addition, there has been an increased separation of the ‘design’ architect from the ‘project’ architect who ensures that the project meets the required standards and deals with matters of liability.\nThe preparatory processes for the design of any large building have become increasingly complicated, and require preliminary studies of such matters as durability, sustainability, quality, money, and compliance with local laws.\nWe need houses as we need clothes, architecture stimulates fashion. It is like hunger and thirst you need them both.\nA large structure can no longer be the design of one person but must be the work of many. Modernism and Postmodernism have been criticised by some members of the architectural profession who feel that successful architecture is not a personal, philosophical, or aesthetic pursuit by individualists; rather it has to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to create liveable environments, with the design process being informed by studies of behavioral, environmental, and social sciences. Cognitive architecture can refer to a theory about the structure of the human mind. One of the main goals of a cognitive architecture is to summarize the various results of cognitive psychology in a comprehensive computer model.\nThere has been an acceleration in the number of buildings which seek to meet green building sustainable design principles.\nEnvironmental sustainability has become a mainstream issue, with profound effect on the architectural profession. Many developers, those who support the financing of buildings, have become educated to encourage the facilitation of environmentally sustainable design, rather than solutions based primarily on immediate cost. Major examples of this can be found in passive solar building design, greener roof designs, biodegradable materials, and more attention to a structure’s energy usage.\nEnterprise architecture applies architecture principles and practices to guide organizations through the business, information, process, and technology changes necessary to execute their strategies. These practices utilize the various aspects of an enterprise to identify, motivate, and achieve these changes.” Practitioners of enterprise architecture, enterprise architects, are responsible for performing the analysis of business structure and processes and are often called upon to draw conclusions from the information collected to address the goals of enterprise architecture: effectiveness, efficiency, agility, and durability."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:86e43fe2-f969-42a4-9f5b-1261888b7da2>","<urn:uuid:0b735351-7abc-4bfe-af17-da037875f93b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Do blood pressure benefits differ between endurance cardio training and combined resistance-sprint training for cyclists?","answer":"Both types of training can benefit blood pressure, but in different ways. Regular cardio activity strengthens the heart, allowing it to pump blood with less effort and decrease arterial pressure, thereby lowering blood pressure. When endurance cyclists add resistance and sprint training to their regime, research shows no negative effects on blood pressure - a study of masters cyclists found no significant differences in blood pressure readings between groups doing pure endurance versus combined resistance-sprint training over a 12-week period.","context":["Endurance training is terrific for your cardiometabolic health in many ways, with lower blood pressure and lower blood lipid levels reported in a number of studies compared to aged matched controls. However, research has also identified that masters-age athletes involved in non-weight-bearing endurance sports such as cycling and swimming have lower bone mineral density compared with other athletes and even inactive controls!\nLower bone density may lead to an increased risk of developing osteoporosis. Consequently, some form of resistance training and weight-bearing activity is recommended for those with low(ish) bone density to help restore bone strength. Road cyclists are you listening??\nEndurance cyclists typically add in either sprint training or some form of resistance training for performance reasons - mainly to add firepower to their attacks and sprint finishes. Sprint and resistance training may also improve bone density. A win-win you say? Well – maybe. As mentioned earlier, endurance athletes generally have better cardiometabolic health than their sprint/resistance counterparts, however for many, adding in sprint and resistance training may require a reduction in endurance training. So does (or will) this affect your cardiometabolic health?\nA recent study (1) conducted in Queensland, Australia took 27 male endurance cyclists (mean age 54 years) with no background of resistance training and all of good health. All participants were involved in competitive cycling and trained a minimum of 8 hours on the bike each week.\nTen (10) of the participants were allocated to a resistance and track sprint-cycling group (RTC), seven (7) to an endurance and track-sprint group (ETC), and the remainder (10) to a control endurance cycling group (CTRL).\nAll groups completed 12 weeks of training in their groups. If you’re interested in the specifics of what each group did you can read the full research paper here.\nThe following tests were conducted pre and post intervention:\n- Stature and body mass\n- DEXA scanning – trunk fat mass & lower limb lean mass\n- Blood measures – fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides\n- Resting blood pressure\nResults: trunk fat mass decreased in all groups, but more so in the RTC and ETC groups (% change: CTRL -2.2%; RTC -5.1%, & ETC -10.4%). Maybe they all trained a little harder and ate a little less as they knew they were being studied, but the body composition changes in the resistance/sprint groups are notable.\nLower limb lean mass (generally the amount of muscle in your legs) was significantly increased in the RTC and ETC groups, i.e. these masters athletes bulked up in their legs in the 12-week intervention period.\nNo differences were noted for any blood measure across time in all groups. Put another way, glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels remained the same from pre test to post test. There were no differences also between the groups for these measures.\nThere were no significant differences in blood pressure readings between groups and over time, and although the ETC had a better VO2peak at baseline, no improvement or deterioration was noted in this measure in the groups over the intervention period.\nThe study by Delvecchio and colleagues adds some valuable evidence to the effects of endurance, sprint, and resistance training in middle-aged and older cyclists. The study has some limitations – subject numbers are small, the groups weren’t randomized, and it would have been great for the researchers to include a bone mineral density scan, a leg strength test, and a cycling time trial as part of their suite of measurements. But cost and time are always a factor.\nIn summary, endurance cycling is good for your health and adding some resistance and sprint training to your regime has no deleterious health effects. In fact, adding some resistance and sprint training will reduce your waistline and improve leg muscle bulk, and will likely improve bone density and cycling performance.\n- Delvecchio, Luke, et al. \"Effect of concurrent resistance and sprint training on body composition and cardiometabolic health indicators in masters cyclists.\" Journal of Exercise Rehabilitation 12.5 (2016): 442.","Cardio Vs Strength Training: Which Is Better for You?\n- 5 Benefits of Cardio Training\n- 5 Benefits of Strength Training\n- 5 Benefits of High-Intensity Resistance Training\nIf you’re a fitness enthusiast, then you already know the value of including both cardio and strength training into your workout regimen.\nBut if you’re a beginner, or maybe returning to exercise after time off, you may be wondering if you should do cardio vs. strength training, what the differences are between the two, and how best to structure your workouts. Let’s dig in:\n5 Benefits of Cardio Training\nCardiovascular exercise is an aerobic activity where you raise your heart rate for a sustained period to train the heart and lungs and boost stamina. Think jogging, hitting the stair climber or row machine, swimming laps, or cross-country skiing. Cardio benefits the body in many ways, including:\n1. Cardio Training Improves Heart Health and Endurance\nIncreased cardio means increased aerobic capacity — the amount of oxygen your blood receives and uses. This improved cardiovascular health allows your heart and lungs to move oxygen through your body more efficiently, which increases your endurance to get through longer training sessions.\n2. Cardio Exercise Reduces Body Fat\nDue to the elevated heart rate and continuous intensity, cardio burns more calories than strength training. This higher calorie burn is why cardio workouts are more often associated with fat loss. That said, there are two types of cardio for fat loss to consider.\nHigh-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): For HIIT workouts, you want to get to at least 80% of your maximum heart rate during the high-intensity intervals and not allow it to drop below 50% for the low-intensity intervals or breaks.\nHIIT workouts help you to retain current muscle mass. HIIT fat loss is believed to be related to an increase in hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), a fat-burning enzyme activated by the release of hormones.\nLow-Intensity Steady State (LISS): LISS workouts consist of aerobic activities (walking, jogging at a leisurely pace, swimming laps, etc.) performed at low intensity for an extended period. It’s the opposite of HIIT.\nResearch suggests that LISS workouts may help burn fat at a higher rate than high-intensity workouts. As a result, LISS is often considered better for anyone with significant fat loss goals, especially since it’s suited for all fitness levels.\n3. Cardio Workouts Increases Energy\nThere’s a complex relationship between stress, hormones, and energy. When you do cardio, your body releases stress hormones (epinephrine and norepinephrine). When released in small amounts through exercise, these hormones give your body energy.\n4. Cardio Regimens Lower Blood Pressure Levels\nRegular cardio activity makes your heart stronger, allowing it to pump blood with less effort, decreasing the pressure on your arteries while lowering your blood pressure. In addition, studies have shown that endurance exercises like running, cycling, or rowing are effective at decreasing blood pressure.\n5. Cardio Activity Increases Mental Clarity\nThe increased blood flow from your cardio routine is good for your body and brain. Improved circulation can lead to better memory, as well as increased alertness and brain function.\n5 Benefits of Strength Training\nStrength training (often called weight training) consists of exercising the muscles against resistance to increase muscular endurance and strength. The muscles are challenged to overcome forces that come from your workout equipment, be it YBells, kettlebells or dumbbells, selectorized machines, or your body weight. Some of the benefits of strength training are:\n1. Strength Training Builds Muscle\nLifting weights builds and sculpts your muscles through hypertrophy, which is an increase in the size of muscles. Weights put more resistance on your muscles, breaking down tissue quickly and triggering your body to heal and build muscle in the process.\nA study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that participants increased their lean mass through a weight training program.\n2. Strength Training Burns Calories Even After the Workout\nWhile cardio training burns more calories during the actual workout, strength training burns calories long after the workout ends. Your muscle is constantly being broken down and built back up, which requires energy (calories). This after-burn leads to a more significant calorie burn throughout the day.\n3. Weight Training Protects Bone Health\nWeight training helps to increase your bone density, which strengthens your bones. Stronger bones can slow down or help to prevent osteoporosis, not to mention avoiding breaking or fracturing your bones.\n4. Strength Training Prevents Injuries\nStronger muscles support your joints, increase your mobility, and reduce your risk of hip or knee damage or arthritis. Strong joints also prevent injury through better balance, coordination and improved posture, decreasing lower back and neck pain.\nA study from the National Library of Medicine showed that strength training reduced the risk of falling by 40% in older people (who are at higher risk of falling).\n5. Weight Training Improves Cardiovascular Health\nWeight training increases lean muscle mass, allowing your lungs to process more oxygen as you breathe and your heart to pump more blood with less pressure. Lowered pressure on your arteries puts less demand on your heart, reducing heart-related health issues.\nIf you regularly lift weights, you’ll reap the benefits of a lowered risk of a stroke or heart attack.\nMeet HIRT: The Perfect Blend of Cardio and Strength Training\nYears ago, gym members had straightforward divisions of cardio vs. resistance training. Today, with the rise of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), Tabata training, and high-intensity resistance training (HIRT), the pure distinction between cardio and strength work has blurred. Sweat sessions often combine the two.\nSo instead of 30 minutes of pure cardio or strict strength, you might do 5 minutes of cardio, followed by 5 minutes of strength. Or you may perform 50 jumping jacks, 15 YBell pick-up cross catch squat presses, 25 burpees, and 15 YBell push-ups.\n5 Benefits of High-Intensity Resistance Training\nWith HIRT, you get all the benefits of HIIT, cardio, and strength training.\n1. HIRT Decreases Fat and Increases Muscle\nCombining cardio and strength gives you the best of both workout regimens: cardio’s fat loss and strength training’s muscle gain.\nHIRT training increases your resting energy expenditure, causing increased fat oxidation. Much like in strength training, HIRT increases your excess post-exercise oxygen consumption as your body recovers from the workout. So you’re burning more energy and breaking down stored fat while you build muscles.\n2. HIRT Enhances Your Cardiovascular Health\nA recent study showed that participants who did resistance and cardio training for eight weeks lowered their heart disease risk factors more than those who did just cardio or just strength.\n3. HIRT Strengthens Your Bones\nBy stressing your bones, resistance training increases bone density and reduces the risk of osteoporosis-related fractures. Several studies have shown that women who do regular resistance training see significant increases in the bone density of their hips and spine.\n4. HIRT Takes Less Time\nGroup classes might last 30 to 40 minutes, but you can achieve a highly effective HIRT workout at home in as little as 10 minutes. It’s all about keeping up your intensity for the elevated heart rate and muscle gain.\nIf you’re low on spare time, you can still sneak in a quick workout during your lunch break or between household chores.\n5. HIRT Is a Sustainable and Fun Workout\nExperienced athletes and those new to working out often find that they can commit to HIRT training better than traditional weight or cardio workouts. That’s because HIRT workouts are much more engaging, requiring you to be agile and focused, whether you’re working out alone or with a group.\nSo Is Cardio or Strength Training Better for You?\nFor optimal fitness, both cardio and strength work are necessary. But, beyond that stipulation, there’s lots of flexibility in how you put together your workout routine.\nVarious research draws conflicting conclusions regarding whether it’s better to do cardio or strength training first. Intuitively, it makes sense to perform cardio first if your goal is to improve endurance so you can run a marathon. However, if you want to build strength and muscle, hit the weights first while your body is fresh.\nVariety and cross-training deliver the best results, so mix up your routine with multiple modalities when possible. If you like doing cardio workouts on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and strength training on Tuesday and Thursday, do that.\nIf you do a HIRT workout with YBells twice a week, that counts as both your cardio workout and strength training. Pick other exercise modalities on alternating days, such as yoga or swimming laps for active recovery.\nLots of options exist. What’s most important: get in both cardio and strength, and adhere to regular workouts!\nFor more than 25 years, Julie King has been a certified group exercise instructor and personal trainer, holding certifications from the American College of Sports Medicine, the American Council on Exercise, the Aerobics and Fitness Association of America, the Aquatic Exercise Association and Schwinn/Mad Dogg Athletics.

{"question":"What was the highest military rank achieved by Werner Voss and Heinrich Ehrler during their respective military careers?","answer":"Werner Voss reached the rank of Leutnant, which was the lowest Commissioned Officer rank, receiving a Reserved Commission. Heinrich Ehrler achieved the higher rank of Major when he was appointed to Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of JG 5 on August 1, 1944.","context":["All enlisted personnel in the German Military start out as a \"Soldat\" or their branch equivalent. For instance a soldier in a Hussar regiment would be referred to as a \"Husar\" or \"Ulan\". While other other Armies had distinctions between privates, in the German Army all privates were basically the same, thus the German rank structure, while comparable to other Armies is not an exact fit. For instance, the Rank of Gefreiter is roughly equivalent to a Lance Corporal or Private First Class in the US Army, yet the responsibilities assigned to the Gefrieter are more in line with a Junior NCO (Corporal).\nFurthermore German Soldiers progressed through the ranks at a very slow pace. Typically a Soldat would not be eligible for promotion to Obergefreiter until he had been in the Army for six years.\nVoss joins the Westphalian Hussars on !6 November 1914 assumes the rank of Husar (troop) or Ulan (lancer). His rank equivalent in other armies would be that of a recruit or Private.\nGefreiter: Acting Corporal (sometime referred to Lance Corporal).\nEffective: 27 January 1915\nGefreiter is the lowest rank given to an Non-Commissioned Officer in the Imperial German Army. While the title \"acting\" sounds temporary, it is not. It refers to soldier that does not have the time in grade and has not attended a NCO training course but has proven that he is capable of being a corporal by his actions. Upon completing the necessary training he would be promoted to Obergefreiter (Corporal). For all intents and purposes, the responsibility of the position similar to corporals or lowest ranking NCOs in other armies\nUnteroffizier: Acting Sergeant.\nEffective:18 May 1915\nThe main difference between the Unteroffizier and the Sergeant is time in grade and lack of official schooling. Voss had gone from Hussar or Private to Unteroffizier in less than seven months.\nVizefeldwebel: Staff Sergeant.\nEffective: 2 March 1915\nThe Vizefeldwebel and above wore an officer's sword knot and a peak on the field cap. Voss had completing training an instructor with FEA7 and this training is probably what elevated him to the rank of Vizefeldwebel or Staff Sergeant.\nEffective: 9 September 1916\nLeutnant, the lowest Commissioned Officer rank. Most pilots in the German Army were given a Reserved Commission. It gave them all the authority and responsibility of a career or regular army officer but without the guarantee of still holding the commission after the war was over. Thus Voss's commission differed from that of von Richthofen's in that Richthofen had gone through a military school and had obtained a regular army commission (For more information on German Rank, see Rank Insignia of the German Army, 1914-18\nThe German did not award the same medal more than once. After all the award was for continual action and not individual acts. Thus, if the soldier continued to prove himself he would usually receive an award higher importance rather than the same award again. Also a soldier would not receive a medal of lesser value if he had already earned a higher award.\nEiserne Kreuz 2 - EK2 (Iron Cross, 2nd Class)\nAwarded on or about: 27 January 1915\nWerner Voss received the EK2 upon being promoted to Gefreiter. The promotion and the award were most likely given because of his continual display of bravery, his leadership skill, or both.\nThe Eiserne Kreuz (EK) or Iron Cross was awarded to individuals other than senior commanders for superior merit in combat. It was specifically designed as a war time award.\nThe combat version of the EK2 had a black ribbon with two white edge stripes, the non-combat version had a white ribbon with two black edge stripes.\nTypically only the ribbon was worn with the uniform. It was passed through a buttonhole on the tunic.\nPilot's Badge (Prussian)\nAwarded on or about 28 May 1916 Despite the common belief, the Pilot's Badge was not awarded upon completion of pilot training. A pilot would receive the Pilot's Badge after gaining experience in aerial combat. Voss completed pilot training and was immediately assigned as an flight instructor. He remained a flight instructor for six months and therefore was incapable of receiving his Pilots Badge.\nVoss was assigned to a combat unit in February. Even though Voss was an accomplished pilot he flew as an observer for some time. This was not uncommon in such units. New pilots would fly as observers in order to become acclimated to aerial combat. Once they became confident and trusted in the air they would then assume the duties as the pilot.\nThis explains why Voss went to flight school in August 1915 but would not receive his Pilot's Badge until nine months later.\nEiserne Kreuz 1 - EK1 (Iron Cross, 1st Class)\nAwarded on or about: 2 December, 1916\nVoss received the EKI for his first two aerial victories which occurred on 27 November, 1916.\nMost Jasta pilots received the EK2 upon confirmation of the first aerial victory and would typically get the EKI around their fifth aerial victory. However, it was common practice to give the EK1 for a first aerial victory if the pilot had already earned the EK2, rather than have him wait until he achieved five victories. It probably had more to do with building confidence than anything else.\nThe EK1, was identical in every way to the EK2 except that it did not have the neck ribbon. Instead it was affixed to the uniform with a pin clasp . It was was worn on the left breast pocket.\nThe Cross of the Order of the House of Hohenzollern\nAwarded on or about: 27 March 1917\nThe House of Hohenzollern was a Prussian order bestowed on officers for bravery in combat. It normally was awarded if the recipient had already received the EK1. Among Jasta pilots, it was typically awarded somewhere between their twelfth and fifteenth victory but this was not always the case.\nVoss was credited with his fifteenth victory on 11 March 1917 and managed to increase his score by seven additional victories in less than two weeks. He had actually passed the mark for the Pour LeMérite within one week of when he should have received the Hohenzollern! Because of his quickness in the air, Voss received the Hohenzollern after achieving 22 aerial victories. While some authors have used this as proof that there was a conspiracy against the working class Voss, it most likely was due to the fact that he could shoot planes down faster than German Staff Officers could process paperwork!\nTo the credit of Voss's superiors they insured that he received the Order of the House of Hohenzollern before receiving the Pour LeMérite.\nPour LeMérite (The Blue Max)\nAwarded on or about: 8 April 1917\nThe Pour LeMérite was awarded for repeated and continual acts of gallantry in action. It was required to be worn while in uniform. It was never awarded posthumously. By 1917, the Pour LeMérite was typically awarded to combat pilots after confirmation of their 20th victory. Typically, along with the award, the pilot would receive a month's leave.\nVoss received his Pour LeMérite after his twenty-fourth victory, just one week and two victories after receiving his Order of the House of Hohenzollern. Again this probably had more to do with how slow paperwork moved rather than some kind of class conspiracy within the German Army.","14 September 1917|\n4 April 1945\n|Years of service||1935–45|\n|Unit||JG 77, JG 5 and JG 7|\n|Commands held||JG 5 Eismeer|\nSpanish Civil War\nWorld War II\n|Awards||Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves|\nHeinrich Ehrler (14 September 1917 – 4 April 1945) was a German Luftwaffe military aviator during World War II, a fighter ace credited with 208 enemy aircraft shot down in over 400 combat missions. The majority of his victories were claimed over the Eastern Front, with nine claims over the Western Front which included eight in the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter.\nScapegoated for the loss of the German battleship Tirpitz, Ehrler - who had been nominated for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords prior to the disaster - was court-martialled, stripped of his command and sentenced to three years and two months Festungshaft (honourable imprisonment). Ehrler's sentence was later commuted and his loss of rank rescinded, and in February 1945 he was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 7. According to his fellow pilots, Ehrler thereafter flew in the increasingly desperate air battles without the purpose and dedication that had made him one of the Luftwaffe's most successful aces. On 4 April 1945, he shot down two Allied bombers for his final two victories, before destroying a third by ramming with his damaged aircraft after having run out of ammunition.\nEarly life and career\nEhrler was born on 14 September 1917 in Oberbalbach, present-day it is part of Lauda-Königshofen, in the district of Tauberbischofsheim of the Grand Duchy of Baden. He was one of eight children of a laborer. When his mother died, his father married again. The second marriage added four further children to the family.\nFollowing a vocational education as a butcher, Ehrler joined the military service of the Wehrmacht on 29 October 1935. He initially served with the 7th battery of Artillerie-Regiment 25 (25th artillery regiment) in Ludwigsburg. He then transferred to the Luftwaffe where he served with Flak-Regiment 8 (8th anti-aircraft artillery regiment) from 7 April to 1 November 1936.\nFrom 2 November 1936 to 15 August 1937, Ehrler served with the 3./Flakbteilung 88 (3rd company of the 88th anti-aircraft department) of the Condor Legion in the Spanish Civil War. Following this assignment, he then served with the 14./Flak-Regiment 5 (14th company of the 5th anti-aircraft artillery regiment) from 24 August 1938 to 1 August 1939. He was then posted to 1./Reserve-Flakabteilung 502 (1st company of the 502nd reserve anti-aircraft department) on 2 August 1939.\nWorld War II\nWorld War II in Europe began on Friday 1 September 1939 when German forces invaded Poland. Ehrler, who was still serving with the anti-aircraft artillery, requested transfer to the fighter force of the Luftwaffe on 3 January 1940. His transfer request was accepted and he underwent flight training from 1 February to 4 November 1940. During this training period he was promoted to Feldwebel (staff sergeant) on 1 July.\nEhrler was posted to 4./Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77—77th Fighter Wing) based in Norway.[Notes 1] He scored his first victory in May 1940. JG 77 supported X. Fliegerkorps (under Luftflotte 5) in operations against Britain from bases in Norway, often providing fighter cover for Stuka attacks against British shipping. JG 77 was restructured as JG 5 Eismeer in January 1942. JG 5 operated from bases in northern Norway and Finland, and they mostly engaged Russian aircraft, but were also given the task of intercepting British raids on Norway.\nEhrler achieved his second victory on 19 February 1942. He was promoted to Leutnant and made Staffelkapitän (squadron leader) in 6./Jagdgeschwader 5 (JG 5—5th Fighter Wing) after his 11th victory on 20 July.[Notes 2] On 4 September, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) for 64 aerial victories. The presentation was made by the Fliegerführer Nord Oberst Alexander Holle. By 1 June 1943 he was promoted to Hauptmann and appointed Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander) for II./JG 5. During this period he was also awarded the Eichenlaub (Oak Leaves) to his Ritterkreuz. On 25 May 1944, he achieved nine victories in one day, bringing his tally up to 155. On 1 August, he was appointed to Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of JG 5 and at the same time was promoted to Major.\nSinking of the Tirpitz\nOn 12 November 1944 the RAF launched its final raid against the battleship Tirpitz. Avro Lancaster bombers from 617 and 9 squadrons were sent to Håkøya a little west of Tromsø where the Tirpitz was based.\nEhrler was in command of 9./JG 5 at Fliegerhorst Bardufoss with 12 operational Focke-Wulf Fw 190 A-3s. The Staffel was at 10 minutes' readiness status due to the continuing pressure of British bombers in the Tromsø area. Ehrler's unit was scrambled airborne, but he received conflicting messages as to the enemy aircraft location and course. Some reports claimed Alta was the target area, others indicated Bodø. When it finally became clear that the target was the Tirpitz, it was too late for the fighters to intercept, and the Tirpitz was destroyed with much loss of life.\nAfter this unsuccessful action, Ehrler faced a court martial hearing in Oslo on the grounds of his not having understood the seriousness of the attack. Evidence was presented that supported the contention that his unit had failed to respond to requests from the Kriegsmarine for help. Ehrler was found guilty. He was relieved of command, demoted and sentenced to three years in prison. Ehrler had been recommended for the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords prior to the disaster, but the award was not approved.\nWalter Schuck, one of his junior officers, appealed to Reichskommissar Josef Terboven. On 12 January 1945 Terboven hand-delivered Schuck's affidavit in support of Ehrler to Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe. Further investigations and testimonies indicated that the aircrews did not know that the Tirpitz had been moved to the new location at Håkøya a couple of weeks earlier, and Heinrich Ehrler was a convenient scapegoat for the failure to protect Tirpitz. The investigation concluded the reason for the failure was poor communication between the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe. Ehrler was exonerated. Shortly afterward, the Führer HQ announced Ehrler's release and return to front-line service, where he would have the chance to \"rehabilitate himself.\" Ehrler's sentence was commuted and his loss of rank rescinded. He was reassigned to an Me 262 fighter squadron in Germany.\nTransfer to Germany\nEhrler was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 7 (JG 7—7th Fighter Wing) on 27 February 1945. JG 7 was equipped with the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, and was given the task of Reichsverteidigung (Defense of the Reich). During the next five weeks, Ehrler scored a further 8 kills,[Notes 3] bringing his tally to 206.\nOn the morning of 4 April 1945, Maj Ehrler flew his last sortie and achieved the last three of his 208 recorded victories. Flying out of JG 7's airfield at Brandenburg-Briest, accompanied by his wingman, was in the skies 50 kilometers east of Hamburg when B-24 Liberators from the 448th Bombardment Group began forming their bombing run of Parchim. Ehrler attacked the lead 714th Bombardment Squadron, downing two B-24 Liberator bombers: Lt J. J. Shafter's \"Miss-B-Hav'n,\" (B-24J-1-FO 42-95620) and Lt Mains' \"Red Bow\" (B-24M-10-FO 44-50838). At the time of the attack, two P-51 Mustangs were pursuing Maj Ehrler, and he was being fired upon by the bomber's gunners, taking hits from the tail and waist gunners of Lt G. Brock's B-24 \"My Buddie\" (B-24H-25-FO 42-95083) who reported pieces of fuselage flying off the jet. The attack took place over Büchen.\nMinutes later, as the 448th Bombardment Group circled back towards their Group RP at Stendal, Ehrler engaged a third Liberator, \"Trouble in Mind\" (B-24H-30-FO 42-95298) flown by Capt John Ray's crew over Kyritz (). A reference is made by surviving crew members to cannon hits in the fuselage that destroyed the Liberator, but Ehrler had only moments before he radioed Maj Theodor Weissenberger that he was out of ammunition and intended to ram the bomber. In any case, both planes were destroyed in the ensuing explosion. The B-24 crashed at Krüllenkempe, near Havelberg, as Maj Ehrler's jet fell to earth in the woods of Scharlibbe, where he was killed. His body was recovered the following day at Scharlibbe, near Stendal, where he was buried. Ehrler's grave at Stendal confirms the date of death as 4 April 1945.\n\"Theo, I have run out of ammunition. I'm going to ram this one. Good bye. We'll see each other in Valhalla.\" - Heinrich Ehrler's last transmission over the Squadron Radio Network before he rammed the B-24 bomber \"Trouble in Mind,\" piloted by Captain John Ray, destroying both aircraft and killing himself. \"Theo\" refers to Theodor Weissenberger.\nWalter Schuck who followed the R/T exchange over the loudspeaker in the ops room recalls Ehrler's last words slightly differently. He believes they were: \"Theo, Heinrich here. Have just shot down two bombers. No more ammunition. I'm going to ram. Auf Wiedersehen, see you in Valhalla!\"\n- Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe (20 July 1942)\n- German Cross in Gold on 18 March 1943 as Leutnant in the 6./Jagdgeschwader 5\n- Front Flying Clasp of the Luftwaffe in Gold\n- Iron Cross (1939)\n- Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves\nRecovered BF 109 G2\nA BF 109, number 13605 of the 6./JG 5 was found in Russia, and was later purchased and recovered by warplane restorer Jim Pearce on November 2003. The aircraft was the one flown by Ehrler on his 200th kill. Afterward he transferred to JG 7 to fly the Me 262. The airframe was later shot down by Russian Flak over northwestern Russia and was forced to land in the tundra, and had sat there until it was recovered. It is currently being restored.\n- For an explanation of the meaning of Luftwaffe unit designation see Luftwaffe Organization\n- There is some doubt as to when this happened.  says 22 August,  says 20 July.

{"question":"What types of industrial transitions occurred in both Glen Mills and Victory Mills over time?","answer":"Both locations underwent significant industrial transitions. Glen Mills evolved from iron production (starting with Sarum Forge in 1749 and the state's first iron-slitting mill in 1756) to paper manufacturing in the mid-1800s. Victory Mills transformed from a cotton manufacturing facility (operating from 1846 to 1928) to various other industrial uses - becoming a board and carton corporation in 1937, then housing operations for pharmaceutical and food carton manufacturing until 2000. Currently, while Glen Mills has developed into a suburban community with various storage facilities, the Victory Mills building is being redeveloped into apartments and a brewpub at a cost of about $60 million.","context":["Storage Types in Glen Mills\n- Boat Storage Units in Glen Mills, PA\n- Businesss Storage Units in Glen Mills, PA\n- Vehicle Storage Units in Glen Mills, PA\n- Climate Controlled Storage Units in Glen Mills, PA\n- RV Storage Units in Glen Mills, PA\nOther Storage Unit Options in Glen Mills, PA\nStorage Unit Sizes in Glen Mills\nAbout Glen Mills\nGlen Mills is a mid-size community about 27 miles west of Philadelphia. It's known for its strong role in the early paper industry, and the historical sites in the area attract many visitors to this small town. In Glen Mills, you'll enjoy a close proximity to the big city as well as a quiet suburban lifestyle at home.\nThe History of Glen Mills\nGlen Mills started as an industrial village where entrepreneur John Taylor built Sarum Forge in 1749. Seven years later, he erected the state's first iron-slitting mill and pioneered the ironmasters tradition in this area. Glen Mills' rich stores of iron ore supported the local economy throughout the 18th and 19th centuries and beyond. The American Revolution increased demand for certain iron products, including munitions, but by cutting off trade routes and destroying forges, the British made it difficult for ironmasters to maintain their businesses. Today, a historical marker in Glen Mills commemorates the iron industry and its impact on local citizens from the city's earliest years.\nThe town was named for two paper mills that existed in the mid-1800s, owned by the local Wilcox family. These mills played an important role in manufacturing paper for the U.S. government, specifically a unique, patented paper to be used for government notes and bonds.\nLiving in Glen Mills\nGlen Mills has many unique local attractions, ranging from quirky entertainment to historical points of interest. One of the area's more unusual attractions is the Bates Motel and Haunted Hayride, which has scared visitors for a quarter of a century. During the Halloween season, it's a popular destination for people from many of Glen Mills' neighboring communities.\nLongwood Gardens serves as another locally-treasured spot in Glen Mills. This attraction features classes, lectures, and research opportunities as well as acres of plants and flowers. The greenhouses offer many plant species to explore, and Longwood Gardens is devoted to both sustainable gardening and the furthering of the arts in Glen Mills. You can view art installations and galleries on the grounds as well as listen to concerts hosted by local musicians.\nOn weekends, you can take the West Chester Railroad, a living-history railway that travels between West Chester and Glen Mills. It provides the experience of traveling back in time to the original West Chester and Philadelphia Rail Road, which arrived in the town in 1858.\nGlen Mills Schools\nThere are a few options for primary and secondary education in Glen Mills, including the private Glen Mills School and public elementary, middle and high school campuses under the jurisdiction of Garnet Valley School District.\nResources for Moving to Glen Mills\nHere's some useful information for planning your move to Glen Mills:\n- Utilities: PECO is Glen Mills' primary energy provider, while the Concord Township manages local water and sewer services.\n- Garbage and Recycling: Although Glen Mills is part of the Concord Township, there aren't any town-provided waste disposal services. Instead, you'll choose a private company for trash and recycling collection.\n- Transportation: The greater Concord Township is part of the SEPTA public transit network.\nGlen Mills Housing\nMost homes in Glen Mills are single-family detached properties with three or four bedrooms, and there's a good mix of newer construction and older houses. The median home price in Glen Mills is higher than both the state and national averages, but there are enough options to make it easier to find something to fit your budget.","Developers are working to turn the 1918 cotton mill into 186 apartments and a brewpub at a cost of about $60 million.\nThe site was home to textile factories from 1846 to 1929. The village and mills are named for the American victory at the Battles of Saratoga, a turning point of the American Revolution (the Postal Service uses the name Victory Mills). The Saratoga Battle Monument of 1883 is within the Village and the General Phillip Schuyler House, Marshall House, and the Saratoga National Historical Park and National Cemetery are nearby.\nIn 1846 “The Saratoga Victory Manufacturing Company” built a three-story cotton cloth factory costing $425,000. Erection of the mill coincided with the Potato Famine in Ireland and many Irish immigrants found work in the mill. The Village of Victory was incorporated in 1849 and in 1850, the cotton mill employed 160 men, 209 women, working at 12,500 spindles and 309 looms and produced nearly 2 million yards of cotton cloth.\nBy 1877, the company had expanded considerably, employing some 700, with 26,000 spindles and an annual production of 819,988 pounds, or almost 4.5 million yards. The complex included the pickers house; the main mill building for spinning carding and weaving; cloth and starch rooms; a large dye house and two store houses. Additional buildings were scattered around the property, including a paint shop, cement house, carpenters and blacksmiths shops, boiler house and company offices. The whole complex was powered by Fish Creek.\nThe existing five-story brick and reinforced concrete mill building was built in 1918 by the American Manufacturing Company. It has six towers, five encase stairways while the sixth contains a water tower. It processed cotton until 1928, when its operations were moved to Guntersville, Alabama.\nIn 1937, the complex was purchased by the United Board and Carton Corporation. A.L. Garber / Wheelabrator-Frye operated the factory from 1972 to 1977, then Clevepak Corporation, who manufactured folding pharmaceutical and food cartons until 1983. In that year Victory Specialty Packaging Company began making cartons there. In 2000 the operations in the building ended, and it has remained vacant since. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.\nA 22-acre parcel across Gates Road to the north, now called Victory Woods, was donated to the Saratoga National Historic Park by the mill owners in the 1970s, but could not be developed until 2005 when the park secured a management plan and necessary funding. The park moved ahead with archeological and landscape assessments however.\nDuring archeology work artifacts were found from 5-8,000 years ago, but remains from the 1777 British Army’s occupation of the site had been lost to looters over the years.\nThe loss of this archeological record was significant, although archival documents from the period were researched resulting in a series of exhibit panels that paint a picture of the final days of the British Army in Victory Woods. Trails opened there in 2009.\nThe proposed mill site on Fish Creek redevelopment includes a Brownfield Cleanup Program project. NYSDEC in consultation with NYSDOH has made a determination that while the site is contaminated, it does not pose a significant threat to public health or the environment. DEC is accepting written comments about the proposed clean-up plan, called a “Draft Remedial Action Work Plan (RAWP)” through December 5, 2020. You can access the RAWP and other project documents online through the DECinfo Locator.\nAdditional site details, including environmental and health assessment summaries, are available on NYSDEC’s Environmental Site Remediation Database (by entering the site ID, C546047).\nMore information can be found inn an online project fact sheet.\nPhotos, from above: Victory Mills complex; Victory Mills Fish Creek Saratoga County Map; and Victory Mills Fish Creek Saratoga County Nineteenth Century Mill Map insert."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6c8ba484-ccfc-46f5-ae68-4fdffe54d850>","<urn:uuid:bce4a7ed-3c0c-4b90-9a64-38420235bb49>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm interested in longevity science - how do the stress reduction benefits of proper highway merging technique compare to the cellular stress from polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs)?","answer":"While proper highway merging technique reduces stress by following specific steps (signaling, finding an opening, matching speed, and merging), PUFAs actually increase cellular stress. PUFAs create mitochondrial uncoupling, increase oxidative stress through superoxide production, and reduce cellular energy efficiency. This cellular stress from PUFAs can decrease longevity, while safe driving techniques help prevent acute stress and accidents.","context":["Highway driving is the last thing students learn when mastering the skill of driving. The reason for this is simple: highway driving is done at high speed and you need to have good control over the vehicle to be able to react to the ever changing on road situation. It is much easier to master and polish your driving skills in a less stressful environment and get on the highway only when you feel confident behind the wheel. Today we are looking at the NYC permit test question that deals with entering highways. While this may seem as a complicated task at first, you will be able to get a hold of it very quickly, provided you have plenty of practice. Make sure to check out other questions on out NY permit practice test before you hit the NYDMV.\nPermit Practice Question\n“WHEN ENTERING A HIGHWAY FROM AN ENTRANCE RAMP, YOU SHOULD GENERALLY:”\nA. Enter above the speed of traffic to get ahead\nB. Enter slowly to avoid other vehicles\nC. Stop first, then slowly enter traffic\nD. Accelerate to the speed of traffic\nIf you are anything like us, you love searching for the right answer yourself. Pick up a copy of the New York drivers handbook and check the section on driving on highways. You are bound to pick up a lot of other useful information while searching for the correct answer to this NY permit test question.\nPermit Test Answers\nAnswer A to this practice permit test NY sample quiz suggests that you should enter a highway above the speed of traffic to get ahead. There are a few problems with this approach. Going too fast may not give you enough time to merge before the lane ends. It is also illegal to pass vehicles in the acceleration lane, you may get cited for it. Another thing is that drivers who are already on the highway do not expect anyone to be traveling faster then them through the acceleration lane and may not have enough time to react to your maneuver.\nAnswer B to the NY permit practice test tells you to enter the highway slowly to avoid other vehicles. Sadly, this is not correct and acceleration lanes were given this name for a good reason. If you enter the highway at low speed, you may be rear-ended by someone who is traveling at higher speed.\nAnswer C to the NYS practice permit test suggests that you should stop first and then slowly enter the highway. This option is even worse then the one before it. If you stop, you will not be able to pick up enough speed to enter the highway. Unless there is a special sign that explicitly instructs you to stop before entering the acceleration lane, you should not do that.\nAnswer D to the New York state practice permit test claims that you need to accelerate to the speed of traffic. So far, this seems to be the most reasonable option.\nCorrect Permit Test Answer\nThe correct answer to this permit test NY question is D:\n“WHEN ENTERING A HIGHWAY FROM AN ENTRANCE RAMP, YOU SHOULD GENERALLY ACCELERATE TO THE SPEED OF TRAFFIC”\nThere are a few simple steps you can follow when entering highways, if there is an acceleration lane present:\n- Switch your turn signal on to let others know what you are about to do\n- Look for an opening in traffic\n- Accelerate to match your speed to that of the traffic flow\n- Enter the highway\nBe extra careful when entering and exiting highways as other drivers are traveling at great speed and a little mistake may cost you dearly.\nWant to receive a practice permit test question to your twitter every day until you pass your permit test?

CR is often being touted as health enhancing because of a premise that sounds something like this. You fast or eat less than X calories and that has the capacity to slow down metabolism, ensuring that you produce less oxidative stress, autophagy ensues, and this opens up your 8th chakra ready for your beyond meat whopper. It’s true that fasting and CR can probably enhance your health when you are prone to over eating, and beyond that nothing else. Yes you will lose weight (seen as that’s the only variable that many people care about these days), but that result is down to one key fact. You are in a calorie deficit. Can you rebound from that restriction is the question that most need to evaluate.\nCR and fasting promotes improvements to health and extending lifespan but the main reasons that it promotes longevity is probably for several reasons that include.\n1. The restriction of polyunsaturated fats or PUFA.\n2. The restriction of methionine, cysteine and sometimes tryptophan.\n3. Perhaps less consumption of pesticides and metals.\nThe question of do you need to fast, should be rephrased with do you even need to fast? What about addressing what can extend lifespan and still maintain an optimal level of metabolism?\nPUFA and mitochondrial uncoupling\nLet’s start with PUFA which are commonly known as vegetable, seed, fish, soy and other oils, including olive oil (which is the better of the lot and when used cold has some useful qualities). The other oils share similarities, as they are all unstable especially so when heated. The most unstable oils in general use and over recommended are the omega 3’s particularly DHA and EPA. I’ve recently seen so called holistic practitioners recommending in excess of 6 grams of DHA to improve anti-inflammatory responses and so-called membrane fluidity. One of the key problems with this approach is that increased DHA levels are known to occur in the obese and diabetics (Madison Sullivan et al., 2018) and this increase is associated with reduced mitochondrial enzymes (metabolic enhancers).\nPUFAs like DHA are often touted as protective because they induce a process called mitochondrial uncoupling. This can occur when your’e cold, when you don’t produce enough thyroid hormone and other stressors. It can indeed be protective but DHA for example creates something called proton leak within the cells, and decreases the efficiency of the cell. Oxygen efficiency is lost and production of energy or adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is also wasteful. This sits well with many who promote theoretical mechanisms of longevity such as the rate of living theory (Speakman et al., 2004) (Vaanholt, Daan, Schubert, & Visser, 2009) and the membrane pacemaker theory (Hulbert, 2007; Hulbert, Kelly, & Abbott, 2014). A. J Hulbert is a well-respected thyroid researcher who completed a large body of work on the role of thyroid hormones and fatty acids and their role in ‘membrane fluidity’. Interestingly Hulbert proposes that mammals and birds with a high metabolic rate (much like Elie Metchnikoff’s theories that link low gut bacteria with metabolism in birds, mammals and longevity) and increased longevity often have this key feature in common. They generally have low saturation of PUFAs as determined by something called the peroxidation index (PI). Conversely animals with high PUFA and PI have decreased longevity, but the membrane pacemaker theory postulates it as high metabolic rate, inducing uncoupling and characterized by increased reaction oxygen species (ROS) and the production of superoxide and superoxide dismutase (SOD).\n“There’s an inverse relationship between the peroxidation index of skeletal muscle phospholipids and maximum lifespan of mammal and bird species of different sizes.” A.J.Hulbert\nThis forms a major component of the rate of living theory or that increased metabolism generates ROS ergo slowing metabolism down, produces less ROS and that’s productive. Although it’s not and this is where many people get confused about efficient thyroid function, enhanced metabolism and potential oxidative stress. I was reminded by a Ray Peat Newsletter earlier on the year how SOD remains elevated throughout the lifespan of those with Down syndrome and that serotonin increases SOD, contributing to decreased longevity. With excess PUFA consumption and tissue saturation, SOD increases as does uncoupling, lipid peroxidation and high levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) are observed with excess lipid peroxidation (Chen & Li, 2016). SOD can be counteracted by glutathione (SOD/G ratio) but this diminishes over time. This enhances the reductive state and perpetuates the gain of electrons, which are a hallmark of damaged physiology and shift efficient energy production away from oxidative metabolism of glucose and metabolic inflexibility.\nPUFA, like DHA does initiate mitochondrial uncoupling but it’s inefficient and increases SOD degrading aerobic metabolism, which comes at a cost to lifespan. Hulbert notes that a 24% decrease in PI, is associated with doubling of lifespan and that calorific restriction alters the acyl composition of the cell membrane. Why? Because PUFA are removed from the cell membrane to be used as fuel. Again this can be problematic if you persistently use unsaturated fatty acids as fuel. Not to mention that refeeding fasted subjects and those on a ketogenic diet are well known to depress thyroid hormone responsiveness, thyroid hormone receptors and glucose tolerance(Boelen, Wiersinga, & Fliers, 2008)(Garbow et al., 2011)(Kose, Guzel, Demir, & Arslan, 2017). Yes there are indeed many short-term studies showing positive changes from CR and ketogenic dieting. If one can benefit from these modalities great but if not metabolically flexible, it isn’t always going to be as fruitful as you think. It’s often these interactions that muddy the water between carbohydrate restriction and beneficial results. Hint, it’s never usually the carbohydrate, and if you’ve been prone to over eating, then that calorie deficit is always going to show a temporary positive effect.\nIf you’re someone that has tried many different interventions for improved health or even body composition and failed to get the results that you need, then the body requires a level playing field of energy and nutrients to create balance. Further stress from skipping meals, long hours without eating and failure to meet metabolic demands are some of the reasons why many develop metabolic inflexibility. The more stressed your physiology, the more prone it is to activating stress pathways and suppressing thyroid hormone, decreasing insulin responses and creating inflammation. More often than not those with tis existing inflexibility may not benefit from increased fatty acid oxidation mediated by a lack of available glucose.\nThyroid, PUFA and membrane composition and fluidity\nMy understanding of the so-called membrane, membrane pump theory and even membrane fluidity is certainly not of an expert but If I’m wrong here, I’m certainly willing to throw my hands up on in the air and say – I told you I wasn’t an expert. I am reasonably sure of the interactions of thyroid hormone, its generality, it’s actions, organizational qualities and much like the theories of low serotonin, low estrogen, high cholesterol treated by statins, and that glyphosphate is a safe and friendly compound, that people with vested interests promote otherwise. I’m not going to go into the complexities of Gilbert Ling’s work (Gilbert N. Ling, 1965 1997, 2014) I’d be lying if I said I truly understand it but my attempt to summarize such a vast body of work.\nThe membrane pump theory has been a widely accepted unproven theory that appears on paper, to be unable energetically to support and each pump requiring unaccountable levels of ATP. Ling’s work suggests that membrane interactions are largely supported by organised or structured water interfaces and that there is no cellular membrane to speak of. Thyroid hormone, proteins and cholesterol are other integral components of this interface.\nIt’s always contentious when someone ends up disproving a theory that’s widely accepted without being proven.\nDoes it make sense that during fasting, these essential PUFA’s are depleted from this so-called membrane and replaced with cholesterol? Can they really be that essential? Thyroid hormones have been shown to modify this “membrane permeability”, cooperatively influencing behavior of enzymes and can penetrate the phospholipid bilayers (Issé, Yunes Quartino, Fidelio, & Farías, 2013). Triiodothyronine or T3 appears similar to cholesterol’s action, increasing fluidity in ordered gel phases and decreasing in liquid crystalline states of phospholipids. I’m guessing that alterations in structured water through positive/ negative charges, and interactions between organisational qualities of thyroid hormones and cholesterol could be the ideal interface. This may explain why in hypothyroidism the so-called membrane, becomes more disorganised, less gel like and more abundant in PUFA (PUFAs degrade cholesterol).\nRestriction of PUFA, methionine and other agents which reduce biology need to be compared with so called decreased rate of living theories to ascertain what really increases longevity. If we keep looking at theories that promote decreased function instead of maintaining and improving order. The end result may be decreased lifespan and a slow death of cellular function.\nBoelen, A., Wiersinga, W. M., & Fliers, E. (2008). Fasting-Induced Changes in the Hypothalamus–Pituitary–Thyroid Axis.

{"question":"What are the similarities between BioFab3D's theatrical production initiatives and FAU's involvement with the Erlanger Poetenfest in terms of combining arts with research institutions?","answer":"Both institutions combine arts with research in distinct ways. BioFab3D commissioned a playwright to create a modern version of 'Rossum's Universal Robots' performed live in their science laboratory, exploring ethical questions around bioprinting organs. The play attracted over 250 audience members throughout its run. Similarly, FAU integrates arts with academia through the Erlanger Poetenfest, hosting various events in university spaces like the Schlossgarten, Orangerie, and University Library, with FAU researchers participating in podium debates and discussions. Both initiatives demonstrate how research institutions can engage with creative arts to explore and communicate complex topics to the public.","context":["The Australian 3D bioprinting community is growing. Thanks to their pioneering technological innovations, collaborations between researchers and healthcare, and support from government initiatives, advances in biotechnology may make manufacturing living structures a reality. 3D printing body parts is quickly becoming the next dreamt of step in organ transplantation, since harvesting stem cells from a transplant recipient and printing them into a replacement organ could help bypass complications associated with organ transplants, such as year-long waits for a suitable donor or rejection of the new organ. To this end, back in 2016, a laboratory was created to focus on building biological structures or body parts that require repair using living cells, the BioFab3D lab. Located at St Vincent’s Hospital in the Australian city of Melbourne, it is making science fiction a reality.\nBioFab3D is Australia’s first biomedical, engineering and robotics center. A not-for-profit initiative and collaboration between St Vincent’s Hospital, the University of Melbourne, Swinburne University of Technology, RMIT University and the University of Wollongong (UOW). A place where researchers, clinicians, and engineers work together to develop cell and materials science to create a new generation of prosthetic cartilage, muscle, bone, and organs for use in the treatment of trauma and disease. This may just be the type of facility that could evolve biotechnology in the Asia-Pacific region, where interest and demand for personalized biomedical innovations continue to increase.\nAustralia also has a great asset: workforce skilled in 3D biofabrication. Education and training in bioprinting have been around for quite a few years, in 2015, Australia’s UOW offered, in conjunction with online education provider FutureLearn, free, four-week online course in bioprinting for whoever wants to learn, attracting over 30,000 people from over 145 countries to date. The course is geared towards high school seniors who may be interested in pursuing a degree in the sciences, encouraging adolescents to get into STEM careers. Also, the UOW along with other universities offered one of the first global master’s degrees in Biofabrication. The workforce is key to the development of additive manufacturing, so that future generations can advance the technology even further, achieving some of the long-term goals that scientists everywhere began targeting decades ago.\n3DPrint.com spoke to Cathal O’Connell, facility manager at BioFab3D, to understand how the pioneering lab is collaborating with researchers in Australia to advance groundbreaking projects.\nO’Connell reveals that BioFab3D is usually packed with researchers, clinicians, engineers and industry professionals, where a real sense of collaboration makes the research and development of innovative ideas easier.\n“In the conference room, there might be a clinician discussing a project with his start-up team, while in the lab researchers are running gene analysis on cells in 3D printed tissues, looking after cells in bioreactors, bioprinting new structures, developing new materials and so on. Engineering, biology, materials science and medicine all come together. I always say the most important piece of equipment in the lab is the coffee machine. That’s where the real magic happens: emerging from the collision of disciplines, and the serendipitous meeting of minds,” described O’Connell.\nBioFab3D is itself a small precursor to a much larger project, called the Aikenhead Centre for Medical Discovery (ACMD), that will be a much larger-scale version, also situated at St Vincent’s Hospital and encompassing 11 floors of research and teaching space. The ambitious initiative to create the first hospital-based and world-class health tech innovation hub in Australia is modeled after several international collaborative consortiums and hubs that have been demonstrated to accelerate the development of medical solutions to market and adoption in clinical practice thereby delivering better patient outcomes and quality of life.\nOne of the most renown projects at the BioFab3D lab is a handheld cartilage printing device called the BioPen. Developed by Peter Choong, Director of Orthopaedics at St Vincent’s Hospital Melbourne, and Gordon Wallace, professor at UOW, the BioPen is filled with stem cells derived from a patient’s fat, which can create and surgically implant custom scaffolds of living material into failing joints. Much like 3D printed bones, the cartilage undergoes a process of growth and development within the body. So far it’s only been tested on sheep, but its developers hope that in future the BioPen can help to accelerate the regeneration of functional cartilage in human patients.\n“Our research is tackling a range of clinical needs, particularly in orthopaedics and neurology. Ongoing projects include: 3D bioprinting muscle, studying how cells react with titanium implants, and modelling epilepsy in the dish from patient-derived cells,” said O’Connell. “Other projects are focused on developed tailored bioinks for bioprinting particular cell types. Still more are focused on improving the interface between living cells and electrodes implanted in the body. More importantly, all of our work is focused on a particular clinical question that can arise, and involves close collaboration with surgeons and doctors at the hospital.”\nIn order to move along with all these projects, O’Connell considers absolutely fundamental to understand cells for biomedical engineering. And not just cells or cell behavior, but the biological system as a whole.\n“I think the whole field is appreciating more and more that the key to engineering new tissues is to understand the developmental process–what happens in utero when that tissue is originally formed.”\nHundreds of researchers around the globe are racing to 3D bioprint living functional organs for transplant, we repeatedly hear that this is the holy grail of biofabrication, but at BioFab3D scientists are engaging in some of the concerns of hospital patients, health afflictions and real-life problems that they consider could have shorter-term solutions.\n“I am wary of giving oxygen to the idea of bioprinting organs for implantation. If that is ever possible, it will be a couple of decades away (and I suspect the final technology will have more to do with cultivating the development of organoids rather than printing cells directly). And I wouldn’t say there is one ‘final frontier’ either. There are a range of unmet needs where bioprinting can play a role. Every new treatment we develop will be a frontier, one which extends the limits of human healthspan,” detailed the expert, who has a strong background in physics and nanoscience.\nThere is so much research going on and labs like BioFab3D are advancing in areas like bioengineered muscle or 3D cultured neurons that mimic brain activity, so many are hoping that the pre-clinical and clinical stages advance faster. Although O’Connell claims that the process is not taking longer than expected since medical research generally progresses slowly and meticulously. Which means it’s right on track.\n“With R&D timelines on the order of 10 to15 years, developing any new treatment which is safe and effective is an extremely difficult thing to do! Perhaps the field of bioprinting only seems slow because there is so much media attention on it, and therefore so much expectation. In fact, the field of bioprinting is moving incredibly fast, it’s just that when you capture something at a high frame rate it appears to move in slow motion.\nWith so many projects in the works, it’s no wonder that the lab is also involved with the regulations and approvals of bioprinting in Australia. According to O’Connell, members of the BioFab3D team have already been involved in discussions with the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (or TGA, the equivalent of the FDA in the US) around regulation of 3D printing in medicine, which includes bioprinting too. O’Connell went on to say that “regulators around the world are still figuring out the most appropriate way to deal with personalized implants.”\n“Ours is a fast-moving field, so there needs to be strong communication between researchers and regulators. In fact, one of our doctoral students is a former medical device assessor with the TGA, and she is looking at this problem in depth.”\nOne of the main drives of the lab is to educate the next generation of biomedical engineers. Students are widely encouraged to attend the Lab and experiment along with professors. Throughout the last three years, undergraduates, masters, doctoral and even high school students have trained at BioFab3D. Actually O’Connell says that students are in the lab a lot more often than the professors!\nIt’s not just students and professors who are interested in the developments and innovations of the lab, many companies and NGOs have partnered with them. Most prominently Stryker Corporation, the company is co-funding a five-year project called Just in time implants, that will combine 3D printing, robotic surgery, and advanced manufacturing to create tailored implants for patients with bone cancer.\nAt BioFab3D scientists and engineers work with CELLINK Inkredible 3D bioprinters, Stratasys Objet 30Prime, David SLS-3 3D scanners, Robo3D R2 3D printer, GeSIM Bioscaffolder, and Dolomite Micropatricle Generator. Along with bioreactors, like Cellec’s Perfusion Bioreactor and Ebers TC-3 Dynamic Bioreactor, systems for molecular biology\nAnd if you thought that was it, the researchers at BioFab3D can still astound you. Late last year, they even commissioned a local playwright (Rohan Byrne) to recreate a story which dealt with questions around 3D bioprinting of tissues and organs as part of National Science Week 2018. The play was hosted live in the lab at BioFab3D. For 10 days, actors performed at the Science laboratory a reimagined tale of the classic sci-fi play “Rossum’s Universal Robots” (R.U.R), written one hundred years ago by Karel Čapek.\nO’Connell explained that Čapek’s robots were not mechanical; they were flesh and blood facsimiles of people made from a special gel-like substance. R.U.R was set (mostly) inside a factory where these ‘robots’ were fabricated.\n“The BioFab3D laboratory is focused on literally ‘building body parts’ using living cells. We felt this convergence of science fiction and real science research makes this play relevant today.”\nThe collaborative fusion of arts and science was called RUR 2020 and is set over a ten-year period at the Talos Laboratory, where human organ transplants have become ubiquitous and synonymous with a factory assembly line. It is a multi-billion dollar corporation and the government is forced to regulate and develop a National transplant scheme. Deception and faulty organs are exposed in a news breakthrough, instigating mass demonstrations and a company meltdown. The contemporary version of the story dealt with questions around 3D bioprinting of tissues and organs: aksing, what would happen if bioprinted body parts become commercially available? It received positive reviews from local critics and was widely attended, with over 250 people in the audience throughout its run.\n“The play dealt with some important ethical questions, such as programmed obsolescence and human enhancement. It turned out extremely well and was very well received, we even had live actors performing inside the lab itself,” said O’Connell.\nBioFab3D is becoming an influential presence in the country and in the global bioprinting community, with ideas that actually seem like they will be solving some of the problems of human health pretty soon. The convergence between science, research and medicine accelerating as people from different professions come together in one place to create the future.","Partnerships and collaborations\nStrong partners for innovation\nInnovation thrives on strong partnerships and trusting collaborations.

{"question":"I'm a photographer starting my business - what's the difference between exclusive and non-exclusive photo licenses?","answer":"An exclusive license means you cannot license the image to other third parties during the agreement duration. A non-exclusive license allows you to license the same image to other third parties under separate agreements during the same time frame. Clients often want exclusive licenses to ensure their brand images don't appear elsewhere or get used by competitors, but they should pay a premium for this exclusivity.","context":["Copyright and image usage can be a complex and confusing arena even for experienced photographers.\nWhen you shoot for a client, you not only need a contract outlining the deliverables, but you also need a user or licensing agreement. You also need a user agreement if a brand or organization comes across one of your images on the Internet and wants to use it in some way.\nSo what exactly is a user agreement and why do you need one?\nA user agreement is a type of contract in which you as the photographer grant specific usage rights to a client or collaborator. They may only use the image within the bounds of this agreement.\nUnder most copyright laws, photography is as protected as any other artwork. In photography, you’re not “selling” your image or giving up your copyright. You’re giving someone a license to use the images for a specific purpose and time frame. In effect, you’re the “lender,” and they are the “borrower.” This is basically what happens when someone purchases stock photography.\nThe two types of licenses\nThere are two types of licenses: exclusive and non-exclusive.\nAn exclusive license does not allow the photographer to license the image or images to other third parties during the duration of the agreement.\nA non-exclusive license allows the photographer to license the same image to other third parties under separate agreements during the same time frame.\nClients often want an exclusive license to ensure the images created for their brand don’t appear elsewhere. In some cases, so they don’t end up being used by their competitors.\nHowever, be aware that they should be required to pay a premium for this exclusivity. This is why usage rates can go very high, depending on the client and their visibility in the marketplace.\nWhen you give exclusivity to a client, it prohibits you from earning more income from your images by licensing it to other third parties, or through stock photography.\nI make a decent side income from being a contributor with them, without having the thousands of images required by other agencies to make stock photography worthwhile. Since most of my commissioned clients want exclusive usage, I don’t submit the images I license to them to stock also. Instead, I submit non-similar rejects from the shoot and even shoot specifically for my stock portfolio.\nWhat should go in the user agreement?\nWhen you’re writing up a user agreement and setting your price, it’s crucial you consider the end use of the image and the visibility of the brand using it.\nLicensing an image to a nationwide restaurant chain should have a different price and terms than the mom-and-pop taco joint down the street.\nOne example of how the details of a user agreement can become critical is when you’re dealing with a start-up or a growing small business.\nIf you provide licensing for several years or in perpetuity (forever ongoing), what happens if that business suddenly takes off and gains extensive exposure? Your image will become worth a lot more, but you won’t see an extra penny if you’ve given perpetual usage away.\nThe rule for user agreements is the wider the audience for the image, the more the image is worth to the brand.\nWhen faced with a client who has good prospects to grow, keep your licensing period shorter and track when it expires via a spreadsheet.\nThe user agreement should also specify whether the license is exclusive or non-exclusive, and describe its intended use.\nI don’t recommend granting unlimited use for an image; otherwise, a brand can use it across every conceivable platform – in advertising, on billboards and for product licensing.\nBe very specific about how they can use your images. More and more clients are asking for universal and unlimited rights. If this is the case, they should be prepared to pay for it.\nSpecify the time frame in which the licensee is allowed to use the image. If they want to use the image beyond this time frame, they will have to purchase another license from you.\nAnother important tip is don’t provide a user agreement until the images have been paid for in full. Let the client know this policy and state on your invoice that the images cannot be used publicly until you have received payment in full.\nEducate your clients\nAs with other types of contracts, a user agreement protects you as the creator of an image. It also prevents misunderstandings between you and a client that can lead to bad feelings and legal hassles if someone feels their expectations haven’t been met.\nUnless a client has worked with photographers before, they may not understand the ins-and-outs of copyright law or why they need to sign a user agreement. Educating the client is vital.\nIf someone is questioning your contracts, they likely are not understanding the process. A local small business or startup brand may need your help in understanding the transaction.\nWhen negotiating a user agreement, it’s important to communicate with self-confidence and to recognize your work has value to your clients.\nAt the same time, remaining respectful and professional can lead to building a mutually beneficial relationship – with more opportunities and income down the line.\nIf you have any other licensing and user agreement info you’d like to share, please do so in the comments section.\nGo to Source\nPowered by WPeMatico"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2ab2f58f-4454-4c9b-96f9-1ca7dbbdf408>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do technological innovations in measurement systems compare between Olympic timing and archery accuracy assessment?","answer":"U.S. Olympic Committee engineers have developed precise timing systems using light beams that can record racers' times to within a thousandth of a second. In contrast, archery accuracy assessment relies more on practical performance measures, particularly in challenging conditions like wind, where variables such as arrow diameter, speed, fletching type, and broadhead configuration all affect accuracy. Unlike the precisely measured Olympic timing, archery accuracy is described as 'more art than science' due to variable conditions and the wide range of equipment configurations used.","context":["1 Engineers with the U.S. Olympic Committee keep improving timing and measurement technology.

I once took a shot at a Wyoming pronghorn in a stiff, 30-mph crosswind. The shot seemed true, yet I missed my target by a full 14 inches! I also remember a follow-up shot on a mule deer at 55 yards when the wind was whipping with intermittent gusts. I had to aim about two feet off-center to send the arrow through the buck’s chest. When the wind blows that hard, a well-gauged aim is critical, but so is your use of specialized tackle to help counter the wind’s forcing your arrow off course.\nUnfortunately, being a precise shooter and knowing how to aim in the wind is more art than science, since wind speed is usually unknown and variable. Also, everyone’s setup is a little different, too, when considering arrow diameter and speed, and fletching and broadhead type — so, no handy arrow-drift chart exists for all archers’ setups. With that said, let’s focus on the important factors that do remain in our control.\nStart With The Arrow\nDiameter and Mass: A lot has been written about the benefits of using a micro-diameter arrow to counter the wind’s effects. By using a shaft with less surface area, a reduction in aerodynamic drag will occur, and the arrow will exhibit less drift and fly more accurately.\nMass weight and arrow velocity are other elements of aerodynamics. A heavier, smaller-diameter arrow improves momentum and reduces the shaft’s deceleration rate. In other words, it won’t slow down as much when compared to a lighter, larger-diameter shaft. This allows for a higher ballistic coefficient and improved downrange punch.\nMicro-sized arrows with sufficient mass such as Easton’s FMJ Injexion, Gold Tip’s Kinetic, and Carbon Express’ Maxima Red SD are all top choices for improved shooting in the wind. I prefer shafts that weigh close to 10 grains per inch using a 400-spine shaft. This strikes a nice balance between speed, energy, and aerodynamics.\nIn addition, “skinny” arrows spin faster in flight (due to the rotational axis of the shaft) when compared to larger-diameter shafts using the same fletching and helical. This premise is based on centrifugal force. As an arrow spins quickly and its fletching builds up air friction, it becomes stable and will no longer wobble. With small-diameter arrows, you can lessen the drag or air resistance caused by larger vanes without jeopardizing arrow stability or control.\nFor this reason, micro-diameter arrows go well with ultra-compact vanes and less helical, both of which improve speed and aerodynamics.\nBroadhead Weight: A shaft’s front of center (FOC) weight also ties in with this accuracy gain. By using a heavier broadhead, you can increase the shaft’s FOC weight and effectively transfer the center mass or balance point of the arrow further toward the tip. This extends the fletching’s leverage effect over the shaft, which accentuates centrifugal force and flight control.\nFurthermore, increased FOC weight also pulls or directs the arrow better through the wind. This helps minimize oscillation to the back end of the arrow and improves flight performance. For this same reason, it gives the arrow increased straight-line energy when the broadhead cuts into game — a win-win proposition.\nA simple switch from 100-grain to 125-grain broadheads will boost FOC by two to three percent. However, for bowhunters looking to increase point weight by 50 percent or more, brass inserts are the obvious answer and are available from most arrow manufacturers. When using Easton’s 4mm Injexion arrows, I often use two inserts in addition to using a 100-grain broadhead. I prefer 100-grain broadheads for the Deep Six inserts, because there are more broadhead models to choose from. Overall, this allows me to boost point weight to 140 grains, giving the arrow better control in the wind.\nWith fletching, I prefer the smallest profile that allows for consistent flight properties, whether using a mechanical or ultra-compact, fixed-blade broadhead. Again, this will minimize drag and lessen the effects of arrow drift. I’ve achieved superior results using Arizona Archery’s Pro Max vanes (4.9 grains each) with a profile of 1.7 x .46 inch. I use a four-fletch setup, which produces about the same amount of steering control as three larger Arizona Archery Max Hunter vanes (7 grains each and a profile of 2.1 x .58 inch).\nPrep The Bow\nNext on the list is the bow. For windy day shooting, fast bows are an advantage because they propel the arrow at a higher velocity. Speed is good, because it cuts down on the time the arrow is subjected to air forces and wind drift. However, I won’t spend too much time on this topic, since the fastest bows don’t automatically qualify as the best bowhunting bows. Why? Some of them can be temperamental to shoot. Bottom line here is to shoot a forgiving yet highly efficient bow to promote solid all-around consistency. Any new compound with an ATA speed rating between 330-340 FPS is an excellent choice.\nPerhaps more important are the accessories you place on the bow. For best results, choose quivers, sights, arrow rests, and stabilizers that have the least amount of surface area. This will keep the bow more streamlined and less susceptible to air forces as you aim. A bow quiver is the biggest culprit here. Practice removing the quiver prior to taking a shot. Of course, a quick-detach quiver is needed in this case. If not, try removing all the arrows in the quiver and then shooting. A cluster of arrows and fletching can act as a wind sail, causing severe “bouncing” to occur and ruining your aim. Some bowhunters prefer a back or hip quiver for this reason. Please experiment heavily to find what works best for you for your specific style of hunting.\nWind Speed & Aiming Techniques\nWind speed: In a perfect world, a bowhunter would tape to the bow limb a chart with specific wind speeds and arrow-drift amounts, use a Kestrel Meter to acquire the wind rate prior to the shot, reference the chart accordingly, and then aim “off-center” the predetermined amount to lethally strike his or her target.\nThe problem is, it takes a significant amount of time to create this wind chart, since it must be created by using your specific bow, arrow velocity, and shaft setup. This could take months, if not years, to acquire.\nFor this reason, most archers are forced to shoot in the wind by “feel,” and lots of practice in various windy conditions. Also, if the wind is blowing exceedingly hard, say 40 mph with intermittent gusts, you should not take a shot. It’s unethical.\nShooting by feel could also mean using techniques to help you gauge the wind’s angle and speed. Some archers prefer to do this with a piece of yarn or twine attached to the stabilizer. Depending on how taut the string suspends in the air, you can estimate the wind’s speed. Other archers prefer to toss blades of grass at waist level to assess wind speed and angle. Use what works best for you.\nAiming: Besides aiming off-target a significant amount, archers can use a secondary method commonly used by outdoor tournament archers. This is known as “bubbling,” and it’s done by using the bubble level on the sight and canting the top limb a slight amount in the direction of the wind to acquire a “quarter,” “half,” or “full bubble” out of center to compensate for arrow drift and impact. With lots of practice, this method works surprisingly well.\nArchers who use this method like the idea of keeping the pin on the target, rather than holding way off-center. However, skeptics of this technique say “bubbling” can disrupt normal shooting form, and it also requires using the same bubble on every bow.\nShooting in the wind is an expert’s game that requires dedicated practice under various types of windy conditions to ensure consistent results. By improving your arrow’s speed and aerodynamics, reducing the bow’s surface-area features, and getting a feel for different arrow-impact patterns in various wind speeds, you can deliver on that important shot and show the wind who’s the real boss."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d23d699e-c4db-4d82-9ebf-c7ba83d4748a>","<urn:uuid:b9d8475b-e806-4190-b46a-96e9251348fa>"],"error":null}

What are the key regulatory functions of endocytic processes?","answer":"Endocytic processes play crucial regulatory roles in cell-environment communication. They control the levels of glucose transporters on the cell surface and regulate levels of activated signaling receptors at the plasma membrane. The plasma membrane is not just a barrier but serves as the primary means for cells to communicate with their environment. Endocytosis must be tightly regulated and linked to specific cargo to properly moderate these cell-environment interactions.","context":["Throughout her career, Sandra Schmid has been at the leading edge of endocytosis research. It was her laboratory that first identified the GTPase dynamin as a central player in endocytosis (1). Since then, she's devoted her research efforts to characterizing this critical cellular process (2) and dynamin's role therein, as the protein that collars and then pinches off forming endocytic vesicles (3, 4).\nSchmid did her graduate work in James Rothman's lab at Stanford University (5) and her postdoc with Ira Mellman at Yale (6). For the past 22 years she's headed up her own lab at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego. There, she's managed the responsibilities of being a lab head, department chair, and mother, while also serving on the editorial boards for several research journals. Schmid also recently completed a master's degree in executive leadership at the University of San Diego and agreed to take on the presidency of the American Society for Cell Biology in 2011. Yet, we managed to collar her for a quick chat about the things that have been keeping her busy.\nWhere did you grow up?\nI grew up in Vancouver, Canada. My father was a high school science teacher, and he actually wrote the textbooks that were used in grades eight through ten in a couple of Canadian provinces.\n“What's exciting about science is that which you don't yet know.”\nIs that what first interested you in science?\nMy father was definitely an inspiration to me, but another strong influence was my early schooling. I was enrolled in something called a Major Works Class, which was a special class for gifted students from all over the city. There were maybe 25 of us in the class and we stayed together from fourth through seventh grades. We had phenomenal teachers, and they had a really unique approach to education: we didn't do anything according to the textbooks or the regular curriculum. The teacher would just throw it out the window and we'd do it our own way. Our teachers were always challenging us to look outside of textbooks to get our own information, and to think critically about what the different sources of information had to say. I think it was really that class that informed my approach to science.\nHow would you characterize your scientific approach?\nI'm always questioning whether I really understand how things work. Once you have formulated a hypothesis of how something works, the trick is to design an experiment that's really set up to test that idea. It's important to keep in mind that you can't approach this thinking you already know the answer to your question, or expecting that you know exactly how things should turn out. What's exciting about science isn't what you already know; what you already know goes in a textbook. What's exciting about science is that which you don't yet know.\nI think that when a student can't produce some expected result, or they can't get the “right” answer, they often feel frustrated or embarrassed. But I have proposed many models throughout my career that have turned out to be wrong, and I'm not embarrassed by that. We propose models based on what we know at the time. Then we try to rigorously test them, and frequently we prove ourselves wrong. I always tell my postdocs, “If you get the result I expect, that's great, but if you get a result that I don't expect, I'm even happier,” because that means we've uncovered something new. As scientists, our whole raison d'être is innovation, and yet I've never, in all my training as a scientist, had a discussion about innovation. That's partly why I recently decided to do a master's degree in executive leadership.\nHow did you complete a master's while also running a lab full-time?\nI try very hard to prioritize. For me, doing that master's degree was important. Having a family was also important to me—I have two great kids, one of whom is about to finish college, and one who's just starting. You obviously can't do everything, but if you have a clear idea of what is most important to you, and you're willing to let go of things that aren't so important, then you will be able to get what you want.\nDid what you learned in your master's affect your approach to running your lab?\nYes. My lab is now much smaller than it was, and yet it's more productive than ever because I can now help every person be as successful as possible. Each individual needs different levels of assistance from me; no two people are alike. Some need a lot of back-and-forth and guidance in order to thrive, others are highly independent, while most fall somewhere in-between. However, even my most independent fellows need help focusing or coordinating their efforts with others—just like Kobe Bryant still needs a basketball coach! Because I have a smaller lab, I'm able to figure out what works best for everyone, and act accordingly.\nIn bigger labs, I think there's a tendency for the lab head to try to treat everyone the same, or else to focus their efforts on just one of those types of people: just the successful ones, or just the struggling ones. As department chair, I've seen labs that fall all along that spectrum. I think senior scientists should learn to use a broader range of leadership skills to help young scientists succeed.\nYou'll be president of ASCB next year—will that help you communicate these ideas?\nI'm definitely going to be trying to increase awareness of these issues. ASCB is an organization whose mission is very much aligned with my interests: being an advocate for science, and for the development of young scientists.\n“Dynamin is the brains and brawn of endocytosis.”\nAs a young scientist, why did you select endocytosis as the focus of your career?\nIt was a question that I first came across as an undergraduate. Vesicular trafficking, the process of pinching off a small piece of membrane and fusing it to another place, just fascinated me. I wanted to pick it apart and understand it.\nPart of what interests me about it now is the idea that the plasma membrane is not just a barrier; it's how cells communicate with their environment. Accordingly, endocytic processes are not just for transporting proteins from one place to another. They also modulate how cells talk with each other and with their environment. For example, they control everything from the levels of glucose transporters on the cell surface to the levels of activated signaling receptors at the plasma membrane. So, endocytosis needs to be tightly regulated and linked to the vesicle's specific cargo.\nWhat regulates endocytic processes?\nI think dynamin is really the master regulator of endocytosis. Dynamin is a giant GTPase that I first encountered when I was just starting my lab here at Scripps. At the time, very little was known about it: biochemical evidence suggested it might be a microtubule motor protein, but genetic studies said it was involved in endocytosis. We set out to test whether dynamin was a motor or an endocytic protein. We made a mutation in the dynamin P loop that prevents it from binding nucleotides. If dynamin was a motor, this mutation would lock it onto microtubules, so we looked for defects in microtubule organization, and found none. Instead, we found defects in endocytosis. But we didn't really begin to understand dynamin's role in endocytosis until later, when we discovered that dynamin self-assembles. When we looked at these assemblies under an electron microscope, we saw that they looked like tiny protein collars. That was our first inkling of how dynamin functions in endocytosis.\nNow we think that dynamin is the brains and brawn of endocytosis. It plays a role early in vesicle formation to monitor cargo composition, coat assembly, and the mechanics of the early stages of vesicle formation. We think it does this by interacting with vesicular coat proteins that sense vesicle curvature and interact with the vesicles' cargo. When these coat proteins sense that the vesicle is loaded with cargo or that signaling receptors need to be internalized, they activate dynamin's self-assembly into protein collars, which in turn stimulates its GTPase activity. The dynamin collars choke off the neck of a budding vesicle and facilitate its fission from the plasma membrane. We think that dynamin might control an endocytic checkpoint—if certain conditions aren't satisfied, the process of vesicle formation is aborted, and started again from scratch.\nNow we're trying to test these ideas. If we're right, then we should be able to observe how protein partners that interact with dynamin affect its assembly and GTPase activities, and how changes to dynamin's basal activity affect the kinetics of vesicle fission. We're using biochemistry, biophysics, and cell biology approaches to these problems, and I also have a collaboration with Gaudenz Danuser at Harvard Medical School using quantitative live cell microscopy to look at vesicle coat dynamics. I'm excited to see what we'll turn up next.\nText and Interview by Caitlin Sedwick"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3b74deb8-065a-4e8f-8ee9-21f22d5bdcda>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What unique presumptions exist for police officers' heart disease claims under workers comp? How can workers in general prove their injury claims are work-related?","answer":"For police officers, there is a special legal presumption that heart disease or hypertension is considered an occupational disease suffered in the line of duty and is compensable. This means officers only need to prove they have the condition and are police officers, rather than having to prove the condition was caused by their work. However, employers can still attempt to rebut this presumption with defenses like last injurious exposure, statute of limitations, or causes unrelated to employment. For general workers' compensation claims, employees must prove several elements: they worked for the employer when the accident occurred, they notified the employer within required timeframes, they weren't violating company policies, the injury occurred on the job, and the injury was sustained because of or made worse by employment. Medical professional testimony often plays a crucial role in proving these claims.","context":["Maryland Police officers are provided additional benefits under Workers Compensation Statutes and case law\nMaryland police officers are provided numerous benefits in addition to those provided for the ordinary employee. Maryland workers compensation laws provide extended benefits, and rightfully so, under the public safety rules which include increased permanency payments, presumptions of law, coverage for secondary employment jobs, and coverage while using patrol vehicle while off duty.\nHigher Permanency rates and Settlement Value for Maryland Police Officers\n2nd Tier Permanency Rates\nPolice are provided 2nd tier permanency rates in cases that would ordinarily be paid out at first tier rates because they are defined as public safety employees under Md. Labor & Employment § 9-628. Second tier rates are ordinarily paid on awards by the Workers Compensation Commission of greater than or equal to 75 weeks. First tier awards are paid out for any award under 75 weeks. In the event a Maryland police officer receives an award by the Commission of less than 75 weeks the police officer will still be paid at the second tier rate. The tier rates vary depending on the year of the injury but are determined by the employees wages as well as the state average weekly wage.\nFirst tier payments are to be paid at 1/3 of the employees average weekly wage. The 1/3 must not exceed the rate set by statutory code. Some Examples:\nSecond tier payments are to be paid at 2/3 of the employees average weekly wage but must not exceed 1/3 of the state average weekly wage. Some Examples:\nPolice Officers, and all public safety employees, can usually look past the first tier rates as vary rarely will these amount apply to their workers compensation awards. The only instances in which public safety employees will receive first tier rates is if their average weekly wage was low enough to indicate first tier money.\nAn example comparing a public safety employee award to non public safety award can provide aid in understanding how the tier system would apply in a real life scenario.\nInjured worker A was hurt while working as a landscaper. He was earning $1,000 a week. In 2016 he twisted his knee in a hole and received 6 weeks of physical therapy. He seen by the insurance company doctor and provided a rating of 5% to his leg. He was seen by the Claimants doctor and received a 20% to the leg.\nInjured worker B was hurt while working as a patrol officer. He was earning $1,000 a week. In 2016 he twisted his knee chasing a suspect in the street. He also received 6 weeks of physical therapy, was rated and received a 5% by the insurance doctor and a 20% by the Claimants doctor.\nBoth A and B attended a workers compensation hearing and were both awarded a 15% which calculates to be 45 weeks of payment.\nA will be paid for 45 weeks at $172 equaling an award of $7,740\nB will also be paid for 45 weeks but at second tier rate for 2016 of $343. Equaling $15,435.\nSettlement Value in Police Officers Workers Compensation Cases\nIn some cases Police Officers may enjoy a higher settlement amount than the ordinary injured Maryland worker. This is directly related to the public safety tier payment system. If a police officer is expected to receive an award of less than 75 weeks then he will be able to use the public safety permanency rates to negotiate a higher settlement than a non public safety employee would receive.\nSettlement value of the Police Officers’ case may not be affected by the higher tier payments in the event that the expected award would be 75 weeks or more. At 75 weeks or more all injured employees receive second tier payment rates as long as their average weekly wage is high enough.\nPresumptions of law enjoyed by Police Officers\nIn addition to the increased permanency awards Police Officers, as public safety employees, are provided presumptions of law regarding certain occupational diseases namely heart disease and hypertension. The statutory language in §9-503 states police officers is “presumed to be suffering from an occupational disease that was suffered in the line of duty and is compensable under this title if: (i.) the police officer…is suffering from heart disease or hypertension AND (ii.) the heart disease or hypertension results in partial or total disability.\nWHAT THE PRESUMPTION MEANS: In the ordinary workers compensation case, or general civil lawsuit, the party seeking benefits has the burden of production and persuasion. Otherwise said, the party seeking something must prove their case with evidence and argument. When a legal presumption exists the burden on the person seeking benefits is almost completely removed. It is assumed that Police Officers who have developed heart disease or hypertension developed the disease because of their job. With the presumption at play the Officer would have to prove they have hypertension or heart disease, and they were a police officer.\nWHAT THE PRESUMPTION DOES NOT MEAN: Police Officers will not effortlessly be awarded workers compensation benefits if they develop hypertension or heart disease. Even though there is a presumption, the Employer or Insurer have the right to rebut the presumption. If a proper rebuttal is provided then the Officer should choose to put on further evidence of support of his case because at any given time the Commissioner (workers comp judge) may be persuaded to rule in favor of the insurance company.\nCOMMON REBUTTAL DEFENSES include the last injurious exposure, the statute of limitations, and causes unrelated to employment.\nLast Injurious Exposure is a defense raised by an employer in an attempt to shift the liability for an occupational disease away from the employer and to another employer or source. Under Maryland law benefits are to be paid by the employer for whom the injured worker was working at the time they were last exposed to the hazard. Stress has been determined the hazard causing heart disease in police officers. An example of last injurious exposure at play would be; a retired Police Officer could file a claim within one year from their retirement. If in that year they worked part time for another employer the liability of the heart disease may be shifted to the new employer. If successfully argued the Police department would be excused from liability and the claim against them lost. The officer would still have the option to file a claim against the post retirement employer but a presumption may not be involved.\nStatute Of Limitations is one of, if not the most difficult defense to overcome in workers compensation cases. If the claim form for heart disease, hypertension, or any other occupational disease is not filed within 2 years from the date the Officer was disabled, had knowledge he was disabled as a result of working as an Officer. While the Statute of Limiations is difficult to overcome, there are numerous exceptions and waivers that may apply in any particular case. As always it is best to consult an experienced Maryland workers compensation attorney.\nCauses Unrelated to Employment are brought up in almost every workers compensation case. Some examples include prior injuries, arthritis, obesity, and age. In heart disease and hypertension cases the unrelated causes may be brought up by the defense in an effort to blame the disease on a preexisting condition. The goal of the defense is to focus on other causes of heart disease and hypertension such as smoking habits, drinking habits, obesity, diet, lack of exercise, or prior medical finding s of high cholesterol and blood pressure.\nPolice Officers are likely covered under workers comp if off duty but driving their patrol vehicle\nIf an employer provides an automobile to an employee they are covered under Maryland workers comp laws if involved in an accident driving to work, coming home from work, or using the car for work purposes.\nPolice Officers enjoy this benefit but are also covered while driving their patrol car for what most would consider strictly personal use. In Montgomery County vs. Wade, 345 Md. 1 (1996) the Court of Appeals, which is Maryland’s highest court, ruled that a County officer was entitled to workers compensation benefits when she was injured in an automobile accident while driving her patrol car to her mothers house.\nPertinent factors in this case were:\n- Montgomery County policy is to allow Officers to use the Personal Patrol Vehicle (PPV) for personal gain.\n- County policy was that Off duty officers using a PPV must carry a handgun, handcuffs, and department credentials, monitor the radio, respond to calls if no response would reflect unfavorably on the department.\n- The County benefits from this program by at the very least providing a visual deterrent to criminal activity.\n- The use of the PPV was indeed incidental to her roll as a patrol officer.\n- At any given moment she may have had to act in her official capacity.\n- Dual purpose doctrine applies in this case because Officer Wade was furthering the departments business purpose while using the PPV on a personal errand.\nWhile each and every workers compensation case is subject to a different fact pattern and different arguments police officers who operate their patrol car for personal use should know they may very well be entitled to workers compensation benefits.\nMaryland Police Officers are likely covered by workers compensation when working secondary employment\nThe Court of Appeals ruling in the Montgomery County vs. Wade case provides solid support for the argument that when an officer works for a secondary employer, commonly referred to as moonlighting, the officer would be covered under the Departments workers compensation policy. Of course there is often room for argument based on the particular facts of any given case, however I am of the opinion that more often than not the police officer would be covered under the departments Workers Comp policy.\nFactual analysis in determining whether the departments comp policy would cover the Officer acting as a security guard should begin with whether or not the officer was in anyway furthering the departments purpose. Was there a police presence by the officer working in security- was he in uniform, using patrol car, carrying weapon, mace, monitoring radio or acting as he typically would act while on duty?\nAnalysis should also consider whether he was permitted by the department to moonlight. Did the Police Officer have to first obtain permission from the department, did he follow the proper protocols, and did he violate any rules? Also of substantial significance is whether or not the department encouraged police officers to work side jobs. If the department encourages their officers to moonlight than they likely are receiving some benefit.","As an employee, you’re focused on doing your job and doing it well. Regardless of how well you do your job, there’s always the potential to sustain an injury. Nearly 8 million people suffer from workplace injuries every year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you suffer an on-the-job injury, you should know there’s a chance you’re eligible for workers’ compensation.\nWorkers’ compensation laws are determined at the state level. If you’re injured at work in Illinois, it’s important to understand the ins and outs of the laws, so you can receive the compensation you deserve. Our South Illinois workers’ compensation lawyers have the knowledge and drive to help you ease your financial burdens with workers’ compensation benefits.\nWhat Is Workers’ Compensation and Why Is It Awarded?\nAccording to the United States Department of Labor (DOL), over 6,500 workers’ compensation claims have been filed in Illinois, as of July 2018. While not every claim was awarded compensation, injured employees have received a combined total of over $213 million.\nIt’s not just the individuals working in high-risk jobs like construction or healthcare who are susceptible to workplace injuries. People working in office jobs are just as likely to sustain injuries deserving of workers’ comp. Companies are required by law to have a workers’ comp system in place.\nIn Illinois, the decision to award is made by the Illinois Workers’ Compensation Commission if there is a dispute between an employer and employee. This state agency manages the court proceedings between the two parties. How the proceedings go is established by the Illinois Workers’ Compensation Act. This act discusses the specific injuries that are to be covered by workers’ comp benefits, as well as scenarios where employees are not eligible for injury-related benefits.\nThe following injuries are covered under the Illinois Workers’ Compensation Act:\n- Injuries sustained after the repetitive use of body parts for an extended period of time\n- Heart attack or stroke sustained because of work conditions\n- Pre-existing conditions exacerbated because of work\n- Other physical injuries, illnesses, or disease caused by work\nThe following injuries are not covered under the Illinois Workers’ Compensation Act:\n- Injuries sustained while committing a crime\n- Injuries sustained off-the-job\n- Injuries sustained while in violation of the company’s policies or procedures\n- Self-inflicted injuries\nWhat Kind of Benefits Are Available for Workers’ Compensation Claims in Illinois?\nThe minimum and maximum workers’ comp amounts are reevaluated and published every six months by the Illinois Department of Employment Security. These amounts are referred to as the statewide average weekly wages (SAWW). Eligibility for workers’ comp benefits is determined by the type of injury sustained, and which disability category that injury falls under.\nTemporary Partial Disability Benefits\nTemporary partial disability (TPD) benefits cover the period of time when an injured employee is healing. The employee is still able to work, either full-time or part-time; however, their duties are medically required to be lightened. At this time, an employee will earn less than they did prior to being injured; however, the employer is required to pay the employee two-thirds of their weekly wages until they have recovered or are deemed able to return to their regular work status.\nTemporary Total Disability Benefits\nTemporary total disability (TTD) benefits are awarded to employees who are temporarily unable to work. TTD benefits also apply if an employee is cleared for lighter duties, but an employer is unable to provide them. TTD benefits are not paid for the first three days of missed work unless the employee is out for 14 days or longer. An employee receiving TTD benefits is legally entitled to two-thirds of their average weekly pay for the extent of their leave.\nPermanent Partial Disability Benefits\nIllinois breaks permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits down into four categories: scheduled awards, nonscheduled awards, wage differential, and disfigurement.\nScheduled awards are provided to employees who have sustained a disability to their ears, eyes, arms, hands, legs, or feet. An employee is generally entitled to 60 percent of their weekly wages for a period of weeks determined by the Illinois Department of Employment Security.\nIf an injury is sustained to a body party not determined to be eligible for scheduled awards, an employee may be eligible for nonscheduled awards. This often applies to internal injuries, like to the spine or organs. An employee receiving nonscheduled awards is also eligible for 60 percent of their original weekly wages.\nIf an employee has suffered a permanent impairment, they may be eligible for wage differential. Wage differential is awarded in situations where a person is required to take on a new position as a result of their injury. For five years, or until the age of 67, they’ll be entitled to two-thirds of the difference between their original average weekly wage and what they make in their new position.\nIn the event an employee suffers from serious and permanent disfigurement to a visible area of the body, they are eligible for up 60 percent of their average weekly wages for a little over three years.\nPermanent Total Disability Benefits\nPermanent total disability (PTD) benefits are awarded for the most serious of injuries, often involving the amputation of multiple limbs or loss of eyesight or hearing. If after your treatment your doctor determines have you sustained a permanent disability, you are eligible to receive two-thirds of your weekly average pay, or whatever you were being awarded for TTD benefits, for the rest of your life.\nAdditional Benefits and Limitations\nIn addition to recovering a portion of the lost wages, injured employees may be eligible for medical benefits to cover treatments and mileage reimbursement for traveling to and from the hospital. In the event they are unable to return to their previous position, some may be eligible for vocational training.\nIf a loved one sustains a fatal workplace injury, the family may be entitled to assistance with funeral expenses and survival benefits. The survival benefits are equivalent to two-thirds the deceased person’s average weekly wages.\nEmployees seeking workers’ compensation benefits cannot recover payment for pain and suffering in Illinois.\nHow Can a Southern Illinois workers’ Compensation Lawyer Help Me Prove My Claim?\nTo file a workers’ comp claim, the employee needs to prove the following:\n- The employee worked for the employer when the accident happened\n- The employee notified the employer within the required timeframe of the incident leading to the injury\n- The employee was not violating any company policies when they were injured\n- The injury or disease was sustained on-the-job\n- The injury or disease was sustained because of employment\n- The injury or disease was made worse because of employment\nIf you’re the victim of an on-the-job injury, pursuing workers’ compensation benefits can ease your financial burden while you recover. While a medical professional’s testimony is likely to play a large roll in whether or not you’re eligible for benefits, that may not be enough. Your employer is likely to have a strong legal team supporting them who may argue about the extent of your injury, the necessity of medical treatment, or your average wages.\nWithout proper legal representation, you may not receive fair compensation.

{"question":"How do differentiation by interest and differentiation by assessment options compare in their approaches to student engagement?","answer":"Differentiation by interest involves tailoring content to students' personal interests and real-life connections, such as using football, pets, or travel experiences to engage learners, while differentiation by assessment options allows students to demonstrate their learning through various formats like puppet shows, letters, songs, poems, or artwork, with all options meeting the same academic objectives.","context":["Differentiation is key to developing the abilities of ALL of our learners. Often you hear about “differentiation by outcome”. This is the idea that wherever the learners end up is differentiated, as some will inevitably produce more or better quality work than others. I’ll summarise the types of differentiation I use below and then give you some ideas you can try tomorrow for each. The graphic above explains what differentiation is. The picture below explains why we need it.\nDifferentiation by resource\nResource is often a euphemism for worksheet at this point. It can be effective if you are somebody who rarely uses worksheets. Students like to have things they can go through at their own pace and given that other subjects use them, why not MFL? However, resource does not have to mean worksheet.\n- Give more able students some authentic materials to work with on a topic – you may have to go to the country to get these!\n- Listening – give weaker students multiple choice answers and ask them to highlight\n- Reading – give weaker students a post-it note and encourage them to tackle the text line by line (covering the rest). It reduces the amount of visual stimulus.\nDifferentiation by task/choice\nThis can take various forms. I think it is best employed in the production stage of a lesson or equally the practice stage if you are covering a grammar point.\n- Students could develop their own response to a task eg: podcast, presentation, speech, voki avatar on “things to do in my town”\n- Students could pick from a selection of tasks that all achieve the same aim. With lower ability sets I like to do this when we teach the clothes topic. The boys can design sports wear (the new United shirt) and the girls respond really well to designing their prom dress. Some boys also like the opportunity to “suit up” so give them the prom option too; in the same way some girls have a staunch allegiance to a football club so don’t be too restrictive. It is a great way of teaching clothes, colours and dictionary use (corsage, bow tie, cufflinks, high heels – all words I learnt from this lesson).\n- In revision lessons, if you have access to a revision guide with graded activities. Give students a series of activites you want them to work through but with different starting points. Students who are more confident could start on more advanced activities but make sure wherever they start that the activities gradually increase in difficulty so as to ensure they are pushing themselves.\nDifferentiation by support (TA)\nWhilst I realise that differentiation by support could mean significantly more, I wanted to devote a section of this to the use and direction of TAs. Here is what the best TAs I have worked with have done:\n- Focus on the weaker students – get to know them. They may not all be immediately apparent.\n- Differentiate tasks for the students they are attached to.\n- Giving students encouragement but praising their effort never their intelligence.\n- One TA went and produced clocks with moveable hands to help teach students the time.\n- Another took a group of students and taught them how to tell the time in English so that they could do it in Spanish.\nCheck out my post on TAs, unsung heroes of the classroom\nDifferentiation by interest\nSometimes students want to write or speak about things unique to them. It may be that comparing modes of transport or the environment hold little interst for them. Sometimes differentiation is not about ability but about interest. I find I can get a lot of kids engaged if I can make links to things they are interested in (football is very useful). The pets topic works for a lot, as do clothes, food and holidays However, we must be careful to engage all kids, what about the one who reads? Could he/she do their coursework on a book rather than a film?\n- Quiz your students at the start of the year – ask them about their strengths and weaknesses within MFL, their hopes for the year and their interests. This will allow you to plan lessons that get them onside immediately.\n- Make links to real-life situations – if a student has been on holiday recently to a French/Spanish/German speaking country use that in your lesson.\n- If teaching school subjects to year 9s (mira 3 does this) then rather than just teaching them school subjects, get them to debate their options in Spanish. What are you going to study? Why?","Differentiating Instruction Leads to Student Success\nWhat is differentiated instruction? At the basic level, differentiated instruction consists of highly knowledgeable teachers responding to the increasingly diverse classrooms of the 21st century. Students represent diverse cultures and learning styles, and it is clear that the one-size-fits-all approach is not an effective way to teach. The goal of differentiation is to cater to your students’ ways of learning, but in the end, lead all your students to the same academic objective. When a teacher reaches out to a student or a small group of students and varies their teaching to fit their needs, that teacher is engaging in differentiating instruction. Teachers are programmed to treat each student the same as the other, which can make differentiating tough. No student deserves special treatment nor does any student deserve less attention, so how does a teacher successfully navigate differentiation?\nWhat the student’s learning objectives are and how they will get their information.\n• Cater classroom reading to each student’s reading levels\n• Upload classroom texts into audio form\n• Use spelling or vocabulary lists at the correct levels for your students\n• Present the content both visually and in audio form\n• Meet with small groups of students that are having a tough time grasping concepts and re-teach them\n• Change the language of the assignment\n• Assign learning activities that build from easy to medium to hard, but make sure that you are providing respectful activities for all students, whether the assignment is hard or easy. Each student’s work should be equally interesting and focused on the skills.\nA series of actions or assignments done by the student in order to achieve the learning objective.\n• Provide information or where to find information that encourages the student to explore the class topic further if that particular topic interests them\n• Create a personal agenda. This will include notes and future differentiated assignments that you want to provide certain students or groups of students.\n• Use manipulatives or physical objects that are used as teaching tools to engage students in hands-on learning\n• Vary the length of time a student may take to complete an assignment or the quantity of the assignment if you can tell they’re truly struggling with the concepts.\nAssignments that ensure that the students fully grasp the concepts of the unit.\n• Give students an option of how to express what they’ve learned. Examples of this include: creating a puppet show, writing a letter, acting it out, writing a song or poem, or creating art or design.\n• Use rubrics that cater to the skill levels of the student\n• Allow students to have the option of working alone or in small groups on their projects\n• As long as the assignment contains the correct requirements, encourage students to create their own assignments or projects\n• Evaluate the students before each unit and teach only what they don’t know\n• Allow students to fix and turn in their assignments again. Some students may get it right the first time, but others may need several revisions.\nHow the classroom feels and works.\n• Although classroom space may be limited try to make sure there are designated quiet workspaces and groupwork spaces.\n• Outline clear expectations for independent work that matches their needs.\n• Provide materials that show you appreciate a variety of cultures and lifestyles.\n• Share strategies with students that allows them to get help when teachers and their classmates cannot immediately help them.\n• Acknowledge the need for some students to move around to learn, while others do better sitting quietly.\n• Mix groups up over a period of days. This allows students to work with students who may have different interests or learning styles. This also lets the teacher see certain students with different kinds of work and students.\nTake a Professional Development Course\nCE Credits Online offers a course Differentiating Instruction in the 21st Century. This course is guided by the essential question: How can we create powerful learning experiences to meet the wide range of student needs in the 21st century classroom?

{"question":"How do water levels affect navigation through dikes in back channels, and what specific access conditions exist at Maple Island's boat ramp?","answer":"At low water, dikes are exposed and can be navigated around, though strong eddies with ripping cross currents and whirlpools may form. In medium water, dikes can typically be paddled over but create the most turbulent conditions with exploding boils, whipping currents, and possible waterfalls with 2-3 foot drops. During high water, most dikes become submerged under smooth flow with minimal noticeable influence. As for Maple Island's boat ramp specifically, it bottoms out in mud below 8MPG, but remains accessible up to flood stage 21MPG. The concrete ramp descends steeply into a hollowed-out back channel, with deep, murky water that experiences no flow during low water conditions but develops powerful flows from the Lock & Dam during high water.","context":["200.6 RBD Maple Island Access Ramp\n(below the Melvin Price Lock and Dam)\nLast public launch on the Upper Mississippi, and good place to begin your Middle Mississippi Expedition. This narrow concrete ramp descends into a hollowed-out back channel between the topmost of the Maple Island archipelago and the mainland above. At low water, there is no flow, but the pool is deep and murky, in the summer full of turtles, in the winter full of fish. In high water you will put into an eddy here, with some waters flowing down the back channel, and powerful waters boiling out from the Lock & Dam. Your best and most interesting route downstream is to follow the back channel. If it is flowing, go for it. If there is no flow, you might be in for a dead end round trip, but you won’t have to paddle far to find out. The boat ramp drops from river’s edge at a steep angle. Huge parking lot above. Easy year-round access. Maple Island Ramp bottoms out in a bowl of mud below 8MPG. Good up to Flood stage 21 MPG. Parking okay for daytrips, but don’t leave vehicle overnight. Arrange shuttle. Contact Big Muddy Adventures for assistance.\n200.7 LBD National Great Rivers Museum\nThe National Great Rivers Museum is a must-see for all river travelers, if nothing else than a warm bathroom and a place to purchase those hard-to-find Army Corps river charts! The National Great Rivers Museum is located on the Illinois (LBD) bank of the river adjacent to the Mel Price Lock and Dam. Unfortunately, it is only accessible from land. To date no landing or other river access point has been built. But paddlers (being the infinitely resourceful people they are) will always find a way. You can beach your vessel top end above the lock and dam (on the Alton side) and climb over the rip-rap. Or you can lock through Mel Price, and before continuing on downstream, hook a sharp left into a protected harbor created in between the lock wall and the rip-rap bank. Coming around the lock wall on the down stream side, the river bank is predominantly mud-covered rip rap however paddlers can make landing and walk up in places where the rip rap has separated. At anything but high water it will be a very, very muddy, which will be a fitting entrance into a “muddy” museum! Leave your boots outside.\nThe National Great Rivers Museum, opened in October of 2003, is one of eleven planned regional visitor centers operated by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. Located adjacent to the Melvin Price Locks and Dam, this 12,000-square-foot facility is the result of a collaboration of the Corps and the nonprofit Meeting of the Great Rivers Foundation and tells the story of the Mississippi River. The Museum features state of the art interactive displays and exhibits that help visitors understand the many aspects of the Mississippi River and how it affects our lives. The natural ecosystem of the Mississippi River and how humans interact with it is one of the major themes of the museum. A large model of the bluffs (photo right) of the region is in the center of the museum and provides information on the various wildlife from prairie plants and trees to birds and other animals. An aquarium displays the various species of fish that inhabit the Mississippi River. The mechanics of the river and how soil is made, erosion and how working models of the river help scientists make decisions affecting the river are explained. At one station visitors can estimate how much fresh water their household uses a day and at another visitors can send e-mail postcards from their hometown.\nAnother theme is how the Mississippi River has been home to many people throughout the ages, from the Mississippian culture that called nearby Cahokia Mounds home to the time when European settlers began arriving. Before the paved highways of today, rivers were the preferred mean of transportation and one display explains how the Mississippi has been used as a highway, not only by humans but by migrating waterfowl, and chronicles the different the types of vessels used from canoes, through keelboats and steamboats, to modern day barges. The Pilot House (photo right,) a simulator based on software actually used to train river pilots at the Center for Maritime Education in Paducah, Kentucky, allows visitors to see what it's like to guide a 1,000-foot tow of barges under a bridge or through a lock. The construction of the Melvin Price Locks and Dam is explained and working models explain how the system of locks and dams make river traffic possible on the Upper Mississippi. Free tours, accessible by wheelchair, of the Melvin Price Lock and Dam are conducted daily at 10 am, 1 pm, and 3 pm. Also explained are what causes floods, with emphasis on the Great Flood of 1993, and how the Corps of Engineers fights these destructive acts of nature, and what future strategies are being developed to limit their impact.\nThe Illinois Esplanade Park is along the entrance road to the Museum and has picnic facilities. The area is especially popular in the winter for Bald Eagle Watching as the eagles congregate below the locks and dam looking for easy food. The Confluence Bikeway runs by the complex and connects with Lock and Dam #27 in Granite City and the Lewis & Clark State Historic Site in Hartford to the south and Alton to the west. The Riverlands Environmental Demonstration Area is just across the Mississippi via the Clark Bridge. Two video presentations are presented daily in the 105 seat Discovery Theater that is located in the Museum. “Power of the River” tours the river from its source to the mouth exploring the culture that lives along its banks. \"Lewis and Clark: A Confluence of Time and Courage” tells the story of the Corps of Discovery from an Army and Native American perspective. The Museum also operates a bookstore and gift shop where you can purchase Upper Mississippi River Charts (while supplies last).\nNo charge to visit the National Great Rivers Museum.

This low-lying earth structure is the home of the National Great Rivers Research and Education Center. Founded in 2002 as a collaborative partnership between the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the Illinois Natural History Survey and Lewis and Clark Community College, the National Great Rivers Research and Education Center is dedicated to the study of great river systems and the communities that use them. The center aspires to be a leader in scholarly research, education, and outreach related to the interconnectedness of large rivers, their floodplains, watersheds, and their associated communities.

Possible forest camping throughout, but the only sand is found along the bottom end below RBD199, and then only at low water. Fleeting area: barges are often tied up to shore top end along main channel (east side of island). Watch for towboat activity as these are “cut loose” and added to bigger tows headed up river or down. Top end Maple Island opens up at 11MPG. The side channels and back channel are well open to shallow draft canoes and kayaks around 6MPG (but watch for rocks), with gentle flow at 8MPG and strong flow at 12MPG.\nMaple Island abounds with young vine-draped forests full of willows and cottonwoods, and other trees more common to the Upper Mississippi like ash, sliver maple, and alders. Canoeing is the best way to get close to birds and wildlife. Put in at the boat ramp and follow the back channels as much as possible to quietly approach white pelicans and other waders that migrate through this area, and songbirds in their season. Pileated woodpecker are common in Spring/Summer months, and occasionally bald eagle. When the river freezes over in cold winters the turbulent waters below the dam create a bald eagle free-for-all. Winter-hardened paddlers will witness flurries of eagles fishing these waters that never freeze while fishermen pull in the catch from the bank. If you are brave enough to venture forth in the winter, be sure to wear a wetsuit or drysuit, and prepare yourself accordingly for emergency exit. Our recommendation: Expert paddlers only in wintertime, capable of self rescue in cold water situations.\nUnfortunately Maple Island is located opposite the noisy conflagration of the Alton/Wood River Industrial reach and your visit will be accompanied by 24 hour whining, grinding, wheezing, and whooshing factories churning out petroleum products and making electricity. It’s okay for a picnic, or maybe an emergency overnight. But otherwise, you will want to avoid this hellish cancer hole and look for more peaceful camping not far downstream on Duck Island, Chouteau or Mosenthein. Maple Island is included in the Riverlands Migratory Bird Sanctuary, and is the southernmost island of the Upper Mississippi Conservation Area.","Your route: Main Channel vs. Back Channel\nRivergator will detail the Main Channel of the Atchafalaya which is almost always the fastest route on the water, but also full of traffic and less scenic; and the Back Channels, which is slower but is full of wildlife and big trees. The Back Channels of the Atchafalaya are the hundreds of bayous, lakes, bays and canals that make up the 20-mile wide basin on wither side of the Main Channel. Main Channel is always open regardless of river level, but back channel is dependent upon river levels. Many back channels are closed in low water, open with slow flow in medium water, and full of strong flowing currents in high water. Main channel hazards are buoys and towboats. (Avoid both!) In the back channel your main hazards are waterfalls over dikes (dependent on river level), snags, strainers and channel blockages (driftwood piling against trees or low bridge). Rivergator will detail all known waterfalls and blockages. But on the river things are in constant flux. What one year is an uninterrupted flowing back channel might next year be blocked by a pile of logs and tree removal dropped by some logging operation. Two things: 1) be a smart paddler and use you own best judgment about what’s safe to paddle and what isn’t. And 2) let us know if you discover something of importance not listed in the Rivergator, like a dangerous waterfall or a blocked channel. Email author John Ruskey, or leave comment in comment boxes which are located at the bottom of every page. That way we can update Rivergator descriptions and keep other paddlers informed about these difficulties and possible hazards! Dikes present special challenges to the back channel paddler. At low water they are exposed, and you can paddle around any dike, but you will often discover strong eddies with ripping cross currents and whirlpools. At medium water you can paddle over most dikes, but that is when the waters are at their most turbulent. You may not see any solid evidence, but you will know they are there by the exploding boils, whipping currents, whirlpools and agitated turbulence. In high water most dikes get swamped over by smooth flow and you hardly notice their influence. In medium water back channels waterfalls sometimes form over a dike, with significant drops (2-3 feet), strong v-line tongues, standing waves, and turbulent side waters. If you hear the sound of rushing water and see the plane of the back channel disappear and drop a level, and see leaping whitewater beyond -- Be especially cautious! Remember the paddler’s mantra: when in doubt, stop and scout!\nThe Atchafalaya Split\nBelow Krotz Springs at mile 56.4 RBD the Atchafalaya divides into two big channels each leading to vastly different experiences for paddlers. Both routes make for good paddling and good scenery along the way. The right hand fork is the Old Channel of the Atchafalaya. And the left hand fork is the New Channel, sometimes called the “Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel.” This point also marks the end of the levee on the west bank. From here on the batture opens up like a blossoming flower, eventually becoming 20 miles wide. Most of the Atchafalaya River flows into the Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel, hence it is the fastest route, and is indeed today considered the main channel. This route is a good choice if you want to make the best speed possible, and aren’t interested in some sight-seeing and exploring some of the back channels of the Atchafalaya Basin. At most water levels the Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel will cut your time in half over the Old Channel. The Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel is more forested and feels wilder. On the other hand, you will miss a rare opportunity for small channel, or back channel paddling through the extensive forests, swamps of the Atchfalaya Basin, and some of its small communities. The Atchafalaya Basin is a place where man and nature coexist in some kind of harmony; where Cajun families live on the waterways and the outdoors is an intimate part of their daily lives; where houses have been built on stilts hanging over the river, or on wooded banks of the bayou, or on houseboats, and where the communities end the deep woods begin. You will experience some of this intimacy with nature, this deep sense of place following the Old Channel of the Atchfalaya River through Butte La Rose. Either way you go will eventually bring you back to the same place, which is the bottom end of Splice Island, where the two channels rejoin, at mile 75.5.\nMaps and Mileage\nOn the Atchafalaya we will leave the USACE Mississippi River Maps behind and go to the 2012 Atchafalaya River Charts , which can be downloaded free-of-charge from the USACE New Orleans website by clicking on the below. All Rivergator mileage will refer back to the USACE system.\nUSACE 2012 Atchafalaya River and Outlets to Gulf of Mexico\nUSACE 2012 Atchafalaya River and Outlets to Gulf of Mexico\nNavigation Chart Folio, 6th Edition\nLouisiana Geological Survey Atchafalaya Basin Map\nIn addition to the USACE maps, you will want to get a copy of the Louisiana Geological Survey Atchafalaya Basin Map -- which will become your best friend for any expedition down the Atchafalaya! This map is essential to any off channel paddling. It’s large scale is wonderful to read. In one map you will be able to see the entire Atchafalaya Basin - to Morgan City anyway.\nThe Atchafalaya Basin Map is a full color, large scale map of the basin above Morgan City created by the LSU Louisiana Geological Survey. This very useful map was printed in 2004 and is still accurate 12 years later, even as some channels are closing up due to sedimentation. Use your Louisiana Geological Survey Atchafalaya Basin Map for wayfinding the best route. (Check latest details on Google Earth. The Atchafalaya Basin is surprisingly connected, thanks to a series of satellite towers situated throughout). Map printed on waterproof paper.

Folded map = $14.00 and Tubed map = $17.00\nMaps of the Atchafalaya Delta\nTo get to the Gulf of Mexico add another map to your references: and that is the Maps of the Atchafalaya Delta and the Wax Lake Delta. Below Morgan City, you will have to retire your trusty Atchafalaya Basin Map (Louisiana Geological Survey). Unfortunately this excellent map does not continue below the Intracoastal Waterway (mile 124). Fortunately for us paddlers there other resources available free-of-charge. Before you go into the Atchafalaya Delta update your maps with the below! You can see all of the Delta on Google Earth, but none of the names, mileage, and very little context. An excellent map of the Atchafalaya Delta detailing all of the passes, the islands and their names - and a WMA campground only accessible by boat - can be had at no charge by going to the following website for the Atchafalaya Delta Wildlife Management Area:\nClick on this pdf to download maps of both the Atchafalaya Delta and the Wax Lake Delta:\nRiver Speed and Trip Duration\nThe Atchafalaya River averages 3 mph at low water, 5 at medium water, and 7 at high water. An average paddler can make 2-3 mph. Making adjustments for wind speed, stops along the way, and any alternate exploration, you can use the above to roughly estimate your time of travel on the big river. The last unknown factor is towboats. You might lose time due to necessary waits for passing tows. Never try to outrun a tow, and never paddle across their line of travel.\nDangers of Paddling through Morgan City\nAs you are approaching the Port of Morgan City be prepared for several new challenging aspects to your adventure. Above Krotz Springs the levees hemmed in the river and you experienced strong currents. But below Krotz Springs the levees fell away, alternate channels and bayous opened up allowing the water to spread outwards from a one-mile wide valley to a 20 mile-wide valley. The river widened and the current slowed down. But now you have passed the cypress-tupelo swamp heart of the River of Trees and the levees are bringing all of the water back together again, plus additional water from rainfall and tributaries. You will feel the current picking up as you paddle through Stout’s Pass, and past Drew’s Pass. All of the water flowing down through Upper Grand Lake and Bayou Sorrel and down along the East Protection Levee now gathers together at the base of Flat Lake and starts migrating downstream towards Morgan CIty with more purpose. All of the water flowing down the West Basin from Butte La Rose on down is funneled along the West Protection Levee and focused into Stout’s Pass where it joins all the water pouring out of Flat Lake.\nThis is all to say that the Atchafalaya River moves deep and fast through Morgan City. Furthermore, there are three bridges to get under. Traffic volume and size will increase. Be very careful around bridges and when making landings. Pull your vessel high above water level, three feet above when possible. Waves from passing work boats, tugs and ships could wash over any low places, especially within inlets or at the edge of shallows (where the wave heights and tide effects tend to multiply frighteningly). The new challenges are these: 1) bigger waves, 2) busy tows and bigger ships, 3) Fog, 4) fleeted barges, 5) buoys, and 6) currents and tides.

{"question":"How does the licensing process for school counselors in Minnesota compare with their expected job market outlook and practical training requirements?","answer":"In Minnesota, school counselors must progress through three licensing tiers (two, three, and four), with tier four being a full license. The process requires a bachelor's degree and 24 graduate-level credits initially, though a graduate degree is needed for full licensure. Practical training is required through clinicals and practicums, where students must complete several semesters of counseling practice under licensed supervision. The job market outlook is positive, with educational, guidance, school, and vocational counselors projected to see 6.7% growth through 2026, resulting in 280 new jobs and approximately 470 annual openings including replacements.","context":["Minnesota Counseling License Requirements\nEarning counseling licensure in Minnesota can be a long journey as the state sets specific education and work requirements for each type of counseling license. There are over 17,000 counselors working in the state with most employed in substance abuse, behavioral disorder, and mental health counseling.1-5 A Minnesota counseling license can open up many opportunities to work with diverse populations in challenging situations. For example, Licensed Professional Clinical Counselors (LPCCs) provide mental health and psychotherapeutic counseling services to all age groups. If you’d like to know more about what it takes to develop a Minnesota counseling career, this page summarizes the major types of counseling licensure in the state.\nTable of Contents\n- How to Become a Counselor in Minnesota\n- Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor (LPCC) Licensing Process\n- Additional Counseling Careers and Licenses in Minnesota\n- Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT)\n- School Counselor\n- Licensed Alcohol and Drug Counselor (LADC)\n- Other Professional Counseling Careers\n- Minnesota Counseling Career and Salary Information\n- Counseling Associations in Minnesota\n- Frequently Asked Questions\nHow to Become a Counselor in Minnesota\nMinnesota requires that prospective counselors complete a degree that meets the coursework requirements for the practice area pursued. Many Minnesota counseling programs are available that meet these requirements, though degrees from out-of-state schools may also be sufficient. Depending on the license pursued, applicants may also need to meet other work experience and testing requirements.\n1. Decide which area of counseling to pursue.\nThe first step towards a career in counseling is to decide which area of counseling you’d like to pursue. The pathways to Minnesota counseling licensure vary and knowing which type of counseling interests you is important because it will help you focus on the correct degree program required for licensure.\n2. Earn the degree(s) required for your counseling practice area.\nIn Minnesota, you will need at least some post-secondary education to begin your career as a counselor. Some types of licensure also require graduate-level education in a related field. For example, mental health counselors must have a master’s degree with an internship component and specific clinical coursework and marriage and family therapists must have a master’s degree in marriage and family therapy or a closely related field. School counselors can begin the licensure process with a bachelor’s degree and 24 credits of related graduate study, but a graduate degree is required for full licensure. Substance abuse counselors are not required to have a graduate degree, but a bachelor’s degree with a supervised practicum is required.\n3. Get licensed to practice counseling in Minnesota.\nThe final step is to become licensed by in Minnesota. In Minnesota, licenses for clinical mental health counselors and substance abuse counselors are issued by the Minnesota Board of Behavioral Health and Therapy and licenses for marriage and family therapists are issued by the Minnesota Board of Marriage and Family Therapy. School counselors are licensed by the Minnesota Professional Educator Licensing and Standards Board. Continue reading to learn more about these licensure processes.\nLicensed Professional Clinical Counselor (LPCC) Licensing Process\nThe Minnesota Board of Behavioral Health and Therapy is responsible for issuing licenses to mental health counselors, known as Licensed Professional Clinical Counselors (LPCCs). LPCCs use professional counseling knowledge and skills to diagnose, evaluate, and treat psychosocial and behavioral issues and mental illnesses. The Board also offers LPC licensure, which allows trained counselors to provide psychotherapeutic services except for the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. For more about a career in professional counseling, read our mental health counselor career guide. LPCC applicants in Minnesota must have an accredited graduate degree comprised of at least 48 credits, including a 700-hour internship and clinical coursework in six key areas, including diagnostic assessments and clinical ethics.\n1. Pass the National Clinical Mental Health Counselor Examination (NCMHCE).\nProspective LPCCs must pass the National Clinical Mental Health Counselor Examination (NCMHCE) administered by the National Board of Certified Counselors (NBCC). The NCMHCE is a simulation-based exam designed to test your knowledge of clinical counseling theories and interventions. The NBCC provides a handbook and links to exam prep resources to help you study.\n2. Accrue supervised experience.\nThe Board has strict work experience requirements for LPCC candidates. You must complete 4,000 hours of supervised clinical experience, including assessments, diagnoses, and interventions of mental illnesses with children and adults. Additionally, 1,800 of the 4,000 hours must be direct client contact and you must receive two hours of supervision for every 40 hours accrued. Supervisors must have the LPCC Supervisor designation from the Board or submit an application and credential verification form to earn approval. Acceptable LPCC supervisors must have four years of experience, including two years of clinical diagnosis and treatment experience, and must complete 45 hours of supervision training.\n3. Apply for and receive your LPCC license.\nYou can begin the application process for LPCC licensure while you complete your supervised experience or after it has been completed. The application form is available online and should be mailed to the Board. At the time of application, you must pay the $150 application fee, the $250 initial licensure fee, and the $33.25 fingerprinting fee (fees current as of September 2019). The Board will send you more information about how to complete the fingerprint background check, which must be completed before your license will be approved.\nProfessional Counselor Licensure by Reciprocity in Minnesota\nMinnesota accepts and evaluates applications for licensure by reciprocity on a case-by-case basis. The burden is on the applicant to demonstrate that the licensure process in the state where they are licensed is equivalent to Minnesota requirements for LPCC licensure. The license held should also have a similar scope of practice to LPCCs in Minnesota, including clinical mental health skills. Reciprocity applicants must submit transcripts, exam scores, and documentation of 4,000 hours of supervised clinical experience to be considered.\nCounselor Licensing Renewal and Continuing Education Information\nThe Board issues renewal notices and forms 45 days prior to expiration. Minnesota has a complex continuing education (CE) system for LPCCs. The first renewal period for an LPCC license is four years. During that time, the licensee must complete 12 credits of related graduate study, up to a maximum of 60 credits, including the graduate degree, and 40 hours of CE. One credit of graduate coursework may be counted as 15 hours of CE during this period up to the 40-hour requirement. Thereafter, the license must be renewed every two years and licensees must complete 40 hours of CE during each renewal cycle. CE activities must be approved by the Board by submitting a request form at least 60 days before the proposed activity.\nAdditional Counseling Careers and Licenses in Minnesota\nChoosing an area of focus in the counseling profession will determine the steps of your career path. In addition to mental health counseling, some of the other major types of counseling licensure summarized below include licensed marriage and family therapists, school counselors, and substance abuse counselors.\nLicensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT)\nLicensed marriage and family therapists are licensed by the Minnesota Board of Marriage and Family Therapy. LMFT applicants must have a graduate degree in marriage and family therapy or a closely related field that is preferably accredited by COAMFTE. If the program is not accredited by COAMFTE, it must meet specific coursework requirements set by the Board. In Minnesota, marriage and family therapy is a specialized form of counseling and LMFTs are licensed to provide psychotherapy to individuals, couples, and families for emotional and mental problems affecting interpersonal dynamics, including premarital and marital counseling, divorce counseling, and family therapy. To become a licensed marriage and family therapist, follow these steps:\n- Apply to the Board for permission to take the AMFTRB national exam in marriage and family therapy.\n- Accrue supervised experience.\n- Apply for your LMFT license.\n- Pass the Minnesota marriage and family therapy oral exam.\n- Receive your LMFT license.\nTo learn more about LMFT careers, visit our LMFT career guide.\nThe Minnesota Professional Educator Licensing and Standards Board is responsible for issuing school counselor licenses. Minnesota school counselors work with students from kindergarten through twelfth grade to help promote age-appropriate academic, emotional, and behavioral development, and resiliency skills among students. There are three school counselor licensing tiers (tier two, tier three, and tier four) and tier four is considered a full license. The minimum requirement to begin the licensure process at tier two is a bachelor’s degree and 24 credits of graduate-level study in school counseling, but an accredited graduate degree in school counseling will enable you to apply directly to tier three. If you have a master’s degree that is not in school counseling, you must complete an approved school counselor preparation program before applying. After completing your graduate education, earn tier four school counseling licensure by completing the following steps:\n- Register as a tier three school counselor with the Board.\n- Earn supervised experience.\n- Request and receive your tier four school counseling license.\nRead more about opportunities in this field on our school counseling career guide.\nLicensed Alcohol and Drug Counselor (LADC)\nThe Minnesota Board of Behavioral Health and Therapy is responsible for issuing licenses for substance abuse counselors, known in Minnesota as the Licensed Alcohol and Drug Counselor (LADC) credential. There are two pathways to licensure, known as the standard method and the supervision method. Both pathways have the same minimum required education, which is a bachelor’s degree with at least 18 credits in drug and alcohol counseling and an 880-hour supervised practicum. The application form can be found online. In Minnesota, LADCs work in a variety of settings, including treatment facilities, correctional facilities, and hospitals, to assess, evaluate, and modify addictive behaviors related to alcohol and drug abuse.

What percentage of workplace injuries in 2017 were caused by slips, trips, and falls?","answer":"According to the data, more than 25% of workplace injuries across all industries were caused by slips, trips, and falls. Specifically, 62% of these incidents occurred on the same level, while 20% involved workers falling between two or more levels.","context":["Even if your company doesn’t operate in traditionally hazardous industries such as construction, workplace injury prevention still has to be addressed. Thankfully, there are simple steps you can take to keep your employees safe.\nEven if you do not consider your workplace to be dangerous, familiarizing yourself with common workplace injuries is a valuable exercise.\nSimilar to how the majority of car accidents occur within a few miles of people’s homes, accidents can happen in the most unassuming, seemingly non-hazardous workplaces.\nThe last thing you want as a leader is to deal with lawsuits, workers’ compensation claims, and lost productivity as a result of an avoidable injury in the workplace.\nUnderstanding the main causes of common injuries can help you spot potential risks and prevent accidents altogether, saving you time, stress, money, and even the risk of an injury yourself.\nIn this article, you’ll discover workplace injury statistics, common types of workplace accidents, and four tips you can use to best prevent injuries in your workplace.\n4 Steps to Preventing Workplace Injuries\n- Communicate hazards\n- Enforce proper attire\n- Keep the space orderly\n- Generate awareness\nThe Most Common Workplace Injuries\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that there were 882,730 occupational injuries and illnesses in 2017. Considering there were 125 million full-time workers in 2017, this means that nearly 0.7% of full-time employees were injured in 2017.\nSource: Housecall Pro\nOf those injury cases, data indicated that:\n- 11% of injuries involved overexertion from lifting or lowering\n- 64% of bone fractures resulted from accidents in the service-providing industries\n- 26% of bone fractures result from accidents in the trade, transportation, and utility industries\n- 62% of slips, trips, and falls occurred on the same level\n- 20% of slips, trips, and falls involved a worker falling between two or more levels\n- 15% of all non-fatal workplace injuries involved workers being struck by objects or equipment while on the job\n- 35% of cases across all industries were sprains, strains, and tears\nThis data also showed that, across all industries, more than 25% of injuries were caused by slips, trips, and falls.\nSource: Housecall Pro\nWhether you work in an environment known for increased levels of risk, such as a construction site, or in an unassuming restaurant or office building, slips and falls are going to happen.\nFour Steps to Prevent Workplace Injuries\nWhile workplace accidents are impossible to eliminate entirely, there are a number of data-driven steps you can use to successfully prevent the majority of accidents.\nSource: Housecall Pro\nConsider applying the following tips to keep your employees and job site safe and secure.\n1. Communicate Hazards\nPosting adequate signage that clearly marks any obstacles must be a high priority. For example, clearly marking spills and dangerous machinery can decrease both falling and pinching incidents.\nSpecifically, for machinery, ensuring that all tools necessary for operation are accounted for is vital. Installing proper lighting can make certain that your job site is easy to navigate and remain safe in.\n2. Enforce Proper Attire\nMandating employees to wear slip-resistant footwear, hardhats, and warm clothing are effective steps in the fight against workplace injuries.\nPersonal protective and life-saving equipment, including eye and face protection, are also powerful tools.\n3. Keep the Space Orderly\nConnected to communicating hazards, containing spills quickly is a must-do. This requires having proper clean-up equipment readily accessible on site, as well as routinely checking for spills.\nA clean space can prevent accidents.\n4. Generate Awareness\nEducating employees about how to move through the workday and space safely is paramount. The system doesn’t have to be extensive, though that wouldn’t hurt either.\nSimple briefings at the start of the workweek (in the form of a standup) allow managers to relay known hazards and best practices to their teams.\nEducation won’t only benefit employees, though. It also has advantages for managers, some of whom may not be trained in how to communicate with employees about workplace safety.\nTraining for managers can focus on identifying ways to encourage employees to report accidents and ‘near-misses,’ which are often ignored. These sessions are also a good time to highlight incident investigation skills and proper reporting procedures.\nMake Your Workplace Safer\nNow, with an enhanced understanding of the most common workplace accidents, you’re aware of the risks that your business faces in the day-to-day environment.\nAnd, with the above tips for accident prevention, you can proactively put a safety plan in place that effectively prevents accidents and keeps your employees safe on the job.\nNo program is perfect right out of the gate, so understand that there will always be room to improve your company’s safety plan.\nAs long as you offer opportunities for employees to communicate their opinions, consider them carefully, and dedicate time to implementing effective fixes, you’re on the right path."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c1b6807c-e4f7-4d05-8658-ff1f39aff1a6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm curious about how hard bop evolved - what specific musical elements did Horace Silver and Art Blakey introduce to create this jazz style?","answer":"Horace Silver and Art Blakey created hard bop by injecting contemporary R&B along with early jazz rhythmic elements (gospel and blues) into their music. They shifted emphasis from harmony back to melody, giving listeners recognizable patterns while still incorporating bebop lessons. This was in contrast to bebop and cool jazz which had moved away from jazz's rhythmic origins. They made the music more appealing to audiences by integrating complex bebop harmonies with stronger melodic and rhythmic elements.","context":["I didn’t want to end the year without doing at least ONE jazz review, and out of the hundreds of jazz albums on my to-do list, I chose the one I would characterize as “most exuberant.”\nHorace Silver was a pretty exuberant guy, with a smile to match. When you read descriptions of his piano style, you see words and phrases like “crisp,” “chipper,” “idiosyncratic,” “colorful,” “upbeat,” “exciting,” “uplifting,” and “generous good humor.” I suppose how you react to that last tag depends upon your sense of humor. Monk is the only pianist who makes me laugh, but Horace does make me smile.\nHorace Silver and the Jazz Messengers was an important and influential album, but before I get to that aspect of the work, I have to stress that it’s also an extremely enjoyable album. Jazz critics turn a lot of people off to jazz by droning on and on about the technical aspects of major developments in jazz, placing the aesthetic experience on the back burner. I will now harken back to the vernacular of the time and tell you that Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers is an absolute gas.\nIts influence owed a lot to perfect timing. The post-war years of jazz involved the sharp departure from the rhythmic emphasis of swing to the harmonic emphasis of bebop. In simple terms, you can dance to swing but you can’t dance—at least in the conventional sense—to bebop (and because a lot of bebop is played at breakneck speed, you’d probably die of a coronary). Bebop made things even more complicated because the harmonies the beboppers created were complex, non-standard harmonies—harmonies that sounded strange to the ears of anyone raised on classical music or The Andrews Sisters. In a muted response to bebop, some jazz musicians (particularly on the West Coast, but also Miles Davis) decided they wanted to slow the tempo and ease up on the intensity to produce a lighter sound while still embracing the harmonic connections bebop made possible. The critics named this style cool jazz (and in a fit of classification madness, later “discovered” a sub-genre of cool jazz called “West Coast Jazz.”) If you’re familiar with Dave Brubeck’s Time Out, that record is allegedly a marriage of cool jazz and West Coast Jazz (said the critics, ignoring the Turkish influences).\nThe thing with bebop and cool jazz is that both had moved jazz a long way from its rhythmic origins, particularly blues and gospel. Jazz lost a good chunk of its audience during these years in part because the music lacked what the average person would identify as rhythm. “Fer chrissakes, can’t ya gimme somethin’ I can at least snap my fingers to?” cried frustrated jazz fans.\n“Sure thing!” said Horace Silver and Art Blakey, the masterminds behind a newly-formed jazz combo called the Jazz Messengers (the name had been around for a while, in Art’s possession). What Horace and Art did is inject contemporary R&B along with the early rhythmic underpinnings of jazz (gospel and blues) into their music. Horace (who composed most of the work) also shifted the emphasis from harmony back to melody, giving the average listener patterns they could easily recognize and recall. They didn’t abandon all the lessons from bebop, but integrated those lessons into compositions characterized by melody and rhythm to make the music more appealing to an audience.\nThe critics had to name it something, so they called it hard bop.\nIf you’ve never heard Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers, I’m going to tell you right now that you’re wrong. I am 100% positive you have heard snippets of several of the songs on this album—maybe in a film, maybe on television, maybe in the background music that accompanies your shopping spree if you’re lucky to shop in a place that doesn’t buy the cheapest muzak available. I would guess the two you’ve heard are “Doodlin'” and “The Preacher,” but “Creepin’ In” is also a safe bet. When Horace Silver set out to create memorable songs, he did not fuck around. The melodic phrases will stick in your head forever.\n“Room 608” kickstarts the album with a high-speed swing (240bpm) that certainly fits the bop paradigm. After a memorable introduction heavy on bluesy major and minor seventh chords (with some fascinating 6/9 variations and a loaded G7 at the finish), the quintet takes flight in a classic unison arrangement. A thunderous—and I mean fucking THUNDEROUS—drumroll from Art Blakey announces the shift from unison playing to soloists, and first up is the amazing and classically underrated Kenny Dorham on trumpet. With Horace Silver pushing him with assertive rhythmic support, Kenny flies like an eagle, completely in command of his instrument despite the breakneck speed. Combining bright clear notes with high-speed trills isn’t easy, but Kenny makes it all sound like a walk in the park. I hate to see him go, but the disappointment is fleeting as Horace Silver takes us on a solo loaded with bright melody and spiced with a short series of intensely played blue notes that certify the piece as hard bop. Although a pianist can’t bend notes, you can achieve a similar effect with a quick run that ends on a flattened fifth or seventh (or a flattened sixth if you’re really evil), and Horace had the speed, discipline and percussive ability to pull it off with gusto. A stop time unison segment follows with a saxophone teaser in the middle, indicating Hank Mobley is next up. I’ve always felt that Hank should have taken the first solo, saving Kenny for last, simply because Hank was from the laid-back school while Kenny Dorham had greater dynamic range and command. I do notice that Horace seems to intensify his playing during Hank’s solo, placing himself closer to the center of attention by focusing on the upper end of the keyboard. Hank gives way to Art Blakey, who restores the balance with a thumping drum solo that only hints at his virtuosity but successfully restores the intensity of the piece. All’s well that ends well as the quintet returns in tight unison, the last note going to bassist Doug Watkins, who has matched Art beat for beat to keep this sucker moving. “Room 608” is a knockout opening piece that displays the talents of the soloists and the absolute commitment of the band to the music.\n“Creepin’ In” is a late-night mood piece that seems to begin as a minor blues but expands to include a larger chord palate as it moves forward, with A-flat minor serving as the anchor. Here Hank Mobley comes first after the unison introduction, his mellow tone reinforcing the smoky bar ambience. Kenny follows his lead by restraining his blow, happy to explore the myriad possibilities inside and outside of the baseline chord progression. Great contributions by both gentlemen, but throughout the piece I’ve had one ear focused solely on what Horace Silver is doing, and while it may be pianist favoritism, I find his work absolutely riveting. During the introduction, he serves as call-and-response to the main theme, providing a rather loping counterpoint that inspires a picture of a patron who’s had a bit too much of the sauce. Every now and then, though, he throws in a riff that strengthens the progression at just the right moment. During Hank’s solo, Horace turns up the brightness while shifting from chords in the pattern to slight variants that are complementary only within the larger harmonic palette of bebop. All brilliantly connective, but when it’s turn for his solo, he shifts to Count Basie minimalism with a series of eventually descending blue note duplets before latching onto the main chord pattern. His next descent sounds almost classical, with formal-sounding trills that magically lead back to a more bluesy feel. His last descent combines a daring run down the keyboard before he reinforces the theme and ends in one beautiful flurry of blue. Although Monk is my favorite pianist, on the rare but pleasant occasions when I sit in with a jazz combo, I use Horace Silver as my model for sustaining an unbroken connection with the theme. While “Creepin’ In” is the longest piece on album, clocking in at 7:27, it never drags thanks to the combination of discipline and diversity of the combo and Horace Silver’s ability to pull it all together.\n“Stop Time” ratchets up the tempo and gives everyone in the band a place in the spotlight, where they all shine. Art Blakey’s solo is framed within brief phrases from Dorham and Mobley on the first few rounds, but when they break the frame and let him go, he pounds those skins like there’s no tomorrow. Critics and fans have noted the relative restraint Art Blakey displays on this album, making moments like this solo all the more special. It’s followed by “To Whom It May Concern,” an interesting piece incorporating flamenco rhythm influences in the “chorus” and “urban cool” in the “verses.” “Hippy” gives the combo another chance to display their tightness in unison and the soloists another chance to riff off a straightforward chord pattern and the Blakey-Watkins rhythm section. Blakey’s solo here features one of his marvelous drum rolls, leading to a strong finish.\nMy first reaction to “The Preacher” is usually disorientation—something along the lines of “What the fuck?” Here I am digging the hard bop sounds mid-50’s America and all of a sudden I’m yanked back in space in time to Dixieland in the 1920’s. What the hell is “The Preacher” doing here?\nMy reaction is understandable and supported by precedent: producer Alfred Lion didn’t want the song on the album either. Horace Silver held his ground, and lo and behold, “The Preacher” became the album’s hit: another entry in my “What the fuck do I know?” journal.\nInterestingly, the song did not originate anywhere near the bayou, but on an English train. Silver took the chords from a 1926 novelty hit called “Show Me the Way to Go Home,” written by two enterprising gents who wrote under the synonym “Irving King.” They were on a train heading out of London one evening, got likkered up and wrote a song about the numbing effects of alcohol. Back in the days when sheet music still held sway with the music-purchasing public, “Show Me the Way to Go Home” sold over two million copies, making the fake Irvings rich and respectable. The song has been recorded by many artists over the years, and modern listeners probably know the song from the movie Jaws.\nJazz composers often borrow chords from old songs as a starting point for new compositions, so it wasn’t unusual that Horace Silver found inspiration in this bit of Vaudeville. Where he differed from his contemporaries was in his straightforward approach—instead of deconstructing the piece à la Charlie Parker, he changed the rhythm to a good old Dixieland strut . . . well, kinda sorta. The first two passages are positively prehistoric, classic New Orleans jazz à la the Jazz Preservation Hall Band. After that, it’s smooth sailing on a looser rhythm where the soloists pay due respect to the melodic structure of the song while removing the starch, creating in effect a delightful tribute to the origins of jazz that clearly establishes the genetic connection to this newfangled hard bop stuff. When the combo returns to the main theme, the reaction is a smile instead of a jerk, and you appreciate the ingenuity that went into the arrangement.\nThe only non-Silver composition on the album is Hank Mobley’s piece, “Hankerin’.” This nice, breezy uptempo piece is a good intro to hard bop for the neophyte because of its cheerful major key melodic lines. Hank’s solo is relatively brief but helps temper the speed of the piece through his “no sweat” approach to the sax. Kenny Dorham absorbs the cue and delivers his solo without a lot of drama. Horace gets the bulk of the attention with a nimble, melodic solo that might sound sweet in a slower tempo. All through the piece, Art Blakey has expressed a certain restlessness, adding unexpected thumps and rolls in spots. When he finally gets his turn, you can hear him muttering to himself as enters the drummer’s trance and lays out a series of rolls and combinations over an ever-steady hi-hat beat. Blakey was Monk’s favorite drummer, and his versatility and ability to immerse himself in the flow demonstrated here shows how he earned that status.\nThe album closes with the familiar sounds of “Doodlin’.” Ira Gitler’s liner notes emphasize the inherent humor of the piece, an effect achieved by Mobley and Dorham playing in unison separated by an octave and a series of staccato notes in the third segment of this twelve-bar blues. When I hear the dominant line, I hear echoes of the Dizzy Gillespie-Kenny Clarke-Charlie Parker derivative piece, “Salt Peanuts,” an equally humorous morsel of music. “Doodlin'” also features Horace Silver’s slickest solo—urbane, confident and minimalistic. Once he leaves the spotlight, he remains in the perceptual field with superb rhythmic support that varies between chords, extended riffs and strong punctuation. Mobley follows Silver with an elegant passage, perfectly setting up Kenny Dorham’s sexy-as-fuck solo. He could have gone on forever as a far as this chick is concerned, but he graciously gives way to Art Blakey’s multifaceted attack, and I forget all about Kenny. Yes, I’m a musical slut! The record ends and you think to yourself, “Man, what a great combo!”\nToo bad they only recorded the songs you hear on this album and a couple of live gigs. While The Jazz Messengers lived on for decades in various configurations under Art Blakey, this group lasted less than two years. Both Blakey and Silver achieved the status of jazz legends; in Horace’s case more for his compositions than his piano, but I still consider him one of the best who ever put fingers to a keyboard. His joyful expressiveness—his exuberance—shines through in every performance. When you listen to Horace Silver, you may not hear a man who could play with the dexterity of Art Tatum or delight you with surprising choices like Monk, but you hear the sound of a man who couldn’t be happier to be alive and making music."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7a164752-b323-4365-b7ef-7c54de348fa8>"],"error":null}
