{"question":"How can apex-minor-free graphs be structurally decomposed for algorithmic purposes?","answer":"The edges of an apex-minor-free graph can be partitioned into k pieces (for any k) such that contracting any piece results in a bounded-treewidth graph. Additionally, the apices can be made adjacent only to 'quasivortices' of bounded treewidth, strengthening the previous structural results from Robertson and Seymour's Graph Minor Theory.","context":["Approximation Algorithms via Structural Results for Apex-Minor-Free Graphs\nWe develop new structural results for apex-minor-free graphs and show their power by developing two new approximation algorithms. The first is an additive approximation for coloring within 2 of the optimal chromatic number, which is essentially best possible, and generalizes the seminal result by Thomassen  for bounded-genus graphs. This result also improves our understanding from an algorithmic point of view of the venerable Hadwiger conjecture about coloring H-minor-free graphs. The second approximation result is a PTAS for unweighted TSP in apex-minor-free graphs, which generalizes PTASs for TSP in planar graphs and bounded-genus graphs [20,2,24,15].\nWe strengthen the structural results from the seminal Graph Minor Theory of Robertson and Seymour in the case of apex-minor-free graphs, showing that apices can be made adjacent only to vortices if we generalize the notion of vortices to “quasivortices” of bounded treewidth, proving a conjecture from . We show that this structure theorem is a powerful tool for developing algorithms on apex-minor-free graphs, including for the classic problems of coloring and TSP. In particular, we use this theorem to partition the edges of a graph into k pieces, for any k, such that contracting any piece results in a bounded-treewidth graph, generalizing previous similar results for planar graphs  and bounded-genus graphs . We also highlight the difficulties in extending our results to general H-minor-free graphs.\nKeywordsApproximation Algorithm Planar Graph Chromatic Number Structural Result Surface Part\nUnable to display preview.

{"question":"What are the key differences in how Food Shift and Waste Management engage with external partners and organizations to achieve their food waste reduction goals?","answer":"Food Shift views other organizations as allies rather than competitors, working with caterers, hotels, and event planners while expressing interest in collaborating with food banks and potentially the military for logistics expertise. Meanwhile, Waste Management has established formal partnerships with multiple organizations including The Recycling Partnership, Keep America Beautiful, various industry associations (NW&RA, SWANA, ISRI), and specific entities like Alameda County Community Food Bank. They also partner with EPA and local stakeholders, demonstrating a more structured, multi-level partnership approach involving both national organizations and local communities.","context":["Dana Frasz is the founder and director of Food Shift, which works with communities, businesses, and government to shift behaviors toward a more sustainable use of food. Food Shift’s programs increase awareness and action around food waste reduction; decrease the amount of edible food rotting in the landfill; and create jobs in the food recovery sector.\nFollowing are Dana’s responses to audience questions that did not get answered during the panel discussion “Beyond the Green Bin,” co-hosted by CUESA and the Commonwealth Club on March 24, 2014.\nQ: Do you just target retail and consumer food waste, or are you looking at addressing farm food waste? If so, will your model therefore compete with CropMobster?\nDana: Food Shift is not currently addressing farm food waste. We view CropMobster and other organizations and platforms in the space as allies rather than competitors. We are all in this together and all our efforts are needed to move the needle on this issue.\nQ: Are you working with caterers, hotels, and event planners to recover and donate food?\nDana: Yes, absolutely. Food Shift is currently in the design and planning stages of a service that will provide customized assistance around food recovery to caterers, hotels, and event planners. We are also exploring the potential for technology integration to make it easier for food donors to connect with food recovery organizations easily and efficiently.\nQ: Are you working with the US military to reduce food waste?\nDana: Not yet, but it’s an excellent idea! So much of reducing food waste is about logistics. There is definitely a place at the table for military to share their expertise!\nQ: What roles do food banks play in rescuing stranded food? Why aren’t you working with food banks?\nDana: Food banks play a huge and essential role in capturing and redistributing surplus food and Food Shift would love to work more closely with food banks. It’s important to note that food banks are generally going after large quantities of surplus food from farms, manufacturers, or large grocery chains. That leaves smaller quantities of food from grocers, delis, restaurants, and catered events without a formalized system for food recovery. That is the gap that Food Shift and other food recovery groups like Food Runners are working to fill.\nQ: What kind of food infrastructure is needed to support reducing food waste?\nDana: We need everything from containers to technology to education to policy changes! That’s why Food Shift is focused on education, advocacy, and action. Based on our work in Oakland we’ve learn that many food assistance organizations throughout the region are in need of food but are unaware of its location, lack legitimate credentials, and don’t have the resources, staff, and infrastructure to secure, store, and distribute food effectively. The food recovery space is in great need of investment to support staff, technology solutions, transportation, logistics, and refrigeration. As a nation we spend $750 million each year to dispose of surplus food that could be donated. We need to shift some of those resources toward the recovery and redistribution of food instead.\nCUESA (Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture) is dedicated to cultivating a sustainable food system through the operation of farmers markets and educational programs. Learn More »","Waste Management's Climate Action Contribution\nAbout Waste Management's Climate Efforts\nIn 2017, the services that Waste Management provided offset the emissions of our own operations by three times. Waste Management’s new goal, a jump from three times to four, will require us to decrease the emissions from our operations while increasing the emissions-reduction services we provide for ourselves and our customers.\n• Fleet and fuel: Waste Management will emit fewer emissions through our operations by transitioning from diesel to alternative fuel vehicles in 90 percent of our entire fleet. We will use renewable fuel in over 90 percent of our vehicles. Our goal of emitting fewer emissions requires an investment in a Near Zero fleet. Over 90 percent of our fleet purchases are ”NZVs” (Near Zero Vehicles), which will allow us to reduce emissions associated with our fleet 45 percent by 2038, against a 2010 baseline.\n• Facilities: Waste Management will continue to improve energy efficiency at our facilities, reducing our own emissions throughout our systems.\n• Production of renewable energy: Waste Management will avoid emissions by capturing methane at our landfills for use by third parties as renewable electricity and renewable fuel.\n• Recycling: Waste Management will increase avoided emissions by recycling materials for the greatest environmental benefits.\nWe are transforming our business model to seize opportunities to compete in tomorrow’s climate-constrained world. Each day, our customers look for our help to reduce their GHG emissions, and this is also a strategic imperative for our business. We continue to expand the productivity of our recycling operations and explore the many options to reduce our footprint. This includes:\n› Producing low-carbon fuels from waste.\n› Transitioning our fleet to renewable natural gas vehicles.\n› Improving the energy efficiency of our facilities.\n› Increasing our use of renewable energy.\n› Expanding the productivity of our recycling operations, with an emphasis on increasing the recycling of those materials that provide the greatest GHG reduction benefit.\n› Providing climate-related sustainability consulting services to customers who want to improve tracking, reduce their carbon footprints, and/or prepare for potential carbon cap-and-trade or carbon tax scenarios.\nLOW-CARBON FUEL PRODUCTION\nAs trash decomposes it produces gas, which is roughly half carbon dioxide and half methane. At our landfill gas-to-energy (LFGTE) facilities, we capture this methane and use it beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel to power homes and provide fuel for industrial uses and commercial vehicles, including our own. The U.S. EPA endorses landfill gas as a renewable energy resource, putting it in the same category as wind, solar and geothermal resources.\nToday, Waste Management is the largest LFGTE developer and operator in North America, with projects generating the equivalent of nearly 4.5 million megawatt-hours per year, enough energy to power 460,000 homes, or the equivalent of replacing nearly 2.5 million tons of coal annually. In 2017, approximately 55 percent of landfill gas collected at Waste Management-owned and -operated facilities was used for beneficial use projects, and we did not directly incinerate waste for energy recovery.\nWe look for capacity to generate renewable energy throughout the organization. For example, in 2017, we hosted the generation of 100 MWh of energy from wind, and we will host up to 54 megawatts of landfill-based solar farms by the end of 2018. We continue to look for opportunities to use solar electricity in support of U.S. EPA’s RE-Powering America’s Land initiative, which encourages renewable energy development on current and formerly contaminated lands, landfills and mine sites when it is aligned with the community’s vision for the site.\nAdditional innovations and investments to enhance renewable energy production at our landfills include:\n• Technologies to convert materials into ultra-low-sulfur diesel and other transportation fuels and petroleum products\n• Small-scale gasification to convert solid biomass feedstock as well as other combustible feedstocks into a high hydrogen and carbon monoxide-rich synthetic gas\n• Thermal chemical conversion of waste materials into advanced biofuels such as ethanol, as well as renewable chemicals\n• Accelerated high solids aerobic and anaerobic digestion to produce renewable energy from organics\n• Conversion of landfill gas into renewable natural gas used to power vehicles, generate electricity at our landfill gas-to-energy (LFGTE) facilities, generate power off-site, or use as a heating fuel; and\n• Conversion of biomass into organic salts that can be converted into a high-octane gasoline that can then be blended directly into a refiner’s fuel pool, avoiding many of the blending and logistics challenges presented by ethanol.\nREDUCING GHGs FROM OUR FLEET\nWith a vision to create a near-zero emissions collection fleet, we’re now working toward a science-based target to reduce emissions associated with our fleet 45 percent by 2038, against a 2010 baseline, and from 2010 through 2017 we have reduced fleet emissions 28 percent.\n• Investing ~$400 million/year in the cleanest near-zero-emissions trucks available\n• 6,536 natural gas vehicles in operation, the largest the largest heavy-duty natural gas truck fleet of its kind in North America\n• 80% of new purchases are natural gas vehicles, which emit nearly zero particulate emissions, cut GHG emissions by 15 percent and are quieter than diesel trucks.\n• For every diesel truck we replace with natural gas, we reduce our use of diesel fuel by an average of 8,000 gallons per year along with a reduction of 14 metric tons of GHG emissions annually.\n• We have financed, constructed and operate 107 natural gas fueling stations across North America, with 29 of these also open to the public\n• We currently fuel over a third of our natural gas fleet with renewable natural gas (RNG) produced from landfill biogas at three of our own facilities plus third-party producers.\n• 100 percent of our natural gas fleet in California, Oregon and Washington runs on RNG, which reduces GHG emissions by 70 percent compared to diesel.\nAVOIDING GHGs THROUGH SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS MANAGEMENT\nOur greatest contribution to making a positive impact on the environment comes from waste reduction services and recycling. Fully 60% of our emissions reduction contribution is tied to our recycling activities alone, and by recycling the right things well, we have the opportunity to reduce GHG emissions by over 80%. Significantly reducing GHG emissions is both achievable and essential to ensure our operations have a positive and lasting impact on the environment and the communities we serve.\nThe method by which customers choose to manage waste materials has a direct impact on the amount of GHG emissions generated. According to the EPA’s Waste Reduction Model (WARM), for example, three times the life cycle emissions are generated when mixed recyclable material is disposed rather than recycled. Consider that in 2017, Waste Management avoided the generation of 32,588,647 MTCO2e life cycle emissions by recycling materials or repurposing them to generate renewable energy and create compost rather than disposing them.\nWaste Management has several key partnerships, including The Recycling Partnership, a nonprofit organization that works closely with cities, counties and states to implement effective programs; Keep America Beautiful, which works with local communities to help teach the fundamentals of recycling to a broad consumer base; and Industry Associations that include the National Waste and Recycling Association (NW&RA), the Solid Waste Association of North America (SWANA) and the Institute for Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI). Our national partnerships on recycling are important means to educate legislators, regulators and the public about ways public policy can maximize the environmental benefits latent in recycling or impede progress in this area, and to advance the sustainability of recycling over the long term by serving as resources on recycling technology, end markets, and life cycle analyses. Local partnerships are equally important, and we participate actively with groups around the country.\nFOOD WASTE AND REDUCING GHGS\nOne-third of food goes uneaten across the globe. Wasted food can add billions of tons of GHG emissions to the atmosphere. In the U.S. alone, more than 60 million tons of food is wasted each year, and displaced food carries a price tag of well over $160 million. The EPA estimates more food reaches landfills and incinerators than any other single material in our everyday trash, making up 22 percent of the disposed stream. Organic materials — primarily discarded food and yard trimmings — comprise approximately 30 percent of the waste stream.\nWaste Management partners with organizations to divert food waste from landfills and to prevent food from entering the waste stream to begin with.\nAs part of a recent California state grant award, Waste Management of Alameda County, Inc. (WMAC) received funding to purchase equipment for organics processing and to support Alameda County Community Food Bank’s (ACCFB) food rescue efforts. The project is expected to improve Oakland’s total waste diversion from 8 percent to 52 percent by diverting 41,540 additional tons per year (TPY) of organics and 26,208 TPY of recycling. The organics diversion alone will avoid 14,459 MT CO2e per year. And, by 2027, the project will have diverted 305,434 tons of organic waste from the landfill and reduced GHG emissions by 106,495 MT CO2e.\nTo support projects such as these, WM has the largest organics recycling infrastructure, including\n• 40 composting and mulching facilities, 13 of which can accept food waste\n• 4 CORe® organic recycling processes that take food waste from restaurants, schools, food processing plants and grocery stores, screen it to remove contaminants, and blend the waste into an engineered slurry that dramatically increases the production of biogas in anaerobic digesters and is used to create renewable energy.\nPreventing food waste upstream, before it becomes waste, benefits both the environment in terms of emissions reduction and communities in need. We work with U.S. EPA and stakeholders on new ways to avoid emissions from discarded food by reducing the amount discarded. For example, as part of its overall commitment to the City of Oakland, Waste Management has partnered with Alameda County, the City of Oakland, ACCFB and Stop Waste for food recovery in the county. Founded in 1985, ACCFB has become the hub of a vast collection and distribution network that provides food for 240 nonprofit agencies in Alameda County — distributing more than 25 million meals last year. The funding will support the Food Bank in bringing five additional stores into its network and will match these stores with local ACCFB network agencies. Collection of food from the five additional stores will result in approximately 175,000 meals per year for local populations in need, while diverting 50 TPY in 2018 and 100 TPY from 2019 onward.\nWhile our “last generation” natural gas engine cuts smog-producing nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by up to 50 percent compared to the cleanest diesels, our 2017 near- zero-emission natural gas engine (ISL-G “NZ”) is the cleanest heavy-duty machine ever certified by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Waste Management helped pioneer this engine with Cummins, and it now provides a 95 percent reduction in NOx emissions compared to the current NOx standard and a 93 percent reduction in NOx compared to the latest diesel engine technology. Additionally, the new engine is already certified at 16 percent below the current GHG emission standard and is 12 percent below the 2027 standard.\nWe also have the largest fleet of hybrid bulldozers in the industry, operating 42 Caterpillar D7E’s at 39 different landfill locations across the country. The D7E’s rate of hourly fuel consumption is on average six gallons less than the D8 tractors it replaces, translating into annual savings of nearly one half million gallons of diesel fuel.\nWheel loaders are another electric hybrid machine we are exploring. In conjunction with Volvo Construction Equipment, we hosted two field tests for Volvo’s prototype LX1 electric hybrid wheel loader at our Redwood Landfill and Moreno Valley Transfer Station, both in California. Data was collected on the wheel loader’s fuel efficiency and GHG reduction against a conventional machine. The LX1 achieved approximately a 50 percent and 45 percent fuel efficiency improvement on average, at the Redwood and Moreno Valley sites respectively.\nLAND USE AND ENVIRONMENTAL PRESERVATION\nWaste Management owns a wide range of properties — large and small, urban and rural. At our larger properties, in the substantial areas that we set aside as buffer zones, we make a concerted effort to enhance the natural value of the land by providing habitat for wildlife and offering educational opportunities and natural beauty to the surrounding community.\nOne of our key partners in protecting and enhancing wildlife habitat is the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC), a nonprofit organization recognized as the authoritative conservation program for businesses. Our long-standing partnership with WHC has resulted in the creation of 90 WHC-certified projects at Waste Management sites. Through project certification, the WHC recognizes commendable wildlife habitat management and community environmental education programs. Together, these properties encompass nearly 20,000 acres created, enhanced or protected for wildlife across North America. The projects often feature a community environmental education component.\nOur projects are included in the WHC’s Conservation Registry, an interactive database that maps conservation, restoration and wildlife habitat-enhancement projects worldwide, allowing us to better understand the impact of our conservation programs. We continue to expand certified sites to include small urban habitats at transfer stations, recycling facilities and other smaller Waste Management facilities.\nBeyond the wildlife habitats certified at our active and closed facilities, we lease our unused property for productive use by farmers and ranchers. As of 2017, more than 22,300 acres in the United States and Canada were used for this purpose.\nWe work with WHC on collaborative efforts among nonprofits, government agencies and companies to create conservation strategies. For example, the Corporate Pollinator Ecosystem Project (C-PEP) brings together companies with the United States Business Council for Sustainable Development to identify pollinator habitats on corporate land and ultimately help revive declining pollinator populations. We have more than 50 programs dedicated to protecting pollinators throughout North America.\nWe also support the Highways Bettering the Economy and Environment Pollinator Protection Act (Highways BEE Act). If passed, the law would facilitate efforts by states to use more pollinator-friendly highway landscaping practices, including reducing mowing and planting native plants and grasses that provide habitats and foliage for bees and monarch butterflies and bees.\nWe incorporate STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education into most of our wildlife habitat programs to demonstrate the value of biodiversity to children and instill the importance of being good environmental stewards.\nSOLAR ENERGY AT CLOSED LANDFILLS\nOur large geographic footprint of landfills and their proximity to existing infrastructure can make them ideal locations for large-scale solar installations, aligned with U.S. EPA’s RE-Powering America’s Land initiative. First launched in 2008, this innovative federal program has resulted in nearly 253 installations on contaminated lands, landfills and mine sites, with a cumulative installed capacity of just over 1,397 megawatts nationwide. Currently, we lease seven closed landfills for solar development.\nClimate Action Commitments\nCurrent Climate Actions Waste Management Is Taking:\nReduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Emissions\nCompanies making this commitment are taking action to reduce ‘short-lived climate pollutants’ (SLCPs) – including methane, black carbon, tropospheric ozone and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) – vital to significantly reducing near-term global warming and improving public health.\nClick learn more for additional information.\nUndertaking this commitment aligns with the work of the US Climate Alliance, which is prioritizing this challenge.

Drafted by the CSA Blockchain/Distributed Ledger Working Group, the report encourages stakeholders to take a holistic view of blockchain/DLT network security by providing a reference security architecture to guide stakeholders' thinking around the why, what, and how aspects of Hyperledger Fabric security.\nThe paper explains the three layers of blockchain security (conceptual, component interaction, and technology) and their interaction with on-premises and cloud IT environments of organizations in critical sectors. It addresses both the value of security controls in terms of controlling an organization’s exposure to operational risk, but also how the security measures can enable organizations to exploit business opportunities.\n“There is no shortage of guidance on how to design, configure, and deploy Hyperledger Fabric, but too few documents take a systematic approach to Fabric security that recognizes that durable security always starts with requirements,” said Dr. Frederick Wamala, the paper’s lead author. “Configuration-led fabric guidance, for instance, rarely explains why high assurance security controls are needed to obtain authorization to operate blockchain solutions in critical sectors. We wanted to close the information gap by highlighting the steps that should be considered when designing these types of blockchain solutions.”\nThe document offers guidance in helping:\n- Business and government leaders understand the true risk balance of using blockchain and the resultant security, financial, regulatory, reputational, business, and consumer risks\n- Chief Information Security Officers and enterprise security architects assess the risk of introducing DLT components into a corporate network while maintaining compliance\n- Regulators and internal risk managers evaluate the potential risks associated with financial crime, consumer exposure, and espionage and devise appropriate policies in response\n- Individuals gain high-level knowledge about blockchain security and reduce their exposure to fraudulent activity and unsuitable products\nThe Blockchain/Distributed Ledger Working Group works to produce useful content to educate different industries on blockchain and its proper use, as well as define blockchain security and compliance requirements based upon different industries and use cases.

{"question":"What are the proper preparation methods for salmon eggs as bait, and what are the key rules for storing regular salmon after purchase?","answer":"For salmon eggs as bait, they must be prepared by cutting the skeins lengthwise while keeping eggs intact and maintaining as much membrane as possible, as this membrane helps hold the bait together in water. Multiple lengthwise separations may be needed depending on skein size. For regular salmon storage after purchase, if bought chilled in a sealed package, it should not be removed from the packaging during storage. If not planning to eat chilled salmon within a few days, it should be frozen immediately. If the salmon is frozen when purchased, it must either be thawed and cooked immediately or placed in the freezer without allowing any partial defrosting. The fish should only be frozen if there are no signs of spoilage.","context":["/ Prawn Cures for\nSalmon & Steelhead\nThose fishermen/women that use salmon roe (eggs) for bait seem to have very distinct ideas on how to cure it. If You talk to 20 of these people, you will probably get more than 20 different recipes.\nPreparation ; However before any cures are undertaken, preparation of the eggs as soon as the female fish is caught can make the difference between GOOD roe and NOT SO GOOD final product. For best results, the fish should be bled as soon as possible, the skeins removed, cleaned, placed in a clean baggie and placed on ice in a cooler. In preparing them, you need to cutting the skeins lengthwise, keeping the eggs as intact as possible and keeping them with as much membrane as possible. This membrane is what will hold the bait together when you have the bait in the water fishing. Depending on the size of the skein, you may have to make multiple lengthwise separations.\nCutting them into bait size sections comes by cutting across. Try not to force any eggs loose.\nMost of us take what we can get when it comes to eggs to cure. However there are some preferences, depending on your circumstances.\nSteelhead eggs ; Steelhead skeins are smaller, but Winter fish are usually matured enough to be about the right size and have enough membrane to hold the bait together.\nCoho eggs ; Eggs from fall fish are mature enough and have enough membrane to egg count to be about perfect for roe bait.\nChinook eggs ; Spring Chinook if taken late in the run work great. Fall Chinook may just fine, but if taken late, the eggs may be too large and not have enough membrane to hold the bait together for many casts.\n|Here eggs are being taken from Coho|\nStoring Baits ; Depending on how long you need the baits to be stored will determine the method. Preferred would be refrigerated, but some may go sour or start to mould if kept for some time. Freezing is the other option. I have found that the Colonel Sanders Country Fried reusable containers they serve potatoes/gravy or salad in work great and are about the right size.\nMany times you can just cover the bait with a folded paper towel after opening. Leave the now damp towel over the bait. If things dry out a tad, just add a bit of salt water which refreshes the bait leaving it still usable.\nEgg Cures ; The common consensus is when fishing for Salmon, any of the commercial cures will work fine. However for Steelhead, avoid those with too much sodium sulfite. This saves the natural egg color, if you need more color use Jello in orange or raspberry.\nI suggest you purchase the book Egg Cures proven recipes and techniques by Scott Haugen. In it he lists and explains 25 different egg cures. I will give a brief discussion of his favorite here.\nSome cures can be used right away, while others need to sit for a while. Others can only be refrigerated, while others may allow you to freeze them. Some may have a self life of a few months to others to a year or two. Do your homework as to your possible usage and pick the cure that fits your needs.\nOne of the old tried and true cures are a equal part sugar /salt/ borax mix. Sprinkle sugar and salt on the skein, rub in, let sit overnight, drain, cut into pieces (bait size), layer in borax.\nA simple one would be, Pro Cure salmon egg cure 1/2 and 1/2 bright red and orange, soak for 2 hrs, remove, let dry for 6-8 hrs, bag in zip-lock bags, refrigerate.\nOne common thing overlooked is when baiting onto the egg loop tied hook is to have the membrane laying toward the leader and away from the hook itself. This allows the membrane to hold the eggs better, allowing longer time in the water before you need to re-bait.\n|Here a combo egg/prawn bait is ready|\nPrawn Cures ; You can supplement your bait choices any time of the year by purchasing uncooked prawns from a grocery store. Curing the whole bait gives you an alternative to using just part or the whole prawn, depending on conditions.\n1 large pot\n20-30 small to medium sized prawns with heads on\n2 quarts water\n2 cups sea salt\n2 cups raw sugar\n2 cups Pink BorX O Fire\nMix all ingredients in the large pot (outside the house)\nBring to a boil & continue boiling for 10 minutes\nDump contents in a strainer and run cold water over, drain for an hour\nPack in a small container, pouring a small amount of rock salt over them, these can be refrigerated for some time.\nIf you want to add any flavor, (like egg) add a generous amount of Pautzke Nectar\nThis Page Under Construction\nCopyright © 2012 - 2015 LeeRoy Wisner All Rights Reserved\nBack to Ramblings\nOriginated 01-31-2012, Last updated\nContact the author","How to store salmon\nAny fish, including salmon, must be kept in the refrigerator. The shelf in this case does not really matter, but it is better to place the fish as high as possible. The lower compartments of refrigerators are usually intended for storing fruits and products that require higher temperature conditions. If you store salmon in inappropriate conditions, the surface of the fish will quickly begin to wind up, and its taste will begin to deteriorate at a rapid pace.\nHow to store salmon at home:\n- if chilled salmon was bought in a sealed package, then the fish should not be removed from it during the entire storage period;\n- if the chilled salmon is not planned to be eaten for several days, then it is better to freeze the fish immediately (if the salmon was bought in a package, then you can freeze it in it);\n- frozen salmon after purchase must either be thawed and cooked immediately, or placed in the freezer (it is better not to allow even partial defrosting of the frozen product);\n- it is only necessary to freeze fish without the slightest signs of spoilage (if an unpleasant smell appears during storage or the fish deteriorates, then freezing it will not only not correct the situation, but will significantly aggravate it);\n- it is necessary to store salmon in the refrigerator only in a covered state (if the fish is opened, then it can absorb the smell of other food products or spoil the taste of other dishes in the immediate vicinity);\n- It is recommended to wrap chilled salmon in foil (if the fish was purchased in a package, then this method can not be used, it is better to leave the container unopened);\n- it is better to store smoked or salted salmon in the refrigerator in a container or cover the fillet with a bowl (if the fish has been removed from the original packaging);\n- chilled salmon can be sprinkled with lemon juice or a cut lemon can be placed next to the fish (citrus will preserve the aroma and juiciness of the fish);\n- thawed salmon should be eaten as soon as possible;\n- – chilled salmon will be better preserved if placed on a layer of ice (the preparation should be stored in the refrigerator in the coolest zones, and the ice will have to be changed periodically);\n- a cloth soaked in vinegar can extend the shelf life of salmon (you just need to cover the fish with a damp cloth for a while so that the vinegar does not have time to saturate the salmon)\n- do not store chilled salmon and cooked fish nearby (both products can deteriorate in the shortest possible time or violate their taste characteristics).\nHow much and at what temperature to store salmon\nThe storage temperature for frozen salmon should be between -18 and -20 degrees. Under these conditions, the fish will remain fresh for 3-4 months. Defrosting and repeated freezing of the product during storage should not be allowed. Otherwise, the structure of the meat and the flavoring properties of salmon will be impaired, and its consumption will become hazardous to health.\nIn the refrigerator (on the upper shelves), salmon can be stored for a maximum of 5-6 days. It is recommended to eat fish earlier than the specified period. The longer the salmon is stored, the more its flavor characteristics change. The exception is fish that have been salted on their own. In this case, there are nuances of storage and eating.\nIf salmon is purchased salted or smoked, the unopened packaging can be stored in the refrigerator until the expiration date. If the container is open, the salmon should be eaten within a maximum of 10 days. If the fish was salted on its own, then the chosen technique and recommendations related to each specific method play a key role. On average, salted salmon can stay in the refrigerator for 2-3 weeks."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:31ce4528-d2b6-4029-a1ba-fbc5f0b01a7b>","<urn:uuid:a3a871e4-2bcd-49cd-abc4-496704026250>"],"error":null}

{"question":"How do agricultural fertilizers and common pesticides differ in their persistence and environmental impact on water systems?","answer":"Agricultural fertilizers and pesticides have distinct environmental impacts on water systems. Fertilizers mainly consist of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium compounds, with nitrogen having a high runoff coefficient of 5-30%, leading to lake and sea eutrophication. While fertilizers generally don't contain toxic substances, pesticides are more persistent and hazardous. Many pesticides don't break down quickly - while modern versions degrade faster than older ones like DDT, they can remain in soil, sediment, or water from weeks to over a year, sometimes breaking down into toxic and persistent chemicals. Pesticides can harm aquatic organisms through irrigation and stormwater runoff, particularly those ingredients that don't bind well to soil.","context":["In this article, a comprehensive discussion is arranged about water pollution. Besides, Sources of Water Pollution (point and non-point sources of water pollution) is also discussed here in detail. We hope, you will be benefited and get all the information that you are searching for.\nWater pollution is nothing but a phenomenon that is characterized by the deterioration of the quality of land water (rivers, lakes, marshes and groundwater) or seawater as a result of various human activities. In this article, we will first classify various humus activities that cause water pollution, discuss water pollution according to their characteristics, and then take a general view of water pollution which is currently in progress in our modern society. Human activities related to water pollution include various industries such as mining, agriculture, stock-breeding, fisheries, forestry, urban human activities, manufacturing industry, construction works and various tertiary industries. Then, in the last section of this article, we will classify wastewaters according to their physical and chemical properties.\n- 1 What is water pollution:\n- 2 Unpolluted vs. Polluted Water:\n- 3 Normal uses of water:\n- 4 Water Quality Parameters and Standards:\n- 5 Sources of Water Pollution:\n- 6 Causes of Water Pollution:\n- 7 Water Pollution by Agriculture:\n- 8 Water Pollution by Agricultural Chemicals:\nWhat is water pollution:\nWater pollution is nothing but any type of physical or chemical change in water that can adversely affect organisms. Nowadays water pollution is a global problem, affecting both industrialized and developing nations. The water pollution problems in the rich and the poor nations, however, arc quite different in many respects. Heat, toxic metals, acids, sediments, animal and human wastes, and synthetic organic compounds foul the waterways of developed nations. Human and animal wastes, sediment, and pathogenic organisms head the list in the non-industrialized nations. In developing countries, unsanitary water and malnutrition account for most of the illness and death.\nThe term ‘water pollution’ is referred to the addition of something with water of excess material (or heat) that is harmful to humans, animals, to desire able aquatic life or otherwise causes significant hazards in the normal activities of various living communities in or near bodies of water. The National Water Commission stated (1973) that ‘water will be polluted if it has been not of sufficiently high quality to be suitable for the highest use people wish to make of it at present on int future.”\nIn reality, the term water pollution refers to a type of aquatic contamination between two extremes:\n1. A highly enriched place such as a river or, over-productive biotic community, such as a river or lake with nutrients from sewage, fertilizer (cultural eutrophication), or\n2. A body of water poisoned by hazardous or toxic chemicals which eliminate living organism or even exclude all forms of life.\nThe term “water pollution” seems to be clear to all. Nevertheless, it is worth determining that its real meaning as this has changed over the course of time. Felfoldy’s (1982) precise definition is the following: “Water pollution refers to every impact which changes the quality of our surface and subsoil waters to such a degree that its suitability either for human consumption or for the support of man’s natural life processes with decrease or cease”\nUnpolluted vs. Polluted Water:\nPollution is totally contrary to purity. When environmental pollution has been the topic, the term has come to mean a deviation from a normal, rather than from a pure state. This has been particularly true for water. This widely distributed substance or material has been such a good solvent that it has been never found naturally in completely pure state.\nEven in the most unpolluted geographical regions, rainwaters is having dissolved CO2, O2, N2 and other gases and may also carry in suspension dust or other particulates picked up from the atmosphere. Surface and ground waters generally contain dissolved compounds of metals like Na, Mg, Ca, and Fe. The term hard water used to describe water that contains minimal amounts of such compounds. Even the water we drink is also not pure in a chemical sense. It may happen that suspended solids have been removed and harmful bacteria or pathogens destroyed, but many substances still remain in solution. Indeed, completely pure water would not be pleasurable to drink, because it has been being the impurities that impart water the characteristic “taste” by which it is recognized. It is desirable that water need some purities because these elements are required for health. So, the desirable limits of water impurity depend on the purpose of water use.\nNormal uses of water:\nWater is used for different purposes. The normal uses of water are given in the below list:\n- Recreation and aesthetics\n- Public water supply\n- Fish, other aquatic life, and wildlife\nWater Quality Parameters and Standards:\nThere are various water quality parameters and standards that differ from country to country. A table is given below with parameters of water-quality characterization. The permissible limits, which have been prescribed by the United States Public Health Drinking Water Standards (USPH), Indian Standards Institution (ISI) and Bangladesh standards prescribed by DoE have been given for comparison. These refer to domestic water supplies for drinking water.\n|Parameters||USPH Standard||ISI Standard||DoE Standard|\n|Total dissolve solids||500||-|\n|Sulphide||0.1 micro per liter(ppb)||-|\n|Specific Conductance||300 micro ohom Cm-1||-|\n|DO (Dissolve Oxygen)||4.0-6.0(ppm)||3.0|\n|Policyclic aromatic||0.2 ppb|\n|hydrocarbons (PAH)||0.002 ppm|\n|Gross beta||1000 pc/L|\n|Coliform cells/100 ml||100|\n|Total bacteria count/100 ml||1* 10^6||<5000|\nSources of Water Pollution:\nThere are various sources of water pollution. Water pollution can result from natural runoff; dissolved chemicals in water that percolates through the soil and human sources such as agriculture, mining, construction, industry, homes, and businesses. It is useful to classify pollution sources as either point sources or non-point sources.\nPoint Sources of Water Pollution:\nPoint sources involve discharge of wastes from identifiable points.\nThese type of sources water pollution includes\n- Sewage treatment plants (which remove some but not all pollutants)\n- Storm water runoff from combined storm and sanitary sewer lines in urban areas;\n- Industrial plants and\n- Animal feedlots where large numbers (sometimes 10,000 or more) of animals are scientifically fed in tightly restricted quarters before slaughter.\nNon-point Sources of Water Pollution:\nNon-point sources involve the diffuse discharge of wastes from land runoff, atmospheric washout, and sources that are difficult to identify and control. They include:\n- Runoff of sediment from natural and human caused forest fires, construction, logging, and farming;\n- Runoff of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and saline irrigation water from croplands;\n- Urban storm water runoff;\n- Drainage of acids, minerals, and sediments from active and abandoned mines; and\n- Spills of oil and other hazardous materials. Non-point source pollution is not recognized as a major problem, since the sources are widely spread out, difficult to identify, and bard to control.\nCauses of Water Pollution:\nThe causes of water pollution are a lot. These causes are descrived with example below.\nWater Pollution by Agriculture:\nAgriculture has been a victim of water pollution in many instances, but sometimes it is also responsible for polluting water. Water pollution caused by agriculture is mainly an outcome of fertilizers and agricultural chemicals such as insecticides and herbicides. Agricaluture can pollute water by following ways.\nFertilizers given to crops are not always fully consumed by crops and a portion of it remains in the soil by being absorbed by soil colloid. Then the fertilizer influence the quality of underground, river and sea waters when it is dissolved. Chemical fertilizers mainly consists of relatively simple compounds of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium which are the nutritive elements of plants. Their runoff coefficients vary depending on the solubility of the fertilizer itself, the rate of absorption by plants, rate of absorption by the soil and rate of decomposition. It is generally believed that the runoff co-efficient of nitrogen is 5.30%, and that of phosphorus is 0.5-5%. Due to high runoff co-efficient tends of Nitrogen the eutrophication of lakes and enclosed sea areas is occured. Fertilizers as the sources of water pollution are called “nor -point sources”.The non-point sources are not only difficult to eliminate, but also hard to measure their quantity. Organic fertilizers such as compost, farmyard manure, human waste and fish meal produce nitrogen and phosphorus when they are decomposed and also become the sources of water pollution. These organic fertilizers do not contain any toxic substances in general.\nWater Pollution by Agricultural Chemicals:\nAgricultural chemicals are considered as a source of peculiar water pollution which cannot be ignored. Agricultural chemicals include a variety of chemicals such as insecticides, sterilizers and weed killers. These chemicals have played vital roles in the production process of modern agriculture, but they have also caused serious environmental pollution specially water pollution.\nThe characteristics of agricultural chemicals as sources of water pollution substances are includes:\n- Almost all of the agricaltural water polluting substances special compounds these don’t produce in nature by itself. The behaviors and final products are sometimes unknow when they are discharged into the natural environment.\n- Many of the agricaltural water polluting substances has negative influences on the human body because of their inherent characteristics.\n- When these chemicals consumed into the human body they tend to accumulate or concentrate in it\n- These chemicals are various kinds and new products are developed constantly in environment\n- Some of them are extremely stable that is called persistent polluting (POPs) agents as chemicals and remain in nature or in the human body for a long time thereby eventually afflicting the human body\n- It is common to all these chemicals to contain additives besides the main constituents and the additives can contribute to affect the environment though they do not have a strong toxicity\n- Some of these chemicals require a special method of analysis","The Grow Smart, Grow Safe® consumer guide to lawn and garden products is a project of Thurston County Environmental Health in Olympia, Washington. The information below comes directly from the Grow Smart, Grow Safe website.\nHow can we reduce the danger of pesticides?\nIncreasing the demand for safer products will encourage manufacturers to make products that are safer and more environmentally sound. You can have an attractive landscape without using hazardous pesticides. Use effective non-chemical methods and less-hazardous products instead.\nLearn about pesticide ratings, how to choose safer products, and ways to care for your lawn and garden naturally at growsmartgrowsafe.org.\nPesticides, human health and the environment\nPesticides include some of the most hazardous chemicals commonly used in and around the home. Products that kill insects, weeds, bacteria and fungi may be hazardous to children, pets, birds, fish, other wildlife, and also to beneficial insects like bees and lady bugs. Pesticides used in the yard or at the workplace can be carried inside on shoes and work clothes and mix with house dust. Young children, who crawl on the ground and put objects in their mouths, can then ingest the chemicals. Rain and irrigation wash pesticides off of yards and carry them to streams, sometimes in amounts that can harm salmon or the aquatic organisms that are their food.\nPesticides and children\nIn 2009, United States poison centers had over 90,000 incidents related to acute exposures to pesticides - about 45% involved children under the age of six. Children are vulnerable to repeated, very small, unintended exposure to pesticides. Per pound of body weight, pesticides have a greater effect on children’s growing bodies and developing nervous and hormonal systems and organs.\nDanger to pets\nMany pesticide products are toxic to dogs, cats and other pets. The risks can be similar to the human health risks. Pets with access to treated landscapes may pick up pesticide residues on their paws and fur, licking it or tracking it into the house. Slug bait containing metaldehyde poses a special risk because dogs are attracted to it and may eat enough to be seriously injured or even die.\nToxicity to birds and bees\nMost insecticides are toxic to beneficial insects, bees and other pollinators, and some insecticides are toxic to birds. Insecticides can kill bees directly when they eat or even just land on treated plants. Foraging bees can carry pesticides back to their hives, threatening the entire colony. Some researchers believe that pesticide use may be implicated in honey bee colony collapse disorder.\nMany insecticides and herbicides are toxic to fish, amphibians and other aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms come into contact with pesticides and fertilizers through irrigation or stormwater runoff from yards and other landscapes. Pesticide ingredients that don’t bind well to soil and are persistent in the environment pose the greatest risk to water pollution. Monitoring studies in the Puget Sound region have found common pesticides and fertilizer nutrients in many of our waterways.\nThe longer a pesticide remains in the environment, the more likely it is to do damage. Older products, like DDT, are still in the environment and in our bodies almost 40 years after their last uses were banned. Many modern pesticides breakdown faster, however most pesticides are not gone after a month or two, and may not be harmless just because the treated area has dried. Some pesticide residues may remain in soil, sediment or water from weeks to over a year or more, and sometimes they breakdown to chemicals that are toxic and persistent.\nHow do I know which products are safer?\nLearn how to read a pesticide label, which chemicals are lowest risk, how to handle and dispose of pesticides, and how to avoid the need for pesticides altogether at www.growsmartgrowsafe.org."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:33eb1fcb-cda6-48c5-bd51-6f16bc8d390f>","<urn:uuid:ecd62e19-7b14-4024-93f6-ba091430d7c5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the physical benefits of golf for seniors, and what summer safety precautions should they take while exercising outdoors?","answer":"Golf provides seniors with opportunities to maintain functional movement and exercise aerobically, with senior golfers rating at the 69th percentile for aerobic fitness in their age group. When exercising outdoors in summer, seniors should take several precautions: exercise early morning or late evening to avoid the hottest times (10 am to 4 pm), wear light-colored and loose-fitting cotton clothing, stay well-hydrated with water and electrolyte drinks, and use sunscreen and protective gear. They should also monitor the heat index and be aware that they may be more susceptible to heat-related illness due to medications and reduced ability to adjust to temperature changes.","context":["Senior golfers (>50 yrs of age) constitute more than 25% of the approximately 20 million Americans who are “committed” golfers (NGF, 2016). Golf is an excellent way to stay physically active and to participate in a “lifetime” sport. PURPOSE: The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate how senior golfers performed both functional and golf-specific fitness tests, and a 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) (aerobic fitness test). Possible changes in mood also were monitored before and after the 6-MWT to determine if walking influenced their total mood disturbance score (TMD). METHOD: Twelve female senior golfers (mean age of 62.9 ± 6.9 yrs) completed the Titleist Performance Institute® (TPI®) golf fitness screen and the 6-MWT. They also completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS) before and after the 6-MWT. The POMS subscales were combined as a Total Mood Disturbance score (TMD). Heart rates (HR) and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured during and after the 6-MWT. Paired t-tests and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for all dependent variables (pilot study: p ≤ 0.10). RESULTS: Physiological variables were TPI® Score, HR, RPE, and %HRmax. Following a series of golf-specific exercises, TPI® golf fitness screen mean scores were 17.5 ± 4.2. The three TPI® tests that these golfers scored lowest on were the deep squat, and the single leg balance tests with their eyes open and again with eyes closed. The remaining variables included the following means and standard deviations at 3 and 6 minutes: HR = 123 ± 16, 130 ± 20 (beats/min); RPE = 12.0 ± 2.0, 13.0 ± 1.0 (“somewhat hard”); %HRmax = 79 ± 12; 83 ± 15% (“vigorous”) (ACSM, 2014). The distance for the 6-MWT was used to measure aerobic endurance and a percentile rating was determined from their age group: 69.2 ± 18.8% (Rikli & Jones, 2013). After the 6-MWT, significant correlations were found for RPE and HR at 3 minutes (p = 0.025). However, RPE at 6 minutes was not correlated with any dependent variable. As hypothesized, %HRmax was correlated with HR at 3 and 6 minutes (p = 0.0001). No correlations were found between exercise intensity and the change in TMD. The TMD scores on the POMS before and after walking were not correlated with the 6-MWT distances (p’s = 0.698, 0.896). The mean TMD score was significantly lower after the 6-MWT, 98.4 ± 12.7, 89.3 ± 15.4 (p = 0.026). There were significant differences between RPE, HR, and %HRmax at 3 and 6 minutes (p ≤ .05). CONCLUSION: Senior women golfers were able to complete the golf fitness tests. Fitness characteristics were identified that could be improved with future golf-specific exercises. Senior women golfers were rated at the 69th percentile for aerobic fitness for their age group and had desirable decreases in TMD after the 6-MWT. Participating in golf provides senior women with an opportunity to maintain functional movement, to exercise aerobically, and to have desirable changes in total mood disturbance.\nLynn A.

Seniors have a higher risk of dehydration and heat stroke for several reasons, including:\n- They are more likely to have medical conditions that may change the way the body responds to heat.\n- They may take prescription medications that impair their body’s ability to perspire or regulate temperature.\n- They may take medications that make them more susceptible to the sun.\n- They don’t adjust as well as younger people to sudden temperature changes.\nDuring the summer months, it helps to take some safety precautions to avoid heat-related illnesses like heat stroke. Below are some helpful safety tips, an explanation of what heat stroke is and an overview of the important symptoms of heat stroke to look out for in the elderly.\nSummer Safety Tips\nWith a few summer safety tips for seniors and their caregivers, you can beat the heat and have fun in the sun this summer.\nTip #1 – Stay Well Hydrated\nAs you age, your body loses some of its ability to conserve water, which makes seniors more susceptible to dehydration. You may also be less aware that you’re thirsty as you age. When it’s warmer, it’s important to make sure you’re drinking enough water each day, especially when out in hot weather. If you’ll be out on a summer drive, pack some water to take along.\nIf you’ll be outdoors for an extended period of time, it’s a good idea to have some electrolyte replacement drinks that have potassium and salt in them, such as Gatorade or PowerAde. Consuming foods that have sodium and potassium can also be helpful when you’re trying to stay well hydrated.\nIt’s also a good idea to avoid drinking caffeinated beverages, drinks with a lot of sugar, and alcohol, since they can make your body lose even more water, increasing the risk of dehydration.\nTip #2 – Choose the Right Clothing\nDressing for warm weather can keep seniors from getting overheated as well. During the warmer months, natural fabrics like cotton are usually cooler than clothing made out of synthetic fibers. Light-colored, loose-fitting clothes can keep you feeling comfortable and cool. Choosing clothing that covers your skin from direct sun rays can also be helpful, protecting the skin from sunburn.\nTip #3 – Avoid the Mid-Day Sun and Heat\nThe hottest part of the day in the summer is usually between 10 am and 4 pm, so it’s best to avoid being outdoors in the midday sun and heat, particularly if you’re dealing with extreme heat or humidity. If you need to be outdoors to run errands or take care of other tasks, try doing so before 10 am or later in the evening when you’ll have cooler temperatures.\nIndependent living should be safe and comfortable. If you’re considering safety modifications to your home, such as ramp installation, bathroom accessibility solutions or stairlifts, HandyWorkx is here to help.\nTip #4 – Be Aware of the Heat Index\nDon’t just pay attention to the temperature outdoors, make sure you are aware of the heat index as well. The heat index factors in the temperature and the humidity to figure out how hot the weather feels. You can easily find the current heat index on weather websites, on radio weather reports, or on local television weather reports. The higher the heat index, the tougher time your body will have cooling itself, so avoid being outdoors when the heat index is high.\nTip #5 – Keep the Eyes Protected\nMany elderly individuals deal with vision loss and exposing your eyes to too much sun can cause more damage and irritate them. Wear sunglasses to keep your eyes protected from the harmful UV rays, which will help preserve your vision and reduce your risk of further eye damage.\nTip #6 – Use Hats and Sunscreen\nNo matter your age, it’s always important to make sure you’re putting on sunscreen. Seniors often have more sensitive skin, so you’ll need extra sun protection to avoid burns. In some cases, medications may make you more vulnerable to the sun’s rays, so check with your pharmacist to find out if you need to avoid sun exposure.\nHats can also protect you from the sun, especially if you have little hair or light-colored hair. A good hat can offer some extra protection for your eyes as well.\nTip #7 – Be Smart with Exercise\nIf you love doing a little outdoor gardening, walking outdoors, or engaging in other types of outdoor exercise, make sure you do it the smart way during the summer. Exercising later in the evening or early in the morning is a great idea. Wearing the right clothing, sunscreen, and any other needed protective gear can help as well. Avoid exercising outdoors for long periods and ensure you’re drinking more water than you normally would when you’re exercising outdoors in warm weather.\nYou may even want to move your exercise routine indoors. You can head to the mall to do some walking. Visit a local gym to do some light strength training or walk on a treadmill. Try water aerobics or swimming at an indoor pool to stay active. You don’t have to be outdoors in the heat to make sure you stay moving this summer.\nTip #8 – Don’t Forget the Bug Spray\nAlong with beating the heat, another concern that comes with the summer months is bug bites. Elderly individuals are more prone to get encephalitis and West Nile Virus, so if you live in areas where there are many mosquitoes or you are outdoors a lot, especially in the evening, make sure you’re applying mosquito repellent to reduce your risk of being bitten.\nWhat is Heat Stroke?\nHeat stroke is the most serious type of heat injury, and it’s considered to be a medical emergency. Heat stroke occurs when the body overheats, usually as a result of physical exertion or prolonged exposure to high temperatures. Heat stroke may occur when the body temperature reaches 104°F or even higher, and the condition most commonly occurs during hot, summer months.\nIt’s important for seniors and senior caregivers to understand that a heat stroke is very dangerous and requires emergency treatment. It has the ability to quickly damage muscles, kidneys, brain, and heart. The longer treatment is delayed, the worse the damage can be, increasing the risk of serious complications or even death.\nSigns and Symptoms of Heat Stroke\nSince heat stroke does require emergency treatment, it’s important for the elderly and their caregivers to be aware of the signs and symptoms of heat stroke. According to the Mayo Clinic, some of the signs and symptoms of heat stroke may include:\n- Rapid Heart Rate – The pulse may increase significantly because the heat is placing a huge burden on the heart to help cool the body down.\n- High Body Temperature – A body temperature that is 104°F or higher is the top sign of a heat stroke.\n- Altered Sweating – If you have a heat stroke brought on by exercising strenuously, skin may feel slightly moist or dry. Heat strokes brought on by very hot weather generally cause the skin to feel dry and hot to the touch.\n- Rapid Breathing – Breathing often becomes shallow and rapid.\n- Headaches – Heat stroke may cause extreme headaches that feel like a throbbing in the head.\n- Altered Behavior or Mental State – This may include irritability, confusion, seizures, delirium, slurred speech, agitation, or even coma.\n- Muscle Cramps or Weakness – You may feel very weak or your muscles may begin to cramp.\n- Vomiting and Nausea – You may feel very nauseated or you could begin vomiting.\nIf you think you or a person you care for is suffering from a heat stroke, get immediate medical attention. Call a local emergency services number or 911. While waiting for emergency treatment, remove any excess clothing and move the person indoors or into the shade. Cooling the person in any way possible, such as sponging with cool water, placing cold, wet towels on the groin, armpits, neck, and head, or spraying with cool water from a hose or shower, can help. Keep in mind, it’s not recommended to use ice on older individuals, since quick changes in body temperature are more dangerous for aging adults.\nIf you are aging in place or you’re a family member that is caring for an elderly individual, having the help of a caregiver during the summer months may be a great idea. Caregivers can help with summer outings, help seniors stay hydrated and keep safe in the hot weather, and be alert for the symptoms of heat-related illnesses."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:652359a2-8055-42b1-916d-36d9a134aca9>","<urn:uuid:0f0f591c-5378-4f77-8eaf-9a4774a5e07e>"],"error":null}

{"question":"How do oral contracts and prenuptial agreements compare in terms of their written documentation requirements under law?","answer":"Oral contracts and prenuptial agreements have distinctly different requirements regarding written documentation. Prenuptial agreements must absolutely be in writing to be legally binding - this is a basic requirement that cannot be waived. In contrast, oral contracts can be valid in many situations, though they carry more potential problems with proving terms and interpretation. However, both prenuptial agreements and certain types of oral contracts fall under legal requirements for written documentation - prenuptial agreements are specifically mentioned in the statute of frauds as requiring written form, similar to how certain oral contracts (such as those involving real property or agreements not contemplated to be completed within one year) must also be in writing to be enforceable.","context":["Question: I have heard that an oral contract is just as good as a written contract. Is that true?\nAnswer: Any contract is good as long as the parties agree and each abides by the agreement. Written contracts have a substantial advantage over oral agreements. The written document can be reviewed for terms of the agreement in event of dispute. The parties may differ as to interpretation, but a judge will be able to confirm meaning of the words.\nAn oral contract carries more potential problems. The parties may not actually agree at the beginning and each have a different understanding of what they have discussed. When dispute later arises, proving terms of their agreement can be difficult. There are usually no independent witnesses to oral contracts. Hence, proving terms is problematic. And, proving the existence of the agreement may be impossible.\nEven when parties agree, an oral contract may be unenforceable. The statute of frauds is statute that mandates certain contracts be in writing. In\nFlorida, the statute is found at Section 725.01 of Florida Statutes. The statute is a codification of the historic statute of frauds which we inherited from England. It's intent is to prevent fraud and enforcement of false claims by requiring certain types of contracts be in writing. If a contract within the statute of frauds is not in writing, the statute states that it is unenforceable.\nContracts which the statute mandates be in writing include the following:\n- Agreement to pay debts of a third party;\n- Any agreement made in consideration of marriage;\n- Contracts for sale of real property or an interest in real property;\n- Any lease for real property longer than one year;\n- Any agreement parties do not contemplate will be completed within one year from date of the contract; and\n- Any guarantee, warranty, or assurance of results of any medical, surgical or diagnostic procedure.\nOther statutes also require certain contracts be in writing. Those include premarital agreements, agreements to make a will and agreements concerning rights of a spouse in the estate of the other spouse. Contracts for the sale of goods for $500.00 or more are also to be in writing.\nAlthough the statute appears to be a complete bar to enforcement of certain oral contracts, its actual application is not so clear. For example, contracts that take more than one year to complete are not barred by the statute if the parties anticipated completion within one year. Merely showing possibility of completion within one year is not enough in Florida, although that would be sufficient in most states. Florida requires proof of intent of the parties. When the contract does not state a definite time for completion and it cannot be shown that performance within in one year is impossible, Florida courts have generally held the statute inapplicable.\nIn most cases, full performance by one party takes the contract outside of the statute. At least one court has held that although pre-nuptial agreements are required to be written, partial performance removes the agreement from the statute.\nWhen there is no real agreement, but one party accepts the benefits of performance by another, the performing party might be able to recover under the theory of quantum meruit. Under quantum meruit, a party must prove an implied agreement and benefit from the performing party to the other. At least one Florida court has ruled that where a party claims an express agreement existed, it contradicts a claim for quantum meruit and the statute bars the claim.\nEven a well written contract may be difficult to enforce. Words can be ambiguous and important terms omitted. Oral contracts are even more likely to be problematic. Evidence of terms is provided by claims of each party. The party seeking to enforce has the burden of proof, and in court cases a tie goes to the defendant. The statute of frauds poses yet additional obstacles.\nFor all of these reasons, it is important to retain an experienced attorney for contract drafting. It may even be more important after the fact, when problems arise to consult with an experienced attorney promptly.\nBy: William G. Morris, Esquire","Premarital or prenuptial agreements are contracts entered into before marriage which specify the division of assets and debts in the event of divorce or death. Parties can contract for the disposition of assets and debts, purchase or sale of property, disposition of property upon separation, dissolution, death, or any other event, modification or elimination of spousal maintenance, making of wills or trusts, choice of law, and any other matter not in violation of public policy.\nPremarital or prenuptial agreements are highly advised for people who enter marriage with assets that they may want to pass on to children from a prior marriage or which they wish to retain should the marriage end.\nPrenuptial agreements are written contracts that help couples define how individual and commonly-held assets are to be divided should the marriage dissolve either by death or dissolution. Prenuptial agreements can be complex and must follow certain legal guidelines in order to be valid, so it’s best to consult an attorney when creating one.\nBasic Requirements for a Prenuptial Agreement\nIn Indiana, your prenup must meet these basic guidelines:\nWritten. Prenuptial agreements must be written documents, signed by both parties, in order to be legally binding.\nVoluntary. The agreement must be voluntary, which means that both parties must be provided a reasonable amount of time to review the terms of the agreement and to have legal consultation about those terms, if they so choose.\nFull disclosure. Both parties must fully disclose all assets. If either of you does not disclose all your assets, the court can later find the agreement unconscionable. This finding usually negates any waivers either of you has agreed to and can result in additional expense and court time to sort it out – which might not work in either of your favors.\nConsultation. Both you and your intended marriage partner have the right to consultation with a separate, independent attorney. You should never assume that your future spouse’s attorney will properly represent your best interests. If there is a conflict of interests, it is any attorney’s job to favor the interests of their client.\nAlthough waiving your right to separate and individual legal consultation is generally acceptable, it is almost never advisable. If, however, either of you should decide you don’t want your own legal representation, the courts will review the waiver request in terms of that party’s business experience and their awareness of the impact of the waiver.\nWaiving your right to consult with your own lawyer, who can help you understand the details of a prenuptial agreement and how they pertain to Indiana law, can result in future issues for you. You should never sign a legal agreement without first consulting your lawyer.\nCollaborative Approaches to Creating a Prenuptial Agreement\nMediation and collaborative law offer approaches to prenuptial agreements that can afford you and your spouse an opportunity to create a more balanced, mutually beneficial agreement. Because you both participate and have ownership in creating the document, with the guidance of a professional, the resulting agreement is less likely to cause friction and animosity between you and your future spouse if it is ever needed.\nPostnuptial agreements are increasing in popularity. They are very similar to prenuptial agreements, with the obvious exception that they are created after the couple is married.\nWhile some people might feel that a postnuptial agreement signals the end of the marriage (or suspicious behavior on the part of one spouse or the other), there are many reasons for which a couple might want to create one – and not all of them are necessarily negative. In fact, these agreements can define the rights of each spouse in many different circumstances.\nFor instance, postnuptial agreements can help both spouses get a very clear view of their finances and assets through the disclosure process. In other cases, the creation of a new business or income stream or the adding of partners to an existing business can prompt the necessity of you and your spouse legally defining the rights and interests associated with the new circumstances.\nBasic Requirements for a Postnuptial Agreement\nPostnuptial agreements in Indiana have the same requirements as prenuptial agreements: They must be in writing, voluntary, and provide full financial disclosure of both parties in order to be valid. Both you and your spouse have a right to legal consultation to ensure that your rights and interests are represented in the document before you both sign it. (See prenuptial agreements, above.)\nAs with any legal contract, postnuptial agreements should be reviewed by each party’s lawyer. You should never assume that your spouse’s attorney will properly represent your best interests. If there is a conflict of interests, it is any attorney’s job to favor the interests of their client.\nIf you are seeking legal advice about pre or post nuptial agreements, please call us at 317-708-9410 to schedule a confidential consultation, or email us at firstname.lastname@example.org"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a7a31e6d-16f6-4f07-8f1f-3832aa31b928>","<urn:uuid:e8f88392-ad1c-4517-9653-493724e4a146>"],"error":null}

Savannah’s rich Jazz history has yet to be told, and is as old and significant as that of New Orleans. Members of the community and those with connections regionally and nationally are being urged to support the project through the donation or loan of artifacts including instruments by noted Savannah jazz musicians past and present, photos, posters, and other memorabilia that will help tell the story of Savannah’s role in the development of jazz music beginning in the early 20th century to the present. Financial donations, grants, and sponsorships are also being pursued to fund the exhibit.\n“Now is the time for our friends and lovers of history and music to step forward by supporting the Savannah Jazz History Exhibit and enabling us to share this story with visitors and residents,” said Tom Glaser, a co-founder and first president of CJA who is chairing the initiative.

Deeply rooted in African traditions, Savannah jazz has evolved through brass bands, vaudeville, blues, big band, combos, and orchestras to take its place in our nation’s jazz pantheon. Following its near demise in 1960 resulting from the ascendency of rhythm ‘n blues and rock ‘n roll, Savannah jazz was reborn in the late 1970s by the Coastal Jazz Association, and today, is one of the area’s most respected art forms enjoyed by visitors and residents, black and white, young and old, alike.\nThe exhibit will be housed in the Savannah History Museum, operated by the Coastal Heritage Society, behind the Visitor Center in downtown Savannah. Utilizing a combination of artifacts, displays, and interactive multimedia, it will illustrate Savannah’s storied jazz history from its inception to today. A key component is the Coastal Jazz Association’s Savannah Jazz Hall of Fame, now totaling 45 inductees who represent a who’s who in the jazz world. The biographies, visuals about their lives, music, and contributions to jazz will clearly establish Savannah’s place as a major center for the art form. From Joe “King” Oliver, Louis Armstrong’s mentor—to Johnny Mercer, Savannah’s famed composer and vocalist—to acclaimed bassist and composer Ben Tucker, who led the jazz revival from the 70s—the Jazz Hall of Fame will draw visitors into the main exhibit and give them an understanding of the legends of Savannah jazz.\nThe evolution of jazz in Savannah, from its earliest incarnations to the present, will be the main focus of the exhibit. Visuals of old West Broad Street (now MLK Blvd.) venues will include theaters and clubs that were meccas in the African-American musical tradition. Images and stories of Tybrisa Pavilion, the legendary dance hall on Tybee Island that hosted the top big bands of the day, black and white, will also be featured as well as highlights from the acclaimed Savannah Jazz Festivals from 1983 to the present. Artifacts on display will include Ben Tucker’s historic bass violin, Jabbo Smith’s trumpet mouthpiece, Johnny Mercer’s straw hat and other memorabilia, artifacts from the estate of James Moody including a Moody horn, a Benedetto Guitar jazz guitar display all handcrafted at its Savannah headquarters, mouthpieces from Savannah’s Jody Jazz company, a Gretsch drum kit, photos and posters from CJA’s acclaimed concerts and festivals, and news articles, recordings, and videos of the legends who performed in Savannah. Donations are being accepted online at www.coastaljazz.org/donate.","The Mercer Family Collection\nJohnny Mercer was born in 1909 into a long-established Savannah (GA.) family. Mercer’s lyrics and writings recall his fond memories of a childhood and youth in Savannah and especially the family’s summerhouse in Vernon View. After prep school in Virginia, Johnny struck out for Broadway and New York’s tin pan alley and a show business career. During the 1920’s and 1930’s, Mercer sang and toured with the big bands. During this period, Mercer was lured to Hollywood where he had great success songwriting for motion pictures. Mercer became one of the most prolific and best-known lyricists of American popular song. Many have since become standards: Hooray for Hollywood, That Old Black Magic, And the Angels Sing, Moon River, Autumn Leaves, Satin Doll and Summer Wind are just a few examples of his lyrics. While Mercer sometimes wrote music, he usually worked with composers, including Hoagy Carmichael, Harold Arlen and Henri Mancini. In 1942 Mercer started Capitol Records with partners Buddy DeSlyva and Glenn Wallichs in order to provide a recording outlet for the singers, musicians and songwriters working in Southern California’s movie industry. After an active, productive career, Johnny Mercer died in Los Angeles California in 1976.\nNancy Mercer Keith Gerard, Johnny Mercer's niece donated the Mercer Family Collection to Lane Library's Special Collections in 2006. Nancy grew up in her Maternal Grandmother’s (Johnny’s mother, Lillian Cieucevich Mercer’s) home in Savannah. Pearce W. Hammond, Amanda Mercer (Johnny’s daughter) and other members of Savannah’s Friends of Johnny Mercer organization have also donated material to the Collection.\nThe Collection consists of photographs, letters and memorabilia from the Mercer Family and documenting Johnny Mercer’s life and the Mercer family in Savannah. Material in the Collection is listed in this Inventory, letters from Mercer and family photographs are described at the item level.\nAt the heart of the collection is a small set of letters home written by Johnny to his parents, George Anderson Mercer and Lillian Cieucevich Mercer. Collected by Johnny’s mother Lillian, the letters begin in the early 1930's when Johnny wrote home from New York as a struggling actor/lyrist. Letters dating from the 1940's and 1950’s reveal Johnny at the height of his career in Southern California. The letters reveal a humble, affectionate son and his thoughts of Savannah. The letters have been used in Gene Lees' published biography of Mercer, Portrait of Johnny. Some of the letters from the Collection are available digitally from the Friends of Johnny Mercer website.\nFun for study and display there are Capitol Records’ promotional items, including pajamas decorated with the record company’s hit song titles. The Collection also includes record albums and sheet music that recall popular music and the music industry from the 1920's through the 1970's.\nA selection of the family photographs from the Collection have been digitized and are available from the Special Collections’ Flickr site.\nSeveral members of the Friends of Johnny Mercer aided in establishing the Collection. Diane Thurman helped Nancy Gerard and special collections librarian Caroline Hopkinson sort and identify the many family photos in the Collection. David Oppenheim donated correspondence of Sadie Vimmerstedt to the Collection and shared copies from his files and media collection about Johnny Mercer.\nMercer descendent Pearce W. Hammond donated to the collection, including the transcription of his great-great grandfather, George A. Mercer’s civil war era diary. The original diary is in the Southern Historical Collection at UNC-Chapel Hill.\nMercer’s daughter Amanda donated two paintings by Mercer to the Collection.\nThe Mercer Family Collection is open to the public.

Original recording housed in the Lane Library’s Special Collections.\nThe Mercer storytelling project arose from a partnership between the Friends of Johnny Mercer organization and Armstrong Atlantic State University. Nancy Gerard recruited volunteers among friends and family to meet Armstrong students in Barbara Fertig (professor of History) course on Folklore. The students then did a course project based on the storytelling sessions. The interviews are not part of a formal oral history project, but record stories about Johnny Mercer and life in Savannah during the 1920’s-1960’s. Those interviewed, all life long residents of the area, recount stories of Johnny Mercer, the Mercer family and life in Savannah during the period. The sessions were conducted in the Florence Powell Minis Room of Lane Library’s Special Collections and videotaped by Armstrong’s CIS department.\nThe Johnny Mercer Educational Archives Maintained by Steve Taksler, this site is dedicated to the legacy of Johnny Mercer.\nInformation on the year-long celebration of Johnny Mercer's birth in 2009, is available at the Centennial Committee's website.\nJohnny Mercer Collections at Georgia State University This features a large archival collection of Mercer’s own records, and oral histories collected by the repository.

{"question":"How many players are required for the Go! Power Team! game?","answer":"Go! Power Team! requires five players in total - four players who act as Rangers wearing power-belts (modified Android tablets), and one player selected from the crowd who acts as the defender of the galaxy.","context":["Go! Power Team!\nThe first game to be demoed was Go! Power Team! which I first ran at the JOIN Local Multiplayer festival in Berlin last year. For the uninitiated, four players take the role of \"Rangers,\" each of them wearing a dedicated power-belt (a modified Android tablet connected to the main computer over WiFi). One player is selected from the crowd to the the \"defender of the galaxy,\" tasked with fighting off monsters by pressing the coloured power-belts in the right order.\nEvery time a new monster appears the rangers are given a new command by the computer, which will tell them to lie on the floor, form a conga line, or hi-five the audience, among other things.\nThe idea is that the rangers are not on the side of the player, nor working against them, but acting of their own accord. Typically the rangers themselves will focus on performing, to make the audience laugh or to one-up each other with their outrageous interpretations of the commands. This is one of the benefits of keeping the rules of a game loosely-defined!\nMeanwhile the player, having to deal with a set of buttons moving around on their own accord, is constantly darting back and forth. In many ways the role of the player is to be focal point of the spectacle, giving the audience someone to root for and a set of shoes they can see themselves in. The player also provides context for the comedy - the antics of the rangers are funny because they create an \"unintentional\" nuisance for the player.\nCodex BashThe next game on show was Codex Bash, which I've been taking to quite a few events over the past year! This was, however, the first time I've run it as a performance instead of an exhibit. Codex Bash uses four custom-made buttons, and players must solve on-screen clues to find the sequence of buttons they need to input with the buttons. Some of the puzzles involve props such as photographs, circuit diagrams and floppy disks.\nFour volunteers from the audience were the team, and all the props were shared among the group. This meant that members of the audience had an opportunity to pitch in to solve the puzzles, and the team had to interact with the audience to get the bits they needed.\nI feel like there's a big opportunity here to turn Codex Bash into something really special on the stage, by using the props, and the fact that the audience becomes part of the challenge. I'm working on new prop-based challenges that encourage the audience to work together to provide the clues the team needs. I want everyone in the room to have a part to play in cracking the codes.\nCustom Sonic ButtonsThe final game of the evening was Sega Megadrive classic Sonic the Hedgehog 2, but with a twist! Using the same buttons as Codex Bash, but with a different program loaded into the hardware, it becomes a game controller.\nEach of the four buttons is mapped to either left, right, down or jump, but the players do not know which button does which action. However, every 30 seconds the role of each button changes - the only way to find out what your button does is by playing!\nI love the way that the custom hardware turns the game into a challenge of communication, as players must coordinate not just to overcome obstacles but to find out what their role is in the first place. Level arrangements that should trivial become challenging when team members must time their actions in sequence. There's a certain comedy to watching Sonic lazily strolling into a spike pit as his team desperately tries to find the button to stop!\nThere's a whole blog post waiting to be written about the myriad ways Sonic 2 is particularly good for creating both spectacle and interesting gameplay when used in this situation. A particular highlight was the moment when Dr Robotnik first appeared, met with a genuine shriek from the entire audience. Back in 1992 that is surely the emotion the game's first boss was meant to elicit!\nTaking games to the stageBetween designing games to be played publicly, to adapting existing works for the stage, I feel there's a great benefit to creating opportunities for the unexpected to happen. When I was working on Tap Happy Sabotage that was certainly core to my design methods, and it's something I try to work into all my projects:\n- create situations where players will surprise you\n- find the most exciting parts of those surprise moments\n- tweak the game to make these come up more often or be more meaningful\nTaking existing games into the theatre asks the designer to redesign the work on the spot - for example, by handing the props from Codex Bash out into the audience. Doing this inspires new directions to take our projects. We can make games where the players are asked to respond creatively to a stimulus (like the ranger commands in Go! Power Team!), or must respond on the spot to an unexpected situation (like coordinating a team while using the Sonic 2 buttons). In front of an audience these become opportunities for comedy and a chance for collective action, as the audience puts themselves in the player's shoes.\nMany thanks to the Bristol Improv Theatre for hosting the event. I'm pleased to be among the pantheon of performers to be photographed with Bish, the BIT mascot! The theatre is currently running a fundraiser to build the UK's first full-time improv theatre, so please do take a look at the excellent work they're doing and maybe throw some money their way!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ac63c457-e754-450e-9649-11cb222630c2>"],"error":null}

{"question":"I am planning business acquisition and want to explore seller financing. Please tell me what is seller financing and what are requirements?","answer":"Seller financing is when the business owner who is selling their business agrees to finance part or all of the purchase price themselves. Typically, sellers finance between 15% to 60% of the purchase price. This type of financing can be particularly beneficial for buyers with subprime credit as it often comes with better interest rates than traditional loans. Some business owners use seller financing to meet SBA loan requirements or other down payment requirements, though this may require the seller to put up collateral during the loan term. It's important to note that you should consult a financial expert during this process to understand all risks involved and potential liability in case of loan default.","context":["Conventional, SBA, and online lenders typically instruct small business owners to submit financial documents for the existing company, including cash flow, operating expenses, and physical assets. You should work with the current owner to get business valuation details and financial statements.\nThe cash flow of your existing business acts as a snapshot of its financial health and an indication of whether your existing business can support the debt and the uncertainty of a business acquisition.\nWhen looking at your cash flow, a lender offering a business purchase loan will want to see that you have enough liquid cash to make a significant down payment and still have enough cash on hand to make your loan payments each month.\nIn addition to your business financials and plan, the lender will consider how your work experience as a business owner will contribute to the future of the business post-acquisition. If you have relatively little experience in the industry of your desired business, that could be seen as a red flag to the lender.\nCompared to other types of online loans, medium-term loans typically have terms of 12 months or longer, with loan amounts up to $1 million. Although the interest rates with these loans will likely be higher than with a bank or SBA loan, you can still find relatively low rates, especially if you have strong qualifications.\nBefore you begin the process of applying for a business acquisition loan, there are multiple considerations you should think about. You should ask yourself the following questions and know the answers:\nOutside of using SBA Lender Match, there are numerous private lenders you can apply directly to that can provide financing. These lenders can walk you through applying for various types of business loans, including traditional term loans, microloans and lines of credit.\nAs you continue to plan out the purchase of an existing enterprise, it may be best to sit down with financial and business advisors who can fully walk you through the process of taking out a loan and acquiring a company. Places you can seek out this advice include:\nBecause your lender will need to get approval from the SBA to back your loan, the application process and paperwork for an SBA 7(a) loan can be lengthy. However, these loans typically boast better terms than traditional small business loans, and sometimes even come with counseling to ensure your business runs efficiently.\nOne distinction: if you are a sole proprietor, you will not need to provide a separate personal guarantee for your SBA loan because you execute the note yourself as a borrower (instead of as a business).\nThis website is owned by a private company that offers business advice, information and other services related to multifamily, commercial real estate, and business financing.

If you need to visit the SBA directly please click here: sba.gov\nFor individuals looking to acquire an existing business, a loan is usually necessary to obtain the required capital. Not only can the loan be used to purchase the business, but it can also give a borrower the cash flow necessary to ensure a successful start to the business. Typically, a down payment of at least 10% will be needed. Interest rates start at 5% and go up from there, with a term of between three and 25 years.\nNo matter which type of financing a business owner goes with, there will be specific documentation required. Not only will the lender require this documentation, but it is also likely that the company being acquired will want to verify this information to make sure the potential buyer has the assets to complete the business purchase.\nOnce the documentation has been gathered, the potential buyer must reach out to the business to express interest in purchasing the company. At this point, a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) will likely be required so basic information about the business can be shared between the two parties. Next, the potential buyer should review this information and research any additional information. This process should take around a week.\nResearching the valuation of the business through valuation calculators will allow the potential buyer to begin planning for the upcoming loan request. In addition, it will allow the buyer to determine the amount of financing needed and what kind of down payment may be required.\nThe top choice among business acquisition loans is an SBA loan. SBA loans have the most competitive interest rates and the longest repayment terms. However, qualification can be difficult, and the process can take between 45 and 90 days.\nA ROBS allows a business owner to invest funds from a personal retirement account into a new business without paying early withdrawal penalties or income taxes. It is not a business loan or a 401(k) loan, which means there is no interest or debt to repay.\nThe funds can be available from a ROBS provider in two to three weeks, which is faster than an SBA loan. Because buying a business can be a time-sensitive process, acquiring funding in a shorter amount of time can increase the probability that the acquisition will be successful.\nFor more information on ROBS financing, check out our article on the best rollover for business startup financing providers. In addition, we recommend Guidant Financial to assist with the proper setup and execution of a ROBS account.\nSeller financing occurs when the business owner selling their business to a potential buyer agrees to finance part or all of the purchase price. With seller financing, the seller typically finances 15% to 60% of the purchase price. This allows potential buyers with subprime credit to get better interest rates for financing the purchase of the new business.\nSome business owners will use seller financing to satisfy requirements for an SBA loan or other down payment requirements. This may require the seller to put up collateral during the term of the loan. A financial expert should be consulted throughout the process to make sure all parties are aware of the risks involved and the potential liability in the event of loan default.\nOnce the financing has been preapproved, the potential buyer will sign a nonbinding letter of intent (LOI) showing the expected purchase offer. Upon accepting the offer, the seller will want to know how the buyer intends to purchase the business. The preapproval letter will show that the buyer is qualified for financing. At this point, initial negotiations regarding sale price and terms will take place. This process should take one to two weeks.\nPotential business buyers have many options available for funding a purchase. Be sure to consult a financial advisor and a legal expert to find the best options and ensure the business is correctly set up to be purchased. SBA loans are the best way to receive funding, but it is essential to know what is required before applying. ROBS financing is also another good option.\nThe Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) ended on May 31, 2021. It offered loans to help small businesses and non-profits keep their workers employed.

When does this happen in your life? What does it feel like? What are some causes? When does it show up? How does it affect us? What are the results of this? Lets YAC about it!\nDefined by the Mayo Clinic:\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that's triggered by a terrifying event — either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event.\nSo.. What Does This Mean?\nGreat question. PTSD comes in all different shapes and sizes and can affect people from all walks of life at all ages. Yes, even children can experience PTSD and often they exhibit different symptoms so it's important to read on and recognize what those are. PTSD is your brain's long-term response to an event or situation that was distressing, disturbing, life-changing or catastrophic. It doesn't always pertain to soldiers or people involved in a war, nor does it always have to do with physical or sexual violence. Trauma can happen to anyone, but what makes PTSD different is that after at least a month or maybe even longer, normal trauma symptoms would subside whereas someone with PTSD continues to experience symptoms that impact their daily lives.\nWhat Causes Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder?\nWhat makes this mental illness a little different than many others is that it's generally caused by an event, whether you personally experience it, witness it or were involved in some other capacity. However, there are other environmental and inherited factors such as having a family history of anxiety and depression, the way your body responds to stress, and your general temperament that can impact whether you experience or are diagnosed with PTSD.\nWhat Are The Symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder?\nSymptoms for PTSD are broken down into four main categories and in order to be diagnosed with this disorder, according to the DSM-5, you must experience a specific amount of each for at least one month; one intrusive symptom, one avoidance symptom, two arousal symptoms, and two changes in mood and thinking. There are other physical symptoms that have been recorded however they don't pertain to the diagnoses in the DSM-5.\n- reliving the event through flashbacks\n- distressing dreams or nightmares about the event\n- recurring memories that won't leave your mind no matter how hard you try\n- avoiding people, places, activities, objects, and situations that bring on distressing memories\n- avoid remembering or thinking about the traumatic event\n- resist talking about what happened or how they feel about it\nChanges in Emotional Reaction (also called Arousal Symptoms)\n- easily startled or frightened, having a guard up, feeling jumpy\n- self-destructive behavior\n- troubles sleeping or concentrating\n- angry outbursts or aggressive behavior\n- negative reactions when talking about a traumatic event\n- feeling guilty or shameful\nChanges in Mood + Thinking\n- negative thoughts about yourself, other people or the world\n- hopelessness especially about the future\n- lack of memory, especially in relation to the traumatic event\n- hard time maintaining relationships\n- detached from family or friends or activities you used to enjoy\n- feeling dissociated or emotional numb\n- sweating, shaking, headaches, dizziness, stomach problems, aches and pains, and chest pain\n- weakened immune system meaning more susceptible to infection\n- tiredness and fatigue\nSymptoms for Children\n- extreme separation anxiety - usually from parents.\n- reenactment of traumatic events\n- phobias unrelated to the event i.e. being scared of monsters\n- regression in skills such as potty training\n- problems sleeping or nightmares, not necessarily related to the event\n- irritability and aggression\n- aches and pains\nHow Is It Treated?\nA combination of medication and psychotherapy or talk therapy is proven to be most beneficial when dealing with PTSD. Let's start with the different types of therapy; Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) can help to retrain your brain by recognizing the ways and patterns in which your brain is negatively thinking about the incident and how it's affecting you. Exposure Therapy, which is pretty much exactly how it sounds, by facing painful situations or memories to learn how to cope or understand how they're affecting you. Another kind of therapy is getting a lot of attention lately and that's Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), it combines exposure therapy with guided eye movements to help you process and change how you react to traumatic memories. Since other mental illnesses can tag along with PTSD like anxiety and depression, often medication is offered along with talk therapy to mitigate some of those symptoms. Anti Depression and Anti Anxiety medication may be recommended or discussed with your doctor. There are also many other natural and herbal treatments that are proven to be helpful for coping with PTSD, we always advise talking to a doctor before introducing any sort of treatment.\nLet's YAC About It!\nIt's time to break down the barriers and end the stigma surrounding mental health. If you live with mental illness or just want to chat, our comments and inboxes are always open. We strongly believe in the value of sharing our experiences + stories in hopes even one person knows they're not alone. This blog is an introduction to a two-part series, the second part will introduce all sorts of resources and ways to find the help you need.

{"question":"How did James Longstreet's relationship with Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Braxton Bragg differ during the Civil War?","answer":"Longstreet had contrasting relationships with Lee and Bragg. With Lee, despite tactical disagreements, there was mutual respect - Lee affectionately called Longstreet his 'Old War Horse.' Even when Longstreet opposed Lee's tactical decisions at Gettysburg, Lee never blamed him for the defeat. In contrast, Longstreet's relationship with Bragg was marked by bitter conflict. When serving under Bragg in the Army of Tennessee, Longstreet became leader of a group that tried to have Bragg removed from command. Their relationship deteriorated to the point where Bragg sent Longstreet on a disastrous campaign to Knoxville, with their disagreements being driven more by bitter disdain than military strategy.","context":["November 10, 1863 (Tuesday)\nGeneral Grant feared that James Longstreet’s Corps, sent forth from Chattanooga to attack Ambrose Burnside’s Federals at Knoxville, would arrive before he was able to stop it or even draw it back. But on the morning of this date, some of Longstreet’s Corps was still waiting at Tyner’s Station, no more than fifteen miles outside of Chattanooga. They had been there since November 4th.\nThe move was to be one of quick secrecy, but word had already leaked out, and Longstreet was making horrible time. “My recollections of the place,” wrote Porter Alexander, Longstreet’s artillery chief, “are only those of the struggled we had to get enough to eat, for no preparations had been made for any such delay.”\nMost of Longstreet’s Corps had already moved, arriving by train at Sweetwater, sixty miles northeast, as early as the 6th. Some units were forced to march to Cleveland, about thirty miles down the line from Chattanooga, and weren’t picked up by the trains until the 8th and 9th.\nStill at Tyner Station, Alexander and his artillery were finally entrained in the early afternoon. They loaded the guns, caissons, themselves and their baggage on flat cars, sending the horses by land. The whole ordeal was a chore indeed, but by 3pm, they were on their way, but the sorry state of the railroads soon became evident.\n“Before we had gone very far the engine got out of wood,” recalled Alexander. “We stopped and cut up fence rails enough to go on, and we had this to do several times. As night came on it was quite cool, riding out on the flat cars, but we wrapped up in blankets and laid in under and among the guns, and managed to sleep with some comfort, arriving at Sweetwater about midnight and disembarking in the morning.”\nThe area around Sweetwater had felt little of the ravages of war. Thus, the larders were full, and in many cases, ripe for the picking. Longstreet’s men had been on short rations, but promised that the land to which they were headed was one of milk and honey (or at least vegetables). Even Longstreet, who in his memoirs had very little nice to say about anything, concurred.\nHe and Army of Tennessee commander, Braxton Bragg, had not seen eye to eye since his arrival just before the battle of Chickamauga. By the time Bragg sent Longstreet away, the reasons for the move were clouded more in bitter disdain\nthan military strategy. Both generals waged a war of letters that reverberated long after the smoke of war had settled.\n“Thus we found ourselves in a strange country,” wrote Longstreet after the war, “not as much as a day’s rations on hand, with hardly enough land transportation for ordinary camp equipage, the enemy in front to be captured, and our friends in the rear putting in their paper bullets.”\nWith most of his corps at Sweetwater, Longstreet turned to his next challenge – that of getting at Burnside in Knoxville. From the depot at Sweetwater, they were still nearly fifty miles away. The troops would still have to march to Louden, where Longstreet planned to establish his base of operations.\nOriginally, the plan had been to his Knoxville from the south. “Anticipating proper land transportation,” Longstreet continued, “plans were laid for march across the Little Tennessee above its confluence with the greater river, through Marysville to the heights above Knoxville on the east bank, by forced march. This would have brought the city close under fire of our field batteries and forced the enemy into open grounds.”\nBut the plan was much more sound than Longstreet’s anticipation of proper transportation. For the construction of a bridge, he was given pontoon, but not the wagons to carry them. Over the next couple of days, Porter Alexander would poke around the countryside, map in hand, searching for some way to cross the Tennessee River.\nFor Burnside, the waiting was tiresome. Rumors were filtering in that Longstreet was already up, but he rightly discounted them. Longstreet’s troops, however, we’re the only ones in the area. A division under Frank Cheatham had been sent a week or so prior to Longstreet, but would be returning to Chattanooga soon enough. Another division, commanded by Carter Stevenson, had been there a few weeks longer. All told, before Longstreet’s arrival, the Confederates had 11,000 troops before Knoxville. Longstreet had already argued to keep Stevenson, but Bragg denied it. The battle between the two would lumber on, inhibiting both, for weeks.1\n- Sources: Fighting for the Confederacy by E.

[↩]","James Longstreet (1821-1904)\nJames Longstreet (January 8, 1821 - January 2, 1904) was one of the foremost generals of the American Civil War, and later enjoyed a successful post-war career working for the government of his former enemies, as a diplomat and administrator.\nLongstreet was born in Edgefield District, South Carolina, the son of a farmer, but grew up in Augusta, Georgia, until age 12 when his father died and the family moved to Somerville, Alabama. He was appointed to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point by the state of Alabama in 1838 and graduated in 1842. He served with distinction in the Mexican War, was wounded at Chapultepec, and received two brevets and the staff rank of major. He resigned from the U.S. Army on June 1, 1861 to cast his lot with the Confederacy in the Civil War.\nCareer as Confederate General\nLongstreet was already highly regarded as an officer, and he was almost immediately appointed as a brigadier general in the Confederate Army. His assignments included: brigadier general, CSA June 17, 1861); commanding brigade (in 1st Corps after July 20), Army of the Potomac July 2 - October 7, 186 1); major general, CSA (October 7, 1861); commanding division, Ist Corps, Army of the Potomac (October 14-22, 1861); commanding division (in Potomac District until March 1862), Department of Northern Virginia (October 22, 1861 - July 1862); commanding lst Corps, Army of Northern Virginia July 1862 - February 25, 1863; May - September 9, 1863; April 12 - May 6, 1864; and October 19, 1864-April 9, 1865); lieutenant general, CSA (October 9, 1862); commanding Department of Virginia and North Carolina (February 25-May 1863); commanding his corps, Army of Tennessee (September 19-November 5, 1863); and commanding Department of East Tennessee (November 5, 1863-April 12, 1864).\nCommanding a brigade, he fought well at the First Battle of Bull Run, and earned a promotion to major general.\nDuring the Peninsula Campaign in the spring and summer of 1862 he saw further action at Yorktown, Williamsburg, Seven Pines, and the Seven Days. In the final days of the latter he also directed A.P. Hill's men. Longstreet's career took off when Gen. Robert E. Lee took command of the Army of Northern Virginia. During the Seven Days Battles, Longstreet had operational command of nearly half the Lee's army.\nAs a general, Longstreet showed a talent for defensive fighting, preferring to position his troops in strong defensive positions and compel the enemy to attack him. Once the enemy had worn itself down, then and only then would Longstreet contemplate an attack of his own. In fact, troops under his command never lost a defensive position during the war. Lee referred to Longstreet affectionately as his Old War Horse. (Longstreet's friends generally called him Pete.) His record as an offensive tactician was mixed, however, and he often clashed with the highly aggressive Lee on the subject of the proper tactics to employ in battle.\nIronically, one of his finest hours came in August 1862, when he commanded what had become known as the First Corps at the Second Battle of Bull Run. Here, he and his counterpart in command of the Second Corps, Lieut. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson, switched their normal roles, with Jackson fighting defensively on the Confederate left, and Longstreet delivering a devastating flank attack on the right that crushed the slightly larger Union Army of Virginia.\nThe next month, at the Battle of Antietam, Longstreet held his part of the Confederate line against Union forces twice as numerous. On October 9, a few weeks after Antietam, Longstreet was promoted to lieutenant general, the senior Confederate officer of that rank.\nHe only enhanced his reputation that December, when his First Corps played the decisive role in the Battle of Fredericksburg. There, Longstreet positioned his men behind a stone wall and held off fourteen assaults by Union forces. About 10,000 Union soldiers fell; Longstreet's men lost but 500.\nIn the winter and early spring of 1863, Longstreet bottled up Union forces in the city of Suffolk, Virginia, a minor operation but one that was very important to Lee's army, still stationed in devastated central Virginia. By conducting a siege of Suffolk, Longstreet enabled Confederate authorities to collect huge amounts of foodfood that had been under Union controland send it to feed Lee's hungry soldiers. However, this operation caused Longstreet and 15,000 men of the First Corps to be absent from the Battle of Chancellorsville in May.\nLongstreet rejoined Lee's army after Chancellorsville and took part in Lee's Gettysburg campaign, where he clashed with Lee about the tactics Lee was using. Longstreet, who had come to believe in the strategic offense and the tactical defense, was proven right when the Confederate attacks on the second and third days were repulsed. This campaign marked a fundamental change in the way Longstreet was employed by Lee. In the past, Lee had preferred to use Longstreet in defensive roles, which were his strength, and use Jackson and the Second Corps to spearhead his attacks. But Jackson had been killed at Chancellorsville, and now Lee wanted Longstreethis best remaining lieutenantto fill that role.\nLongstreet was willing and capable of doing so, but he argued with Lee a number of times during the battle of Gettysburg, essentially telling Lee that his tactics were going to lead to defeat. Longstreet advocated disengagement from the enemy after the first day's battle, embarking on a strategic flanking movement to place themselves on the Union line of communication, and inviting a Union attack. He argued that Lee had agreed before the campaign that this \"strategic offensive, tactical defensive\" would be the proper course. But Lee had settled on the tactical offensive. On July 2, the second day of the battle, Longstreet's assault on the Union left nearly succeeded, but on July 3, when Lee ordered Longstreet, against his wishes, to attack the Union center in what became known as \"Pickett's Charge\", the Confederates lost 7,000 men in an hour. Longstreet was right, and Lee was wrong and immediately admitted as much, but to many of Lee's admirers, such as Jubal Early and the Lost Cause advocates after the war, the lost battle was Longstreet's fault.\nLee never blamed anyone but himself for the defeat, and in fact dispatched Longstreet to Georgia that fall in response to a desperate appeal for help from the Confederate Army of Tennessee. That resulted in Longstreet and 14,000 of his First Corps veterans taking part in the Battle of Chickamauga that September. Longstreet led an attack of his men and some of the Army of Tennessee men that routed the Union Army of the Cumberland and won the greatest Confederate victory ever in the western theatre.\nLongstreet soon clashed with the much maligned Army of Tennessee commander, Gen. Braxton Bragg, when Bragg failed to capitalize on the victory by finishing off the Union army and recapturing the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Longstreet became leader of a group of senior commanders of the army who conspired to have Bragg removed. The situation became so grave that Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy, was forced to intercede in person. What followed was one of the most bizarre scenes of the war, with Bragg sitting red faced as a procession of his commanders declared him incompetent. Amazingly, Davis sided with Bragg and did nothing to resolve the conflict. Bragg not only stayed in command, he sent Longstreet and his men on a disastrous campaign into east Tennessee, where in December, they were defeated in an attempt to recapture the city of Knoxville. After Bragg was driven back into Georgia, Longstreet and his men returned to Lee.\nLongstreet helped save the Confederate Army from defeat in his first battle back with Lee's army, the Battle of the Wilderness in May, 1864, where he launched a powerful flanking attack against the Union II Corps and nearly drove it from the field. But he was wounded in the processaccidentally shot by his own men not a mile away from the place where Jackson befell the same fate a year earlierand missed the rest of the 1864 spring campaign, where Lee sorely missed his skill in handling the army. He rejoined Lee from October, 1864, to March, 1865, during the Siege of Petersburg, commanding the defenses in front of the capital of Richmond. He surrendered with Lee at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865.\nAfter the War\nAfter the war, Longstreet renewed his friendship with his old friend and adversary, Lieut. Gen. and future President Ulysses S. Grant, and became the only major Confederate officer to join the postwar Republican party. For this, he lost favor with many Southerners, but nevertheless enjoyed a successful second career. He also converted to Catholicism when he married his second wife which also made him less popular in the more Protestant South. Moreover he advised the Southern state governments to extend civil and voting rights to freed slaves, much to the chagrin of his former Confederate comrades.\nLongstreet decided to make New Orleans his first post-War home. He found various business opportunities there, associating himself with a cotton brokerage and soon assumed the presidency of the Great Southern and Western Fire, Marine and Accident Insurance Company. He unsuccessfully sought the presidency of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad but was made president of the Southern Hospital Association.\nUlysses S. Grant appointed Longstreet to the position of surveyor of customs for the port of New Orleans after he was inaugurated President in 1869. In June 1873 he was named to the four-year position on the Levee Commission of Engineers. By 1878 Rutherford B. Hayes had appointed him deputy collector of internal revenue. He remained in the position for only a few months, before accepting the position of postmaster in Gainesville, Georgia.\nIn May 1880, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Longstreet as his ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. President Garfield, another former Union general, nominated him to a four-year term as U.S. Marshall for Georgia, a position he had long desired. He served in that capacity for slightly over three years, but his tenure was plagued by controversy and political intrigue.\nWith the election of President Grover Cleveland Longstreet had no prospects of receiving another position and he went into semi-retirement in Gainesville, Georgia. There he operated the Piedmont Hotel, and enjoyed raising turkeys, tending an orchard, and nurturing his vineyard. His wife, Louise died in December of 1889. He began to write his memoirs, but the task was to take five years.\nLongstreet married Helen Dortch in September of 1897. She was a native Georgian and assistant state librarian at the time of the marriage, and only 34 years old.\nLongstreet served from 1897 to 1904, under Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, as U.S. Commissioner of Railroads.\nLate in life, after bearing criticism of his war record from other Confederates for decades, he refuted most of their arguments in his memoirs entitled From Manassas to Appomattox. The memoir was published in 1896 and created a furor of controversy, which continues today in Civil War circles\nHe attended many military and Civil War related reunions, including the 100th Anniversary of the U.S. Military Academy in 1902 and the Memorial Day Parade of 1902, when he commented \"I hope to live long enough to see my surviving comrades march side by side with the Union veterans along Pennsylvania Avenue, and then I will die happy.\"\nHe outlived most of his detractors and died of pneumonia on the morning of January 2, 1904, while visiting his daughter's home in Gainesville, Georgia, just six days short of his 83rd birthday. He is buried in Alta Vista Cemetery.\nBecause of criticism from authors in the Lost Cause movement (Jubal Early in particular), Longstreet's war career was disparaged for many years after his death. The publication of Michael Shaara's novel The Killer Angels in 1974, based in part on Longstreet's memoirs, has been credited with restoring his reputation as an outstanding general.\nIn 1990, one of the last monuments erected at Gettysburg National Military Park is a belated tribute to Longstreet. He is depicted on his horse at ground level in a grove of trees in Pitzer Woods, unlike most generals, who are elevated on tall bases overlooking the battlefield. This is indicative of the continuing controversies over the career of James Longstreet."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ee8abf8e-42be-4251-9918-e67aebde96bf>","<urn:uuid:e7d1e680-caf0-4f0b-89f6-66ba3143ff55>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the traditional dining customs and main foods in Baluchi cuisine?","answer":"The Baluchi people have two meals a day, in the morning and evening, with men and women eating separately. Wheat is their most important grain, though they also eat millet and rice. They make unleavened bread baked in mud ovens. Meat is an important part of their diet, with sajji being a favorite dish served to honored guests. They also consume milk products, dates, and wild fruits and vegetables. A summer drink called lassi is made with milk, molasses, and sugar.","context":["The Baluchis (also Baluch, or Baluchi) are a seminomadic people (they travel with their herds on a seasonal basis but also have a home area where they grow some food crops). They live in the southern mountain range and coastal areas of South Asia’s western borderlands. Their traditional homeland is among Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan.\nThe Baluchis believe they are descendants of Amir Hamza, an uncle of the Prophet Muhammad. They settled in their present homeland sometime between the fifth and seventh centuries AD. Persians, Arabs, Hindus, and others have claimed to parts of Baluchistan, the traditional Baluchi homeland. Conflict within tribes and rivalries between tribes were frequent throughout the region. The reason was often competition for land, money, and resources.\nThe Baluchis population today estimates at 7.5 million. In addition, many people are Baluchis in culture but have adopted the language of their neighbors. The Baluchis could total over 11 million in number.\nThe traditional homeland of the Baluchis extends west from the borders of the Punjab and the Sind (a province of Pakistan in the valley of the Indus River), across a small section of Afghanistan, to the areas of the Iranian Plateau southeast of Kerman. The southern boundary defines by the coast of the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman.\nThe Province of Baluchistan, in which some 6 million people (80 percent of the total Baluchis population) live in Pakistan. Just over 1 million Baluchis live within the borders of Iran, and there are 300,000 more in Afghanistan.\nThe Baluchi language is an Indo-Iranian language of the Indo-European family. Modern Baluchi language is a kind of combination of Persian, Arabic, Sindhi, and other languages. No written form of the language existed before the early nineteenth century. Persian was only used for official purposes until that time.\nThe Baluchi are known as bravery and courage. Also, Many tribal heroes are honored in folk songs and ballads.\nThe Baluchis are Muslim, mostly Sunni.\nThe Baluchi observe the festivals of Eid al-Fitr, which is at the end of Ramadan, and Eid al-Adha, the Feast of Sacrifice that falls at the end of the Islamic year. On these occasions, people wear clean clothes and begin the day with prayer. The rest of the holiday spends in gambling, horseracing, and general merrymaking.\nEid al-Adha is celebrated with the sacrifice of goats and sheep. The meat is distributed among relatives, friends, and the poor. Alms (donations) are given to beggars. The tenth day of the month of Muharram is observed by visits to the graves of relatives, followed by prayers and the giving of alms to the poor. In general, the Baluchis pay less attention to celebrating festivals than do other Muslim peoples in South Asia.\nRites of Passage\nThe birth of a child is greeted with rejoicing, music, and singing. Food and sweets are prepared and given out. The birth of a boy is cause for greater celebration, and some groups barely recognize the arrival of a girl. Names common among the Baluchis include Lalla, Bijjar, Kannar, and Jihand.\nOther ceremonies mark occasions such as the circumcision of boys, the time when a child begins to walk, and the first wearing of trousers. This last event, occurring around the age of fifteen, was traditionally an important stage in a boy’s life. It shows his becoming an adult and the time when he took up arms and joined his people in warfare.\nBaluchi nomads live in tents (gidam) made of palm matting stretched on poles. A coarse goat-hair carpet forms the floor of the tent. There are permanent settlements to live in during the summer months. More recently, houses build of sundried brick. They are scattered along narrow, long village lanes. Both old and newer houses have an open courtyard in front, enclosed by a low mud wall or palm fence.\nTraditional clothing for the Baluchi man is a long, loose shirt (jamag or kurta) that reaches below the knees, worn with baggy trousers (salwar), and a turban (pag). The turban is a long cloth wound around a turban cap on the head. Leather shoes or palm-leaf sandals are worn. A shawl or wrap (chaddar) provides extra warmth in winter but can also be used as a towel, sash, or head-cloth; it can be used to carry things.\nWomen wear a long shift (pashk) reaching to the ankles, with a wrap used to cover the head, shoulders, and upper body. The wearing of pants under the shift has been restricted to women of high status. Bright colors are usually avoided, but scarlet is popular among girls of married age. Widows wear black. Women wear an assortment of jewelry, including rings (nose rings, earrings, rings on fingers and toes), necklaces, bracelets, and hair ornaments. Jewelry is made of gold or silver, depending on what a person can afford.\nThe Baluchis have two meals a day, in the morning and evening. The food for the whole family is cooked together, but men and women eat separately. The most important grain is wheat, but millet and rice are also eaten. Grains are ground into flour and made into unleavened bread (flat bread, without any ingredients to make it rise), which is baked in mud ovens.\nMeat is an important part of the Baluchis diet. Sajji is a favorite dish that is mostly served to honored guests. A sheep is killed, skinned, and carved into joints. The meat is sprinkled with salt. The pieces of meat are spitted on green twigs, which are stuck into the ground in front of a blazing log. Once cooked, this dish is eaten with a knife, although Baluchi usually eat with their hands.\nMilk is drunk and made into fresh cheese, buttermilk, and butter. In summer, a sherbet (lassi) is made with milk, molasses, and sugar. Dates and wild fruits and vegetables also form an important part of the Baluchi diet."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7eb2c0a2-99c6-4162-a270-f2769d90b677>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key considerations for soil sampling depth and timing, and what specific instructions should be followed during the collection process?","answer":"For soil sampling depth, samples should typically be taken at 0-8 inches, with exceptions for sites with minimal tillage where additional 0-4 inch samples are needed to assess surface acidification. For timing, sampling should occur after harvest in fall or before planting in spring, with fall being preferred if lime applications are planned. In-season sampling should only be used for nitrate testing. Regarding collection, at least 12 subsamples should be taken using clean tools to avoid contamination. The samples should be collected using a clean bucket, spade, auger, or sampling tube, avoiding field edges and nonrepresentative areas. Samples should not be taken when soil is very wet or within 6-8 weeks after lime or fertilizer application. After collection, lumps should be broken up, stones and debris removed, and subsamples thoroughly mixed before air-drying at temperatures no higher than 120°F.","context":["The accuracy of a fertilizer recommendation depends on how well the soil sample on which the recommendation was based represents the area on which the recommendation will be used. The physical and chemical characteristics of soil in an area can vary considerably from place to place because of natural factors and the management to which the area has been subjected. Natural variation arises from soil-forming processes (such as mineral weathering and erosion) that lead to accumulations or losses of nutrients at different sites. Management factors might include tillage and fertilization practices, crop selection and irrigation. It may be necessary to take many samples from a given area (at random or in a systematic manner) to assess its fertility accurately.\nFour variables are generally considered when taking soil samples:\nProper consideration of these variables ensures that the sample accurately reflects the fertility of the area in question and allows for the best possible fertilizer recommendations.\nSample distribution usually depends on the degree of variability in a given area. In relatively uniform areas smaller than 25 acres, a composite sample of 20 to 30 cores taken in a random or zigzag manner is usually sufficient. Larger areas are usually subdivided into smaller ones. Non-uniform areas should be subdivided on the basis of obvious differences such as slope position or soil type.\nBanding fertilizer creates zones of very high fertility in soils because the fertilizer is mixed with only a small portion of the soil. Samples taken in the band can greatly overestimate the overall fertility of a site. Because the position of fertilizer bands is rarely known with certainty, one should take more random samples than usual in fields with fertilizer bands and vary sampling position with respect to row location to ensure that the bands do not bias test results.\nFor non-uniform sites, a systematic sampling approach is best. Sampling in a grid pattern can give an idea of variability in a field and fertilizer application can be adjusted according to the distribution of soil test results within the grid. The grid spacing can vary from as little as 30 feet to several hundred feet. Often the grid spacing is some multiple of fertilizer applicator width. Grid geometry can be adjusted to account for characteristics of the site in question. For example, a rectangular grid may be more useful than a square grid when fertilizer applications have been primarily in one direction. Eight to 10 cores are usually taken and combined for analysis at each sampling point in the grid.\nSoil samples used for nutrient recommendations should be taken at the same depth that is used in the research generating the recommendations, normally 0 to 8 inches. A major exception involves sampling sites subjected to little or no inversion tillage, including those in established forages, no-till and ridges. In such cases, additional samples should be taken at a shallower depth (0 to 4 inches) to assess acidification of the soil surface and make appropriate lime recommendations. Surface soil pH may greatly affect herbicide activity and/or carry-over problems. Occasionally sampling the soil profile in 4-inch increments also may be useful for assessing the degree of nutrient stratification in fields managed with conservation tillage, but no recommendations are being made at this time based on the results of such samples.\nSampling after harvest in the fall or before planting in the spring is recommended. Fall sampling is preferred if lime applications are anticipated. Sampling during the growing season may give erroneous results due to effects of crop uptake and other processes. In-season sampling should be used only to test soils for nitrate as a guide to sidedressing additional N. Recommendations for sampling soils for nitrate are not consistent across Indiana, Michigan and Ohio, so those interested in such tests should use in-state recommendations.\nSampling should occur at the same time of the year each time a particular field is sampled. This allows better tracking of trends in soil test values over time, which may be as important as the test values themselves.\nMost sites should be sampled every three to four years. On sites where rapid changes in fertility (particularly decreases) are expected or when high-value crops are involved, shorter sampling intervals (1 to 2 years) are recommended. Regardless of the sampling interval, records of changes in soil test values over time should be kept for each site tested.\nAfter the sample has been collected, contamination must be avoided. Common sources of contamination include dirty sampling tools, storage vessels and surfaces on which soils are spread to dry. Ashes from tobacco products can cause considerable contamination of soil samples. Soils should be shipped to the testing laboratory only in containers approved by the lab.\nIndividual cores should be mixed thoroughly to form a composite sample. Moist cores should be crushed into aggregates approximately 1/8 to 1/4 inch across for optimum mixing. If the mixed sample is to be dried, the drying should be done at temperatures no greater than 120 degrees F (50 degrees C). After drying, a sub-sample of appropriate size should be taken from the composite mixture and sent to the testing laboratory for analysis.\nSeveral tests are available to measure the availability of individual nutrients in the soil. The recommendations made here are based on research conducted using very specific tests, which are identified for each nutrient. Producers and consultants should always be certain their fertilizer recommendations are based on research using the same procedures used to generate their soil test results.\nThe specific procedures used to test soils in Indiana, Michigan and Ohio are described in NCR Publication 221, 1988, Recommended Chemical Soil Test Procedures for the North Central Region, written by the USDA-sanctioned North Central Regional Committee on Soil Testing and Plant Analysis (NCR-13) and published by the North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station. Other procedures may yield results incompatible with the recommendations given here.\nAll soil test data in this publication are reported as parts per million (ppm) rather than pounds per acre (lb/acre). The change to ppm is being made because it more truly represents what is measured in the soil. Soil test values are an index of availability and do not reflect the total amount of available nutrients in soil. The use of lb/acre in the past has also led to some confusion about soil testing and the resulting fertilizer recommendations. Most commercial soil test laboratories are currently reporting soil test values in terms of ppm. To convert ppm to lb/acre multiply ppm by 2.\nJay W.

Smith, Associate Vice President for Ag. Adm. and Director, OSU Extension.\nTDD No. 800-589-8292 (Ohio only) or 614-292-6181","Sampling Instructions for Routine Soil Analysis\nThe most critical step in soil testing is collecting the sample. It is important that you take the necessary steps to obtain a representative sample; a poor sample could result in erroneous recommendations.\nThe first step is to determine the area that will be represented by the sample. Soil physical appearance, texture, color, slope, drainage, and past management should be similar throughout the area. It may be helpful to draw a map of the property and identify areas where you will collect samples. Using a clean bucket and a spade, auger, or sampling tube collect 12 or more subsamples to a depth of six to eight inches (four to six inches for turf) from random spots within the defined area. Avoid sampling field or plot edges and other nonrepresentative areas. Avoid sampling when the soil is very wet or within six to eight weeks after a lime or fertilizer application.\nNext, break up any lumps or clods of soil, remove stones, roots, and debris, and thoroughly mix subsamples in the bucket. Once the sample is thoroughly mixed, scoop out approximately one cup of soil and spread on a clean sheet of paper to air-dry. A fan set on low will help speed the drying; do not apply heat. Do not submit wet soil samples to the lab.\nPlace approximately one cup of your dry sample in a plastic zip-lock bag. Label each ziplock bag with your sample ID (you create this) and complete the submission form.\nComplete all information on the sample submission form (found on our website). Provide your contact information, including a phone number and email address, under “Main contact.” If you would like a copy of your results sent to anyone else, include their contact information under “Send copy to.” Enter your Sample ID using the same name you labeled your samples with. Please include the approximate area represented by each sample. This information is useful to the lab and will be reported with your results. A rough approximation is adequate (i.e., +/- 1000 square feet for turf or +/- one acre for row crops).\nBe sure to specify a Crop Code for each sample; without a Crop Code, the lab cannot provide lime and nutrient recommendations. Crop codes are listed on the back of the submission forms. Finally select any optional tests you would like in addition to routine soil analysis. A brief description of these is provided below.\nSend your sample(s), completed submission form and payment to the address listed on the front. Enclose check payable to UMass with your order. Please include $2 for postage and handling if you would like your results sent by US Mail.\nSoil Test Descriptions & Fees\nRoutine Soil Analysis\nStandard fertility test: $20.00\nIncludes pH, acidity, Modified Morgan extractable nutrients (P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, B), lead, and aluminum, cation exchange capacity, and percent base saturation. Recommendations for nutrient and pH adjustment are included with results.\nOptional Additional Soil Analysis\nSoil Organic Matter: $6.00\nMeasurement of soil organic matter by loss on ignition at 360 C.\nThis measure is useful for evaluating soil quality and nutrient supplying capacity. A measure of soil organic matter is also required to determine the effective rate for certain herbicides.\nSoluble Salts: $6.00\nMeasure of electrical conductivity of a 1:2 soil:water extract.\nThis test is used to determine if salinity levels are high enough to limit plant growth. Sources of soluble salts in Northeastern soils include fertilizers, animal manure, compost, runoff from surfaces treated with de-icing salts, and poor quality irrigation water.\nSoil Nitrate: $8.00\nMeasurement of nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) using an ion-specific electrode.\nDue to the inherent variability of soil NO3-N in our climate, these results are not directly used to make nutrient recommendations.

{"question":"How do winemaking approaches differ between Châteauneuf-du-Pape red wines and white wines in general?","answer":"Châteauneuf-du-Pape red wines are characterized by complex blends, with most producers using four main red grapes (Grenache Noir, Mourvedre, Syrah, and Cinsault), and they may even include white grapes to maintain freshness. In contrast, white wines in general follow a simpler process where grape skins are usually removed after pressing to ensure crisp texture and neutral color, and they are typically fermented in stainless steel tanks at cool temperatures, though some expensive whites are fermented in barrels for added complexity.","context":["Something like two miles east of the southern banks of the Rhone stream sits a small town that produces notorious French wines and has a major spot in winemaking history inside the nation, and seemingly, the world. Chateauneuf du Pape aoc might be a little district in contrast with a portion of the bigger ones all through France, however the collective and encompassing regions that make up the AOC of Chateauneuf du Pape or chateau brachial produce probably the most worshipped and pursued wines worldwide. At the point when you visit this small Middle age town in the marshes of the Rhone Stream Valley, it’s practically difficult to accept that this is the home of the unbelievable Grenache-based red mixes that hold a lofty put-on wine record, however in the wake of hearing the story, you figure out how to regard the profound history and explicit winemaking that prompted wines from this area being viewed as so exceptional.\nThe Set of Knowledges and Wine of Châteauneuf-du-Pape –\nWinemaking in the Chateauneuf du Pape AOC community region returns to a period before records were kept. Notwithstanding, the region discovered some reputation during the fourteenth century when Pope John XXII, the second of the Popes to live in Avignon, viewed the town as charming to the point of being chosen as the area of his own personal Middle age palace. The palace that presently sits, for the most part annihilated, on the highest point of the greatest mark of the town chateau brachial was developed somewhere in the range of 1317 and 1322, with work on it being recorded through 1332. The name “aoc Châteauneuf-du-Pape” means “Pope’s New Palace,” and it was the making of this superb construction that truly placed the little town on the guide as both the home of the Pope and as a viticulture community in the southern Rhône Valley.\nExtension of Wine Making –\nHowever, viticulture and winemaking kept on extending after the fortification was built, particularly during the wine exchanges of the eighteenth hundred years and into the twentieth 100 years, the palace, unfortunately, fell into chaos. It was generally deserted for many years beginning in the fifteenth 100 years; a significant number of its stones were mined and utilized in building houses in the town or strengthening defences. During The Second Great War, it was totally obliterated by German officers who attacked the town. All that remains presently is a solitary segment of the southern piece of the donjon, a simple remnant of the great construction that once directed the consideration of the strong French and strict authority in the country.\nA Little Town and Large Harbinger in Quality Wine –\nChâteauneuf-du-Pape aoc predetermination was not to be home to strong pioneers, but rather to turn into the innovator in laying out safeguarded regions for French viticulture and winemaking. Beginning during the 1930s under the initiative of Pierre Le Roy de Boiseaumarié, or Nobleman Le Roy, the French wine characterization framework or the Epithet d’origine contrôlée (AOC) framework was established, and Châteauneuf or chateau brachial had a huge job in that impact of France’s winemaking history. Le Roy was a lawyer and viticulturist who wedded into the family that claimed Château Fortia in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, and subsequently, tried to lay out a method for safeguarding the quality wines made in the locale. He helped to establish the Institut Public des Monikers d’Origine (INAO), presently called the Institut public de l’origine et de la qualité, which is the association that controls and safeguards agribusiness in France, and in 1936, Châteauneuf-du-Pape turned into the primary French AOC Châteauneuf-du-Pape assigned locale. Accordingly, this minuscule collective on the southern banks of the Rhône Stream drove the nation, and subsequently the world, into a time when quality wine guidelines would be perpetually directed and safeguarded by the public authority.\nChâteauneuf-du-Pape’s Unusual Mixes –\nEach wine developing area in France has its “thing” with regards to winemaking. The “thing” in Châteauneuf-du-Pape aoc is that each wine should be a mix from grapes filled in the real cooperative of Châteauneuf or in one of four explicit connecting collectives. Anything developed and produced external this viticultural region can’t be marked ” aoc Châteauneuf-du-Pape,” yet can be named “Côtes du Rhône.” Red and white wines are allowed styles, however rosé wines are not allowed inside the Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC assigned district.\nAbout the Wine Cultivators and Vineyards –\nThere are around 320 wine cultivators in the district and 3200 hectares of grape plantations, for the most part planted with red grapes. Somewhere around seven percent of the grape plantation land is planted with white grapes, of which the most well-known plants are Grenache Blanc, Clairette, and Roussanne. There are 13 permitted grapes, or up to 18 in the event that assuming you count a portion of the white grapes separate from their red partner (Grenache can be Grenache Noir and Grenache Blanc). Albeit, most producers just utilize four primary red grapes in most of the production: Grenache Noir, Mourvedre, Syrah, and Cinsault.\nThe secret behind the mix genuinely makes wines from Châteauneuf du pape aoc exceptional. A few producers might put the cépage, or grape assortment, rates on the back mark, despite the fact that it isn’t needed. For some producers, the recipe of the wine is a strictly confidential mystery. The vast majority of the mixes are overwhelmed by the plum, raspberry, and unobtrusive red natural product jamminess of the Grenache grape, yet customers likewise partake in these wines for the novel “garrigue” or home-grown flavour that is credited to the quite certain Rhône terroir tracked down nearby. In Châteauneuf, producers might try and remember white grapes for their red mixes to keep up with newness and acridity, particularly while hotter developing seasons cause higher sugar levels in red grapes that lead to higher liquor and diminish newness in the glass.\nFrom the ascent and fall of Middle age palaces and lofty Popes to the unassuming starting points of a rural region that turned into the first to safeguard its quality wine, Chateauneuf du Pape AOC isn’t simply a wine with a notable jug and a baffling mix, yet a locale with a memorable past play had a huge impact in the making of present-day quality wine as far as we might be concerned all over the planet.","The Great White Grapes\nThe world of the white grape is a large one, so Leslie Williams has selected some highlights and matched their unique notes with the ideal food.\nThere is no great mystery to wine. When you crush grapes and add yeast, the sugar in the grape juice is converted into alcohol and the end result is wine. The juice from almost all grapes is naturally clear. Red wine gets its colour from prolonged contact with the grape skins, but white wine grapes add little colour and skins are usually removed after pressing to ensure a crisp texture and a neutral colour. White wine is usually fermented in stainless steel tanks at cool temperatures, but some, usually expensive, wines are fermented in barrels to add certain flavours and complexities. Many wine drinkers stick with their favourite Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc or Italian Pinot Grigio, but there is so much more to explore in the world of white wine. Most of the popular international white grape varieties originate in France, such as Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Vouvray’s Chenin Blanc, along with many others. But you’d be missing out if you didn’t swot up on some Italian and Spanish varieties, such as fragrant Moscato, light, crisp Vermentino and Pinot Grigio, or Pinot Gris, as it’s known in France, where it tends to be a little softer. Germany’s white wines have given the world floral, spicy Gewürztraminer and the deliciously dry Riesling. Both grapes are now grown internationally and Aresti’s Gewürztraminer from Chile is a good example of the style.\nChardonnay originates in Burgundy and is the only white grape used in 99% of wines from the region. A classic example is André Goichot Chablis, perhaps the purest expression of the grape. Chablis is mostly made without oak and has a fine stony freshness and a crisp citrus character. Chablis is the classic match for oysters and white fish, such as sole. Chardonnay from New World countries such as Australia or Chile tends to be richer due to the warmer climate. Nugan Dreamer's Chardonnay has minimum contact with oak but nevertheless has a tropical fruit character and a rich mouthfeel that will match well with creamy pasta dishes.\nSauvignon Blanc is grown in Bordeaux, where it’s often blended with Semillon, and in the Loire Valley vineyards such as Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé. Guy Saget Pouilly-Fumé has classic chalky and citrus aromas but is also soft on the palate, with floral touches. New Zealand Sauvignon tends to be a little riper. Coopers Creek Sauvignon Blanc has a richer gooseberry character but is still dry and crisp with lots of acidity. Both of these Sauvignons will work well with seafood and young cheese, such St Tola goats’ cheese.\nAlbariño & Godello\nSpain has a number of native white varieties, but the two most fashionable at the moment are Albariño and Godello from the north-western part of the country. Both grapes are fragrant but dry, with Abellio Albariño smelling of peaches with a weighty character and a dry finish. Armas de Guerra Godello has a soft, ripe apple character that also finishes dry. Both will match well with pan-fried fish and spicy Thai or fragrant Chinese food.\nGermany makes some sweet Riesling, but almost all grown in France or New World regions such as Australia’s Clare Valley are bone dry. Lone Kauri Riesling from Marlborough in New Zealand has a light fl oral character and some dry lime and lemon citrus flavours, making it a fine match for fresh mackerel or perhaps with some Gubbeen or Comté cheese.\nMixing It Up\nThese are just a few of the best-known white grapes you’ll see on the shelves, but remember that as with red wine regions such as Bordeaux and the Rhône, you will also have grape blends, from classic Sauvignon-Semillon in Bordeaux to innovative ones such as the Barone Montalto Passivento blend of local grape Catarratto with Viognier, Sauvignon and Moscato."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5bab5447-a791-4ff0-b086-f8d7be6b1a9b>","<urn:uuid:6a7dc391-9088-4d0e-b20e-074a38e8382f>"],"error":null}

Similarly, UCLA's Mindful Awareness Research Center's approach to mindfulness has been shown to ease stress and is presented as a tool that enhances immune function, reduces inflammation, lifts mood, and eases stress.","context":["Meditation for Beginners: How to Start Meditating\nHave you heard a lot about meditation and its benefits for mental and physical health? Are you interested in learning to meditate but don’t know where to start? A meditation for beginners program can teach you the basics—what meditation is, why it's beneficial and how to begin practicing today.\nMaybe you’ve tried meditation before but could never really get the hang of it. Or perhaps you’d like to try, but you’re worried it will be hard to stick to. Whatever brought you to this Beginners Meditation Guide, you’ll find some basic tips that will help you build the foundation of a lifelong practice.\nOne of the world’s most ancient wellness practices has seen a recent surge in popularity thanks to new science, modern technology and growing awareness about mental well-being.\nToday, more and more people are turning to meditation as a simple, free and accessible way to bring more peace and well-being into daily life.\nIf you’re wondering why to meditate, consider some of these common reasons people enjoy this everyday wellness practice:\n- Coping with daily stressors and improving mood\n- Managing anxiety and depression naturally\n- Improving focus or difficulty concentrating\n- Reducing sleep disturbances\n- Increasing sense of self-awareness and self-compassion\nWhatever your reason for wanting to start meditating, the science is clear—meditation has important benefits for our mind-body health.\nBenefits of Meditation\nFor decades, researchers have been interested in what makes meditation so beneficial for our physical and mental well-being. Countless studies have been conducted to investigate which types of meditation are most effective and who benefits from meditation the most, including different personality types or pre-existing conditions.\nWhile there are varying findings, generally, scientists agree that meditation can have positive effects for people who stick with it.\nHere are some of the key findings science has discovered that will convince you that meditation is worth trying out.\n1. Reduces Stress and Boosts Mood\nOne of the most well-studied outcomes of mindfulness meditation is its benefits for stress reduction and improving mental and emotional well-being. Studies have found that an eight-week meditation program called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) relieves anxiety and depression symptoms as well as antidepressants.\nEven for people without clinical anxiety and depression symptoms, regular meditation has been shown to help people improve their mood and increase their stress-management skills.\n2. Improves Concentration\nIn a world of so many distractions, many people find it difficult to concentrate, which can negatively impact their quality of life. By turning to meditation, you may be able to train your brain to increase your focus and attention span while learning to reduce the effect that distractions have on your concentration.\nIn fact, studies have found that participants who meditated regularly for only a few months were better at reducing distractions on concentration tests compared to non-meditators. Long-term meditators were found to be better at maintaining focus for longer periods compared to the control group. Overall, meditation works by rewiring the brain to enhance the mind’s ability to hold sustained attention longer.\n3. Enhances Sleep Quality\nSleep disturbances affect millions and adult Americans every year. From difficulty falling asleep to trouble staying asleep to ongoing tossing and turning, sleep disturbances can wreak havoc on your mental and physical well-being.\nA 2015 study by UCLA researchers found that adults with moderate sleep disturbances who underwent six weeks of meditation training reported fewer symptoms of insomnia and fatigue, as well as reduced depression.\nMeditation techniques help put your mind and body into a state of relaxation, and the effects of meditating during the day carry over into bedtime. The more you’re able to control your own relaxation response, the better you’ll sleep at night.\n4. Protects Physical Health\nMindfulness meditation isn’t just for reducing stress and making you feel better. It also has important protective effects on physical health. Various studies have found that meditation offers benefits for improving immune and cardiovascular system health, potentially reducing the risk of chronic illnesses.\nRecent investigations have discovered that meditation may reduce blood pressure. Stress is one of the primary causes of high blood pressure. Since regular meditation reduces stress, it may have additional benefits for heart health. Additionally, meditation has been shown to reduce inflammation in the body, which is a common immune response to stress and other chronic conditions. Evidence also indicates that meditation may be a natural pain-reliever.\nHow to Meditate for Beginners\nMeditation for beginners starts with getting clear on your personal reasons for practicing. Meditation can be challenging for most people, and having a clear reason why you want to practice it can sustain you on days when it feels like a struggle.\n- Do you want to meditate as a way to manage stress and improve mental well-being?\n- Are you curious about meditation for boosting concentration or creativity?\n- Is meditation a possible way for you to cultivate self-reflection or a deeper sense of meaning?\nMeditation is a highly personal journey, and all of these are valid reasons for you to begin practicing.\nHow to Start Meditating\nWhile meditation appears to be most beneficial the longer you practice it, the recommended goal for beginner meditators is one 20-minute session per day, increasing to two 20-minute sessions daily for more advanced practitioners.\nBut for those who are just starting out, meditating for 20 minutes straight can be extremely challenging, and can discourage people easily. Instead, think of meditation as a skill that you build over time. Experts recommend starting with a simple one- to two-minute session for beginners.\nHere’s a recommended schedule for how to start meditating:\n- Week 1: Meditate for 1-2 minutes once or twice daily for one week.\n- Week 2: Increase your meditation sessions to 4-5 minutes once or twice daily for one week.\n- Week 3: Practice for 7-8 minutes per session once or twice daily for another week.\n- Week 4: After achieving a 7- or 8-minute long session, increase your meditation session to 10 minutes, twice daily if possible.\nAfter four weeks, you’ll have laid the groundwork for a solid meditation practice. Continue to add two-minute increments each week until you’ve achieved a 20-minute meditation session by week seven or eight.\nIn the beginning, it may be easier to practice in shorter but more frequent sessions until your skills have increased.\nMeditation Techniques for Beginners\nMeditation is an umbrella term referring to a type of mindfulness practice that involves concentrating on a single point of focus. Over the years, people have practiced many kinds of meditation, and each one is a slight variation of the other.\nResearchers have found that different meditation techniques produce different results and that some people receive more benefits from one type over another.\nHere are some common meditation techniques to try.\nMindfulness Meditation for Beginners\nMindfulness meditation is a type of meditation that cultivates present-moment awareness. When practicing mindfulness meditation, focus your attention on one point of concentration, such as the sensations in your body or even your own thoughts. Mindfulness meditation for beginners can also involve focusing on a particular sound, word or image to help keep your thoughts fixed on the present moment.\nAn important part of mindfulness meditation is to practice non-judgmentally, meaning that when your thoughts inevitably wander, you gently return your mind to the present moment without self-judgment.\nBy becoming aware of when your mind wanders, you increase your ability to recognize and manage stressful or anxious thoughts.\nChakra Meditation for Beginners\nChakra meditation refers to a tradition in yoga and other healing practices that address the energy centers of the body. According to this ancient tradition, the body contains seven energy centers, or chakras, running from the base of the spine to the crown of the head. These energy centers are said to become blocked or dulled due to stress or other afflictions, preventing the flow of energy through the body.\nDuring a chakra meditation, you mentally focus your attention on each of the seven chakras throughout the body, helping to create greater mind-body awareness.\nChakra meditation can be good for beginners because it provides an easy way to bring more mindfulness to sensations throughout your body.\nTranscendental Meditation® for Beginners\nTranscendental Meditation® is a meditation program taught by certified trainers of the Maharishi Foundation. Students practice TM® twice daily for 20 minutes, during which they aim to transcend consciousness. Whereas the purpose of mindfulness meditation is to become aware of your own consciousness, the TM technique is meant to help the practitioner go beyond their own thinking.\nThe results of TM are said to happen spontaneously and without concentrated effort. By using Transcendental Meditation mantras, practitioners are given a mental tool to help achieve a state of tranquility more easily. There are various Transcendental Meditation mantras to choose from, but they all involve chanting a meaningless but soothing sound, the most common being “Omm.”\nTranscendental Meditation may be a better technique for beginners who struggle with lots of distracting thoughts during mindfulness meditation.\nMeditation Tips for Beginners\nWhether you’re practicing mindfulness meditation, a gratitude meditation or you’re attending a meditation center for the first time, there are some basic tips for all beginners to make meditation an enjoyable and beneficial practice.\n- Try guided meditations: Meditation is easier for beginners when you have a trained teacher guiding you through a session. Look for guided meditations on YouTube or a mindfulness app to teach you some of the basics.\n- Create a meditation space: An essential part of meditating is getting yourself into the right environment. Your meditation space may include the perfect meditation cushion or chair, meditation candles or meditation music on YouTube or Spotify, all to help put you in a more relaxed state.\n- Incorporate meditation into daily life: Meditation is accessible to you anytime, anywhere. Try a meditation session while sitting on your bed in the morning, or at your desk when you need a relaxation break. Daily life can be full of mindful moments—some people even practice shower meditations to help them relax and enjoy a cleansing ritual.\nRelax The Back Guided Meditation for Beginners\nIf you're interested in trying guided relaxation, join Brandi Healy during our Facebook live event on Tuesday, May 4 at 11 am Pacific time.

It doesn’t matter your background, your religion or your health condition.”\nIt just takes practice to cultivate.\nPerhaps you already know mindfulness confers myriad health benefits, but who has the time or the discipline to meditate for hours a day? And even if you do manage to find some time, you discover that when you sit and close your eyes, instead of blissful escape, you find yourself mentally scanning your to-do list.\nNeither long stretches of time nor banishing all thought are required to successfully practice mindfulness, says Marvin Belzer, PhD, associate director of MARC and a professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences.\n“It’s not uncommon for people to have the idea that they’re supposed to be able to stop thinking and clear their mind of thoughts, just by deciding to – and talk about unnecessary failure,” Dr. Belzer says. “That’s a misconception. Even in the midst of thoughts, we can do things with our mind that are helpful.”\nSpending hours quietly folded in a lotus pose also isn’t necessary. Dr. Belzer often encourages beginners to start with just a minute or two of practice, which can be done seated, standing or lying down.\nBasics of mindfulness practice\nGuided meditations can be useful for beginners. MARC offers free guided meditations on its website and app, UCLA Mindful, available in 14 languages besides English. Listening to a teacher provide instructions can help focus attention, and with practices available as short as three minutes, there’s no need to set a timer.\nBut you don’t need a guide or an app or a timer to start a mindfulness meditation practice. All you need are your breath, your senses and a willingness to try, Dr. Belzer says.\n“Just focus on what you can hear, the ambient sounds, focus on sensations in your body, like the feel of the breath — and you can do that without magically stopping thoughts or stopping anything,” he says. “So the thoughts may be going on, and indeed thoughts will pull our attention away at times, too. And then one thought leads to another really fast and time goes by. And at some point, we realize it.”\nThat’s when you gently and non-judgmentally redirect your attention back to the sensation of sound or the feel of the breath moving in and out.\n“We can practice not just being lost in one thought leading to another to another,” Dr. Belzer says. “So we notice we’re thinking. Often there will be emotion, stimulating some degree of anxiety, excitement, joy, fear. We include the feel of the emotion, recognize the feel of it in our body, and then simply come back to where we were trying to focus.”\nIt takes commitment\nLike starting an exercise program or learning any new skill, beginning a mindfulness practice requires commitment.\nYou have to do the exercise to gain the benefits. You have to learn chords to play guitar. And you have to commit to taking time each day to practice mindfulness.\n“It’s even easier than playing the guitar,” Dr. Belzer says. “It is something that, if we’re convinced it would be useful to try, then it takes some effort and determination to do it. In that sense, it’s quite similar to getting enough exercise or eating right.”\nBut mindfulness may be even more natural, because it comes with being human, he says: “Mindfulness is a capacity that we already have. We don’t have to create it.”\nWhat mindfulness meditation practice does is connect us with that capacity, allowing us to deepen and refine it. It’s a practice of developing awareness of what is actually happening in the present moment — whether that’s thinking about your to-do list, feeling the discomfort of your foot falling asleep or noticing your belly expand and contract with each inhale and exhale — and being OK with it.\n“You definitely can do this,” Dr. Belzer says. “And, lo and behold, there are really great effects from doing this for a while.”\nFind out more about programs available through the UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:25f93e83-43c4-48f0-a6a1-50b0474e5476>","<urn:uuid:8a3d9a87-a51c-4f3e-9838-356a50a7fad5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a mechanical engineering student, I'm curious: how do screwcutting gear calculations relate to workplace risk assessment methods? 💭","answer":"Screwcutting gear calculations involve complex mathematical combinations - for example, 20 gears can generate 804,650 possible arrangements including 380 two-gear sets and 29,070 four-gear sets. This complexity parallels the systematic approach of JHA, which requires thorough analysis by asking specific questions like 'What can go wrong?', 'What are the consequences?', and 'How could it happen?' Both processes require methodical evaluation and documentation - screwcutting needs precise gear arrangements documented in charts while JHA requires detailed documentation of hazards and control measures for each job step.","context":["These notes should be used in conjunction with the following programs:\nFor lathes using changewheels for screwcutting (on a lathe like this) use: NthreadsP written by Geoff Carter\nFor lathes with a screwcutting gearbox (on a lathe like this) use BoxfthreadP\nBoth have to be downloaded and unzipped - however, in Windows 10 they appear to unzip automatically without recourse to a third-party program.\nWhen running, you'll see the following:\n- a box in the centre to enter the number of teeth of the changewheels in your set (this setting can be saved)\n- top left is a tick box to change to metric pitches\n- an \"Edit Quickbox\" in BoxfthreadP is to enter, if known, the internal ratios of the screwcutting gearbox\nFill in the other boxes as required and click \"Calculate\"\nThe results are displayed as a list of changewheels to use - and where they should be mounted described in terms of \"Driver\" and \"Driven\" gears. The position of the \"Driver\" and \"Driven\" gears can be determined by reference to the changewheel diagram below - which is also reproduced here: gear-train.bmp (you might want to print it out). More detailed instructions can be found further down the page - please read them\nAnother screwcutting calculator program - for changewheels only and ready to use - is here.\nDon't just jump in and attempt to use the programs, to get the best results read and understand these notes first - and if your lathe has a screwcutting gearbox it's even more important to go though the explanations and examples steadily.\nThe programs have been written to help with the following situations:\n1) If your screwcutting chart is absent - or to calculate a new one.\n2) Should changewheels be missing the programs will attempt to calculate alternative arrangements using the gears to hand\n3) To generate a pitch not on a threading chart\n4) To calculate the missing changewheels necessary to make a more useful set\n5) To generate metric pitches on an English lathe without using a 127 tooth gear\nA book with screwcutting information most suitable for the amateur (and ideal to refresh the memory of the professional) is: \"The Amateurs Lathe\". This gives a complete breakdown of the process with simple-to-follow instructions that will enable even the complete beginner to cut threads successfully. Other useful publications include the inexpensive: \"Screwcutting in the Lathe\" and a newer, beautifully produced hard-back book that is highly recommended: \"Screwcutting\"\nRemind me which program to use…..\nNthreadsP is the program for lathes with screwcutting by changewheels. BoxftrhreadP is for lathes with a quick-change gearbox. Note: some lathes with changewheels for screwcutting have, rather handily, a two or three speed box that gives two or three sets of ratios for each train of gears. Examples include some Models of the Harrison L5 and certain early American Sheldon lathes\nCalculations show that a set of 20 gears will generate, for example, 380 sets of 2-gear arrangements, 29,070 sets of 4-gear and 775,200 sets of 6-gear: a total of 804,650. By calculating all these possibilities it is possible to set up gear trains that will generate pitches with only a very minor or even zero pitch errors. It would, of course, be extremely laborious to calculate all these many arrangements by trial-and-error method with a pocket calculator - but a computer program can do it very quickly.\nThe Gear Train:\nTypical lathes for which the NthreadsP program was written include the smaller British and American types such as Myford, South Bend, Boxford, Colchester, Drummond, Atlas, Craftsman, Sheldon, Delta, Rockwell, etc. For lathes that have either screwcutting by changewheels or a screwcutting gearbox a diagram of a typical set-up is shown below with the gears coloured - and in gear-train.bmp - together with a photograph of a similar arrangement here: changewheels.bmp. Briefly, a gear on the end of the main headstock spindle engages with a \"tumble-reverse mechanism\" - two gears on a pivoting arm arranged to reverse the drive. The tumble-reverse mechanism has an output gear (often referred to as the \"Stud\" gear) driving a train of gears, this being, sometimes, a \"compound set\" where one or more studs carry two gears that rotate together as they fastened to each other by a key or pin. An important point is that the stud gear is usually made removable, allowing it to be part of the screwcutting train while also providing a quick and easy means of slowing down or speeding up the minimum carriage feed rate..\nTo space the gear-train out and make it physically possible to build, idler gears are also sometimes included, but these, no matter how large, or small - or how many - have no effect upon the overall ratio.\nThe \"Stud\" gear \"A\" on the end of the primary shaft (shown red on gear-train.bmp) is the first DRIVER gear. It turns a gear \"B\" on the 1st stud (shown in yellow) this being a DRIVEN gear.\nThe adjacent gear \"C\" (coloured blue on the 1st. Stud) is a DRIVER gear and is fastened to and turns with gear B - the arrangement being known as \"compound\". Gear C, in turn, drives either an idler gear (in green) or direct to the gear (in purple) fitted on the end of the leadscrew or screwcutting gearbox input shaft.\nIn many cases spacing collars are needed to get the gear train in line - these can be plain distance pieces or often just spare gears.\nThe number of teeth on the idler gear (green) has no effect on the thread produced.\nNB : Depending on the gears required to cut a given thread, it will sometimes be necessary to fit the idler gear on the first stud and a compound set of gear (two gears pinned together on one shaft) on the second.\nFrequently the train of changewheels can be simplified to just three gears: a driver (red gear on primary shaft), an idler (green gear) and the final driven gear (purple) on the leadscrew). Very occasionally the drive can be direct from output stud to leadscrew, or gearbox, with no idler gear in the train.\nA note: 'Changewheels' you say. Why not 'changegears'? - the explanation is that, while laymen call gears \"cogs\", the rest of us use the term \"gears\" - but in the past a time-served, hands-on engineer would have referred to them as \"wheels\" - hence the \"changewheels\" (gears) you change to set up a particular screwcutting train. Watch and clockmakers also use the term \"wheels\" in place of \"gears\".","Presentation on theme: \"What is a JHA and How Do I Use It? Presented by Bill Jividan, CSP.\"— Presentation transcript:\nWhat is a JHA and How Do I Use It? Presented by Bill Jividan, CSP\nPurpose To inform safety proponents about a very useful tool that can be used to indentify hazards and to have a plan on how to control or eliminate hazards.\nWhat is a hazard? A hazard is the potential for harm. In practical terms, a hazard often is associated with a condition or activity that, if left uncontrolled, can result in an injury or illness.\nJHA Definition OSHA defines a Job Hazard Analysis as: a technique that focuses on job tasks as a way to identify hazards before they occur. It focuses on the relationship between the worker, the task, the tools, and the work environment. A JHA is on component of the larger commitment of a safety and health management system.\nWhats the difference between JHA and JSAs? A Job Hazard Analysis should be the preliminary step to evaluating hazards associated with any job category or function. The JHA assigns risk while the JSA identifies specific hazards and provides tools to remediate the hazards.\nContinued Performing a JHA prior to a JSA is critical because it allows a company to prioritize the implementation of its workplace safety efforts.\nWhy is a JHA important? One of the best ways to determine and establish proper work procedures is to conduct a JHA. A JHA is one component of the larger commitment of a safety and health management system\nWhat value does a JHA have? JHAs help identify, eliminate and prevent hazards in the workplace. This will likely result in fewer worker injuries and illnesses, safer, more effective work methods and reduced workers compensation costs and increased worker productivity.\nWhat jobs do I use JHA on? Jobs with the highest injury or illness rates. Jobs with the potential to cause severe or disabling injuries or illness, even if there is no history of previous accidents. Jobs in which one simple human error could lead to a severe accident or injury. Jobs that are new to your operation or have undergone changes in processes and procedures. Jobs complex enough to require written instructions.\nOK, Where do I begin? Involve your employees Review your accident history Conduct a preliminary job review List, rank, and set priorities for hazardous jobs. Outline the steps or tasks.\nHow do I identify workplace hazards? What can go wrong? What are the consequences? How could it happen? What are other contributing factors? How likely is it that the hazard will occur?\nGrinding Iron Castings: Job Steps Step 1. Reach into metal box to right of machine, grasp casting, and carry to wheel. Step 2. Push casting against wheel to grind off burr. Step 3. Place finished casting in box to left of machine.\nExample Job Hazard Analysis Form Job Location: Metal ShopAnalyst: Joe Safety Date: Task Description: Worker reaches into metal box to the right of the machine, grasps a 15 pound casting and carries it to grinding wheel. Worker grinds 20 to 30 castings per hour. Hazard Description: Picking up a casting, the employee could drop it onto his foot. The casting's weight and height could seriously injure the worker's foot or toes. Hazard Controls: 1. Remove castings from the box and place them on a table next to the grinder. 2. Wear steel-toe shoes with arch protection. 3. Change protective gloves that allow a better grip. 4. Use a device to pick up castings.\nJob Location: Metal Shop Analyst: Joe Safety Date: Task Description: Worker reaches into metal box to the right of the machine, grasps a 15 pound casting and carries it to grinding wheel. Worker grinds 20 to 30 castings per hour. Hazard Description: Castings have sharp burrs and edges that can cause severe lacerations. Hazard Controls: 1. Use a device such as a clamp to pick up castings. 2. Wear cut-resistant gloves that allow a good grip and fit tightly to minimize the chance that they will get caught in grinding wheel.\nJob Location: Metal ShopAnalyst: Joe SafetyDate: Task Description: Worker reaches into metal box to the right of the machine, grasps a 15 pound casting and carries it to grinding wheel. Worker grinds 20 to 30 castings per hour. Hazard Description: Reaching, twisting, and lifting 15 pound castings from the floor could result in a muscle strain to the lower back. Hazard Controls: 1. Move castings from the ground and place them closer to the work zone to minimize lifting. Ideally, place them at waist height or on an adjustable platform or pallet. 2. Train workers not to twist while lifting and reconfigure work stations to minimize twisting during lifts.

{"question":"What are the main flower types available in Chinese peonies, and how do they differ in terms of blossom characteristics?","answer":"There are six peony flower types, ranging from simple to extremely full blossoms. The anemone, single, and Japanese types have open, lightweight blossoms, while semi-double, double, and bomb types have fuller, heavier blossoms. The fuller types are more susceptible to collapsing stems, especially after rainfall.","context":["Few plants have a longer history of cultivation or a more important role in ornamental gardening than peonies, and of the many species within the Paeonia genus, arguably the most popular and important is the Chinese peony (P. lactiflora), also known as common garden peony. These clump-forming, shrub-like perennial plants have enormous full flowers that appear in late spring and early summer. Peonies require winters cold enough to induce plant dormancy, so they are rarely used as garden plants south of USDA zone 7. On the other hand, many varieties are hardy down to minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit, so they are greatly prized in most northern gardens. Chinese peonies have been cultivated for centuries and there are many hundreds of cultivars, as well as P. lactflora x hybrids.\nPeonies are normally planted as well-developed potted nursery plants in the spring, but bare-root plants, often ordered from online retailers, are typically planted in the fall. Chinese peony is a slow-growing plant that can take as long as three years to become mature enough to bloom, but you’ll be rewarded for your patience with a very long-lasting plant. Peonies are extraordinarily long-lived—they may survive 100 years or more.\nPeonies contain a toxic substance, paeonol, that can cause gastrointestinal distress if ingested by pets. Peony is not included on lists of plants toxic to humans.\n|Common Name||Chinese peony, common garden peony|\n|Botanical Name||Paeonia lactiflora|\n|Plant Type||Herbaceous perennial|\n|Mature Size||2–3 ft. tall and wide|\n|Sun Exposure||Full, partial|\n|Soil Type||Sandy, loamy|\n|Soil pH||Neutral (6.5 to 7.0)|\n|Bloom Time||Late spring to early summer|\n|Flower Color||Pink, red, white, yellow, purple, bicolors|\n|Hardiness Zones||3-8 (USDA)|\n|Native Area||Central Asia (China, Siberia)|\n|Toxicity||Mildly toxic to pets|\nChinese Peony Care\nWhen planting peonies, generous spacing and good air circulation are crucial because overcrowding encourages the spread of diseases—3 to 4 feet between plants is recommended. Keep them well away from other large plants that might compete for nutrients. Because Chinese peony requires a winter chill in order to set flower buds, they should be planted so the root crown is quite close to the surface—no more than 2 inches deep. If planting a nursery-grown specimen, make sure not to bury the crown deeper than it was growing in the pot.\nThe flower heads of peonies are large and heavy so they tend to flop over, especially after it rains. If you do not want to buy special peony rings you can use wooden or light metal stakes and twine to make your own support.\nThe only other regular maintenance peonies require is the removal of the foliage and thorough fall cleanup. During the growing season, for a neater appearance and to prevent the spread of disease, remove any diseased leaves.\nFor the best bloom, garden peonies need full sun with at least six hours of daily sunlight. The only exception is in warmer climates where you can plant them in partial shade to protect them from the midday heat.\nPeonies can grow in many different soils as long as the soil is fertile and well-drained. Avoid wet locations where water pools. If the soil is sandy or high in clay, add organic matter but not manure, as this can encourage botrytis disease. When adding amendments to the soil, make sure to mix them in deeply. Peonies prefer a relatively neural soil pH, but will tolerate mild acidity.\nGenerally speaking, Chinese peonies do not require extra watering in regions with regular rainfall. Their water needs are the highest in the spring and fall so if there are dry conditions during those crucial months, keep the soil evenly moist by watering them slowly and deeply as needed. About 1 inch of water weekly, through a combination of rainfall and irrigation, is the standard.\nTemperature and Humidity\nPeonies are perennials for cool climates—many varieties will survive temperatures as low as minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit. They need winter chill to induce the full dormancy that resets the growth buds. Chinese peonies thrive in zones 3 to 7, and the northern part of zone 8 can also support peonies.\nChinese peonies don’t do well in strong heat and humidity, especially during the bloom period. In regions with warm, humid summers, one workaround is to select varieties that bloom earlier, before the onset of the summer heat.\nChinese peonies generally don’t need fertilizer unless the soil is lacking in nutrients. In poor soil—or if the plants are not flowering adequately—apply a low-nitrogen fertilizer, such as bulb fertilizer, after the bloom period and again in the late summer, around the dripline of the plants.\nBut it's best not to feed peonies at all until there's evidence of need—such as plants that don't flower even though all other conditions are favorable.\nTypes of Chinese Peonies\nOf the many hundreds of named cultivars of Chinese peony, these are some of the most popular:\n- Paeonia lactiflora ‘Sarah Bernardt’ is a fragrant late-season bloomer with rose-pink double flowers.\n- P. lactiflora ‘Karl Rosenfield’ is a crimson-colored mid-season bloomer with double flowers.\n- P. lactiflora ‘Shirley Temple’ is a fragrant, early bloomer with double, light-rose flowers that gradually fade to ivory.\n- P. lactiflora ‘Bowl of Beauty’ is a fragrant, early-season bloomer with single pink flowers and frilly off-white to yellow centers.\n- P. lactiflora ‘Kansas’ is a fragrant, early to mid-season bloomer with bright pink-red double flowers.\n- P. lactiflora ‘Festiva Maxima’ is a highly fragrant, early-season bloomer with double white flowers.\nAmong the many cultivars of Chinese peony, there are six peony flower types to choose from ranked from simple single-petal flowers to extremely full and heavy double-flowered types. Anemone, single, and Japanese types have relatively open, lightweight blossoms, while semi-double, double, and bomb types have much fuller, heavier blossoms that are sometimes susceptible to collapsing stems, especially after a rainfall.\nSpent flowers should be deadheaded to prevent fungal diseases from setting in and to keep the plants attractive. Cut off the flower stalks down to just above a strong leaf.\nIn the fall, cut the entire plant back to just above ground level. Remove and destroy the debris to eliminate fungal spores that might reinfect the plant in spring.\nPropagating Chinese Peony\nPeonies are best propagated by digging up and dividing the rhizomatous root clumps, but this is a somewhat tricky operation. Here's how to do it:\n- In fall, cut back the plant's stalks to a few inches above ground level, then carefully dig up the entire plant.\n- Use a sharp knife to divide the root ball into sections, each having three to five growth eyes at the top of the section.\n- Replant the pieces in the desired locations, making sure the growth eyes are buried no more than 2 inches deep. Planting too deep will prevent the roots from getting the winter chill they need and may compromise flowering.\nBe patient, because a root division may take three years or even more to develop into a mature flowering plant.\nHow to Grow Chinese Peony From Seed\nNearly all peonies are hybrid plants that don't \"come true\" from seeds collected from the flower heads. Even if you buy seeds from a reputable commercial source, it can take many years for seedlings to grow into mature flowering plants. For this reason, seed propagation is rarely done by amateurs, who find it much easier to propagate by vegetative means.\nPotting and Repotting Chinese Peony\nBecause they are so tall and top-heavy, Chinese peonies tend to topple over when planted in containers. If you want to grow them this way, choose dwarf hybrids, also called patio peonies.\nIt's a bad idea to give Chinese peonies too much winter protection, as they count on a severe winter chill to reset the flowering buds. Gardners who heap mulch over the plants in winter with good intentions may be surprised by plants that refuse to flower the next year.\nBut it is a good idea to cut the plants down to just above ground level and clean away all debris around the peonies before the snow sets in, as this prevents fungal spores from overwintering and reinfecting plants the following spring.\nCommon Pests & Plant Diseases\nThe most common diseases affecting Chinese peonies are botrytis blight and other fungal diseases, which can be especially troublesome in wet, cool spring weather. If you notice diseased, blackened, or wilted leaves or stems, remove them promptly to prevent the spread of the disease. In the fall, cut the herbaceous stems down to a few inches and dispose of them in the garbage. If you find that your peonies are susceptible to fungal disease, a weekly spray with a fungicide early in the season may prevent diseases from becoming serious.\nMildew, which is also a fungus, appears as a white coating on leaves and stems, mostly in hot, humid summer weather. It is merely unsightly and does not harm the plants. Here, too, a thorough fall cleanup helps prevent the plants from getting reinfected in the following year.\nPeonies are largely free of serious pest problems, though they can be susceptible to thrips, scale, mealybugs, bulb mites, and beetles, all of which can be treated with neem oil or pyrethrin-based organic insecticides. The ants that often cover peony blossoms are utterly harmless, drawn to the nectar in the flowers.\nHow to Get Chinese Peony to Bloom\nGiven good sun exposure, mature peonies usually are quite willing to bloom vigorously. Young plants, however, may take three years or so before they bloom, so don't be discouraged if a bare-root planting or divided peony doesn't flower in its first few years.\nA peony that is planted too deep may refuse to bloom because its growth eyes have not received the proper winter chill. Try digging up the plant and planting it a little shallower. Finally, if the soil is poor, a fall dose of bulb fertilizer may jolt the plant into better blooms the following spring. Be careful not to overfeed, though, as excess fertilizer can also hinder blooms.\nA plant that is harvested too heavily for cut flowers may also respond with reduced blooms the following year. To ensure a good annual display, never harvest more than one-third of the flowers for cut arrangements.\nCommon Problems With Chinese Peony\nThere are only a couple of common complaints with this largely trouble-free plant.\nFlower Stems Flop Over\nPeonies have suffered from the horticultural industry's success at breeding plants with huge double-petaled flowers. The enormous blossoms found on many varieties often collapse under their sheer weight, especially after a rainfall soaks the petals. The answer: Use gridded plant supports that offer reinforcement to the flower stems that grow up through the grid openings. Or, plant varieties with single or anemone-type flower petals.\nPlant Turns Mushy and Collapses\nThis is the classic sign of botrytis disease or other serious fungal diseases. By the time such symptoms arise, it's probably too late to save the plant; you'll need to dig it up and destroy it. If you find that peonies are susceptible to these diseases in your garden, then early spraying with fungicides may help prevent disaster.\nFlowers Are Covered With Ants\nDon't worry. This is entirely normal, as ants are drawn to the sweet nectar and scent of the flowers. They do not injure the blossoms, and ants can be easily brushed away before you bring cut flowers indoors for flower arrangements.\nHow should I use Chinese peony in the landscape?\nPeony is a classic flowering plant of perennial border gardens, where they are best used near the middle, planted in small groups. After the spring flowering season is complete, they will provide a shrub-like form in the garden.\nAs very long-lived plants with good form after the flowering period is over, they can also be used as a herbaceous low hedge or edging along fence lines or garden walls.\nHow long does Chinese peony live?\nWhat are the different types of peonies?\nIn addition to the Chinese peonies, which include the many hundred cultivars of P. lactiflora, there are several other major categories that are common garden plants:\nThe tree peonies include a select group of Paeonia species, especially Paeonia suffruticosa, that are woody shrubs with flowers that are very large but more open than those of Chinese peonies. Because the plant stems are very sturdy, the flowers are less susceptible to flopping. Tree peonies are hardy in zones 4 to 8. These are quite expensive plants, however.\nItoh peonies, also known as intersectional peonies, include many cultivars of a particular hybrid peony that was bred by crossing a tree peony species (P. lemoinei) with Chinese peony (P. lactiflora). Thus, they have the large showy flowers of tree peonies on plants that more closely resemble Chinese peony.\nFinally, a much smaller group of peonies, the fern-leafed types, include Paeonia tenuifolia and a few cultivars. These delicate plants have dark red flowers and beautiful fern-like foliage quite unlike the other peony types."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9ed32572-2b31-48fe-9d27-1f3263868a53>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which is more empty: the space between atoms or the space between stars? 🤔","answer":"The space between atoms and between stars are both extremely empty, but intergalactic space is emptier. While atoms are 99.9999999% empty space, they are actually filled completely with spread-out electrons. In contrast, interstellar space has an extremely low density of only about one atom or several atoms per cubic centimeter (approximately 10-24 g/cm3), and this density becomes even significantly less outside galactic disks.","context":["So long as energy exists within it — even the zero-point energy of the quantum vacuum is sufficient — there will always be some form of radiation that can never be removed. The Universe has never been completely empty, and so long as dark energy doesn’t decay entirely away, it never will be, either.\nWhich universe is completely empty?\nIntergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.\nHow was the universe created if there was nothing?\nVirtually all astronomers now believe that the universe sprang forth in what is known as the “Big Bang” explosion, from a state of extraordinary compression and phenomenally high temperature in which forces such as gravity and electromagnetism were unified in a single, all-encompassing force.\nAre we just empty space?\n99.9999999% of your body is empty space.\nIs the universe empty? – Related Questions\nWhy can’t we walk through walls?\nIt’s all down to Pauli’s Exclusion Principle. It states something to the effect of “2 particles with the same characteristics can’t occupy the same point in space”. The principle applies to fermions – the particles of which matter is made – but not bosons.\nDo atoms ever touch?\nAgain, atoms never touch in the everyday sense of the word for the simple reason that they don’t have hard boundaries. But in every other sense of the word “touch” that has meaning at the atomic level, atoms certainly touch.\nIs Empty Space nothing?\nWith no particles or antiparticles, no matter or radiation, no identifiable quanta of any type in your Universe, all you’d have left is the void of empty space itself. To some, that’s the true scientific definition of “nothingness.”\nHow much of the universe is empty?\n1.1E+57 cubic meters of matter in the universe\nThat means that only about 0.0000000000000000000042 percent of the universe contains any matter. The universe is a pretty empty place! For more information on this topic, check out the links on the next page.\nWhy is an atom 99.99 empty space?\nIn reality, atoms do not contain any empty space. Rather, they are filled completely with spread-out electrons, making the shrinking of atoms impossible.\nWho said empty space does not exist?\nAristotle said that empty space cannot exist and that matter is made of Earth, fire, air and water.\nDoes nothingness exist?\nThere is no such thing as nothingness, and zero does not exist.\nDoes time actually exist?\nAccording to Rovelli, time emerges in the thermodynamic context, but it is an illusion born of our incomplete knowledge; it is not something that exists objectively. “Time is a derived concept, it is not something fundamental,” Rovelli summarises to OpenMind.\nWhat is beyond the universe?\nThe trite answer is that both space and time were created at the big bang about 14 billion years ago, so there is nothing beyond the universe. However, much of the universe exists beyond the observable universe, which is maybe about 90 billion light years across.\nWho created universe?\nMany religious persons, including many scientists, hold that God created the universe and the various processes driving physical and biological evolution and that these processes then resulted in the creation of galaxies, our solar system, and life on Earth.\nDoes space ever end?\nNo, they don’t believe there’s an end to space. However, we can only see a certain volume of all that’s out there. Since the universe is 13.8 billion years old, light from a galaxy more than 13.8 billion light-years away hasn’t had time to reach us yet, so we have no way of knowing such a galaxy exists.\nWhat was there before the universe?\nIn the beginning, there was an infinitely dense, tiny ball of matter. Then, it all went bang, giving rise to the atoms, molecules, stars and galaxies we see today. Or at least, that’s what we’ve been told by physicists for the past several decades.\nIs time finite or infinite?\nAs a universe, a vast collection of animate and inanimate objects, time is infinite. Even if there was a beginning, and there might be a big bang end, it won’t really be an end. The energy left behind will become something else; the end will be a beginning.\nHow will the universe end?\nIn the unimaginably far future, cold stellar remnants known as black dwarfs will begin to explode in a spectacular series of supernovae, providing the final fireworks of all time. That’s the conclusion of a new study, which posits that the universe will experience one last hurrah before everything goes dark forever.\nCan something be created from nothing?\nSomething can be created from nothing\nBut such a perfect vacuum may not exist. One of the foundations of quantum theory is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. It begins to be of profound importance to our understanding of nature at the atomic scale and below.\nDoes God exist Yes or no?\nThe atheistic conclusion is that the arguments and evidence both indicate there is insufficient reason to believe that any gods exist, and that personal subjective religious experiences say something about the human experience rather than the nature of reality itself; therefore, one has no reason to believe that a god\nWho created God?\nWe ask, “If all things have a creator, then who created God?” Actually, only created things have a creator, so it’s improper to lump God with his creation. God has revealed himself to us in the Bible as having always existed. Atheists counter that there is no reason to assume the universe was created.","Also found in: Dictionary, Thesaurus, Acronyms, Wikipedia.\ninterstellar medium(ISM) The matter contained in the region between the stars of the Galaxy, constituting about 10% of the galactic mass. It is largely confined to a thin layer in the galactic plane and tends to be concentrated in the spiral arms. Several different constituents have been observed in the ISM, including clouds of ionized hydrogen – H II regions – and smaller relatively cool (100 kelvin) clouds of neutral hydrogen – H I regions – surrounded by more tenuous regions of hot gas (1000–10 000 K). The presence of some very much hotter regions has been inferred from a diffuse background of soft X-ray emission and by ultraviolet absorption lines. There are also very cool (10 K) dense clouds of molecular hydrogen – molecular clouds – in which a number of other molecules and radicals have been observed.\nThere are several components of the ISM. In the three phase model of the ISM these are referred to as the cold neutral medium (H I gas at about 70 K and a density of 30 cm–3 filling 3–4% of the total volume), the warm neutral medium (H I, 6000 K, 0.3 cm–3, 20% of the volume), and the hot ionized medium (H II, 106 K, 10–3 cm–3, 70% of the volume). The three components are in approximate pressure equilibrium, and gas may cycle back and forth between the three phases.\nIn addition to the gas, cosmic dust is to be found throughout the medium. The dust comprises small solid grains that are between about 0.01 to 0.1 μm in size. The grains are thought to be composed of carbon, silicates, or iron material, with mantles of water and ammonia ice and possibly solid carbon dioxide, when they occur in dense molecular clouds. The total mass of interstellar dust is thought to be about 1% of the gas mass. The dust causes dimming and reddening of starlight (see interstellar extinction) and also interstellar polarization of starlight. The interstellar grains can undergo a complex life cycle, passing into and out of molecular clouds: the ISM is constantly churned up by shock waves from expanding supernova remnants, by stellar winds and bipolar outflows, and by other forces. While in a molecular cloud the grains may be incorporated in a newly forming star, and may later be ejected back into the ISM in a stellar wind or supernova explosion.\nThe medium is permeated by a flux of cosmic rays that spiral along the field lines of the galactic magnetic field of a few microgauss and cause the synchrotron emission that is the galactic radio background radiation. Radio maps show that this radiation is largely confined to the galactic plane but has several spurs, in particular the north galactic spur, radiating away from it. The north galactic spur is the most prominent segment of a huge fragmentary ring of gas detected at radio and X-ray wavelengths. This giant gas shell is probably a nearby old supernova remnant.\nthe tenuous material—interstellar gas and minute dust particles—filling the space between the stars in our and other galaxies. The interstellar medium also includes cosmic rays, interstellar magnetic fields, and quanta of electromagnetic radiation of various wavelengths. Near the sun (and other stars), the interstellar medium merges into the interplanetary medium; the space between the galaxies is filled by the intergalactic medium. V. la. Struve was the first to deduce (in 1847) the existence of an interstellar medium that absorbs star-light, but actual proof came only in the 1930’s (the American astronomer R. Trumpler and the Soviet astronomer B. A. Vorontsov-Vel’iaminov).\nInterstellar gas consists of neutral and ionized atoms and molecules. The main mass of the gas is made up of atoms of hydrogen and helium (90 percent and 10 percent, respectively, by the number of atoms) with small admixtures of oxygen, carbon, neon, and nitrogen (about 0.01 percent of each). Of the molecules, the most abundantly represented is H2, which is concentrated in clouds. In addition, there are small quantities of CH, OH, H2O, NH3, CH2O, and other organic and inorganic molecules. The interstellar gas is almost equally mixed with interstellar dust, which consists of particles measuring from 10-4 to 3 X 10-6 cm in diameter. The smaller particles consist of Fe and SiOa, and the larger ones have partially graphite cores, possibly with an admixture of iron and coated with condensed gases, such as CH4, NH3, and H2O. Gas and dust are almost entirely absent in elliptical galaxies, but in spiral galaxies of types Sa, Sb, and Sc they constitute about 1 percent, 3 percent, and 10 percent, respectively, of the galactic mass, and in irregular galaxies about 16 percent. The interstellar gas and dust are strongly concentrated in the galactic plane, forming a disk whose thickness averages several hundred parsecs and increases toward the periphery, sometimes to several kiloparsecs. The concentration of gas in the disks averages one atom or several atoms per cubic centimeter (density about 10-24 g/cm3); outside the disk and at its edges, the density of the gas is significantly less. In spiral galaxies, much of the gas and dust is concentrated in the spiral arms: the density of gas between the arms is three to ten times less than within the arms. In the arms, about 80-90 percent of the gas is concentrated in interstellar clouds, which often coalesce to form gas-dust complexes, located mainly on the inside (concave) side of the spiral arms. The parameters of interstellar clouds are extremely varied.\nIn our galaxy the diameters of the interstellar clouds are usually 5-40 parsecs; the concentration of atoms in them ranges from 2 to 100 atoms per cubic centimeter, and the temperature from 20° to 100°K. Clouds occupy about 10 percent of the volume of the galactic disk. The gas and dust of the interstellar medium along with the stars move around the center of the galactic disk in near-circular orbits with mean velocities of 100-200 km/sec. Individual clouds of interstellar gas have proper (peculiar) velocities averaging 10 km/sec and sometimes reaching 50-100 km/sec. In the galactic halo, gas of unknown origin has been observed falling onto the Galactic plane with velocities of tens or hundreds (up to 200) km/sec. The concentration of atoms between the clouds is 0.02-0.2 per cubic centimeter, and the temperature is 7°-10,000°K.\nHydrogen, helium, and other elements whose ionization potential is larger than that of hydrogen are ionized very weakly within the clouds, but between clouds the hydrogen is ionized to several tens of a percent. The remaining elements are singly ionized by the light of the stars. Such clouds and the medium between them are called H I (neutral hydrogen) regions and occupy the main part of the galactic disk. Around hot O-type stars the hydrogen is strongly (up to 99 percent) ionized by ultraviolet radiation. Such regions are termed H II (ionized hydrogen) regions, or Stromgren spheres. The temperature of the H II regions reaches 6000°-8000°K; the size of these regions varies, depending on the temperature of the star and on the density of the gas, from fractions of a parsec to several tens of parsecs; in exceptional cases it reaches several hundred parsecs. In addition to the ionized interstellar clouds, significantly denser diffuse nebulas, in which the concentration reaches tens or hundreds of atoms per cubic centimeter, are usually observed around hot stars. Possibly these nebulae are remnants of the dense complex out of which these hot stars were formed. The H II regions gradually expand under the influence of the hot gas. If in the way of such a cloud there happens to be a condensation from an H I region, then the boundary of the H II region bends around the condensation, eroding it from all sides. In this manner are formed the dark (against the bright background of the H II regions), cold, dense H I regions in the shape of filaments (“elephant trunks”) or spherical clumps (globules). Bright emission lines of hydrogen and forbidden lines of oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and some other elements are observed in the spectra of H II regions, as are weak continuous spectra. At radio wavelengths these regions radiate a continuous spectrum, as well as lines of hydrogen and helium arising from quantum transitions between very high energy levels. In the H I regions the gas does not radiate at optical wavelengths. These regions are studied by means of absorption lines in the light from stars situated behind the regions. Much information is provided by resonance absorption lines of atoms and ions, which are located in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum and are observable from space probes. Information about the neutral hydrogen in our galaxy and in other galaxies, such as the hydrogen’s distribution and motion, is obtained by observing the line of neutral hydrogen at the radio wavelength of 21 cm. However, only a small fraction of the thermal energy of the gas in the H I regions is radiated at this wavelength. Most of the energy is radiated by H I regions in the far-infrared spectral lines of O atoms and C, Si, Fe, and other ions.\nThe mean density of the dust in the Milky Way Galaxy’s disk is 10-26 g/cm3 (0.01 of the gas density). This dust absorbs starlight, absorbing more strongly in the blue than in the red. Therefore, because of the dust, the light observed from distant stars appears dimmer and redder than it actually is. The presence of dust prevents the observation of stars lying in the galactic plane at distances of more than 3 kiloparsecs from the earth. The dense clouds of gas and of dust that absorbs the light appear dark against the bright background of the Milky Way. Gas-dust clouds stand out even more sharply when projected against a bright nebula. Near very bright stars (primarily class B) the dust is illuminated sufficiently to be photographed from the earth; these bright clouds are called reflection nebulae. The layer of gas and dust in other galaxies, observed edge on, is seen as a dark band. Interstellar dust particles are nonspherical in shape and are generally oriented in a definite way with respect to the Milky Way Galaxy’s magnetic field; this causes the polarization of starlight.\nThe masses of large gas-dust complexes can reach tens or hundreds of thousands of solar masses. In the central regions the temperature is very low (sometimes only 5°-6°K) with concentrations of atoms up to several hundred per cubic centimeter and more, and the density of the dust is greater than 1/100 of the density of the gas. The latter circumstance is associated with the fact that at low temperatures and high densities molecule formation occurs, including the formation of polyatomic molecules, followed by the adherence of these molecules to the dust particles. Stars may be formed in such places. In connection with this, it is highly significant that in the central portions of these complexes, compact objects are observed (of the order of 1015 cm and smaller in size), out of which possibly stars (protostars) and planets form. They radiate intensively at radio wavelengths of the molecules OH, H2O, and others, the radiation sometimes resembling that from lasers. Much less common in the interstellar medium are the particles making up cosmic rays and having enormous energies—from 106 to 1020 eV, but their total energy in a cubic centimeter is about 1 eV, that is, it exceeds the energy of thermal motion of the interstellar gas. High-energy cosmic rays interact weakly with the gas and dust, occasionally causing nuclear reactions. Less energetic particles (106-107 eV) are capable of heating and ionizing the interstellar gas and are among the principal sources of the heating of H I regions. The intensity of the interstellar magnetic field is low (105 times weaker than the earth’s magnetic field), but the field’s energy is approximately equal to that of the cosmic rays. Therefore, the pressure of the cosmic rays and the pressure of the magnetic field play an essential role in the dynamics of the interstellar medium. Electromagnetic quanta in the interstellar medium have frequencies ranging from radio wavelengths to hard gamma radiation. The greatest influence on the interstellar gas and dust is exerted by optical radiation, ultraviolet radiation, and soft X-radiation (with energy quanta of less than 1 keV). The last, which partly comes from intergalactic space and partly originates in X-ray sources within the Milky Way Galaxy, causes (together with cosmic rays) the heating and partial ionization of the H I regions. Optical and ultraviolet quanta in interstellar space are the result of radiation from stars in our galaxy.\nIn galaxies there is a constant exchange of matter between the stars and the interstellar medium. The interstellar medium serves as material for the formation of stars, and the stars, in turn, eject part of their matter into the interstellar medium, simultaneously imparting kinetic energy to the gas. This occurs even during the quiet stages of stellar evolution, as well as at the end of the evolution, when the star throws off an envelope, forming a planetary nebula, or explodes as a supernova. A constant circulation of matter takes place, during which the quantity of gas in the interstellar medium is gradually depleted. In particular, the latter circumstance explains why there is no gas in elliptical galaxies while at the same time there is a great deal of it in irregular galaxies—here it has been depleted least of all. Insofar as during the process of stellar evolution, and especially during supernova outbursts, nuclear reactions alter the chemical composition of the gas, the composition of the interstellar medium, and consequently of the stars formed from it, also changes. In addition, an exchange of gas occurs between galactic cores and the interstellar medium.\nREFERENCESPikel’ner, S. B. Fizika mezhzvezdnoi sredy. Moscow, 1959.\nKaplan, S. A., and S. B. Pikel’ner.

{"question":"How do the growth drivers compare between the die casting market and the high molecular weight polyisobutylene market in terms of their environmental impact?","answer":"Both markets show environmentally-driven growth, but through different approaches. The die casting market demonstrates environmental consciousness through innovations like Volvo Group's green castings in India, which could reduce CO2 emissions by 210 million tons annually by using waste and alloys free of radioactive elements. Meanwhile, the high molecular weight polyisobutylene market's environmental impact is primarily driven by its role in improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in the transportation sector, particularly through its use in lubricants and as a fuel additive that enables more controlled and effective fuel burning.","context":["Die Casting Market Size, Share, Opportunities, And Trends By Material (Aluminum, Magnesium, Zink, Others), By Application (Automotive, Electronics And Electric, Aerospace And Defense, Medical, Others), And By Geography - Forecasts From 2023 To 2028\n- Published : May 2023\n- Report Code : KSI061615335\n- Pages : 143\nDie casting is an automated casting technique that produces metal pieces of a certain shape by pressurizing molten material into a predetermined shape. Compared to plastic injection moldings of comparable dimensions, die-cast pieces are more grounded. Withing so many applications, the automotive industry has seen significant growth over the years. Die casting is used in the automotive sector for many different applications. Die casting is the ideal process for producing the numerous metal pieces that are required to be cast into precise shapes for the majority of cars. Aluminium and zinc are the two metals used in casting processes the most frequently. According to the most recent data for 2021, there were 5% more new vehicle registrations in the UK (Source: gov. UK). Rising auto sales and the automotive industry's increased focus on producing lightweight metals are driving up demand for die-casting equipment.\n- Among all segments, aluminium die-casting will have the largest share.\nThe lightweight alloy aluminum has a high degree of dimensional stability. To produce intricate shapes and designs with a thin wall section, aluminum dies casting is a common production procedure. As a result, they are a widely used metal in numerous industries. Over the years, more and more industrial applications have seen an increase in the need for aluminium high-pressure die-casting parts. In the Asia-Pacific area, where about 37.08 million tons of refined aluminium were produced in 2020, China produced most of this metal (Source: nrcan.gc.ca). Due to the region's expanding aluminium production and consumption, significant advancements are expected to occur in both the Asia-Pacific region and Europe.\n- Innovation in the pressure die-casting market will dominate the growth\nPressure die-casting technology is always developing to stay up with the most recent business developments. As a result, new die lubricant technologies are being developed and are being introduced into the die-casting market. For Instance, A team of scientists from the International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials (ARCI), India, created a steel alloy powder manufacturing technology in June 2022 that may be used to create effective cooling channels for pressure die casting. This can lengthen the tool's useful life, increase the casted components' quality, and decrease the number of casting-process rejects. Thanks to these new technologies, casting machines can produce castings of higher quality and complexity at higher die temperatures, which also shortens the time that machines need to be shut down for maintenance. As a result, die-casting facilities have increased productivity.\n- Consumer electronics rising popularity will fuel growth.\nAs demand for smartphones, artificial intelligence, and voice recognition technology rises, as do the replacement cycles and falling prices of numerous electronic gadgets, the consumer electronics business is expanding.

{"question":"Hey, I'm studying cell division in cancer. Can you explain how normal cell division works and what makes cancer cells different?","answer":"Normal cell division (mitosis) is a regulated process where parent cells divide into two identical daughter cells, each with the same chromosomes and DNA. This process is controlled by chemical signals from proteins called cyclins that tell cells when to start and stop dividing. In healthy cells, this helps with growth, repair, and maintenance. However, cancer occurs when cells lose control of this division process. This happens through mutations in different types of genes: oncogenes (which normally regulate cell growth) become overactive and accelerate cell division with just one mutation, while tumor suppressor genes (which normally slow division and repair DNA) stop working properly. Additionally, DNA damage response genes can fail, leading to more mutations accumulating in other critical genes.","context":["Sign In / Sign Out\n- ASU Home\n- My ASU\n- Colleges and Schools\n- Map and Locations\nCell: a tiny building block that contains all the information necessary for the survival of any plant or animal.

Or, is there another explanation?\nEvery day, every hour, every second one of the most important events in life is going on in your body—cells are dividing. When cells divide, they make new cells. A single cell divides to make two cells and these two cells then divide to make four cells, and so on. We call this process \"cell division\" and \"cell reproduction,\" because new cells are formed when old cells divide. The ability of cells to divide is unique for living organisms.\nCells divide for many reasons. For example, when you skin your knee, cells divide to replace old, dead, or damaged cells. Cells also divide so living things can grow. When organisms grow, it isn't because cells are getting larger. Organisms grow because cells are dividing to produce more and more cells. In human bodies, nearly two trillion cells divide every day.\nWatch cells divide in this time lapse video of an animal cell (top) and an E. coli bacteria cell (bottom). The video compresses 30 hours of mitotic cell division into a few seconds. (Video by the National Institute of Genetics)\nYou and I began as a single cell, or what you would call an egg. By the time you are an adult, you will have trillions of cells. That number depends on the size of the person, but biologists put that number around 37 trillion cells. Yes, that is trillion with a \"T.\"\nIn cell division, the cell that is dividing is called the \"parent\" cell. The parent cell divides into two \"daughter\" cells. The process then repeats in what is called the cell cycle.\nCells regulate their division by communicating with each other using chemical signals from special proteins called cyclins. These signals act like switches to tell cells when to start dividing and later when to stop dividing. It is important for cells to divide so you can grow and so your cuts heal. It is also important for cells to stop dividing at the right time. If a cell can not stop dividing when it is supposed to stop, this can lead to a disease called cancer.\nSome cells, like skin cells, are constantly dividing. We need to continuously make new skin cells to replace the skin cells we lose. Did you know we lose 30,000 to 40,000 dead skin cells every minute? That means we lose around 50 million cells every day. This is a lot of skin cells to replace, making cell division in skin cells is so important. Other cells, like nerve and brain cells, divide much less often.\nDepending on the type of cell, there are two ways cells divide—mitosis and meiosis. Each of these methods of cell division has special characteristics. One of the key differences in mitosis is a single cell divides into two cells that are replicas of each other and have the same number of chromosomes. This type of cell division is good for basic growth, repair, and maintenance. In meiosis a cell divides into two cells that have half the number of chromosomes. Reducing the number of chromosomes by half is important for sexual reproduction and provides for genetic diversity.\nMitosis is how somatic—or non-reproductive cells—divide. Somatic cells make up most of your body's tissues and organs, including skin, muscles, lungs, gut, and hair cells. Reproductive cells (like eggs) are not somatic cells.\nIn mitosis, the important thing to remember is that the daughter cells each have the same chromosomes and DNA as the parent cell. The daughter cells from mitosis are called diploid cells. Diploid cells have two complete sets of chromosomes. Since the daughter cells have exact copies of their parent cell's DNA, no genetic diversity is created through mitosis in normal healthy cells.\nBefore a cell starts dividing, it is in the \"Interphase.\" It seems that cells must be constantly dividing (remember there are 2 trillion cell divisions in your body every day), but each cell actually spends most of its time in the interphase. Interphase is the period when a cell is getting ready to divide and start the cell cycle. During this time, cells are gathering nutrients and energy. The parent cell is also making a copy of its DNA to share equally between the two daughter cells.\nThe mitosis division process has several steps or phases of the cell cycle—interphase, prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis—to successfully make the new diploid cells.\nWhen a cell divides during mitosis, some organelles are divided between the two daughter cells. For example, mitochondria are capable of growing and dividing during the interphase, so the daughter cells each have enough mitochondria. The Golgi apparatus, however, breaks down before mitosis and reassembles in each of the new daughter cells. Many of the specifics about what happens to organelles before, during and after cell division are currently being researched. (You can read more about cell parts and organelles by clicking here.)\nMeiosis is the other main way cells divide. Meiosis is cell division that creates sex cells, like female egg cells or male sperm cells. What is important to remember about meiosis? In meiosis, each new cell contains a unique set of genetic information. After meiosis, the sperm and egg cells can join to create a new organism.\nMeiosis is why we have genetic diversity in all sexually reproducing organisms. During meiosis, a small portion of each chromosome breaks off and reattaches to another chromosome. This process is called \"crossing over\" or \"genetic recombination.\" Genetic recombination is the reason full siblings made from egg and sperm cells from the same two parents can look very different from one another.\nMeiosis has two cycles of cell division, conveniently called Meiosis I and Meiosis II. Meiosis I halves the number of chromosomes and is also when crossing over happens. Meiosis II halves the amount of genetic information in each chromosome of each cell. The end result is four daughter cells called haploid cells. Haploid cells only have one set of chromosomes - half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.\nBefore meiosis I starts, the cell goes through interphase. Just like in mitosis, the parent cell uses this time to prepare for cell division by gathering nutrients and energy and making a copy of its DNA. During the next stages of meiosis, this DNA will be switched around during genetic recombination and then divided between four haploid cells.\nSo remember, Mitosis is what helps us grow and Meiosis is why we are all unique!\nBianconi E, Piovesan A, Facchin F, Beraudi A, Casadei R, Frabetti F, Vitale L, Pelleri MC, Tassani S, Piva F, Perez-Amodio S, Strippoli P, Canaider S.

{"question":"What are the operating temperature ranges of Samsung's EHS Monoblock air source heat pump?","answer":"The Samsung EHS Monoblock air source heat pump can operate in temperatures ranging from -25°C to 35°C. It can heat water up to 65°C, making it suitable for almost any use. The unit provides a heat output of 16 kW for heating and 14 kW for summer cooling.","context":["Keep reading to learn more about the pros and cons of air source heat pumps, so you can decide if getting one is the right choice for you. air source heat pumps are efficient both in winter and summer, thanks to an excellent SCOP (seasonal coefficient of performance). The COP of a heat pump is a way of measuring its efficiency by comparing the energy input needed to produce heat with the amount of heat produced. A figure of “seasonal COP” is adjusted for seasonality.\nFor those who are new to renewable heating systems, an air-source heat pump draws heat from outside air, even at temperatures as low as -20 to -25 degrees C, and converts it into energy that can power your home's heating and hot water. The system includes a fan that is installed on your property. The fan passes air through an exchange coil containing cooling fluid. This liquid boils and turns into steam, which is then compressed at high temperature to feed the heating and hot water.\nSamsung is one of the best-known brands in the world, manufacturing everything from phones to televisions and, yes, air source heat pumps for your home. Samsung invested heavily in research and development of renewable energy technology and has manufactured one of the most efficient, powerful and competitively priced air source heat pumps in the form of EHS Monoblock. What we love about the EHS monoblock is that, along with its efficiency and power of 16 kW, it is also one of the smallest units you can buy, about 40% lighter and more compact than the average competitor. By investing in a Samsung air source heat pump, you can be sure that the company will be present throughout the life of your heat pump and that it has excellent customer support.\nSamsung's 16 kW Monoblock EHS Air Source Heat Pump is composed of an inverter compressor that works according to the external temperature. The outdoor unit is lightweight and compact, which not only makes installation easier and cheaper, but is also more discreet in your property. The slim design also helps reduce sound. As a result, the EHS Monobloc is extremely quiet and produces an acoustic power of 66 dBA.\nThe high-end EHS monoblock has a heat output of 16 kW and 14 kW for summer cooling. The hot water can be heated up to 65°C, which is suitable for almost any use. The unit can also operate in temperatures as low as -25°C and as high as 35°C, making it perfectly suitable for anywhere you live in the UK. The Yutaki S80 system comes with a controller and anti-vibration foot package to help further reduce sound.\nYou can also purchase an optional cylindrical tank of 185 or 250 liters, temperature sensors and a three-way motorized valve for heating domestic hot water, as well as for space heating. Vaillant manufactures a range of UniStor hot water cylinders for use with Vaillant heat pumps. Capacities range from 150 to 300 litres, and cylinders are made of 100% recyclable stainless steel. The units also come with a 25-year warranty.\nThe best thing about Altherma air source heat pumps is that they can operate at extremely low temperatures. In fact, all heat pumps in Daikin's Altherma range can operate in conditions as low as -20 °C. At the same time, Altherma heat pumps can produce hot water at temperatures from 55°C to 80°C, depending on the unit you purchase. It doesn't usually drop to -25°C in the UK (except in some parts of Scotland), but having an air-source heat pump system that can operate at such low temperatures and still produce hot water and heat energy efficient gives you plenty of peace of mind during the winter months.\nThe F2040 range of air-to-water heat pumps is one of the company's most popular products, not only because of its easy installation, but also because of its low operating temperature, generous production and the company's excellent customer service. Nibe offers a wide range of accessories for use with its F2040 models (F2040-6, -8, -12 and -1). These range from control modules to better integrate your air conditioning system at home to wall mounting brackets and ventilation units with heat recovery. Nibe also manufactures optional stainless steel hot water cylinders.\nThe Nibe F2040 range is so popular because it is really the best air source heat pump for small and medium properties. The units themselves are very compact, reducing the amount of space they consume on your property. Can also be wall mounted to free up floor space. In addition, the F2040 models only need 150 mm of free space from any wall next to which it can be installed, and 1 meter of open space in front of the unit.\nThis gives you a lot of flexibility in a small space. People also love the attention to detail in the design. Fan blades are designed to move air with low noise, while anti-vibration connections also help make the F2040 one of the quietest air source heat pumps you can buy. And with options ranging from 8.7 to 15.8 kW, it should produce a lot of heat, even in cold temperatures, to heat the average UK terrace.\nTaking all these factors into account, Samsung tops our list. The South Korean firm may not have the legacy of firms like Daikin or Vaillant in this market, but it has brought its design creativity and technological prowess to an increasingly crowded market and has created a unit that offers the best of all worlds. Your EHS monoblock system is powerful, energy efficient, compact and backed by a seven-year warranty. And with an aggressive pricing structure that makes it affordable for most consumers, the Samsung EHS Monoblock stands out above the rest.\nOf course, other homeowners have more specific needs. That's why we've explored the entire market to find the best air source heat pumps for those who need something more powerful or more efficient. Or maybe you live somewhere where it's cold all year round and you want the most efficient heat pump for your climate. While this may seem like a lot of money, remember that you will make this initial investment over time by reducing energy bills and UK government payments through the Renewable Heat Incentive Program.\nSince the average air source heat pump should last 20-25 years, your system should easily pay for itself at the end of its life. Air source heat pumps use four times less energy than a traditional gas boiler to supply the same amount of heat to your home. This means you can save up to £300 or more per year on your energy bills while reducing your carbon footprint. In addition, unlike ground source heat pumps or even solar panels, the installation of air source heat pumps is much simpler and cheaper.\nHere, our HVAC professionals share what they consider to be the best air source heat pumps that many homeowners are very happy with. Lennox (the manufacturer) is a company that manufactures some of the best air source heat pumps on the market. Your XP 25 model is Energy Star certified and comes with a 10-year limited warranty that includes the compressor. If you have a zoned system in your home, this is probably one of the best air source heat pumps you can choose.\nIt also uses a Puron refrigerant that does not deplete the ozone layer, making it an eco-friendly option. Sometimes the best air source heat pumps are those that are economical. And that is exactly the case with the Comfortmaker NXHP model. It has a single-stage scroll compressor, which makes this unit quite quiet.\nWhen it comes to the best air source heat pumps, size does matter. However, a larger unit doesn't necessarily mean better for your home. Here's what happens: Even if you buy the best air source heat pumps for your home, without proper installation, it won't matter too much. For those of you who are trying to figure out if an air source heat pump is suitable for your needs, we have prepared a table with all the pros and cons, followed by more details about each of them.\nCold weather heat pumps are standard split system heat pumps that can operate effectively even when outdoor temperatures are below freezing. The acronym for Energy Star for these pumps is CCashP, which stands for air source heat pump for cold weather. If you are moving to a new construction or if you need to replace your boiler and you live in a medium-sized house, this is probably the best air source heat pump for you. For large heating needs, you can even install up to seven FlexoTherm Vaillant heat pumps together, which, together with the AroCollect unit, will provide maximum efficiency and reliability.\nTherefore, most installers suggest the 5-ton unit for a cold climate and the 3.5-ton heat pump for a milder climate. Geothermal heat pumps, which also control humidity, can reduce your home's energy use by 25 to 50 percent compared to a conventional heating and cooling system. Like any heating system, whether traditional or renewable, the cost really depends on a number of factors, such as the size and location of your home, and your overall heating needs. Too big: energy is wasted and a heat pump that is too large runs in short cycles, which can damage the system and lead to premature mechanical failure.\nIf you live in a small property with a terrace or have a small garden, this is one of the best heat pumps in the UK for you. The most efficient ones are an incredible SEER over 24 years old, and all major brands (Lennox, Carrier, Trane, Rheem and even Goodman) make heat pumps with efficiencies of 20 SEER or more. There is a table of annual heating savings and costs by HSPF that shows comparisons of heat pump costs between SEER common efficiency units. This is because they rely exclusively on outside air, and as the temperature drops, so does the total heat output that the pump can produce.\nAlthough central air heat pumps are rugged and designed to withstand all types of weather, frost can be particularly complicated. There aren't many add-ons for air source heat pump systems; however, Samsung offers a pre-installed cylinder unit that you can buy as an extra with the EHS monoblock. . ."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dd5b8e3e-6042-4190-9b62-c0238ca94538>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿De qué manera la perspectiva del mercado libre ha influido en los medios públicos y el desarrollo del transporte sostenible? 🌍","answer":"The free-market perspective has led to the dominance of consumer sovereignty and economic criteria in public broadcasting, marginalizing non-economic considerations in Anglo-American democracies. This has resulted in the deregulation of broadcasting systems and a shift away from traditional public service models. In contrast, in sustainable transportation, market forces are being directed toward environmental goals, with cities implementing various initiatives despite the prevalence of free-market ideology. This includes investments in public transportation infrastructure, promotion of active transportation, and encouragement of electric vehicles through market incentives and regulatory policies to reduce emissions.","context":["The neo-liberal state and the crisis of public service broadcasting in the Anglo-American democracies /\nFrench, Terry W.\nMetadataShow full item record\nThe NeO'liberal State and the Crisis ofPublic Service Broadcasting in the Anglo-American Democracies The purpose ofthis analysis ofthe present condition ofpublic service broadcasting in the Anglo- American democracies was to investigate whether such media can still be regarded as the primarypublic spherefor a dialogue between each nation 's civil society and the State. The motivationfor this thesis was based on a presumption that such fora for public discussion on the central issues of each society have become viewed as less relevant bypoliticians andpolicy-makers and thepublics they were intended to serve in the Anglo-American democracies over thepast two decades. It is speculated that this is the case because ofa beliefthat the post-war consensus between the respective States andpublics that led to the construction of the Keynesian Welfare State and the notion ofpublic service broadcasting has been displaced by an individualistic, neo-liberal, laissez-faire ideology. In other words, broadcasting as a consumer-oriented, commercial commodity has superseded concerns pertaining to the importance ofthe public interest. The methodology employed in this thesis is a comparative analysisfrom a criticalpolitical economy perspective. It was considered appropriate to focus on the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and the\\ United States because they comprise the four largest Anglo-American nations with democratic political systems andprimarily market economies. Justificationfor this particular sample is reinforced by thefact that case study countries also share a common socio-political and economic tradition. The evidence assembledfor this thesis consisted almost exclusively ofexisting literature on the subjects ofpublic service broadcasting, global economic andpolitical integration, and the ascendance ofthe 'free-market ' ethos in Western democracies since the late mid- to late-1970s. In essence, this thesis could be considered as a reinterpretation ofthe existing literature relevant to these issues. Several important common features werefound among the political, economic and broadcasting systems of the four case study nations. It is proposed that the prevalence of the neo-liberal world view throughout the political and policy environments of the four countries has undermined the stability and credibility of each nation 's national public service broadcasting organization, although with varying intensity and effect,. Deregulation ofeach nation 's broadcasting system and the supremacy ofthe notion of 'consumer sovereignty' have marginalized the view of broadcasting on any basis other than strictly economic criteria in thefour case study countries. This thesis concludes that,for a reconstruction ofa trulyparticipatory anddemocraticpublicsphere to be realized in the present as well as thefuture, a reassessment ofthe conventional concept ofthe 'public sphere ' is necessary. Therefore, it is recommended that thefocus ofpolicy-makers in each Anglo-American democracy be redirectedfrom that which conceived ofan all-encompassing, large, state-ownedand operated public broadcasting service toward a view which considers alternativeforms ofpublic communication, such as local community and ethnic broadcasting operations, that are likely to be more responsive to the needs of the increasingly diverse and heterogeneous populations that comprise the modem Anglo-American democracies. The traditional conception of public broadcasters must change in accordance with its contemporary environment if the fundamental principles of the public sphere and public service broadcasting are to be realized.","Sustainable transportation refers to the use of transportation methods and systems that have minimal negative impacts on the environment and promote a greener future. It involves reducing carbon emissions, improving air quality, promoting public health, and enhancing overall efficiency. In more sustainable cities, transportation is given high priority as it plays a crucial role in achieving environmental goals and creating a more livable and sustainable urban environment.\nHow Cities Are Prioritizing Sustainable Transportation\nCities around the world are taking various measures to prioritize sustainable transportation. These measures include:\nInvesting in Public Transportation Infrastructure: One of the key ways cities are prioritizing sustainable transportation is by investing in public transportation infrastructure. This includes improving and expanding bus and rail networks, building new transit lines, and implementing smart transportation systems. By providing reliable and efficient public transportation options, cities can reduce the number of private vehicles on the road, which in turn reduces congestion and carbon emissions.\nPromoting Active Transportation: Cities are also prioritizing sustainable transportation by promoting active transportation, such as walking and cycling. This involves creating pedestrian-friendly streets, building dedicated cycling lanes, and providing bike-sharing programs. Active transportation not only reduces carbon emissions but also improves public health by encouraging physical activity and reducing sedentary lifestyles.\nEncouraging the Use of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles: To further prioritize sustainable transportation, cities are encouraging the use of electric and hybrid vehicles. This is done through various initiatives, such as providing incentives for purchasing electric vehicles, building charging infrastructure, and expanding the availability of electric and hybrid vehicle options. Electric and hybrid vehicles produce fewer emissions compared to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, contributing to improved air quality and reduced carbon footprint.\nImplementing Policies and Regulations to Reduce Emissions: Cities are also implementing policies and regulations aimed at reducing emissions from transportation. This includes implementing low-emission zones, imposing emissions standards for vehicles, and promoting alternative fuels. By setting strict emission standards and encouraging the use of cleaner fuels, cities can significantly reduce the environmental impact of transportation.\nSustainable Transportation Initiatives\nHere are some examples of sustainable transportation initiatives:\n1. JPMorgan Chase's commitment to investing in low-carbon transportation infrastructure: JPMorgan Chase has committed to investing $200 billion in clean energy and low-carbon transportation infrastructure by 2025. This includes financing projects that support the development of sustainable transportation systems, such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure and public transportation upgrades.\n2. The City of Seattle's climate action plan to reduce emissions from transportation: The City of Seattle has developed a comprehensive climate action plan that includes strategies to reduce emissions from transportation. This includes expanding public transportation options, promoting electric and hybrid vehicles, and investing in cycling infrastructure. The city aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.\n3. The City of Vancouver's plan to increase cycling infrastructure: The City of Vancouver has prioritized sustainable transportation by investing in cycling infrastructure. The city has built a network of dedicated cycling lanes, bike parking facilities, and bike-sharing programs. These initiatives have resulted in a significant increase in cycling as a mode of transportation, reducing traffic congestion and carbon emissions.\nCities are prioritizing sustainable transportation by investing in public transportation infrastructure, promoting active transportation, encouraging the use of electric and hybrid vehicles, and implementing policies and regulations to reduce emissions. These initiatives contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions, improvement of air quality, promotion of public health, and enhancement of overall efficiency. While there may be challenges in implementing sustainable transportation initiatives, the benefits far outweigh the costs. By prioritizing sustainable transportation, cities can create greener and more livable urban environments for future generations."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:feb187c5-ec15-4471-8b9d-33c696db7406>","<urn:uuid:689dadf7-0436-4154-8ad8-e758663a485e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do file extensions work in computer systems, and what security risks exist when working with encrypted document formats?","answer":"File extensions, which are characters at the end of file names divided by a dot, help computer programs and operating systems identify file types and associated programs. While file extensions help manage different document formats, there are security concerns particularly with encrypted formats. For instance, in PDF encryption, researchers discovered that the lack of integrity checking allows attackers to modify encrypted contents and add malicious elements without detection.

The PDF standard allows for partially encrypted documents that include a mix of both encrypted and unencrypted sections, and does not include integrity checking. This means an attacker can add additional sections or interactive Actions to an encrypted PDF without raising any alarms, said the researchers in their overview:\nActions can be set to run when a document is opened or something within the document is clicked on, and send the decrypted contents to an attacker’s server.\nFirst, the attacker would need to intercept or obtain a copy of the PDF in order to insert the pointers, and would need a channel through which to exfiltrate the stolen data without that being noticed, detected or blocked.\nAttack #2 – CBC gadgets\nBecause not all PDF viewers support unencrypted content in PDFs, the researchers tried a more involved technique that exfiltrates plaintext by manipulating the PDF’s cipher block chaining (CBC) encryption format using something called ‘malleability gadgets’.\nIn this attack, the researchers exploit the lack of integrity protection to modify the encrypted contents directly:\n…an attacker can stealthily modify encrypted strings or streams in a PDF file without knowing the corresponding password or decryption key. In most cases, this will not result in meaningful output, but if the attacker, in addition, knows parts of the plaintext, they can easily modify the ciphertext in a way that after the decryption a meaningful plaintext output appears.\nFortunately – from an attacker’s point of view – the PDF AESV3 (AES256) specification defines 12 bytes of known plaintext…\nThe researchers tested both techniques against 27 popular PDF viewers and editors to see how successful they would be under real-world conditions, finding a surprising amount of variation between programs.\nNevertheless, all 27 were vulnerable to at least one variant on either attack method, including Adobe Acrobat, Foxit Reader, Evince, Okular, Chrome, and Firefox.\nWhat does this mean?\nAs with other formats that share some of the PDF’s security characteristics (XML, S/MIME, and ePub for instance), there is clearly some work to do in terms of AES-CBC’s integrity protection.\nThis must be fixed in future PDF specifications and any other format encryption standard, without enabling backward compatibility that would re-enable CBC gadgets.\nThanks to the widespread use of TLS encryption, it would be difficult for attackers to intercept and modify PDFs as they move across a network or the internet, whether the documents themselves are encrypted or not. However, PDFs at rest have been shown to be vulnerable.\nIf you think it’s worth encrypting your PDFs and you want to be sure they haven’t been tampered with, use a respected third party encryption tool, like GPG.\nThis post appeared first on Naked Security"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6f43ccfc-5eca-4dca-8dc2-f06942a8f6a9>","<urn:uuid:526f37ba-c1f4-4cd3-b067-e3c31219f2cb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do mental stimulation and physical exercise work together in dog training, and what are the signs of insufficient activity in dogs?","answer":"Mental stimulation and physical exercise are both crucial for effective dog training. Mental stimulation can be provided through puzzle toys and clicker training, which help develop problem-solving skills and make dogs more intelligent and focused. These activities should be combined with physical exercise like daily walks and playing with toys. Without sufficient physical and mental activity, dogs often develop behavioral issues such as barking, chewing, digging, and destruction due to excessive energy and boredom. Dog sports like agility, flyball, and obedience can provide both mental and physical stimulation. A well-stimulated dog is not only happier but also less likely to engage in destructive behaviors.","context":["In the world of pet ownership, it’s not uncommon to find individuals seeking ways to better understand and communicate with their cherished companions. Whether it’s dogs, cats, birds, or even reptiles, training them is often a necessary part of ensuring they’re happy, healthy, and well-embedded into your family life. In this article, you’ll find valuable insights on how to develop a training program for your pet, specifically dogs, that not only helps them learn new skills but also enhances their natural abilities. With the right techniques, you can ensure that training is a positive and rewarding experience for both of you.\nBefore we delve into the nuts and bolts of creating a training program, it’s important to understand the inherent abilities of dogs. All breeds of dogs have specific talents that, if nurtured correctly, can make training more effective and enjoyable.\nPet dogs are descendants of wolves and retain many of their wild relatives’ traits. For instance, retriever breeds have an instinct to fetch, while herding dogs are excellent at gathering other animals. Recognizing these natural abilities and incorporating them into your training can significantly enhance their learning experience.\nStart by observing your dog to identify their natural skills. Maybe your pet loves to dig, runs exceptionally fast, or has a keen sense of smell. Once you identify these skills, you can tailor your training program to emphasize and enhance them.\nNow, onto the actual training process. Positive reinforcement is a tried-and-tested method that uses rewards to encourage good behavior. This approach is not only effective in training dogs but can also help strengthen your bond with your pet.\nIn positive reinforcement, you reward your dog immediately after they perform the desired behavior. This could be a verbal praise, a treat, or their favorite toy. The reward should be something that your dog finds highly desirable, so they associate the reward with the behavior, making them more likely to repeat it.\nRemember, timing is crucial. The reward must be given immediately after the behavior so that your dog associates the reward with the behavior.\nPlaytime can be a powerful tool in training your pet. It keeps them engaged and makes learning new behaviors a lot more fun. Plus, incorporating games into your training can help enhance your pet’s natural abilities.\nFor example, if your dog has a natural affinity for fetching, you can use a game of fetch to train them on commands such as ‘sit’, ‘stay’, or ‘come’. During play, you can also introduced structured games that stimulate their mental abilities and keep them engaged.\nHide-and-seek, for instance, is a fun game that also teaches your dog to stay and come on command. Plus, it keeps them mentally stimulated as they try to find you or a hidden treat.\nAdding tricks to your training program can bring an element of fun and challenge and can also help fine-tune your dog’s natural skills. When teaching tricks, select ones that align with your dog’s inherent abilities.\nIf your dog loves to dig, teach them to dig in specific areas or containers. If they’re a fast runner, train them to race on command. If they have a keen sense of smell, train them to find hidden objects or treats.\nTricks can be a great way to channel your dog’s natural instincts into behaviors that are enjoyable and entertaining. It can also provide mental stimulation, which is essential for your dog’s well-being.\nLastly, but crucially, being consistent and patient throughout the training process is key. Dogs learn through repetition, so being consistent with your commands and rewards will help them understand what you expect from them.\nPatience is also vital. Training takes time, and progress can be slow. Additionally, some behaviors might be difficult to teach depending on your dog’s age, breed, or temperament.\nDespite these challenges, don’t give up. Celebrate small victories along the way, and know that with time and persistence, your pet will learn the required behaviors.\nTraining your dog should be an enjoyable process that strengthens your bond and enhances their natural abilities. With the right approach and techniques, you can create a training program that your pet will not only find rewarding but fun too.\nIf you’re looking for advanced ways to enhance your dog’s natural abilities and provide mental stimulation, consider introducing clicker training and puzzle toys to your training program. Using these tools can help to further develop problem-solving skills in your dog, making them more intelligent, focused, and agile.\nClicker training is an effective positive reinforcement training technique that capitalizes on the concept of \"marking\" a good behavior. In this method, a distinct sound, usually from a small mechanical device called a clicker, is used to signal to the dog that it has performed the desired action correctly. The click is immediately followed by a reward, thereby reinforcing the positive behavior. By incorporating clicker training into your training sessions, you can help your dog to learn new commands and tricks faster.\nOn the other hand, puzzle toys are great tools for mental stimulation. They challenge your dog’s brain, fostering their problem-solving skills. These toys require your dog to figure out how to get the treat hidden inside them, and in the process, they learn patience, persistence, and creative thinking. Plus, these toys can keep your dog occupied for extended periods, allowing you to squeeze in some much-needed quiet time.\nRemember, mental stimulation is as important as physical exercise. A well-stimulated dog is not only happier but also less likely to engage in destructive behaviors.\nWhile training your dog at home can be a rewarding experience, sometimes, it may be beneficial to enlist the help of a professional dog trainer. Particularly if you’re training a dog to perform specific tasks such as being a service dog or if you have a dog with behavioral issues that you’re finding difficult to address, professional help can be invaluable.\nProfessional dog trainers have extensive knowledge and experience in handling different breeds and temperaments. They can also provide more advanced training techniques tailored to your dog’s specific needs. Furthermore, they can help identify and correct any potentially harmful behaviors in your dog before they become ingrained habits.\nHowever, hiring a professional dog trainer doesn’t mean you’re off the hook. You will still need to reinforce the training at home consistently. Moreover, you can learn effective training techniques from the professional trainer, which you can later apply in your training sessions.\nTraining your dog doesn’t have to be a tiresome task. With the right mindset and techniques, it can be a fun and rewarding process that enhances your dog’s natural abilities. Whether you’re using positive reinforcement, teaching dog tricks that align with your dog’s inherent skills, or incorporating play into your training sessions, the key is consistency, patience, and a strong bond with your dog.\nRemember, every dog is unique, and what works for one dog may not work for another. Therefore, it’s essential to understand your dog’s natural abilities and tailor your training techniques accordingly.\nA well-trained dog is not only a delight to be around but also a happier, healthier, and more balanced companion. So invest your time and effort into training your dog and, in doing so, you will reap the rewards of a loving and lasting relationship with your furry friend.","How to Solve Behavior Problems in Your Dogby Louise Lawson\nEvery pet parent dreams of owning an obedient, loving, playful dog; however, few dogs are without some type of behavioral issue. Behavioral problems ranging from simple theft of socks to violent aggression can occur in any breed, and must be addressed quickly to prevent injuries to humans or other animals. Determining the root of the issue and modifying problem behavior is the most thorough way to solve behavioral issues.\nSchedule your dog for a complete physical with your veterinarian. Many behavioral problems have roots in pain or illness that can be cleared up through proper veterinary care.\nObserve the dog quietly and note what’s going on around him when the problem behavior starts. If he’s whining and cowering when a thunderstorm approaches, he may have a fear of loud noises. If he picks up a shoe and starts chewing after he’s been inside all day, he may be chewing out of frustration and boredom.\nEliminate obvious triggers for problem behavior. For example if giving your dog bones when he's out in the yard creates digging behavior to bury and find bones, don't give your dog bones when he's outdoors.\nSpay or neuter the dog to prevent humping and other dominance problems. Humping behaviors are less of a sexual issue and more of a display of dominance, and altering the dog reduces hormone levels that may cause issues.\nKeep a close eye on your dog to avoid accidents in the house. One of the most common behavioral issues is not going outside to potty, but this can be avoided with proper training and observation. Start the potty training process as soon as you bring the puppy home, containing himr in a small room. Take the puppy outside after every meal and nap time, and praise him when he potties outside. Crate the puppy at night and take him out as soon as you hear him whine or bark to prevent accidents. Whining is an attempt to communicate, so don't ignore it. If you have an adult dog with marking issues, have the dog examined by his veterinarian for urinary or incontinence issues. For dogs with a clean bill of health, monitor water intake and take the dog out every 30 minutes to minimize accidents. Clean soiled spots thoroughly to remove odors that may entice the dog to remark the area. Crate the dog when you cannot watch him closely, and let him out as soon as you return to prevent him from going in the crate.\nDiscourage your dog from nipping and biting during play time. Mouthing is natural for puppies as they learn to establish their place in the pack. It can be an ongoing problem if it is not corrected once the puppy is weaned. When your dog starts to chew on you, firmly say “no bite” and give him a proper chew toy. Repeat this exchange every time he mouths on you, and he will learn to chew his own toys when he feels the urge to bite.\nConfine your dog to a crate or small room while you eat, to prevent begging. Dogs often drool, whine and bark in an effort to obtain food from their owners during meal time. Giving the dog food reinforces that negative behavior. To curb the begging issue, give the dog a bone or chew toy stuffed with dog treats to keep him occupied while you eat.\nStop your dog from jumping up on you by providing him with positive attention on your terms. Dogs frequently jump up on their owners out of excitement and need for attention, but should not be praised for jumping. Ignore him when he jumps up on you, or turn and walk away to discourage jumping. Tell the dog to sit. when he's sitting calmly, bend over and pet him as a reward. Making him sit immobilizes him, making it difficult for him to jump up and get your attention.\nProvide your dog with plenty of exercise. Dogs often resort to behavioral issues such as barking, chewing, digging and destruction due to excessive amounts of energy, and these problems can be greatly reduced with exercise. Walk the dog daily, and toss a ball or other toy around the yard to burn off your dog's energy. Dog sports such as agility, flyball and obedience are excellent forms of exercise for bored dogs.\nContain an aggressive dog to prevent injuries. Dog aggression is a complex issue, and may be directed toward humans or other dogs, but keeping the dog contained in a place he feels safe will minimize issues. If he is striking out against other dogs that invade his personal area, keep his crate and toys in a room that no other animals have access to. Feed him away from other animals to avoid food aggression attacks, and slowly introduce him to new animals at a neutral location, such as a dog park. If your dog is aggressive toward new people, take him on short excursions to the pet store or other safe public areas. Slip a soft muzzle over his nose to prevent accidental bites, and introduce him to new people. Walk the dog by your side near strange people, praising him when he remains calm. Work with him frequently until he no longer cowers or growls at new people.\nStay calm and quiet when leaving and entering your home if your dog barks when you leave. Many dogs suffer from separation anxiety, and making a fuss when leaving only exacerbates the issue. Place the dog in his crate with a treat or toy, close the door, and leave quietly without talking to the dog. Upon returning, open the crate quietly, and ignore the dog until he calms down.\nItems You Will Need\n- Dog treats\n- Keep a basketful of toys near the dog's bed. He can pick out his own toys when he wants to play, instead of tearing up the newspaper.\n- If you are unsure about handling an aggressive dog, hire a professional behaviorist. You will learn how to handle the dog properly as he is trained, reducing his level of aggression and increasing your confidence to keep you both safe.\n- Don't smack your dog when he misbehaves. Negative reinforcement such as physical punishment will scare the dog and can cause injuries.\n- CNN.com: Solve Common Pet Behavior Problems\n- Lane County Animal Services: Solving Behavior Problems in Dogs\n- The Humane Society of the United States: Urine-Marking Behavior: How to Prevent It\n- WebMD: How to Stop Your Dog From Begging at the Table\n- Petfinder: How to Stop Dog Jumping\n- PAW Rescue: Aggression, Growling, Lunging at Dogs and People Outdoors\n- black labrador puppy chewing image by Scott Slattery from Fotolia.com"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0a6a2981-a3e5-4b7b-9944-c45e6d94aa16>","<urn:uuid:100564c1-ee41-4b51-98b2-61d4270c89c4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm studying child development and would love to understand how Piaget and Kohlberg's theories compare when it comes to moral development in children. Could you explain the key differences in their approaches?","answer":"Piaget and Kohlberg had similar but distinct approaches to moral development in children. According to Kohlberg's theory, children progress through three main levels: pre-conventional (based on physical consequences to self), conventional (based on others' approval and law compliance), and post-conventional (based on universal ethical principles and social contracts). Meanwhile, Piaget found that young children (ages 4-7) view rules as unchangeable and follow them for egocentric reasons, while around age 10, they begin understanding that rules can be adapted and are formed by mutual consent for everyone's benefit. Both theorists emphasized that early moral development is egocentric, with Kohlberg's work building upon and expanding Piaget's initial insights.","context":["Lawrence Kohlberg (1963) built on the work of Piaget and was interested in finding out how our moral reasoning changes as we get older. He wanted to find out how people decide what is right and what is wrong. In order to explore this area, he read a story containing a moral dilemma to boys of different age groups. In the story, a man is trying to obtain an expensive drug that his wife needs in order to treat her cancer. The man has no money and no one will loan him the money he requires. He begs the pharmacist to reduce the price, but the pharmacist refuses. So, the man decides to break into the pharmacy to steal the drug. Then Kohlberg asked the children to decide whether the man was right or wrong in his choice. Kohlberg was not interested in whether they said the man was right or wrong, he was interested in finding out how they arrived at such a decision. He wanted to know what they thought made something right or wrong.\nPre-conventional Moral Development\nThe youngest subjects seemed to answer based on what would happen to the man as a result of the act. For example, they might say the man should not break into the pharmacy because the pharmacist might find him and beat him. Or they might say that the man should break in and steal the drug and his wife will give him a big kiss. Right or wrong, both decisions were based on what would physically happen to the man as a result of the act. This is a self-centered approach to moral decision-making. He called this most superficial understanding of right and wrong pre-conventional moral development.\nConventional Moral Development\nMiddle childhood boys seemed to base their answers on what other people would think of the man as a result of his act. For instance, they might say he should break into the store, and then everyone would think he was a good husband. Or, he shouldn’t because it is against the law. In either case, right and wrong is determined by what other people think. A good decision is one that gains the approval of others or one that complies with the law. This he called conventional moral development.\nPost-conventional Moral Development\nOlder children were the only ones to appreciate the fact that this story has different levels of right and wrong. Right and wrong are based on social contracts established for the good of everyone or on universal principles of right and wrong that transcend the self and social convention. For example, the man should break into the store because, even if it is against the law, the wife needs the drug and her life is more important than the consequences the man might face for breaking the law. Or, the man should not violate the principle of the right of property because this rule is essential for social order. In either case, the person’s judgment goes beyond what happens to the self. It is based on a concern for others; for society as a whole or for an ethical standard rather than a legal standard. This level is called post-conventional moral development because it goes beyond convention or what other people think to a higher, universal ethical principle of conduct that may or may not be reflected in the law. Notice that such thinking (the kind supreme justices do all day in deliberating whether a law is moral or ethical, etc.) requires being able to think abstractly. Often this is not accomplished until a person reaches adolescence or adulthood.\nConsider your own decision-making processes. What guides your decisions? Are you primarily concerned with your personal well-being? Do you make choices based on what other people will think about your decision? Or are you guided by other principles? To what extent is this approach guided by your culture?","While it can be challenging to communicate with any child of any age, children with autism undoubtedly pose a unique challenge. Their emotional, cognitive and behavioral development is far different than that of a normal child. This naturally makes it difficult for a parent or educator to provide assistance that will enable the child to progress physically, academically and mentally.\nWhile there are many theories on development for normal children and children on the autism spectrum, two of the best known researches in these fields are the late Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget and the late American psychologist B.F. Skinner. While the theories proposed by these two men have their differences, they are similar in many ways and provide important insight into the behavior of normal and autistic children. Following is an overview of the cognitive, social/interactional, emotional and moral dimensions of childhood development as addressed by these two leading psychologists.\nAfter extensive study and experimentation, Piaget summarized the four stages of cognitive development in normal children.\nThe Stage of Sensori-Motor Intelligence (0-2 years)\nAt this stage, a child’s behavior is primarily based on motor skills. He or she does not yet have the ability to think conceptually; however, cognitive development is being constructed.\nThe Stage of Preoperational Thought (2 – 7 years)\nLanguage, representation and conceptual development are proceeding at a rapid pace. Even so, a child’s reasoning is either not entirely logical or not logical at all.\nThe Stage of Concrete Operations (7 – 11 years)\nAt this stage, children gain the ability to use logical thought to solve concrete problems.\nThe Stage of Formal Operations (11 – 15 years)\nDuring this stage, a child gains the ability to apply logical reasoning to all types of problems.\nThere is a common misconception that Piaget’s theory is separate. In fact, the opposite is the case. Piaget was the first to acknowledge that each child is unique and that one particular child may reach a particular stage before or after his or her peers. (Wadsworth, 1984) Additionally, Piaget pointed out that both autistic and non-autistic children could experience behaviors from different stages at any given time. (Wood, Smith, Grossniklaus, 2001)\nPiaget was adamant that each child had to go through all four stages of cognitive development. (Wadsworth, 1984) This assessment included children with learning disabilities such as autism. In fact, Piaget stated that each and every person is autistic to a certain degree. He attributed the difference in levels of autism to the predominance of assimilation over accommodation. (Piaget, 1962) In simple terms, the level at which a child is able to not only assimilate but also accommodate the information he or she takes in determines the child’s level on the autism spectrum. A child who can accommodate little to none of the information he or she receives would likely be non-verbal while a child who has only mild accommodation problems would be diagnosed with Asperger’s. This would imply that children with autism would simply progress through the four stages of development at a different pace than a normal child.\nPiaget also made it plain that teachers should wait until a child has reached a particular stage of cognitive development before attempting to teach him or her certain concepts. (McLeod, 2015) This would seem to run contrary to the common practice of including children with ASD in the same grade as their non-ASD peers.\nSocial and Interactional Development\nJean Piaget’s thoughts on social and interactional development were tied to his four stages of cognitive development. He found that as children gained cognitive skills, they were better able to understand important social concepts and interact harmoniously with others. (Wadsworth, 1984)\nIn his lectures and writings on applied behavior analysis, B.F. Skinner taught that healthy social development in children was impossible unless a child’s home and school reinforced good behavior and punished bad behavior. (Doherty and Huges 2009). He ascertained that a child who was punished for doing wrong would be unlikely to commit transgression again; conversely, a child who was not punished for doing wrong or was punished for doing something that was not wrong would not be able to develop socially and interactionally as they should.\nIt is B.F. Skinner’s applied behavior analysis’ procedures and techniques that have been widely used to help children on the autism spectrum learn to communicate. They include a focus on the separate training of each verbal operant, an emphasis on mand and intraverbal relations, separate training for speaking and listening and the use of automatic reinforcement in analyzing and training verbal skills. Skinner’s insight has also helped educators to realize that failure in verbal communication may not be entirely due to a child’s autism but rather to an incomplete behavioral analysis of the language task.\nEven so, researchers have noted that while Skinner’s emphasis on behavioral intervention is spot-on, there is no guarantee that even intensive behavioral intervention will work with every single child on the autism spectrum. The age at which the intervention takes place, a child’s place on the autism spectrum and the nature of the behavioral program all have a bearing on its success. (Sundberg, Sundberg, 2001)\nPiaget taught that a child’s emotional development is closely tied to his or her cognitive development in infancy. However, as a child gets older, emotional development becomes closely related to his or her moral and social development. This applies from early childhood up to adolescence. (Hesse, 1987) However, he does not give much more information. In fact, it has been accurately said that Piaget ignored emotional development entirely except when it related to cognitive development. (Nadel, Muir, 2005).\nSkinner, on the other hand, addressed emotional development in the context of “nurture over nature”, a theory that modern experts describe as accurate but warn needs to be tempered due to the fact that further research makes it clear that each child possesses innate mechanisms that interpret social interaction. (Rochat, 2010). Piaget’s theory on the close relation between cognitive and emotional development seem to be the most accurate; those who teach autistic children will likely find that mental development (or regression) undoubtedly influences the behavior of a normal or autistic child just as much as behavioral interventions.\nPiaget described the physical development of a young child in detail. In his theory of cognitive development, he noted that the first two years represent a period of sensory-motor development. He divided this period into six smaller periods, outlining how a normal child’s increased ability to move around and reach objects and people affects his or her mental development. Increased sensory stimulation enables a child to process new information in relation to information he or she has already learned (Wadsworth, 1984).\nModern research has made it clear that some children with autism may experience sensory-motor problems while others experience normal physical development. (Stone, Turner 2005) This is clearly in line with Piaget’s teaching that children may display characteristics from different stages of cognitive development at any one time. While some autistic children are clearly at an early stage of cognitive development as it relates to physical development, other children on the ASD spectrum exhibit physical behavior in line with their age while struggling to reach a stage of cognitive development that their peers have already reached or even passed.\nBoth Piaget and Skinner emphasize the close link between social development and moral development. Skinner believed that socializing with others was a child’s primary means of moral development. In other words, both normal children and children with ASD learn morals from those around them. As he expounded on applied behavior analysis, he put forth the theory that a child’s behavior could be altered solely by altering the environment around him or her.\nPiaget held similar views when it came to the training of young children. When interviewing children using the Clinical Interview Methods, he discovered that young children used figures of authority to determine right from wrong. However, Piaget differs from Skinner in that he emphasizes the fact that children do not only learn moral via socialization. As they get older, factors such as justice, welfare, rights and the development of a child’s own intelligence and knowledge base enables a child to create his or her own principles of morality. (Psychology Notes HQ, 2014)\nYet again, Piaget places an emphasis on moral stages of development. He notes that normal children ages 4 – 7 typically view rules as being unchangeable. Furthermore, they only follow them for egocentric reasons; alternatively, they may even make up rules as they go along. Young children in this group do not understand that there may be exceptions to rules or that a person’s motive should be taken into account. About the time a child turns 10, he or she begins to understand that rules can be adapted or changed as the need arises. They also begin to understand that rules are formed by mutual consent for the good of all involved. (Flemming, 2005 – 2006)\nWhile skinner made no differentiation regarding the process by normal children and children with ASD learn morals, his work made it plain that children with autism need certain types of behavioral intervention that a normal child would not require. Piaget, on the other hand, emphasizes the many similarities between egocentrism and autism. (Piaget, 1962). This makes it clear that he saw autistic children as being stuck in an early stage of moral development. Lawrence Kohlberg, who admired Piaget’s work on moral development in children, patterned his theory of moral development on Piaget’s work. Kohlberg, like Piaget, noted that the first stage of any child’s development is egocentric and guided primarily by resulting consequences of any given type of behavior. (Flemming, 2005 – 2006) Kohlberg’s work is supported by contemporary research and is in line with Skinner’s emphasis on behavioral conditioning as it applies to children with ASD. (Morelli, n.d.)\nApplication for the Preteen and Early Teen Years\nSkinner’s and Piaget’s writings make it clear that each child is different. It is simply impossible to judge a normal or ASD child based on rigid criteria because a child’s development is determined by his or her cognitive, emotional, physical, moral and social stage of development in conjunction with past experiences and applied behavioral intervention (or the lack of it). Even so, there are some clear guidelines that apply to children in the preteen and early teen years (approximately 10 – 14 years of age).\nAccording to Piaget, a normal child in his or her early preteen years should be able to use logical thought to solve concrete problems. As a child enters his or her teen years, he or she should be able to solve all types of problems using a logical thought process. (Wadsworth, 1984) This assessment is in line with Kohlberg’s work, which is endorsed by modern researchers. An autistic child, on the other hand, should not be expected to be at a stage of formal or logical operations. Instead, a teacher should expect that a child with ASD would be at an earlier stage of cognitive development.\nSkinner’s comprehensive study of human behavior should also be taken into account when comparing a normal child with an autistic one. Educators who, through experience and training, have learned how to handle a regular or autistic preteen or teen should expect to see positive results in at least some of the stages outlined above. Taking social skills into account is imperative when dealing with autistic youth in particular, as the inability to communicate clearly should not be mistaken for problems in cognitive development.\nBoth Skinner and Piaget provide invaluable counsel and advice in dealing with children at all stages of development. These guidelines, when applied appropriately, can help any child make mental, physical and academic progress in the right setting.\nWadsworth, Barry J.

{"question":"函数返回值和Lambda函数有什么区别？🤔","answer":"Functions in C/C++ and Lambda functions in Python handle return values differently. In C/C++, functions can either return a value of a valid data type (int, float, char, etc.) or be void if they don't return anything. The return keyword both returns the value and exits the function. Lambda functions in Python, on the other hand, can only evaluate and return one expression, making them more limited. They are primarily used for creating small, throwaway functions and are particularly useful with functions like map(), filter(), and reduce() for operations on iterables.","context":["In C , C++\nWhat is function?\nThe functions are like subtasks. They receive some\ninformation, do some process and provide a result.\nWe have a main() [ function ] in every C program\nWriting a function\nWhen we write a function.

Function that return a value\n2. Function that do not return a value\nFunction that return a value\nSuppose we have a function that calculates the square of an\ninteger such that function will return the square of the integer\nFunction that do not return a value\nSuppose we have a function that display some information\non the screen so this function is not return a value to the\nStructure of function\nThe declaration syntax of a function is as follows\ndeclarations and statements\nThe first line is the function header and the declaration\nand statement part is the body of a function\nStructure of a function\nD.

Some function does not need any\ninformation to perform the task. In this case, the argument list\nfor such functions will be empty. Arguments to a function are\nof valid data type like int number, double radius etc.\nDecleration and statements\nThis is the body of the function. It consists of declarations\nThe task of the function is performed in the body of the\n//This function calculates the square of a number and returns it\nint square(int number)\nint result = 0;\nresult = number*number;\nFunction Calling mechanism\nHow a program can use a function? It is very simple. The\ncalling program just need to write the function name and\nprovide its arguments (without data types). It is important to\nnote that while calling a function we don’t write the return\nvalue data-type or the data-type of arguments\nSee the example…\n// This program calculates the square of a given number\n# include <iostream.h>\nint number, result;\n// Getting the input from the user\ncout << “ Please enter the number to calculate the\n// Calling the function\ncout << “ The square of “ << number << “ is “ << result;\nDeclaration and definition of a function\nDeclaration and definition are two different things. Declaration is\nthe prototype of the function, that includes the return type, name\nand argument list to the function and definition is the actual\nfunction code. Declaration of a function is also known as signature\nof a function.\nAs we declare a variable like int x; before using it in our program,\nsimilarly we neto declare function before using it. Declaration and\ndefinition of a function can be combined together if we write the\ncomplete function before the calling functions. Then we don’t need\nto declare it explicitly. If we have written all of our functions in a\ndifferent file and we call these functions from main( ) which is\nwritten in a different file. In this case , the main( ) will not be\ncompiled unless it knows about the functions declaration.","The Basic Syntax\nLambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are a flexible tool for creating small, throwaway functions. They're incredibly useful when we need to pass a function as an argument to another function, and we don't want to define a separate one in our code.\nUnlike regular functions in Python, which are defined using the\ndef keyword, we denote lambda functions with the\nA lambda function accepts any number of arguments but only evaluates and returns one expression.\nlambda arguments: expression\nObserve the following lambda function that adds two numbers:\nadd = lambda x, y: x + y print(add(3, 4)) # Output: 7\nAs you can see, we have defined a lambda function\nadd that takes two arguments\ny. The body of the function contains a single expression\nx + y returning the sum of\nAdditionally, we can include multiple arguments. For instance, we can create a lambda function that calculates the product of three numbers, like so:\nmultiply = lambda x, y, z: x * y * z print(multiply(2, 3, 4)) # Output: 24\nCombining Regular and Lambda Functions\nLet's demonstrate how a regular function can return a lambda function that performs a specific operation. Moreover, we'll see how we can create multiple instances of the same lambda function with different behaviors by calling the regular function with different arguments.\ndef create_function(n): return lambda x: x + n add_5 = create_function(5) add_10 = create_function(10) print(add_5(3)) # Output: 8 print(add_10(3)) # Output: 13\nIn the example above, we have a regular function named\ncreate_function that takes in an argument\nn, and returns a lambda function that takes an argument\nx and calculates the sum of\nWe then use\ncreate_function to create two separate instances of the lambda function,\nadd_10, by calling it with different arguments,\nWhy Use a Lambda Function?\nThe Python style guide, PEP 8, states that it is always preferred to use a def statement instead of an assignment statement that binds a lambda expression directly to an identifier. Frankly, regular functions are less limited than lambdas and in turn offer more benefits and should be used whenever possible.\nAnother disadvantage of lambda functions is that they can be difficult to debug. Since they are anonymous, it can be challenging to trace when an error occurs.\nHowever, that doesn't mean that lambda functions can't provide neat solutions. The key is to use them judiciously, and only when there is nothing more \"Pythonic\" available to us.\nLambda Functions on Iterables Objects\nThe most appropriate use of lambda functions would probably be in iterable objects alongside functions such as\nreduce(), to name a few. With this combination, we can loop over lists, tuples, and dictionaries, and greatly simplify our code.\nmap() with Lambda Functions\nmap() function takes a function and an iterable object as arguments, and returns a new iterable object with the function applied to each element.\nTo demonstrate, we'll use an example where we square each element in the list:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)) print(squared_numbers) # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\nfilter() with Lambda Functions\nfilter() function takes a function and an iterable object as arguments, and returns a new iterable object containing only the elements for which the function returns\nWe can potentially use it in combination with a lambda function to filter a list and find all even numbers:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)) print(even_numbers) # Output: [2, 4]\nreduce() with Lambda Functions\nreduce() function takes a function and an iterable object as arguments, and returns a single value that is the result of applying the function to the elements of the iterable object.\nWe can use it with a lambda function to calculate the product of all numbers in the list, like so:\nfrom functools import reduce numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers) print(product) # Output: 120\nWhile lambdas have some drawbacks, they can potentially be a neat addition to any Python programmer's toolkit. They provide a way to create simple, one-off functions for specific tasks. However, they should be used with care and only when there is no better alternative present.\nIf you need a refresher, take the time to familiarize yourself with the basics of functions in Python found below, alongside other useful resources. As always, don't be afraid to experiment and see how you can potentially utilize lambda functions in your projects."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:409b3c00-f3cf-4705-ba14-9735e50ce1e6>","<urn:uuid:2b747b94-93da-4884-b35f-53b470b5bf21>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the applications of diamond films in wastewater treatment, and how do they relate to biochemical oxygen demand measurements?","answer":"Diamond films, particularly boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes, are used extensively in wastewater treatment through electrochemical processes. They are effective in water disinfection, decontamination, and the production of strong oxidizing species that enable fast mineralization of organic pollutants. These electrodes can be used in electro-oxidation processes and are particularly useful in the fabrication of Ti/BDD systems for wastewater treatment. The effectiveness of these treatments can be measured through biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which indicates the oxygen demand of biodegradable pollutants in the water. BOD tests measure how the oxygen content of water decreases as bacteria break down pollutants, serving as a key indicator of pollution effects in natural waterways and industrial wastewater.","context":["Synthetic Diamond Films: Preparation, Electrochemistry, Characterization, and Applications\nDescriptionThe book gives an overview on the current development status of synthetic diamond films and their applications.

The electrochemical properties of diamond films in different scientific areas, with special attention in electroanalysis, are further described. Different strategies to modify these electrodes are also discussed as important technologies with ability to change their electrochemical characteristics for a more specific electroanalytical use. The second part of the book deals with practical applications of diamond electrodes to the industry, organic electrosynthesis, electrochemical energy technology, and biotechnology. Special emphasis is made on the properties of these materials for the production of strong oxidizing species allowing the fast mineralization of organics and their use for water disinfection and decontamination.

Those biochemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the biochemical oxygen demand BOD.\nSuch chemicals are also liable to be broken down using strong oxidizing agents and these chemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the chemical oxygen demand COD. Both have been widely adopted as a measure of pollution effect.\nThe BOD test measures the oxygen demand of biodegradable pollutants whereas the COD test measures the oxygen demand of oxidizable pollutants. Any oxidizable material present in an aerobic natural waterway or in an industrial wastewater will be oxidized both by biochemical bacterial or chemical processes.\nThe result is that the oxygen content of the water will be decreased. Wastewater can be treated in wastewater treatment plants which include physical, chemical and biological treatment processes.\nMunicipal wastewater is treated in sewage treatment plants which may also be referred to as wastewater treatment plants. Agricultural wastewater may be treated in agricultural wastewater treatment processes, whereas industrial wastewater is treated in industrial wastewater treatment processes.\nFor municipal wastewater the use of septic tanks and other On-Site Sewage Facilities OSSF is widespread in some rural areas, for example serving up to 20 percent of the homes in the U.\nSome wastewater may be highly treated and reused as reclaimed water.

Access to either of these systems is typically through a manhole. During high precipitation periods a combined sewer system may experience a combined sewer overflow event, which forces untreated sewage to flow directly to receiving waters.\nThis can pose a serious threat to public health and the surrounding environment. Sewage may drain directly into major watersheds with minimal or no treatment but this usually has serious impacts on the quality of an environment and on the health of people. Pathogens can cause a variety of illnesses.\nSome chemicals pose risks even at very low concentrations and can remain a threat for long periods of time because of bioaccumulation in animal or human tissue.

Fabrizio Cantelli, Naonori Kodate, Kristian Krieger - 9th May 2010 The concept of the World Risk Society (Beck, 1998) is often associated with major disasters and accidents.\nAnd indeed, safety from the forces of nature can no longer be taken for granted even by the population of industrialised countries, as an increasing number of floods, hurricanes and winter storms over the last two decades demonstrates. Similarly, industrial accidents, such as Chernobyl, Sandoz and Bhopal, cause severe and lasting damages to human health and the environment (Perrow, 1999). In view of accelerating technological change and increased competitive pressures, as well as climate change, it is reasonable to expect that such disasters will continue to undermine the safety of the population and commentators will keep on referring to the idea of a ‘risk society’.\nWhile the association of the concept of a risk society with disasters is not wrong, it is incomplete. New Partnerships on the Horizon? Voice matters. Risk society. The term “Risk Society” is a neologism coined by German sociologist Ulrich Beck, in his book Risk Society: Toward a New Modernity, first published in German in 1986 and translated into English in 1992.\nThere is a long-standing tradition in intellectual thought of choosing society labels—e.g., Acquisitive Society, Open Society, Affluent Society, Civic Society, Post-Industrial Society, and so on—to capture the dominant theme or spirit of an age, or what Germans call its zeitgeist. Beck’s “Risk Society” is just such a label; its intent is to underscore his position that society, in this era of advanced modernity, is dominated by the ubiquity of risks, not only as the dominant consciousness of the age but also as the challenge that threatens to overwhelm societies. Separating the present era from its past are new species of risk that, unlike in the past, are no longer circumscribed spatially or temporarily. Further reading Citation Rosa, E. (2006).

Introduction Crisis management is a critical organizational function.\nFailure can result in serious harm to stakeholders, losses for an organization, or end its very existence. Public relations practitioners are an integral part of crisis management teams. So a set of best practices and lessons gleaned from our knowledge of crisis management would be a very useful resource for those in public relations. Volumes have been written about crisis management by both practitioners and researchers from many different disciplines making it a challenge to synthesize what we know about crisis management and public relations’ place in that knowledge base. Definitions There are plenty of definitions for a crisis. Effective crisis management handles the threats sequentially. Crisis management is a process designed to prevent or lessen the damage a crisis can inflict on an organization and its stakeholders. Pre-Crisis Phase Prevention involves seeking to reduce known risks that could lead to a crisis.\nSITUATIONAL CRISIS COMMUNICATION THEORY - Timothy Coombs. SOCIAL MEDIA AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT - Timothy Coombs. When Should a Leader Apologize—and When Not? When we wrong someone we know, even unintentionally, we are generally expected to apologize.\nThe person we hurt feels entitled to an admission of error and an expression of regret. We, in turn, try to ameliorate the situation by saying, “I’m sorry,” and perhaps making restitution. But when we’re acting as leaders, the circumstances are different.","What is a Crisis?\nIn times of crisis, you will likely see the soul of your organization, as well your own, exposed for better or for worse. You’ll see, sometimes suddenly, weaknesses that need attention both in yourself and your organization. And you’ll lay awake nights searching for strengths and strategizing about how you can build upon them.\nThe best time to plan for a crisis is before you have one!\n**Most of the material presented here is drawn from the book Not If, but When, published by United Methodist Communications, and from the Episcopal Communicator’s Manual, Diocese of Texas Office of Communications.\nCommon Components of Crises\n- They arise suddenly.\n- Information and key leaders are not always available when you need them.\n- Every crisis provides its own opportunity to position your organization in the way it wants to be understood. This opportunity comes very early in the game.\n- All crises tend to impair judgment and clear thinking.\nLife Cycle of a Crisis\nThe typical life cycle of a crisis begins with the event, quickly moves to investigative coverage, and eventually to blame-assignment, public reaction, reminders, and disinterest. Your objective is to get from the event to disinterest as quickly as possible. The longer that full and complete facts are not forthcoming, the longer the situation continues to be unresolved, the longer the crisis will be kept alive. The longer the crisis lives, the more damage that will be done.\nCrisis Management Team\nPermanent Basic Team:\nRector, Communications Director, Sr. Warden, and other staff or congregational leaders as needed.

Do not assume team members know their responsibilities. Make specific assignments. Prepare a list of duties and actions expected of each team member.\nMake sure every member of the team understands who is responsible for what. Establish a clear chain of command and an agreed-upon approval process for action and the dissemination of information. An example of roles and responsibilities could be:\n- Assembles the crisis management team and sets the plan in motion.\n- Assists in anticipating the intermediate and long-range impact of the crisis.\n- Provides final decisions based on input from the crisis management team.\n- May serve as spokesperson in some situations.\nThe Communications Director\n- Manages the organization’s message — is responsible for crafting a clear, concise, constructive and credible message.\n- Often the primary spokesperson to inform others of the crisis, including clergy, laity, the general public, the media, and others.\n- Relates to the media with input from the crisis management team, anticipates and meets the needs of the media.\n- Corrects inaccurate or misleading reporting immediately.\nThe Senior Warden\n- Keeps in touch with the family of victim(s) involved.\n- Manages logistics of the crisis — screens and logs calls.\n- Tracks schedules of all team members — knows how to reach them all at all times.\n- May serve as alternate spokesperson.\n- Provides input on liability and regulatory concerns.\n- Reviews all statements and news releases for legal implications.\n- Understands that a loss in the court of public opinion can be more devastating than a loss in a court of law. During a crisis, a legally correct decision may not be the best solution to the problem.\nCrisis Management Plan\nThe optimum time within which to respond to a crisis is 90 minutes. The longer you take to respond, the bigger the chance that public opinion will be swayed by others. Having a plan will enable you to respond quickly.\nA good plan is characterized by the following standards:\n- Openness, accessibility, availability and willingness to respond\n- Truthfulness and honesty without conditions\n- Responsiveness to all constituencies\n1: Objectives — clear statements that clarify your response strategies\n2: A list of possible crises including scenarios from all of the following categories:\n- Natural disasters\n- Criminal or legal action\n- Violent acts, demonstrations, death, or violent injuries\n- Personnel crises\n- Positive crises\n- Perceived crises\n3: Choice of spokesperson(s) and alternate(s)\n4: Staff assignments\n5: Outline of your decision-making process.\n6: Media guidelines and up-to-date phone numbers and emails.\n7: Prioritized list of various audiences to whom information must be disseminated.\n- Each list should include identified means of communicating with each list (office or home phone, email, Internet, 1-800 numbers, hotlines, home and office numbers).\n- Primary list with all contact information for persons who “need to know” immediately. This includes employees/staff, law enforcement. Others are key clergy and lay leaders, and those most directly impacted by the crisis.\n- Secondary list of those who need to be informed shortly following the initial event. This may include deans, priests, wardens, national church personnel, Episcopal News Service, etc.\n- Current Media Contacts, both print and broadcast, in regional and local media.\n- Other lists might include non-Episcopal clergy in the affected area, public officials (board of health, social services, fire, police, city, county and state emergency management agencies, insurance agents, etc.)\n8: Plans for computer backup and storage of files.\n9: Plans for informing and training staff about the crisis plan.\n10: Office space. Designate a strategy room for the media response team’s use.\n11: A Media room. If needed, how could you provide sufficient phone, fax, or computer capabilities? How might you provide the media work room? Press conference space?\n12: Outline a notification process for family and friends when there is loss of life or injury. Name the crisis team member(s) who will keep in touch with them.\n13: Media relations: Assess your current media relations. Do you need to know and make friends with current media personnel? Building a working, trusting relationship rarely occurs in the midst of a crisis.\n14: Practice: Your plan should include times when crises are simulated so that the plan can be practiced.\n15: Regular meeting: Team should meet to anticipate and discuss possible crises and how they might be avoided or minimized.\nThink like a Girl Scout: Be prepared for the next disaster, by Hanah Smith, August 2016\nHandling Media in a Crisis: http://www.ministrymatters.com/all/entry/3544/handling-media-in-a-crisis"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8c97e19e-3269-4dc4-82a6-bea8497cc12d>","<urn:uuid:51bf25dc-641a-415e-9908-ee30ab0dea0f>"],"error":null}

{"question":"As a hiking enthusiast interested in geothermal features, what are the distinctive characteristics of the Firehole River area, and what safety precautions should photographers take when capturing these features?","answer":"The Firehole River area features dramatic thermal features including the Firehole Falls, where water pours through an 800-foot canyon. The river runs through multiple thermal basins, including the Lower Geyser Basin with its popular Fountain Paint Pot pools of colorful, hot mud. When photographing these features, several safety precautions are essential: always stick to the boardwalks as the crust in geyser basins can be dangerously thin, and protect your camera equipment from geyser spray which contains silica and calcium carbonate that can form a hard-to-clean film on lenses. It's recommended to keep lens caps on until ready to shoot and regularly wipe lenses clean.","context":["In. the Northwest corner of Wyoming lies Yellowstone National Park, the oldest, largest and most popular National Park in the continental United States. Few places on earth offer so much scenic and scientific interest in one area. Yellowstone is in the heart of the Rockies, a land of pine-clad mountains and broad, grassy valleys. The countryside is laced with lakes and streams of exquisite beauty.\nThe popular West Entrance to Yellowstone parallels the winding Madison River, a route followed by the earliest pioneers into the park. It leads to the Grand Loop Road that will take you to all of the park’s major features.\nIn addition to superb mountain scenery, the park is one of the world’s principle wildlife preserves. Many visitors eagerly await the opportunity to photograph wildlife in its native environment. Yellowstone is a photographer’s paradise.\nTraveling south on the Grand Loop Road towards Old Faithful, a side road leads to Firehole River Cascades. Here water pours through an 800 foot canyon, climaxing at roaring Firehole Falls.\nThe Firehole River is our introduction to the most famous and certainly the most popular section in all of Yellowstone. Our route takes us through a series of thermal basins, beginning with the Lower Geyser Basin. The road brings us close to the popular Fountain Paint Pot, pools of colorful, hot mud that bubble and sputter like pudding boiling in a pan. The mud is a mixture of silica, clay and water.\nBubbles are formed by super-heated gases rising from magma and molten rock deep within the earth. A stroll around Fountain Paint Pots revels a variety of small geyser, pools and springs.\nMidway, Biscuit and Black Sand basins lie adjacent to each other with the Firehole River serving as a common boundary. Runoff from many of the geysers in these basins drains into the nearby river. Each year Excelsior Geyser alone pours an incredible 5 million gallons of scalding water into the river.\nAt Midway Basin, Grand Prismatic Spring is the most spectacular feature. From above, its splendid array of deep colors is stunningly visible. At 370 feet in diameter, it is believed to be the largest spring in Yellowstone. Clearly marked boardwalks and paved trails offer visitors a safe and exciting means of exploring the thermal features of Midway Basin.\nIn the Black Sand Geyser Basin, Cliff Geyser is interesting because it sits of the edge of Iron Spring Creek. Its eruptions can go as high as 50 feet.\nRainbow Pool is a large hot spring with an intensely blue center. The water at the pool’s edge is cooled sufficiently to permit the growth of algae, producing a rainbow of colors. Nearby Sunset lake vies with Rainbow Pool for beauty and iridescent color.\nTo many visitors, the Upper Basin, the Old Faithful area, is the heart and sole of Yellowstone Park. Unique Old Faithful Inn is one of America’s finest lodges. Today, its immense rustic lobby and huge stone fireplace yet posses the grandeur of earlier times.\nNo visit to Yellowstone is complete without witnessing one or more eruptions of Old Faithful Geyser. This iconic geyser is the most famous in the world and is one of America’s greatest natural wonders.There are geysers that erupt higher and for longer periods of time, but rarely is the tremendous power of nature so inseparably combined with Old Faithful’s innate beauty. This superb spectacle, once you’ve actually witnessed it in person, will stay in your memory forever.\nFor more detailed information about Yellowstone, visit our Intro To Yellowstone National Park pages. We also have a complete collection of Webcams, Maps, Videos, Photos, Geology, History, Wildlife, Geysers and much much more. Enjoy your visit.","Land on Fire\nYellowstone’s spectacular geothermal fireworks draw visitors from all over the world. Here’s where and when to see—and photograph—geysers blowing, hot springs bubbling, and the earth itself steaming beneath your feet.\nImages and tips by Jeff Vanuga\nTake care near this vibrant feature: The 42-foot-deep pool’s violent boiling can toss water 10 feet high.\nLocation: Upper Geyser Basin\nSee it: Stroll the boardwalk from Old Faithful to the Castle Group area.\nWhen to go: Summer, when higher temps promote bacterial growth that deepens the pool’s blue hue\nPro tip: Midday is usually the time to put away your camera for landscape photography, but this is the exception. Crested Pool is best when the sun is high and light filters deep into the water, creating this stunning luminescence.\nShot details: Canon EOS 5D Mark II camera, 24-105mm lens at 28mm, ISO 100, f/16, 1/100 second\nWest Thumb Geyser Basin\nThis small basin is too often overlooked, leaving its scenic hot springs, mud pots, and lakeshore geysers to in-the-know visitors.\nLocation: West side of Yellowstone Lake\nSee it: Walk the 3/8-mile boardwalk.\nWhen to go: Sunrise in summer and sunset in winter for the best light.\nPro tip: When shooting people, include wider perspectives like this one that provide a sense of place for your trip.\nShot details: Nikon D4 camera, 70-200mm lens at 200mm, ISO 220, f/5.6, 1/500 second\nGeyser Photography 101\nUse a tripod. Even the steadiest hands tremble on long exposures, yielding blurry images. Add a cable release (or use your camera’s timer function) for even crisper shots.\nGet up early. Not only is the light gorgeous and the wildlife more active early in the day, but sunrise is your best bet for shooting in the busy geyser basins without catching dozens of other visitors in your shot.\nShield your lenses. Geyser spray contains silica and calcium carbonate, which can build up on lenses in a hard-to-clean film. Be vigilant about wiping lenses and/or keep your lens cap on until you’re ready to shoot.\nSentinel Meadows – Steep Cone Geyser\nThe hot springs in this meadow deposit minerals in a ring as they boil, forming distinctive sinter rims.\nLocation: Lower Geyser Basin\nSee it: Hike 1.5 miles from the Sentinel Meadows trailhead on Fountain Flat Drive.\nWhen to go: June through fall for snow-free trails\nPro tip: When using a wide-angle lens, include something interesting in the foreground (like these bacterial mats) to add depth and dimension to your shot.\nShot details: Canon 1Ds camera, 17-35mm lens at 22mm, ISO 125, f/16, 1/60 second\nGrand Prismatic Spring & Excelsior Geyser\nGrand Prismatic measures 370 feet across, making it the world’s largest hot spring. Despite its name, adjacent Excelsior is considered more like a hot spring, too, as it last erupted in 1901.\nLocation: Midway Geyser Basin\nSee it: On the .5-mile loop trail off Grand Loop Road or from the 5-mile (round-trip) Fairy Falls Trail\nWhen to go: Summer for the brightest colors\nPro tip: This stunning perspective required a flight in a fixed-wing aircraft. Most visitors won’t be flying over the basin, but you can still get a higher view from the Fairy Falls Trail south of Midway.\nShot details: Canon EOS 7D camera, 18-200mm lens at 75mm, ISO 400, f/8, 1/600 second\nWhen to Use a Tripod\nAnytime you are shooting in low light, a tripod can help ensure crisp images. A good rule of thumb is to use a tripod when your shutter speed is lower than 1/60 of a second or when the shutter speed is slower than the focal length. For optimal results from your digital equipment, set your camera at a low ISO and a mid-range aperture of f/8 or f/11. As you’ll have to carry your tripod into the backcountry, invest in the lightest tripod you can afford (and that can support your camera with its heaviest lens). Even point-and-shoot users can benefit from a small tripod, like the flexible GorillaPod models (joby.com).\nGreat Fountain Geyser\nGreat Fountain shoots water 150 feet in the air (and superbursts up to 220 feet have been recorded) from its 16-foot-wide crater, making it one of Yellowstone’s most dramatic geysers. Check visitor centers for predicted eruption times (every 9 to 16 hours).\nLocation: Firehole Lake Drive near Lower Geyser Basin\nSee it: Pick up the 2-mile, one-way drive just south of Lower Geyser Basin.\nWhen to go: Firehole Lake Drive is typically open April through October.\nPro tip: Vary how you approach a subject. Generally, front-lit subjects are boring and lack depth, so change your position to include side or back lighting. Here, the setting sun backlights the geyser for much better color, depth, and illumination.\nShot details: Nikon D4 camera, 24-70mm lens at 48mm, ISO 160, f/16 + .33 exposure compensation, 1/100 seconds\nThis 160°F hot spring may look placid, but beware: The pool was named after a Belgian visitor slipped into it in 1929, suffering fatal burns. The crust in the geyser basins can be dangerously thin, so always stick to the boardwalks.\nLocation: Upper Geyser Basin\nSee it: Head for the Grand Group, north of the Castle Group, on the boardwalk.\nWhen to go: Late spring through fall for the best weather\nPro tip: Experiment with angles. In this shot, the camera was tilted about 20 degrees to create a more interesting diagonal line leading into the image. High-angle sun also intensifies the color.\nShot details: Nikon D4 camera, 24-70mm lens at 52mm, ISO 100, f/16, 1/60 second\nThis river got its name from early trappers in the area, who mistook the steam rising from the valley’s abundant geothermal features for campfire smoke. A major tributary to the Madison, both rivers beckon anglers with plentiful—if challenging to catch—brook, rainbow, and brown trout. Vanuga created this shot in the early morning, when the valley’s steam plumes are most visible.\nLocation: Yellowstone NP, WY\nSee It: Midway Geyser Basin bridge, Grand Prismatic Spring\nWhen to go: May through early July and September through October are best for fly-fishing.\nPro tip: A slow shutter speed lends the river and thermal streams a smooth look and enhances the movement of the scene.

{"question":"As an IT admin planning security improvements, what's best practice for network segregation in enterprise systems, and how does this relate to cloud security compliance requirements?","answer":"For network segregation best practices, you should create multiple layers of security, starting with a DMZ network that forces all external traffic through proxies before reaching core servers. Database and identity management servers should be segregated from other servers. This layered defense approach allows you to tighten firewall rules since only specific systems need access to particular servers. For cloud security compliance, organizations must maintain clear audit trails of data access, ensure customer data is encrypted or hashed, and keep development and live environments separate. Additionally, when using cloud services, you must ensure regulatory compliance as customers are responsible for their own security and data integrity. It's essential to choose ISO 27001 accredited providers and have clear contracts defining security responsibilities and penalties for security breaches.","context":["It is no surprise that security is at the forefront of everyone’s minds these days. With high profile breaches, to script kiddies wreaking havoc across the Internet, it is obvious that there are some weaknesses that need to be addressed.\nIn most cases, complete network redesigns are out of the question. This can be extremely invasive and costly. However, it may be possible to augment the existing network in such a manner as to add additional layers of security. It’s also possible that this may lead to the possibility of being able to make even more changes down the road.\nSo what do I mean by this? Allow me to explain…\nMany networks are fairly simple with only a few subnets, typically a user and a server subnet. Sometimes there’s a bit of complexity on the user side, creating subnets per department, or subnets per building. Often this has more to do with manageability of users rather than security. Regardless, it’s a good practice that can be used to make a network more secure in the long run.\nWhat is often neglected is the server side of things. Typically, there are one, maybe two subnets. Outside users are granted access to the standard web ports. Sometimes more ports such as ssh and ftp are opened for a variety of reasons. What administrators don’t realize, or don’t intend is that they’re allowing outsiders direct access to their core servers, without any sort of security in front of it. Sure, sure, there might be a firewall, but a firewall is there to ensure you only come in on the proper ports, right? If your traffic is destined for port 80, it doesn’t matter if it’s malicious or not, the firewall lets it through anyway.\nBut what’s the alternative? What can be done instead? Well, what about sending outside traffic to a separate network where the systems being accessed are less critical, and designed to verify traffic before passing it on to your core servers? What I’m talking about is creating a DMZ network and forcing all users through a proxy. Even a simple proxy can help to prevent many attacks by merely dropping illegal traffic and not letting it through to the core server. Proxies can also be heavily fortified with HIDS and other security software designed to look for suspicious traffic and block it.\nBy adding in this DMZ layer, you’ve put a barrier between your server core and the outside world. This is known as layered defense. You can add additional layers as time and resources allow. For instance, I recommend segmenting away database servers as well as identity management servers. Adding this additional segmentation can be done over time as new servers come online and old servers are retired. The end goal is to add this additional security without disrupting the network as a whole.\nIf you have the luxury of building a new network from the ground up, however, make sure you build this in from the start. There is, of course, a breaking point. It makes sense to create networks to segregate servers by security level, but it doesn’t make sense to segregate purely to segregate. For instance, you may segregate database and identity management servers away from the rest of the servers, but segregating Oracle servers away from MySQL servers may not add much additional security. There are exceptions, but I suggest you think long and hard before you make such an exception. Are you sure that the additional management overhead is worth the security? There’s always a cost/benefit analysis to perform.\nSegregating networks is just the beginning. The purpose here is to enhance security. By segregating networks, you can significantly reduce the number of clients that need to access a particular server. The whole world may need to access your proxy servers, but only your proxy servers need to access the actual web application servers. Likewise, only your web application servers need access to your database servers. Using this information, you can tighten down your firewall. But remember, a firewall is just a wall with holes in it. The purpose is to deflect random attacks, but it does little to nothing to prevent attacks on ports you’ve opened. For that, there are other tools.\nAt the very edge, simplistic fire walling and generally loose HIDS can be used to deflect most attacks. As you move further within the network, additional security can be used. For instance, deploying an IPS at the very edge of the network can result in the IPS being quickly overwhelmed. Of course, you can buy a bigger, better IPS, but to what end? Instead, you can move the IPS further into the network, placing it where it be more effective. If you place it between the proxy and the web server, you’ve already ensured that the only traffic hitting the IPS is loosely validated HTTP traffic. With this knowledge, you can reduce the number of signatures the IPS needs to have, concentrating on high quality HTTP signatures. Likewise, an IPS between the web servers and database servers can be configured with high quality database signatures. You can, in general, direct the IPS to block any and all traffic that falls outside of those parameters.\nAs the adage goes, there is no silver bullet for security. Instead, you need to use every weapon in your arsenal and put together a solid defense. By combining all of these techniques together, you can defend against many attacks. But remember, there’s always a way in. You will not be able to stop the most determined attacker, you can only hope to slow him down enough to limit his access. And remember, securing your network is only one aspect of security. Don’t forget about the other low hanging fruit such as SQL injection, cross site scripting, and other common application holes. You may have the most secure network in existence, but a simple SQL injection attack can result in a massive data breach.","Common examples of cloud computing include:\n- Software-as-a-service (SaaS) is cloud computing where the software you would normally install on office computers is instead delivered via the internet. It is also commonly known as ‘hosted software’ or ‘hosted applications’.\n- Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud computing is where you rent space in a datacentre and use their servers rather than buying new hardware to run your business. A common example of IaaS is website hosting.\n- Any type of online data storage or backup uses the cloud to do so.\nAs well as delivering management and sometimes cost benefits, the cloud also facilitates flexible working practices such as home and other off-site working.\nWhatever tasks or applications you use the cloud for, it is vital to protect your own and any customer data that resides there. Analyst firm Gartner has identified seven perceived risks of cloud computing:\n- Privileged user access\nKeeping sensitive information with a third party has inherent risks because you are bypassing your company’s own IT infrastructure and support team.\n- Regulatory compliance\nCustomers are responsible for their own security and data integrity.\n- Data location\nYou do not know where the information is physically being stored; it could be anywhere in the world.\n- Data segregation\nYour data is stored alongside other people’s data and an encryption failure could make your data completely unusable.\nWhat happens in a disaster? Is the data being replicated?\n- Investigative support\nInappropriate or illegal activity might be hard or impossible to investigate.\n- Long-term viability\nWhat happens if your provider is bought out or bankrupted?\nYou can either choose to host applications and infrastructure selectively in the cloud, or opt for a provider who provides a total cloud offering.\nChoosing a cloud provider\nResearch the cloud provider market thoroughly and use only experienced, well-resourced companies who have an excellent reputation and preferably, come recommended. They must be able to help you as your needs change and your organisation grows, understand your business model and demands and be able to communicate with you in a way you understand. The provider should be ISO 27001 accredited, which will ensure that your data is hosted in an environment that meets international baseline information security management standards of confidentiality, integrity and availability.\nProtecting your presence in the cloud\nApart from making a wise informed choice of cloud provider, you should observe the following precautions to maintain data safety, integrity and availability:\n- Limit access to the cloud servers to those who need it. Maintain a clear audit trail of who has access to what data and when, and a record of who has access to encryption keys (if used). Change encryption keys if employees leave the business.\n- Ensure that any customer data stored in the cloud is either encrypted or hashed in such a way to make it unusable to unauthorised users. Many large and small organisations have faced legal action for failing to adequately protect data when their cloud based services were hacked.\n- Keep development and live environments separate to make direct access from development servers to live data impossible.\nCloud hosting contracts\nYou should have a cloud hosting contract that clearly defines:\n- What exactly your provider will do for you (and what they expect you to do for yourself).\n- A schedule for any project work that will be undertaken (such as how long will it take to install a new server).\n- A service level agreement – how quickly and to what level they will respond to and fix problems.\n- A clear fee structure.\n- Penalties in the event of a lapse / shortfall in service or a security breach."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c95eeed0-9314-4f6b-bfd2-64ccc32d2cb6>","<urn:uuid:ab9e39b2-9e3c-4d15-b492-e702944569d1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you compare the health risks for dental hygienists and computer workers in terms of shoulder injuries and ergonomic concerns?","answer":"Dental hygienists face greater risks for shoulder disorders compared to computer workers. They spend 11% more of their workday with arms elevated above 30 degrees and 5% more time above 60 degrees than computer workers. This increased arm elevation exposure may contribute to their higher injury rates, with 11-68% of dental hygienists experiencing shoulder pain. While computer workers have lower shoulder injury risks, they still face ergonomic concerns - repetitive motion injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome can occur with improper positioning, and research shows prolonged sitting can be detrimental to overall health.","context":["Workday arm elevation exposure, a comparison between two professions.\nEttinger-L; Kincl-L; Karduna-A\nProceedings of the 35th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Biomechanics, August 10 - 13, 2011, Long Beach, California. Newark, DE: American Society of Biomechanics, 2011 Aug; :121\nINTRODUCTION: Occupations that require repetitive arm motions above 60 degrees and 90 degrees of humeral elevation have been attributed as being potentially injurious professions for the shoulder. 11% - 68% of currently working dental hygienists have shoulder related pain and or dysfunction. Unlike dental hygienists, workers who use computers for the majority of their workday do not share the same risk factors for occupational musculoskeletal injuries of the shoulder. It is hypothesized that because dental hygienists have a greater tendency for shoulder disorders that they will spend a greater percentage of their workday at elevated humeral angles than computer based workers. METHODS: Twenty female dental hygienists with an average age of 42.6 years (24-56 years) and nineteen female computer workers with an average age of 42.6 years (26-62 years) participated in our study. Computer workers were recruited to match the dental hygienist population as closely as possible for age, arm dominance, number of years employed and total number of hours worked per week. All data were collected on an eight hour workday for both dental hygienists and computer workers (8.8 hours, 8.1 hours, respectively). Before the start of the workday subjects were fit with two tri-axial accelerometers (Virtual Corset) bilaterally at the level of the deltoid tuberosity of the humerus. Virtual Corset data were recorded at 7.6 Hz until the device was removed at the end of the workday. Data were converted from linear accelerations to arm elevation angles using a previously validated equation. The total amount of time participants spent with their arm elevated above 30 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees was summed and then averaged as a percentage of total working hours - this measure is treated as the quantitative dependant variable. Independent samples t-tests were used to quantify differences between total arm usage above 30 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees for dental hygienists and computer workers. Percent of workday with arm elevated above 30 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees for dental hygienists and computer workers. Significant differences where p<.05. RESULTS: On average dental hygienists worked with their arms above 30 degrees for 11% of their workday more than computer workers (p<.001) and above 60 degrees for 5% of their workday more than computer workers (p<.001). No significant differences between groups existed above 90 degrees (p=.07). DISCUSSION: Occupational risk factors for shoulder disorders have been attributed to awkward and constrained posture, the intensity and duration of force loads on the shoulder and the repetitious nature of the work being performed. Svendsen et al., composed a cross-sectional analysis comparing arm usage in different overhead professions such as painters, machinists and car machinists. From that study it was identified that the greater duration of working hours with the arm elevated above 60 degrees and 90 degrees yields a stronger correlation with shoulder injuries. The results of our study support our hypothesis that dental hygienists spend a significantly greater percentage of their workday with their arm elevated above 30 degrees and 60 degrees when compared to computer workers. Trends in the literature regarding both dental hygienists and computer workers suggest that dental hygienists have a greater tendency for shoulder disorders than computer workers. Our results may help to explain, at least in part, why dental hygienists may be at greater risk for developing shoulder injuries than other occupations. There could be other occupational factors that could be contributing to the differences in injury rates between these two populations. Dental hygienists did not significantly differ from computer workers above 90 degrees of humeral elevation. Findings from this study suggests that chronic exposure to humeral elevations angles below 60 degrees may be sufficient to increase the risk of occupational shoulder injuries.\nInjuries; Musculoskeletal-system; Musculoskeletal-system-disorders; Extremities; Arm-injuries; Dentistry; Exposure-levels; Risk-factors; Computers; Computer-equipment; Humans; Women; Age-groups; Dentists\nProceedings of the 35th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Biomechanics, August 10 - 13, 2011, Long Beach, California\nUniversity of Oregon","Computers can perform repetitive tasks faster and with fewer mistakes than humans, so the first few years of computers being used in the business world were concentrated on automating a wide range of industrial processes.\nThe statistics speak for themselves: Worker productivity in the United States had been increasing at an annual rate of 1 percent to 1.5 percent since the early 1970s, but the productivity rate started to increase dramatically in the mid-1990s, and averaged 2.9 percent from 1995 to 2000. Many economists, noted that this rise in productivity occurred during the same period when computers became common in workplaces, and credit computer-related information technology for the increase.\nWhy Ergonomics Matters\nErgonomics is a science that helps align products to users and jobs to workers. The word ergonomics comes from a combination of two Greek words: ergon, which means “work,” and nomos, which means “natural laws.” Sometimes ergonomics can be referred to as human engineering, biotechnology, or human factors.\nNot only does ergonomics cover items that improve working conditions, it also includes how the products you use in your daily life are designed. But ergonomics can refer not only to the way objects are designed, but also the way they are arranged for optimum use.\nIt’s easy to look at ergonomics as an expense rather than an investment. But think about it this way: many people choose a car for its safety features, believing those features are worth the cost of protecting themselves and their families. Businesses who purchase ergonomic products for their employees demonstrate their commitment to their health and well-being. More and more organizations are beginning to realize the importance of helping their people prevent injuries that can be more costly down the line, when weighed against the costs for sick time, short- or long-term disability, and insurance premiums.\nOne of the most important employee perks is workplace ergonomics, which fosters a safety and health culture as a core value. People recognize the value of walking into a safe workplace; with the knowledge that their employer wants to keep their team healthy, employees are likely to be happier at work. Reducing ergonomic problems leads to fewer sick days, fewer injuries, and can reduce long-term, cumulative issues that can shorten a worker’s career. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons says office workers can help prevent back pain by standing at least once every hour to move around—at least stretch, if not walk around a little.\nErgonomics and Computer Workstations\nA lot of early ergonomics research was directed toward industrial professions. For example, the risks of musculoskeletal disorders for someone who operates a jackhammer may be high, that doesn’t negate the risk for office workers; however, risks to office workers wasn’t immediately recognized. In more recent years, experts have learned that ergonomic products are important in all types of workplaces.\nRepetitive motion injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome can occur when workers are improperly positioned or uncomfortable while working. Musculoskeletal problems can occur in workers in all industries, from the assembly line to the office. And the latest research demonstrates that too much sitting can be detrimental to your overall health.\nMore and more companies are creating ergonomic products for the workplace, like electric adjustable desks and under-desk keyboard trays. These products can help you work more comfortably, which translates into working more safely. Improving your workstation’s ergonomics can help you improve your posture, which in turn helps reduce fatigue, stiffness, and soreness.\nWhether you want to modernize your home office or your workplace, ergonomic products are the way to go—especially electric height adjustable computer workstations. These desks not only have the latest features, they’re ergonomically friendly and will blend perfectly with your modern design."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a4ba16f6-e20a-4b65-851a-44f86592a158>","<urn:uuid:102397f4-0955-41cb-80e5-b678cb44e4a1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As an environmental planner looking at port sustainability, could you outline the key challenges and opportunities in transitioning port operations to zero emissions?","answer":"The transition to zero emissions in goods movement is a priority that faces several challenges and opportunities. The main challenge is time pressure, as environmental issues are pressing and stakeholders desire faster progress. The transition requires significant technological innovation, as much of the needed equipment is still in development or not yet on the market. It will also require many millions of dollars in investments for new equipment and infrastructure. However, there are opportunities through alignment with state objectives to access grants and incentives from the state, air quality district, and potentially federal government. The Port is currently in a phase of identifying specific operations and equipment types that can work within their terminals, working with tenants on deployment, and anticipating new generations of equipment becoming available in the next 3-4 years.","context":["An interview with Richard Sinkoff, Director of Environmental Programs and Planning, Port of Oakland, on the value of working with stakeholders to achieve a healthier environment.\nAt 91 years old, the Port of Oakland (Port) is not slowing down. The Port manages a 1,300-acre seaport, 2,400-acre airport, and 850 acres of commercial real estate holdings, the majority of which consists of open space, habitat areas, and public parks. The Port’s economic impact is significant―supporting 73,000 jobs in Northern California.\nThis economic activity can affect air quality for one of the Port’s closest neighbors, the community of West Oakland. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has selected West Oakland to be one of the first participants in its Community Health Protection Program. Launched through the passage of Assembly Bill 617 (AB 617), the Community Health Protection Act is a community-driven approach “to reduce exposure in communities most impacted by air pollution.\nESA’s Chris Easter and Breanna Sewell interviewed Richard Sinkoff, Port of Oakland Director of Environmental Programs and Planning, to find out how the Port engages with its neighbors, addresses air quality concerns, and promotes a healthier environment.\nESA: We see the State of California as leading the way on environmental protection, particularly with Assembly Bill 617 (AB 617). How do you see AB 617 and the Seaport Air Quality Plan?\nRS: The foundation of the Port of Oakland’s air quality strategy for the Seaport is the Maritime Air Quality Improvement Plan (MAQIP), which the Oakland Board of Port Commissioners adopted in April 2009. Since then, the Port and its regulatory and business partners have made tremendous progress to reduce diesel particulate matter from seaport activities. The 2017 Seaport Emissions Inventory calculated an 81 percent reduction in diesel particulate matter (DPM) from Port maritime sources—the level that the State of California projected from regulatory compliance. The Port’s goal is an 85 percent reduction in DPM by 2020. This means that reducing DPM emissions an additional 4 percent will depend on identifying additional emissions reduction measures that go “above and beyond” compliance.\nConcurrently, the Port is focused on new regulatory and public policy air quality concerns: climate change and local exposure. Reducing localized exposure to toxic air contaminants is the focus of AB 617. Abatement of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is the focus of the State’s Sustainable Freight Action Plan and the governor’s executive orders.\nFor the Port’s ongoing air quality planning work, we are indeed writing a new chapter with our community and our regulatory and business stakeholders. While maintaining our keen focus on regional ambient air quality, we are also focused on local exposure and GHG emissions. Our air quality planning for the Seaport is synthesizing the existing MAQIP DPM reduction programs with new programs to reduce local exposure and GHG emissions.\nESA: How do you feel about the AB 617 rollout to date by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) and CARB?>RS: Well, I think the designation of West Oakland and Richmond as the first communities to do their community-based clean air plan is very exciting. It takes air quality planning to the neighborhood level. By this I mean that we can work to improve ambient air quality and still have, at a local level, “hot spots” and related elevated health risk. So, the fact that the State has selected West Oakland as one of the first communities to do the community-level air action plan is very encouraging.\nESA: Are there any other plans or previous studies, perhaps a master plan, which will help the Port extend those gains and help meet carbon and energy-efficiency side targets?\nRS: Our planning approach at the Port is to align ourselves with State policy and the State regulatory process. We collaborate with the State, the BAAQMD, and our local community toward consistent goals. Better outcomes result from alignment on goals. When it comes to master planning, we’re very aware of the governor’s executive orders on GHG reductions, both the 2030 goal and the 2050 goal. In 2030—―which is not that far away…\nESA: It used to seem a long way away, but you’re right. It isn’t.\nRS: It’s just around the corner. The governor has established the goal of reducing GHG emissions statewide by 40 percent below the 1990 levels by 2030. The 2050 goal is to reduce GHGs by 80 percent below the 1990 levels. These goals provide a framework for the Port’s air quality planning efforts, particularly because we know that design and implementation of emissions reduction projects can take time.\nRight now, the vision for the Port’s new Seaport Air Quality Plan is “The Pathway to Zero Emissions.” The approach is for the Port to establish a planning framework to transition from our carbon-based goods movement to, as much as we can, a zero-emissions “at the tailpipe” operation. We understand that this transformation will require many millions of dollars of investments in equipment and new infrastructure. The Port wishes to align as much as possible with the State’s objectives so that we can—we as the Port and/or our partners—―access available grants and incentives from the State, air quality district, and perhaps from the federal government.\nESA: What are you most excited about in terms of opportunities with State Bill 32 (SB 32) and all the other things that are happening?\nRS: I’m very excited about the future. The transition to zero emissions of goods movement is an absolute priority. There’s a lot of dynamism right now in this space because it’s going to rely upon technological innovation. It’s going to rely upon funding innovation. It’s going to rely upon planning innovation. It is going to rely upon external funding and grants.\nWhereas past planning and program development were focused on existing equipment, now we’re moving into a new chapter where a lot of the equipment that we’re going to use has not yet come out on the market.We’re in a phase where we’re identifying specific operations and types of equipment that can work within our terminals and we are working with our tenants to get those deployed. In three to four years, we anticipate that another generation of equipment is going to be available. For anyone who’s interested in the nexus between innovation and environmental stewardship, this is a very exciting time.\nESA: We couldn’t agree with you more. We would be remiss if we didn’t ask you: what about challenges?\nRS: I think the biggest challenge we’re facing is time, because so many of the environmental issues are so pressing and we all want to get to the outcomes. The Camp Fire, and recent wildfire disasters like it, just brings home in a very dramatic way that this isn’t so theoretical. When air quality is degraded so much from catastrophic California wildfires, you can argue about the source of the problem but you can’t really argue about the impact. I think there’s a desire on everyone’s part—stakeholders, business entities—to move faster. There is, at times, impatience that we haven’t solved the problem. If certain types of equipment in development are not far enough along to be effective or readily available, as customers would want, it might be perceived as a delay.\nESA: What about traffic? As activity increases here at the Port, do you see that becoming a bottleneck in terms of achieving your goals and plans? Has it been historically a challenge for you?\nRS: In terms of equipment, the trucks that haul cargoare the largest source category at the Port. Within our secure truck enrollment plan—the Secure Truck Enrollment Program (STEP)—we have close to 9,000 trucks registered. Somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 trucks on average come to the Port of Oakland each day to move cargo.\nNo one is denying that truck traffic generated by the Port is a major activity. Truck management has been a part of our operations for decades. It seems, in my experience, that every decade, every chapter, has a different focus. Right now, the focus for Port and City planners is to reduce the impacts of truck circulation in the local neighborhood. According to the 2017 emissions inventory, Port truck emissions are down by 98 percent. This is the result of cleaner engines and fuels and built-in particulate filters—technologies that have created a clean truck fleet.\nESA: The West Oakland community has been very engaged with the Port on air quality. Many organizations have been involved in the process. What are some ways you are engaging with the community to meet the AB 617 requirements?\nRS: The AB 617 planning process is community-driven and BAAQMD-led, so the Port is a member of the steering committee and a stakeholder.\nFor the Oakland Seaport air quality plans—both the MAQIP and the current 2020 and Beyond Plan—we have stakeholder engagement processes. We’re continuing with the same framework of a co-chairs–led process. The West Oakland community sits as one of the co-chairs of the 2020 and Beyond Task Force through representatives from the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project.\nI would say through working together for nearly two decades, West Oakland and the Port have built a very productive working relationship. The West Oakland community is a partner and has been an important resource for community-based science. The tremendous value that the community provides are data from different community-based data collection and data analysis efforts. We’re trying to integrate the findings of these studies into our planning process as much as we possibly can.\nWest Oakland and the Port form a unique place in the Bay Area. We are neighbors. We have a long history of connection, because West Oakland and the Port evolved together. Some people have this idea that the Port was established in West Oakland, but that’s not how this unique place developed. Historically, the neighborhood grew to serve industries and activities on the Oakland waterfront. There were jobs on the waterfront—some very good-paying jobs related to moving cargo via ships and railroads. People were attracted to West Oakland also because of its proximity to the water and to the ferry and transportation systems.\nThis is our neighborhood. The challenge is always to sustain the relationship, to keep in touch. We try to make sure that it’s an ongoing relationship and that we’re not just meeting with the community when we have a need or a problem, but that we’re in touch through different forums all the time to promote joint problem-solving.\nESA: We’re interested to hear your vision—as a thought leader here at the Port and regionally—for the next 10 to 20 years for the Port and surrounding community.\nRS: I am confident that the Port will continue to take its role as a steward of the environment very seriously. When the Port speaks of the “environment,” we mean both the natural resources—air, water, and land primarily—and the “human environment”—the place where we work, conduct business, go to school, play, and raise families. We’re aware of the ongoing pressures on the Port of Oakland to perform at a very high level. We’ve recently hired a new generation of planners and scientists on our team. When I started my work at the Port of Oakland in the 1990s, some considered environmental compliance to be an ancillary concern that one dealt with after all the important business decisions were made.\nThe paradigm has shifted so fundamentally that we sometimes forget where we started. Today, our engineers, planners, marketing professionals, leadership, and board members embrace sustainability. They appreciate the importance of integrating the Port’s role as a regional economic driver with a profound commitment to social equity and environmental compliance.\nI’m very optimistic when I talk to our newest colleagues.

{"question":"I'm fascinated by protected lands - how do these two parks compare in terms of their geographical features?","answer":"Corbett National Park features diverse landscapes due to its location between the Himalayas and the terai, including wet and dry areas, plains and mountains, forests and grasslands. It has the Ramganga River flowing through it with a reservoir of about 80 sq km. On the other hand, Yellowstone National Park spans across Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, featuring many geothermal features, most famously the Old Faithful Geyser. Yellowstone has various ecosystems, with subalpine forest being the dominant one.","context":["Corbett National Park is the oldest national park of Asia established in 1936 and India’s one of the first tiger reserves declared in 1973. It is named after Jim Edward Corbett, a hunter turned conservationist.\nBlessed with a wide variety of landscapes due to its geographical location between the Himalayas and the terai, which provide varied habitats such as wet and dry, plain and mountainous, gentle and rugged, forests and grasslands, it supports diverse ecosystems. Ramganga River flowing through the jungle is the largest of the precious few perennial sources of water in the park and provides the most picturesque views. A dam on Ramganga at Kalagarh forms a reservoir of about 80 sq. km, the backwaters of which reach till Dhikala.It is truly recognized as the “Jewel of the Crown”.\nOwning to its unique location, bird population is quite high throughout the year with winter visitors, summer visitors, altitudinal migrants, passage migrants and local migrants.\nFlora & Fauna\nThe main attractions of Corbett National Park are the Asiatic wild elephants, tigers and the wide variety of birds found here. Other commonly seen wildlife includes leopard, sambar deer, spotted deer, hog dear, barking deer, jackal, langur monkey, rhesus macaque, wild boars, peacock etc.Various aquatic species such as mahseer, crocodile, gharial, turtles etc are also found here.\nCorbett’s rivers attract specialist birds of prey such as Pallas’ fish eagle and the rare tawny fish-owl. Other water dependent birds like kingfishers, cormorants, storks, terns, shanks, sandpipers, dippers, forktails etc. also frequent the park’s rivers. During winters many long-distance migrant birds throng the Ramganga Reservoir. These are mainly storks, herons, sandpipers, plovers, waterfowl (ducks and geese) and ospreys.\nDistinct variation in flora is clearly visible in the park. The lower areas consist of sal and associated forests while as you go higher you encounter progressive belts of mixed forests, chir pine, oak and rhododendron, khair (Acacia catechu) and shisham or sissoo (Dalbergiasissoo) trees which grow on sandy, gravelly areas all along the Ramganga and streams and chaur (local name for extensive savannah grasslands) which is the most unique vegetation of Corbett National Park. More than 600 species of trees, shrubs, herbs, bamboos, grasses, climbers and ferns have been identified in the Park.\nWinter (Nov – Feb)\n(Max. 25°C – 30°C Min 4°C-8°C)\nClear sky with comforting sunshine, good for wildlife viewing between November and December. In January one may see frost on the meadows.While the days are pleasant, nights are fairly cold.\nSpring (Mid Feb to April)\n(Max. 35°C-40°C Min 9°C-13°C)\nClear weather with excellent visibility and moderate day temperatures.\nSummer (May – June)\n(Max. 44°C-46°C Min 19°C-22°C)\nHot in the afternoons. Mornings and evenings are pleasant. Long daylight hours facilitate longer wildlife viewing time.\nMonsoons (Mid June- October)\nThe weather becomes quite pleasant with the drop in temperature. The park is closed for the tourists during the rainy season, However, the Jhirna (gate) region of the park is open throughout the year and tourist can visit and enjoy rainy season with wildlife safari.The main reason for closure of the park during the rest of the year is that during the monsoons most of the roads get washed away. Repair work starts after the rains end and it is only by November that roads are back in motorable condition.During monsoons, the humidity soars up to 98 percent, making the weather very sultry.\nIdeal time to observe Wildlife and Photography\nWinter (November – March): Days are clear and pleasant, Nights get cold. Great time for bird-watching and tiger sighting.\nSummer (April – June): Hot days with pleasant nights. Ideal time for animal sightings, especially elephants and tigers.\nMonsoon (July – September): Humid days and nights. Most areas of the park are closed during this time. Good time for walks and trekking. Because of less crowd and rush, good probability of animal sightings. Good for observing flora.","Yellowstone National Park(noun)\nthe first national park in the United States; located in the border area between Wyoming and Montana and Idaho; spectacular wilderness; famous for Old Faithful geyser and for buffalo and bears\nYellowstone National Park\nYellowstone National Park is a national park located primarily in the U.S. state of Wyoming, although it also extends into Montana and Idaho. It was established by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872. Yellowstone, widely held to be the first national park in the world, is known for its wildlife and its many geothermal features, especially Old Faithful Geyser, one of the most popular features in the park. It has many types of ecosystems, but the subalpine forest is dominant. Native Americans have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years. The region was bypassed during the Lewis and Clark Expedition in the early 19th century. Aside from visits by mountain men during the early-to-mid-19th century, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. The U.S. Army was commissioned to oversee the park just after its establishment. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the National Park Service, which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than 1,000 archaeological sites.²\nThe Nuttall Encyclopedia\nYellowstone National Park\na high-lying tract of land in the State of Wyoming (q. v.) traversed by the Yellowstone, about the size of Kent, being a square about 75 m. in diameter; is set apart by Congress as a great pleasure ground in perpetuity for the enjoyment of the people; it abounds in springs and geysers, and care is taken that it be preserved for the public benefit, to the exclusion of all private right or liberty.\nyellowstone national park\nQuotes by yellowstone national park -- Explore a large variety of famous quotes made by yellowstone national park on the Quotes.net website.\nThe numerical value of yellowstone national park in Chaldean Numerology is: 8\nThe numerical value of yellowstone national park in Pythagorean Numerology is: 9\nSample Sentences & Example Usage\nWe still have a bunch of trips scheduled for the next few weeks, so we’re either going to have to cancel or take clients up to Yellowstone National Park and do what we can, we rely on this part of the year to provide the money to keep us going through the winter.\nAs managers of Yellowstone National Park, we balance the preservation of park resources with public safety, our decision takes into account the facts of the case, the goals of the bear management program and the long-term viability of the grizzly bear population as a whole, rather than an individual bear.\nAs managers of Yellowstone National Park, we balance the preservation of park resources with public safety, our decision takes into account the facts of the case, the goals of the bear management program, and the long-term viability of the grizzly bear population as a whole, rather than an individual bear.\nImages & Illustrations of yellowstone national park\nFind a translation for the yellowstone national park definition in other languages:\nSelect another language:\nDiscuss these yellowstone national park definitions with the community:\nWord of the Day\nWould you like us to send you a FREE new word definition delivered to your inbox daily?\nUse the citation below to add this definition to your bibliography:\n\"yellowstone national park.\" Definitions.net.

{"question":"What are the essential growing conditions for tea plants, and how do green building practices support agricultural sustainability?","answer":"Tea plants require specific growing conditions including deep, airy soil rich in minerals, optimal temperatures between 18-20 degrees Celsius, and appropriate humidity levels. The plants are sensitive to cold, dryness, and lighting conditions, with high humidity impairing tea quality while periods of dryness can enhance it. Growing at high altitudes increases tea quality but reduces crop yield. Green building practices support agricultural sustainability through multiple mechanisms: they help protect biodiversity and ecosystems, improve air and water quality, protect against soil erosion, and improve land quality. Additionally, green infrastructure creates ecological corridors and improves landscape permeability, while contributing to disaster prevention and strengthening ecosystem resilience, all of which support sustainable agriculture.","context":["What is the origin of tea, and does the climate crisis threaten its production?\nTea – the ancient beverage comes in different flavors and colors. The Queen of England will never go without her afternoon tea, in India it’s enjoyed with milk and spices and we all like to pour ourselves an occasional cup of Earl Grey, especially when winter comes knocking. But have you ever wondered whether the saying « all the tea in China » really does indicate where tea drinking started? Or if the soothing drink may be affected by the climate crisis? Should we, in fact, be drinking it? We have, and our researchers explained, surprised us and busted some myths in the process.\nWhen the Chinese Mystics Met the Tea Plant\nWe’re not going to keep you in suspense: It turns out that the coveted drink was sipped by the Indian Buddhist monks two thousand years ago – long before it became an integral part of Chinese culture and a long, long time before it became popular in Western cultures.\n“The tea plant was known in China as early as the first centuries BCE, but recent studies show that the custom of drinking tea was brought to China from India,” explains Prof. Meir Shahar from The Department of East Asian Studies of The Lester and Sally Entin Faculty of Humanities at Tel Aviv University, who researches, among other things, the influence of Indian culture on Chinese religion and literature.\n“In the first centuries CE Buddhism came to China from India and the Buddhist monks, who wanted to stay awake during the meditation, used to drink tea. The Chinese monks would observe this, and went on to adopt the custom as well, which then continued to spread to the rest of the Chinese population.”\nWhile tea originates from India, the origin of the word ‘tea’ in most of the world’s languages, however, is Chinese. “In northern China it is called cha, hence the Russian chai, and in southern China it is pronounced as tcha, which is the origin of the English word tea,” reveals Prof. Shahar.\nBuddhist monks on their tea break\nWhat’s in Your Cuppa?\nBuddhist monks realized long ago that tea keeps them awake and today, thanks to science, we are able to explain how the active ingredients of the plant affect us.\n“Contrary to many people’s beliefs, all types of tea are produced from the same plant, namely the leaves and buds of the Camellia Sinensis plant. While there are several varieties of the plant, the types of tea that we are familiar with – white, green, oolong and black – differ according to the part of the plant from which they are produced and the way they’re processed. Green tea, for example, contains less caffeine than black tea. The leaves used to produce green tea undergo a minimal drying process while the leaves intended for black tea undergo drying and fermentation,” explains Guy Shalmon, a sports nutritionist and exercise physiologist at the Sylvan Adams Sports Institute.\n« Tea leaves contain substances known as flavonoids. Their composition, however, varies from one tea to another. For example, green tea has a higher concentration of a substance called epigallocatechin 3-gallate, known for short as ‘EGCG’, than black tea which undergoes a prolonged processing process. It has antioxidant activity and is attributed various health effects, » says Guy.\n“Having said that, tea may reduce the absorption of iron-derived iron minerals. The polyphenols (compounds with antioxidant properties), which exist in tea leaves, may bind inorganic iron mineral before it is excreted in the feces. In order to prevent this, one does not need to give up drinking tea, but instead make sure not to drink it while consuming iron-rich plant foods, » he advises.\nWill Tea Survive the Climate Crisis?\nThe climate crisis brings with it many changes and different regions of the world are experiencing major climate fluctuations, ranging from heat and droughts to floods, storms and extreme cold. This could threaten the continued survival of agricultural crops. Some plants have crossed oceans and been absorbed by other continents, but what about those that require special conditions to thrive? Will the tea plant survive the changing conditions?\n« A plant can adapt to new conditions up to a certain limit, » says Prof. Shaul Yalovsky of the School of Plant Sciences and Food Security at The George S. Wise Faculty of Life Sciences, who studies plant development mechanisms and their response to environmental stresses. His lab has succeeded in developing tomato varieties that consume less water and still deliver the same amounts of fruit while maintaining its quality.\n« Tea is a crop that grows in very rainy areas. Therefore, it is not cultivated in an area like Israel, for example. Tea plantations are usually located on hills, where the weather is humid and cool to the appropriate extent and the soil is deep enough. »\nThe tea fields stretching over hills and mountains. Tea harvest in action\nDid you know that red « tea » (also known as « red bush tea ») is actually an infusion from the Rooibos plant that grows in South Africa? Because it is processed in the same way as the tea plant, it is commonly referred to as « red tea », while in reality it is not a tea, but an herbal infusion. It is naturally caffeine-free.\nJust like many other plants, tea requires specific conditions to grow: deep and airy soil rich in minerals, and an optimal temperature range between 18 and 20 degrees Celsius. « Tea is sensitive to cold, dryness, humidity and lighting conditions. For example, high humidity impairs the quality of the tea while periods of dryness increase its quality, and growing at high altitudes increases the quality of the tea but lowers the amount of crop, » explains Prof. Yalovsky.\nThe tea is grown in Asia, Africa and South America. The six largest tea producers in the world are China, India, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Turkey. So what happens if growing conditions in East and Southeast Asia change? Prof. Yalovsky explains that it is necessary to adapt the types of tea plants according to their growing areas. « What works at one location does not necessarily work elsewhere: what grows well in East and Southeast Asia will not necessarily grow well in Kenya or Turkey, for example. Even if we should manage to copy a crop from one place to another, we may not succeed in maintaining its qualities and taste. »\nWhen we drink Earl Grey tea we expect a very specific taste, and if the same tree were to be grown elsewhere – where the temperature may be the same as the original habitat but the soil is not – we would likely notice a change in the taste of the product. This is possibly one of the reasons why drinking Japanese green tea differs in taste from Chinese green tea.\nWith regard to the future of the in-demand beverage, Prof. Yalovsky says: « Even if the regions of the cultivated areas should experience floods – the tea plantations are positioned on the slopes of hills and mountains so it should not become an issue. » Another good news is that unlike many crops that depend on pollination to develop fruit – the tea plant is less reliant on this. « In the production of tea, we use its leaves and not its flowers or fruits and so it can be propagated by pruning (cutting a branch from a mature plant, a so-called ‘mother plant’, and creating a new plant through rooting). This method also ensures the genetic uniformity of the ‘daughter plants’, with everything that implies, » he concludes.\nWe made sure to ask Guy Shalmon which type of tea (if any) he recommends that our students drink during the exam period, to which he replied: “Actually, I wouldn’t say there’s any unique advantage or need to drink tea during an exam period. I’d say drink the kind of tea that you fancy and, ideally, try to rotate different types of tea. If the need for caffeine is the main consideration, black tea is the best choice, as it has the highest caffeine concentration. Black tea contains approx. 60-40 mg of caffeine per cup, while green tea contains only 20-15 mg.”\nWell, who needs the exams as an excuse, anyway? If you’re like us, we suggest you pour yourself a cuppa on any day of the week – no special occasion required – and enjoy a peaceful break from everything and everyone.","Green building method, sometimes known as sustainable building or even green building, is an approach to building and architecture that favors environmentally sound and resource-efficient methods that last through a building’s lifecycle.\nBenefits of green building: 30-50 % water saving, 20-30 % energy saving, conserves natural scarce resources and generates less waste, enhanced air quality and excellent day-lighting and provides healthier space for occupants.\nThe building sector has the greatest potential to reduce CO2 emissions. Currently, 30% of global CO2 emissions and 40% of global resource consumption is a result of constructing buildings.\nOur main goal is to optimise the environmental performance of a building using a life cycle approach, in which the materials and products used in a building are compared and evaluated for best performance at the building level (life cycle assessment).\nOur expertise spans all phases of a project from conceptual design through construction to project hand-over; in addition to continuous operation and maintenance.\nThe built environment has a vast impact on the natural environment, human health, and the economy. By adopting green building strategies, we can maximize both economic and environmental performance. Green construction methods can be integrated into buildings at any stage, from design and construction, to renovation and deconstruction. However, the most significant benefits can be obtained if the design and construction team takes an integrated approach from the earliest stages of a building project.\nGreen infrastructure can be broadly defined as a strategically planned network of high quality natural and semi-natural areas with other environmental features, which is designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services and protect biodiversity in both rural and urban settings.\nGreen infrastructure is effective, economical, and enhances community safety and quality of life.\nMore specifically green infrastructure, being a spatial structure providing benefits from nature to people, aims to enhance nature’s ability to deliver multiple valuable ecosystem goods and services, such as clean air or water.\nExperience has shown that investing in green infrastructure can contribute to the recovery of Europe’s economy by fostering innovative approaches and creating new green businesses. Green jobs already represent around 5% of the job market.\nGreen infrastructure and sustainability goals are our specialty, and achieving these goals requires technical knowledge and training in varied fields.\nPotential benefits of green infrastructure can include:\n- Provision of clean water\n- Removal of pollutants from air and water\n- Improved air and water quality\n- Protection against soil erosion\n- Improvement of land quality\n- Enhanced and protected biodiversity and ecosystems\n- Reducing waste streams\n- Conserved and restored natural resources\n- Creation of jobs\n- More energy solutions\n- greener cities\n- Better health and human well-being\n- Diversification of local economy\n- Minimized strain on local infrastructure\n- Improved overall quality of life\nClimate change adaptation and mitigation benefits\n- Disaster prevention\n- Flood alleviation\n- Strengthening ecosystems resilience\n- Ecological corridors\n- Landscape permeability\n- Improved habitats for wildlife\n- Reduced operating costs\n- Improved occupant productivity\n- Optimized life-cycle economic performance"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:adda959a-875f-4fa3-891e-768d51bada77>","<urn:uuid:888f4a5f-235e-46c4-907a-3e8da92ff1d6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does climate change affect the transportation sectors of developed nations like Japan versus small island developing states?","answer":"Climate change impacts transportation differently in Japan versus small island developing states (SIDS). In Japan, the main effect is through increasingly powerful typhoons that are projected to maintain their strength longer as they move northward, leading to extended port closures and requiring additional infrastructure investment of US$311 million to US$1.3 billion by 2085 to maintain economic growth. SIDS, on the other hand, face more existential threats due to their heavy reliance on coastal transport infrastructure, particularly seaports and airports. They are especially vulnerable due to their limited adaptation capacity, and impacts threaten not only their trade but also disaster relief efforts and international tourism, which is crucial for their economies. Their situation is particularly alarming as they are already exposed to major natural hazards, and climate change effects like sea-level rise and extreme weather events pose significant risks to their critical transport infrastructure.","context":["Climate change is set to cause some of the 21st century’s chief challenges. Among these are fears that rising sea temperatures will provoke an increase in the frequency and intensity of weather events, such as tropical cyclones.\nThe term “tropical cyclone” describes a closed atmospheric circulation that forms over warm oceans. When the sustained maximum wind speed of such storm systems exceeds 119 km per hour, they are called typhoons in the Pacific Ocean, hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean, and cyclones elsewhere.\nMany factors influence tropical cyclone behaviour. While there is debate among scientists as to just how much global warming is to blame, governments need to consider the worst-case scenarios so as to mitigate and prepare.\nJapan is extremely vulnerable to tropical storms, experiencing an average of 26.7 annually for the past 30 years. The country therefore already experiences much physical damage and other indirect economic consequences. It is important to understand how the amount of time and money lost due to these phenomena could increase.\nModeling the growing cost\nRecent computer simulation work at the United Nations University Institute of Advanced Studies (UNU-IAS) aims to gauge such indirect effects on the Japanese economy in the face of possibly bigger typhoons. Much of the existing research focuses on the physical damage without calculating the non-direct effects, such as disruption of transportation and industrial systems.\nTherefore the key indicator in the UNU-IAS model is the average amount of hours lost, because — as anybody who lives in tropical cyclone zone knows — when a typhoon hits, virtually all transport, industry and commerce come to a stop. Essentially, as citizens are forced to take shelter, the economic productivity of the country dramatically decreases.\nNorthward shift in tropical cyclone tracks\nA direct comparison between the control scenario (no climate change) and two climate change scenarios used in the simulation (based on different parameters on how typhoons can be expected to grow) shows that the northern areas of Japan will increasingly suffer economic downtime due to typhoons.\nThis is because an increase in surface sea temperatures will result in tropical cyclones keeping their strength over a longer distance as they travel north, resulting in higher latitude regions becoming affected (see figure).\nPorts would be hard hit\nJapan’s typhoon season lasts from around July to September, and most port downtime usually occurs during these months. In the scenarios above, the average period during which Japan’s ports will be unable to operate due to high winds is expected to increase by between 18% and 43%.\nAn 18% increase on the seasonal downtime already experienced would have a rather severe effect, especially for the southernmost regions, and would be quite dramatic in the case of Naha Port, in Okinawa.\nDue to the fact that Japan is made up of a series of islands and the economy is heavily trade-orientated, port infrastructure investment has been indispensable for the growth of the Japanese economy. A direct link has been found between the amount invested in port infrastructure and the growth in Japanese gross domestic product (GDP).\nSo basically, Japanese economic growth is dependent on port infrastructure expansion. In order to offset the cost of increased downtime due to bigger typhoons, spending on port infrastructure would have to be bumped up at a higher rate than that of the 20th century. This could cost an additional ¥30.6 to ¥127.9 billion (US$311 million to US$1.3 billion) by the year 2085 and would be on top of any infrastructure spending normally needed to maintain economic growth.\nRise in downtime would bite into GDP\nAccording to the results of our simulation, the annual economic damage due to periods of typhoon-caused inactivity could amount to 0.15 percent of Japanese GDP in the year 2085 (based on 1990 GDP figures). If this were to happen to the Japanese economy as it is today, it would mean a loss of more than ¥687 billion (US$7 billion, or the equivalent of US$60 per capita) every year from typhoons alone.\nThis future potential for loss is high in urban areas due to economic and demographic developments. More people and economic assets will be exposed to natural hazards in particularly risky coastal urban areas as a result of population growth driven by the relatively attractive economic conditions of these regions.\nWhat it all means\nAcross the globe scientists and economists are working to measure the economic consequences of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change claims that “the overall costs and risks of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5% of global GDP each year, now and forever. If a wider range of risks and impacts is taken into account, the estimates of damage could rise to 20% of GDP or more.”\nOf course climate change is not a precise science and how typhoon patterns will change in the future remains unknown. Our work assumes they will change according to the results of a 2004 study by Knutson and Tuleya, who predict a 6% increase in surface wind speed by 2085, due to a +0.8 to +2.4 degrees Celsius rise in surface sea temperature. However, some scientists are now predicting even bigger increases in temperatures by the end of the century.\nThe work carried out at UNU-IAS aims to provide a more detailed assessment of the overall cost of climate change than did Stern’s more general approach. The simulation results show that adaptation measures, such as designing more robust ports and harbour structures, will indeed be economically prudent in the future.\nThey also show a clear case for investing more money in renewable energies and cutting greenhouse gas emissions. As one of the countries most likely to suffer the negative effects of climate change, Japan should take the lead in doing this. Essentially every yen spent now might contribute to alleviating this potential increase in typhoon strength, and hence future economic losses, while providing jobs and stimulating Japan’s currently dire economic situation.","Climate change impacts pose huge risks to transportation, threatening global trade and development. Now is the time to adapt.\nHundreds of lives lost. More than 8,000 people stuck overnight in a flooded airport in Japan in the wake of a typhoon in 2018.\nNearly 800% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Dutch island of St. Maarten (and 600% of the GDP of the French half, St. Martin) wiped out during the 2017 hurricane season, which devastated many Caribbean island economies, with over $5.4 billion in losses reported in Anguilla, Bahamas, British Virgin Islands, St. Maarten, and Turks and Caicos Islands alone.\nTransportation industry stakeholders across sectors and technical experts from academia and international organizations examined these impacts of extreme weather events and how to better adapt to a changing climate at an UNCTAD meeting on \"Climate Change Adaptation for International Transport: Preparing for the Future\" held in Geneva, Switzerland, on 16 and 17 April.\n\"When it comes to climate change, transport is not just a culprit, but also a victim,\" said UNCTAD's chief of transport policy and legislation, Regina Asariotis.\nThough the transport sector is a contributor to climate emissions, it also faces severe risks resulting from impacts of climate change such as sea-level rise, soaring temperatures, extreme storms and floods.\nWe are suffering more extreme weather events as a result of climate change, warns the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its latest report, which calls for accurate climate information to support strategies for adaptation and mitigation.\nThe IPCC's call is also reflected in the Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2018 by the World Meteorological Organization, as highlighted by Boram Lee, a senior scientific officer at the organization.\nThe World Economic Forum's 2019 global risks report identifies extreme weather events, failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation, and natural disasters as the top three economic risks.\nThe risks to transportation, especially coastal transport infrastructure, threaten global trade and development.\nInternational maritime transport carries over 80% of the volume of world trade and provides access to global markets for all countries, including those that are landlocked.\n\"Coastal risk is becoming one of the most threatening natural hazards, especially in low-income countries,\" said Michalis Vousdoukas, an expert from the European Commission Joint Research Centre, while presenting latest global projections on climate risks and multi-hazard exposure of transport infrastructure assets.\nDamage, disruption and delays that may be caused by extreme weather events and climate change pose a huge economic risk to closely interlinked global supply chains, with significant repercussions for trade and development.\nFor small island developing states (SIDS), which are already exposed to major natural hazards, the outlook is particularly alarming.\nTheir critical reliance on coastal transport infrastructure, in particular seaports and airports, worsens their susceptibility to climate change impacts such as sea-level rise and extreme weather events.\nFor SIDS, these impacts threaten trade and disaster relief efforts, as well as international tourism, their crown jewel of economic development, which requires secure and reliable international transport connections.\n\"Transport is critical to 'sun, sea and sand' tourism, which accounts for up to 70% of the GDP of countries in the Caribbean,\" said Ms. Asariotis. \"The potential for losses caused by climate change is huge.\"\nYet SIDS and other developing countries have limited capacity to adapt and build the resilience of their transport infrastructure to cope with climate change.\n\"Strategies for reducing vulnerabilities, enhancing resilience, and improving economic efficiency are necessary for sustaining economic and social gains,\" said Willard Phillips, economic affairs officer at the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.\nHe welcomed UNCTAD's recent technical cooperation work in the Caribbean and called for further climate-risk assessment for ports and airports across the region.\nTo prepare for the future, there is a need to build in domestic and regional redundancy in transportation for the Caribbean region, Mr. Phillips said.\nSustainable and resilient transport is a cross-cutting issue under the 17 Sustainable Development Goals set by the international community in 2015. It is key to the achievement of progress on several goals.\nBut much international debate and action in relation to climate change and international transport has focused on addressing the causes (mitigation) rather than coping with the impacts (adaptation).\n\"We must examine the two sides of the coin - both the effects of transport on the environment and the impacts of climate change on transport,\" Ms Asariotis said.\nThe unrelenting assault of climate change requires countries to develop strategies for resilient transport infrastructure and systems, various speakers at the meeting said.\n\"Climate change will continue having devastating effects. The benefits of acting now far outweigh the costs of inaction,\" said Walters Tubua, associate programme officer at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nExperts at the meeting emphasized the need for an integrated approach when working on climate adaptation and resilience building for transportation across global supply chains.\n\"Transport underpins trade and society. It should be considered as a system,\" said Carole Escolan, manager of sustainable development at the International Union of Railways.\nAdaptation actions should become part of normal business in the transportation sector rather than special projects or process, Ms. Escolan said.\n\"In order to facilitate climate change adaptation, we need to work as supply chains rather than transport modes,\" said Michael Woods, principal operations specialist at the Rail Safety and Standards Board in the United Kingdom.\nClimate change will create significant challenges related to finance, insurance and regulations, especially for the aviation sector, said John Lengel, who leads the Airports Council International's adaptation work.\n\"Solutions can only be found by all stakeholders working together,\" said Mr. Lengel, underscoring the need to be more proactive in incorporating adaptation into the management and expansion of transport infrastructure.\nExchanging knowledge and experiences on building the resilience of transport infrastructure or systems and setting up common methods for measuring success are essential, said Patrick Mallejacq, secretary-general of the World Road Association.\nData will be key in this process. The establishment of databases on all transport assets, land use, the regional economy, weather and climate change should be a priority in every country, said Susanna Zammataro, director-general of the International Road Federation.\n\"There is a need for adaptive policy-making, high-quality asset data, capacity-building, and incentives for the private sector to invest in adaptation,\" Ms. Zammataro said.\nShe also urged the creation of an open-access global transport infrastructure database of adaptation-oriented policies, measures and projects.\nEqually important are capacity-building programmes for transport infrastructure practitioners to enable long-term resilience planning, said Austin Becker, associate professor at the University of Rhode Island in the United States.\nOne such effort is the UNCTAD SIDSport-ClimateAdapt project that is strengthening the capacity of Caribbean SIDS to take appropriate adaptation response measures.\nSome of the project's substantive findings informed the IPCC assessment of climate change impacts at 1.5 degrees global warming, highlighting the risk of marine flooding to coastal transport infrastructure in SIDS, which could occur as early as the 2030s.\nOther experts emphasized the need for long-term investment in human resources and skills through academic education and training, including at the United Nations University.\n\"Despite the potential high initial costs of adaptation measures, their benefits often outweigh the costs, as several studies have found,\" Ms. Zammataro said.\nThe above recommendations and others made by experts at the meeting are expected to inform discussions at the UN Secretary-General's Climate Action Summit scheduled for 23 September at the UN headquarters in New York.\nNEWS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS\nNEWS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS\nNEWS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS\nNEWS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS\nDRR VOICES BLOG\nDOCUMENTS / PUBLICATIONS"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:58c1c4ed-bc4e-4885-9675-98da4ac0b930>","<urn:uuid:19041b53-f11e-451a-90a0-d3fb011416a6>"],"error":null}

Molded by inspiration from such classic painters as Frederick Church and John Frederick Kensett, Hobbs seeks to move the viewer by the intense power of the natural world. Like the Hudson River School artists, Hobbs has grown skillful at depicting distance with the subtle moods created by atmosphere and lighting.\n- Frank Joest\nFrank Joest’s formal art training began at Music and Art High School in New York and The Academy of Creative Arts, Karlsruhe, Germany. He received his Pedagogic Degree from the University of Creative Arts, Berlin, Germany. Joest taught art in Berlin, Washington, D.C., Miami and the Poconos. He owned and operated an art gallery in Rockville, MD. He exhibited his art throughout Europe and the US and had one-man exhibits in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, Florida and several cities in Germany. He received a fellowship to paint in Venice, Italy and created an 18 foot metal sculpture to honor Professor Whitenight. The sculpture stands outside the Koehler Fieldhouse at ESU. Joest spent his life working in painting, graphics, sculpture and pottery. He has been papercutting since 1987 and is a juried member in Papercutting of the Pennsylvania Guild of Craftsmen. Joest can be reached at email@example.com.\n- Linda Schwartz\nCeramics – Graduating in printmaking from Tyler School of Art, Linda spent the last 10 years immersed in clay. She finds she uses many printmakers techniques in her approach to ceramics. Pressing into the clay she creates embossed images using type, handmade stamps and found objects. The use of engobes on the textured surfaces borrows from printmaking, and she sometimes work in a series, much like a suite of prints.\n- Yanina Siana\nOriginally from Kiev, Yanina creates limited edition and one-of-a-kind jewelry from seeded pearls and semi-precious stones in a variety of styles from understated elegance to, well, elegant. Many of the pearls are seeded from specific shapes like diamonds or ovals where the individual pearls are similar but unique with an eye to combining colors, shapes and textures to create truly stunning jewelry. Yanina also hand-knits woolen clothing accessories like hand-warmers, socks and hats.\n- Kathleen Sweeney\n- Cullen Yates\nOil Landscape Artist – Cullen Yates achieved national prominence as a landscape painter during his lifetime. A native of Bryan, OH, Yates studied in New York and Paris, moving to Shawnee in 1908. His 1908 painting “March Day, Shawnee” was exhibited at the National Academy show and sold for $800, a grand sum at that time.

{"question":"How do the treatment approaches compare between granulocytic ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever?","answer":"Both diseases are treated with antibiotics from the tetracycline family. For ehrlichiosis, the antibiotics tetracycline and doxycycline are effective treatments. Similarly, for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, doxycycline is the antibiotic of choice and is continued for several days after the fever subsides. While doxycycline is usually not given to children under 8 due to the risk of teeth staining, in cases of RMSF, treatment takes priority due to the disease's severity - untreated cases can lead to death.","context":["According to the Handbook for Zoonotic Diseases of Companion Animals, ehrlichiosis refers to a group of diseases. The specific type of ehrlichiosis is named according to the host and type of white blood cell it affects. Canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis is caused by the pathogens Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Ehrlichia ewingii, affecting your dog's granulocytic white blood cells.\nGranulocyte + Ehrlichiosis = Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis\nA granulocyte is a white blood cell comprised of small granules containing proteins. This particular type of blood cell wards off bacterial infections, which is why a dog's granulocyte count increases if he's battling this particular infection. In the U.S., the bacterial infection ehrlichiosis is caused by one of three types of ehrlichia: Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Ehrlichia ewingii and Ehrlichia muris-like, with Ehrlichia ewingii targeting granulocytes. Though it doesn't carry the \"ehrlichia\" label, Anaplasma phagocytophilum also can cause granulocytic ehrlichiosis. Both types of bacteria are spread to dogs by ticks.\nComing From a Tick Near You\nContracting granulocytic ehrlichiosis can be as easy as a walk in the park for your dog -- all it takes is a run-in with the wrong kind of tick. If Duff lives in the Northeast or Upper Midwestern U.S., the black-legged tick carrying Anaplasma phagocytophilum can give him granulocytic ehrlichiosis; the Western black-legged trick can do the same thing in Northern California. The lone star tick, found in the south central and southeastern U.S., can transmit granulocytic ehrlichiosis to your dog by carrying Ehrlichia ewingii. Regardless of where he lives or what kind of tick he meets, Duff becomes infected with the disease in the same way: The tick jumps on your pup, feeds and transfers the bacteria to his granulocytes. The bacteria live on, multiplying and spreading through your dog's system.\nDifferent Phases, Different Symptoms\nEhrlichiosis progresses in three phases in dogs: acute, subclinical and chronic. Common symptoms of granulocytic ehrlichiosis in the acute phase include fever, loss of appetite, weight loss and listlessness. Swollen joints, stiffness and hesitation to move are also signs of infection. The acute phase lasts one to three weeks and if left untreated, progresses to the subclinical stage. At this point, your pup will appear to return to his normal good health and remain there for months or even years. For certain dogs, such as one with a compromised immune system, the chronic phase can be life-threatening. In the chronic phase, weight loss and fever are common, particularly in severe cases.\nSearching for Antibodies\nBlood testing is important for diagnosing granulocytic ehrlichiosis; a positive test for antibodies against the bacteria confirms exposure to the pathogen, but doesn't confirm an infection is active. A negative test doesn't give an all-clear because Duff may be too sick to produce the antibodies or it's too soon after infection to detect the antibodies. Other tests may confirm diagnosis, and as Veterinary Partner notes, occasionally the offending organism can be seen on a blood smear. The antibiotics tetracycline and doxycycline are effective at treating granulocytic ehrlichiosis. Prior infection doesn't build immunity to this disease, so if Duff picks up this pathogen again, he'll need treatment again.\nKeep it Clean\nIt takes 24 to 48 hours for an infected tick to pass the bacteria to its host. That means you can help decrease the odds your pup becomes infected by performing a thorough check of him after he's been outside. Look for and remove any attached ticks from Duff promptly to minimize any chance of infection. Using a topical acaricide vastly decreases his chance of getting a tick bite. Finally, keeping his outside environment free of brush and yard debris discourages ticks from taking up residence near your home.\n- Iowa State University Center for Food Security and Health: Ehrlichiosis and Anaplasmosis: Zoonotic Species\n- Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association: Zoonosis Update: Ehrlichiosis and Related Infections\n- Handbook for Zoonotic Diseases of Companion Animals; edited by Glenda Dvorak et al\n- Companion Animal Parasite Council: Ehrlichia SPP and Anaplasma SPP\n- Veterinary Partner: Ehrlichia Infection in Dogs\n- Medline Plus: Granulocyte\n- Centers for Disease Control: Ehrlichiosis","Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) in Children\nWhat is Rocky Mountain spotted fever?\nRocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a bacterial infection spread by the bite of\nan infected tick. It usually occurs from April until September, but it can occur anytime\nduring the year where weather is warm. The mid-Atlantic and southeastern states are\nmost affected. The disease is spread to humans through a bite from an infected tick;\nit is not spread from one person to another.\nIn the U.S., the American dog tick, the Rocky Mountain wood tick, and the brown dog\ntick, have been identified as the ticks that transmit the RMSF bacteria.\nWhat are the symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever?\nThese are the most common symptoms of RMSF:\nRMSF is a serious illness that should be treated as soon as possible. Death has occurred\nin untreated cases of RMSF.\nThe symptoms of RMSF may look like other conditions or medical problems. Always see\nyour child's healthcare provider for a diagnosis.\nHow is RMSF diagnosed?\nYour healthcare provider can diagnose Rocky Mountain spotted fever based on your symptoms\nand history of a tick bite. The appearance and characteristics of the rash are important,\nif your child gets one. Skin biopsy samples and lab tests are usually done to rule\nout other conditions and confirm the diagnosis.\nWhat is the treatment for Rocky Mountain spotted fever?\nTreatment may include antibiotics and treating the symptoms. Doxycycline is the antibiotic\nof choice, and it will be continued for several days after the fever goes away. Doxycycline\nis in the tetracycline drug family, and these drugs are usually not given to children\nunder the age of 8 because of the risk of staining the permanent teeth. However, in\nthe case of suspected RMSF, it is more important to treat the illness.\nHow can Rocky Mountain spotted fever be prevented?\nOnce a child has RMSF, he or she cannot be reinfected. Some general guidelines for\npreventing RMSF include the following:\nSince ticks cannot bite through clothing; dress your child and family in:\nLight-colored clothing so that ticks can be easily seen\nLong-sleeved shirts tucked into pants\nSocks and closed-toe shoes\nLong pants with legs tucked into socks\nCheck your family often for ticks, including:\nAll parts of the body that bend: behind the knees, between fingers and toes, underarms,\nOther areas where ticks are commonly found: belly button, in and behind the ears,\nneck, hairline, and top of the head\nAreas of pressure points, including:\nWhere underwear elastic touches the skin\nWhere bands from pants or skirts touch the skin\nAnywhere else where clothing presses on the skin\nAll other areas of the body and hair, and run fingers gently over skin. Run a fine-toothed\ncomb through your child's hair to check for ticks.\nOther helpful measures include:\nWhen possible, walk on cleared paths and pavement through wooded areas and fields.\nShower after all outdoor activities are over for the day. It may take up to 4 to 6\nhours for ticks to attach firmly to skin. Showering may help remove any loose ticks.\nUse insect repellents safely:\nProducts that contain DEET are tick repellents, but may not kill the tick and are\nnot 100% effective. Use a children's insect repellent (20% to 30% DEET). The current recommendations\nfrom the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC for children older than 2 months\nof age are to use 10% to 30% DEET. Products that contain DEET should not be used on\ninfants less than 2 months of age. Do not apply insect repellants around your child's\nmouth, nose, or eyes, or over cuts or open sores.\nTreat clothing with small amounts of a product that contains permethrin, which is\nknown to kill ticks on contact. Do not use permethrin on the skin.\nCheck pets for ticks and treat as needed."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4749f6e5-0e83-49ab-91dc-4abed856055f>","<urn:uuid:1f9f4890-481a-4419-954f-bd2e136a65a3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What financial challenges do historic theater restoration projects face, and what are the regulatory consequences of non-compliant renovations?","answer":"Historic theater restoration projects face significant financial challenges, with renovation costs being 'very expensive' according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's coverage. For instance, the Warner Grand Theatre's restoration costs $89 million to convert it into the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra's venue. Regarding regulatory consequences, non-compliant renovations can lead to serious penalties. Local authorities can take violators to magistrates' court, resulting in fines up to £5000 plus daily penalties of £50 for continued violations. Additionally, non-compliant work can affect property sales, as authorities won't issue completion certificates, which may surface during local land search inquiries when selling the property.","context":["As Americans fell in love with movies in the 1910s and 20s, extravagant movie palaces were built. The theater’s generally featured a single screen and a stage for vaudeville performances. However, as modern movie theaters came on the scene with multiple screens, many of those older, ornate theaters began to close and fall into disrepair. Over the past few decades, many of these spaces have been brought back to life as atmospheric theaters and music venues.\nHere in Milwaukee, many of these historic theaters are undergoing renovations. Tom Daykin covers commercial development for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, so he’s an ideal person to share updates on some of the plans for renovating these historic buildings.\nMilwaukee, in general, has done a good job of maintaining historic buildings. The problem though, according to Daykin, is that “the idea is one thing, the romance is one thing, the costs is quite another. They tend to be like a lot of historic building renovation projects — very expensive.”\nAlthough some of these movie palaces will still show movies, Daykin says they aren’t trying to compete with AMC and Marcus for regular release movies. “The people doing these projects, in some cases they may be a a bit idealistic, but they’re not stupid.”\nMany of these theaters are still in the planning stages of redevelopment, so Daykin is proving an update on some of the renovations that are moving forward.\nThe Warner Grand Theatre (212 W. Wisconsin Ave.)\nBuilt during the height of the Great Depression, the Warner Grand Theatre will get a second life as the new home of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra (MSO). It will cost $89 million to restore it and turn it into MSO’s performance venue, rehearsal space, and office space.\nA building next to it was torn down to create a new addition that blends the older historic architecture with a new design. Daykin says Marcus Corporation did a good job of maintaining the building, making the renovation much easier than it otherwise could have been.\nThe restorations is “going to have a really big impact on downtown, specifically on the west side of downtown,” Daykin says.\nThe MSO plans to open at the newly restored venue by September 2020.\nThe New State Theater (2600 W. State St.)\nBuilt in 1915, the State Theater closed by the late 1950s. Throughout the 1980s and up until the early ’90s, however, it served as a working tavern and club for mostly rock music. After shutting down and reopening as a strip club, its license didn’t get renewed and it subsequently closed for good.\nLast year, though, a nonprofit group bought the property with plans to restore the theater into an all-ages music venue, which Daykins says “is something that we hear repeatedly is needed in Milwaukee.” The group also plans to use the space for classes and workshops, a storefront for local artists, and sound engineering studios.\nThe West Bend Theatre (125 Main St., West Bend)\nJust outside of Milwaukee, the West Bend Theatre is going through a renovation of its own. The Historic West Bend Theatre nonprofit group is in the midst of an approval process with the West Bend Plan Commission to renovate the exterior. But they’ve already done a significant amount of interior work, including removing lead paint, asbestos, and all the old seats that were beyond repair, Daykin says.\nThey hope to have their soft opening by winter of this year. Daykin says “they plan to show some movies,” but also have “live performances and other events too.”\nThe Grand Theater (2917-23 N. Holton Ave.)\nBuilt in 1911, the lesser-known Grand Theater sits on the border of the Riverwest and Harambee neighborhoods. Although renovation of the theater is still in its nascent stages, Daykin says the Riverwest Investment Cooperative has raised money to convert the theater into a live venue for performance arts. And that makes sense, as Daykin says “Riverwest and Harambee both have a lot of musicians living there.”\nThe Modjeska Theatre (1134 W. Mitchell St.)\nBuilt in 1924, the Modjeska Theatre is owned by the nonprofit Mitchell Street Development Opportunities Corporation. The group is seeking proposals to renovate the theater and operate the building. “They’ve done a fair amount of interior demolition and gutting work,” says Daykin, and “they’re actively looking for a user for the building.”","What are the Building Regulations?\nThe Building Regulations apply to building work in England & Wales and set standards for the design and construction of buildings to ensure the safety and health for people in or about those buildings. They also include requirements to ensure that fuel and power is conserved and facilities are provided for people, including those with disabilities, to access and move around inside buildings.\nDo I need Building Regulations Approval? If you are planning to carry out ‘Building Work’ as defined in Regulation 3 of the Building Regulations, then it must comply with the Building Regulations. This normally means seeking approval of the work from a Building Control Body.\nThe following types of project amount to ‘Building Work’:\nThe erection or extension of a building\nAn alteration project involving work which will temporarily or permanently affect the ongoing compliance of the building, service or fitting with the requirements relating to structure, fire, or access to and use of buildings\nWhen installing replacement windows using a builder or window company not registered with the relevant Competent Person Schemes\nThe installation or extension of a service or fitting which is controlled under the regulations\nThe insertion of insulation into a cavity wall\nThe underpinning of the foundations of a building\nWhen you want to change the building’s fundamental use\nIf your building work consists only of the installation of certain types of services or fittings (e.g. electrical installations in dwellings, heating, hot water, air-conditioning and ventilation, replacement windows, WCs, and showers) and you employ an installer registered with a relevant Competent Person Schemes as designated in the Building Regulations, that installer will be able to self-certify the work. Therefore, you will not need to involve a Building Control Service. However, this concession is strictly limited to the specific type of installations and does not cover any other type of building work.\nThe works themselves must meet the current relevant technical requirements in the Building Regulations and they must not make other fabric, services and fittings less compliant than they were before – or dangerous. For example, the provision of replacement double-glazing must not make compliance worse in relation to means of escape, air supply for combustion appliances and their flues and ventilation for health.\nThey may also apply to certain changes of use of an existing building. This is because the change of use may result in the building as a whole no longer complying with the requirements which will apply to its new type of use, and so having to be up-graded to meet additional requirements specified in the regulations for which building work may also be required.\nWhere to get Building Regulations approval\nTo help you achieve compliance with the regulations, you are required to use one of two types of Building Control Service:\nyour local authority Building Control Service; or\nan approved inspector’s Building Control Service\nFailure to comply with the Building Regulations\nIf you do not follow the building control procedures set out for handling your building work or you carry out building work which does not comply with the requirements contained in the Building Regulations you will have contravened them.\nEnforcement Notices & Fines The local authority has a general duty to enforce the Building Regulations in its area and will seek to do so by informal means wherever possible.\nWhere an approved inspector is providing the Building Control Service, the responsibility for checking that the Building Regulations are complied with during the course of your building work will lie with that inspector. They will usually do this by advising you. However, approved inspectors do not have enforcement powers. Instead, the regulations provide that in a situation where they consider your building work does not comply with the Building Regulations they will not issue you with a final certificate and in addition will cancel the initial notice by notifying your local authority. If no other approved inspector takes on the work, the Building Control Service will automatically be taken on by your local authority. From this point on your local authority will also have enforcement powers to require you to alter your work, if they consider this necessary.\nIf a person carrying out building work contravenes the Building Regulations, the local authority or another person may decide to take them to the magistrates’ court where they could be fined up to £5000 for the contravention, and up to £50 for each day the contravention continues after conviction (section 35 of the Building Act 1984). This action will usually be taken against the builder or main contractor, and proceedings must be taken within two years from the completion of the work. Alternatively, or in addition, the local authority may serve an enforcement notice on the owner requiring them to alter or remove work which contravenes the regulations (section 36 of the 1984 Act). If the owner does not comply with the notice the local authority has the power to undertake the work itself and recover the costs of doing so from the owner.\nA section 36 enforcement notice cannot be served on you after the expiration of 12 months from the date of completion of the building work, but this does not affect a local authority’s (or any other person’s) right to apply to the Courts for an injunction for the same purpose. A local authority also cannot take enforcement action under section 36 if the work which you have carried out is in accordance with your plans which the authority approved or failed to reject within the statutory time of five weeks (or two months with your agreement) from deposit of the plans.\nImpact on Selling the Property Notwithstanding the possibility of enforcement action, you should bear in mind that if the local authority considers that building work carried out does not comply with the Building Regulations and it is not rectified, the authority will not issue you with a completion certificate and the contravention may come to light through a local land search enquiry when you wish to sell your property.\nIs Building Regulations approval the same as planning permission?\nBuilding Regulations approval is a separate matter from obtaining planning permission for your work. Similarly, receiving any planning permission which your work may require is not the same as taking action to ensure that it complies with the Building Regulations.\nCall Us On +44 20 8886 6591"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c66e5810-156c-4397-ba02-d2bdaad55b0c>","<urn:uuid:5f0a3955-8d2b-4a1b-b86d-bc0b8e69d45e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the traditional methods for finding the Qibla direction, and how do modern navigation technologies like eLORAN complement GPS in maritime navigation?","answer":"Traditional methods for finding the Qibla include using the sun, making a sundial, and using an analog watch. The sun method involves knowing that twice a year (May 28 at 9:18 UT and July 16 at 9:27 UT) when the sun is directly above Ka'bah, facing the sun gives you the Qibla direction. As for modern navigation, eLORAN complements GPS by providing signals about 1 million times more powerful than satellite signals. Unlike GPS, which can be jammed or disrupted, eLORAN uses low-frequency signals that can penetrate buildings, underground areas, and even steel containers. It offers positioning accuracy of ±8 meters and includes features like automatic direction-finding, making it a reliable backup when GPS fails.","context":["In this article we will be discussing some traditional and modern ways to Find the Direction of Qibla for Prayer.\nThe Qibla has great importance in the daily lives of Muslims. Qibla is the direction towards Ka’bah (situated in Makkah, Saudi Arabia) towards which Muslims pray five times a day. In the Quran Allah (SWT) says:\nVerily! We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad’s SAW) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qibla (prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid- Al-Harâm (at Makah). And wheresoever’s you people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction. Certainly, the people who were given the Scriptures (i.e. Jews and the Christians) know well that, (your turning towards the direction of the Ka’bah in Makkah in prayers) is the truth from their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what they do.\nIn the past locating Qibla was a very difficult task to do in unfamiliar land, but nowadays technology has made it very easy, now we have many more options to do this task easier and quicker.\nThe Concept for locating Qibla\nAt first one has to clear his location to Baitu-llah or Khana Ka’bah. It’s a common thought that Muslims pray towards east but its not true. Muslims are ordered to pray facing Ka’bah, so where ever a Muslim resides from Ka’bah he or she has to pray facing towards Ka’bah. If Muslims are living in Japan they have to pray towards west or northwest, where as in America Muslims pray towards northeast.\nAmazingly, while on a map Makkah appears to be southwest of the U.S., still in most of the United States Muslims pray towards northeast! Can you guess why? Of course, this is because the Earth is spherical and Muslims in the U.S. discovered that the distance to Makkah measured from northeast is actually shorter than the distance measured from southeast. Thus, northeast is the correct direction to pray!\nMethods for locating Qibla\nUsing the Sun\nThe sun rises in the east and sets in the west across the globe. If we know some basic things then we can easily find our prayer directions.\nFor example, if you know that Makah is north of your country and the Sun sets to your exact left, then you are already facing the Qibla. On the other hand if the sun is setting on your right, then you need to be facing the opposite direction.\nTwice a year, you can use the Sun to determine the precise location of the Qibla. The sun is overhead or right above the Ka’bah at two times of a year. These times are:\n• May 28 at 9:18 UT\n• July 16 at 9:27 UT\nOn these dates, at these exact times (converted to your local time) when you face the sun you will also be facing the Ka’bah, thus giving you the direction to your Qibla.\nAlthough this option cannot be used on a daily basis, it is still a tried and tested method for locating the direction of the Ka’bah.\nMake a sundial\n- Wherever you are, get to level ground and place a vertical object, approximately 3 feet in length, on the ground just before noon\n- Mark the place on the ground at the tip of the shadow\n- Now make a circle which has a radius that is equal to the length of the shadow\n- As the day progresses, the shadow will get shorter moving away from the circle. Eventually the shadow will start getting longer in a different direction and finally will touch the circle again.\n- Make another point at this intersection of the circle and the shadow.\n- Now draw a line between the two marks you made.\n- The direction is west to east. The first point is west and the second east.\n- Draw a line which is perpendicular to this line. The line you just drew is the north-south line.\n- Now keeping in mind where you are in the world you will able to get a rough idea of where the Qibla is.\nUse a Watch\nAn analog watch with hours and minutes hands can help you find directions too!\n- If you are in the northern hemisphere, then hold your watch horizontally such that the hour hand points to the sun.\n- The point which is midway between the hour hand and 12-marker on the watch is south. Once you know where south is you can easily determine the other directions.\n- If you are in the southern hemisphere you will need to hold the watch horizontally such that the twelve o’clock mark points towards the sun.\n- The direction that is right in the middle of the 12 marker and the hour hand will be north. You can then easily determine the other directions.\n- Now keeping in mind where you are in the world you will able to get a rough idea of where the Qibla is\nUsing a compass\nThe Compass is the easiest way to determine your directions. It’s really easy finding Qibla by Compass.\nSoftware Apps and Internet\nNowadays we can easily find Qibla by using Mobile Apps. We can also enter our location and by the click of a button we can locate Qibla. We can easily download apps onto our smartphones that point to the exact Direction of Qibla. Some regular mobile phones also come with built-in applications for locating the Direction of Qibla.","The world’s shipping industry is experiencing strong growth, which is expected to continue. Ships are getting larger and faster, sea-lanes are becoming more crowded, and crews are increasingly relying on electronic navigation systems to operate in this environment . The newly proposed concept of e-Navigation will improve safety, security, and protection of the marine environment as well as potentially reducing costs. It will provide bridge officers with all the information they need on a single display. In order to make these critical e-navigation services available, the system will require a supply of position and timing data of exceptionally high accuracy and reliability.\nSystems like GPS, Russia’s GLONASS, China’s BeiDou, and Europe’s Galileo systems are Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS) that provides real-time positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) data. However, in many environments in which military operates (inside buildings, in urban canyons, under dense foliage, underwater, and underground) have limited or no GPS access. Similarly, GPS signals can be significantly degraded or unavailable during solar storms. GPS is also vulnerable to jamming attacks, GNSS jammers are now being used by criminals or vehicle hijackers, as reported by the FBI: “… GPS tracking devices have been jammed by criminals engaged in nefarious activity including cargo theft and illicit shipping of goods.Typical military jammers are able to affect GPS receiver for many tens of kilometers by line of sight. It’s a problem because best accuracy, availability and global coverage of PNT data is through GPS/GNSS.\nIn September 2001, almost simultaneously with the “9/11” act of terrorism, the US Government published its “Volpe Report” . This spelled out the degree to which the US, like other nations worldwide, was starting to base its critical infrastructures on GPS. The Report explained the vulnerability of GPS (and similar GNSS systems) to disruption by intentional or unintentional interference. It identified Loran as a potential solution to this important problem. This attracted interest worldwide, and provided an impetus to modernize the Loran system in the US.\nLORAN, short for long-range navigation, was a hyperbolic radio navigation system developed in the United States during World War II. It was first used for ship convoys crossing the Atlantic Ocean, and then by long-range patrol aircraft. Loran-C, delivered a positioning accuracy of 460 meters , principally to mariners sailing in coastal and oceanic waters. When the Global Positioning System (GPS) appeared in the1980s, with its positioning accuracy of tens of meters, many began to regard Loran-C as irrelevant.\nWith the perceived vulnerability of GNSS systems, and their own propagation and reception limitations, renewed interest in LORAN applications and development has appeared. Enhanced LORAN, also known as eLORAN or E-LORAN, comprises advancement in receiver design and transmission characteristics, which increase the accuracy and usefulness of traditional LORAN. With reported accuracy as good as ±8 meters, the system becomes competitive with unenhanced GPS. eLoran is an independent, dissimilar, complement to Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). It allows GNSS users to retain the safety, security, and economic benefits of GNSS, even when their satellite services are disrupted.\nThe US Loran evaluation and modernization program resulted in this new version of Loran with significantly improved performance. It has much better accuracy, integrity, and continuity while continuing to meet Loran-C’s traditional availability requirements. These improvements are realized mainly through the addition of a data channel. The data channel conveys corrections, warnings, and signal integrity information to the user’s receiver via the Loran transmission. eLORAN also includes additional pulses, which can transmit auxiliary data such as DGPS corrections. These enhancements in LORAN make it a possible substitute for scenarios where GPS is unavailable or degraded.\nAs eLoran uses high-powered transmitters and low-frequency signals (not microwatts and microwaves like GNSS), it is very unlikely to be interfered with or jammed by the same causes that would disrupt GNSS signals. This means that small, low-cost, eLoran receivers, even built into GNSS units, can mitigate the impact of disruptions to GNSS.\nA further important benefit of eLoran’s low frequency signals is their ability to penetrate into places where GNSS signals either cannot be received at all, or where they are intermittent or inaccurate. These include the urban canyons in the centers of major cities. Loran signals have been shown to penetrate reliably into steel shipping containers, refrigerated vehicles and storage warehouses. This ability has led to the development of systems that track items either of highvalue or whose safe and timely delivery must be guaranteed. The tracking of hazardous cargoes also demands the consistent updates and high availability of eLoran-based systems.\neLoran supplies the precise timing needed to support not only e-Navigation, but also the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and synchronized lights in harbor areas. Moreover, eLoran can do things GNSS cannot, such as acting as a static compass. An important bonus of using eLoran – something GNSS cannot provide – is the eLoran compass. When the receiver is used with an H-field (Magnetic Loop) antenna it can be employed as an automatic direction-finder taking bearings on the transmitting stations. From these, the receiver calculates the ship’s heading, generally with an accuracy of better than 1°, and independent of the ship’s movement.\nAt sea, a new concept of navigation enhanced navigation (e-Navigation) – is being developed which requires an exceptionally reliable input of position, navigation, and time data. Uniquely, the combination of GNSS and eLoran has the potential to meet its needs.\nUK’s eLoran (enhanced Long Range Navigation) for ships and aircrafts\nThe General Lighthouse Authorities (GLAs) of the UK and Ireland have employed eLoran (enhanced Long Range Navigation), that enables ships and aircraft to determine their position and speed by triangulating low-frequency radio beacon signals transmitted by presently seven differential reference stations on the shore. U.K. has become first country to provide alternative position, navigation, and timing (PNT) information to ships fitted with eLoran receivers that can ensure their safe navigation in the event of GPS failure.\nCaptain Ian McNaught, deputy master of Trinity House, commented, “eLoran provides a signal around 1 million times more powerful than those from satellite signals, providing resilience from interference and attack.”\neLoran can provide navigation information for vessels as well as the timing data necessary to maintain the power grid, cell phones, financial networks, and the Internet in the event of an outage. Unlike space-based navigation, eLoran signals can also reach inside buildings, underground, and underwater.\nReferences and Resources also include:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ad61e329-5abc-4825-ba1e-4a8bd450d6a1>","<urn:uuid:855f526c-ebe7-4cc2-b62d-240d0001aaa6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is difference between share capital and share premium in Dutch BV company for accounting purposes?","answer":"In terms of accounting and taxation, both share capital and share premium are treated equally as part of the equity of a Dutch BV company. According to Dutch Accounting Standards, funding through new share issuance is recorded in Equity. Capital contributions by existing shareholders without issuing new shares are recognized as share premium (agio) and shown as a separate balance post under Equity in the Financial statements, as per article 2:373 subsection 1 of the Dutch Civil Code.","context":["Share capital vs. share premium for capital funding of a Dutch company\nWhen a shareholder wants to fund its Dutch Limited Liability Company (BV) with capital there are two choices: share capital or share premium. Are there any pros and cons in regard the use of both options?\nShare capital and share premium are both considered to be part of the equity of a BV and therefore both are in principal a tax neutral instrument. Share capital can be brought into a company by paying up issued shares in cash or in kind. Share premium can be brought into a company by a contribution in cash or in kind on the existing shares of a company.\nAccording to the Dutch Accounting Standards funding of a BV by issuance of new shares will be recorded in the Equity. According to the Dutch Accounting Standard RJ 240.221, capital contributions made by existing shareholders on account of their financial relationship to the entity that are executed conducted without actual disbursement of new shares (or rights to receive or call shares) are to be recognized as share capital premium (in Dutch: agio). In the Financial statements funding under share premium contribution will be shown under Equity as a separate balance post (article 2: 373 subsection 1 Dutch Civil Code).\nIncrease of equity\nIncreasing the capital of a company by means of capital requires the execution of a deed by a Dutch civil law notary. For the execution, the notary will require a resolution from the shareholder which also includes a power of attorney. Additionally, a power of attorney from the company will be required. Normally, the notary drafts the notarial deed, power of attorney and resolution.\nA contribution of share premium will require a share premium contribution agreement concluded between the shareholder and the company, plus a shareholder’s resolution. There is no registration of share premium with the Dutch trade register or in the shareholders register. After the conclusion of the share premium contribution agreement and adoption of the resolution, the share premium can be paid by the shareholder to the company by means of a transfer. As there are not many formalities, a share premium contribution can, in case of urgency, be executed within a day.\nShare premium and share capital redemption\nIn case of liquidation, redemption of share capital can be executed without any formalities and in a tax neutral way. In case the company will be continued, the share capital can only be executed in a tax neutral way by means of a decrease of the nominal value of the shares. This decrease of the nominal value can only be realised by means of a notarial deed. In case of a decrease of the nominal value of the shares with 50 per cent, an amount equal to 50 per cent of the initial share capital can be distributed to the shareholder.\nIn relation to accounting and taxation, share capital and share premium are both considered to be part of the equity and are treated in an equal way. Therefore, it is recommendable to make use of the type of equity that can be applied most easily. A contribution of share premium takes less time and brings less legal expenses and paperwork.\nFeel free to contact our legal team in case of any questions or need for support with a capital contribution.\nDutch Civil Code in English: http://www.dutchcivillaw.com/civilcodegeneral.htm\nNBA (Netherlands Institute of Chartered Accounctants) guidance on contribution in kind: https://www.nba.nl/globalassets/wet--en-regelgeving/nba-handreikingen/nba-handreiking_1129_storting_op_aandelen_anders_dan_in_geld_inbreng_in_natura.pdf\nDutch Accounting Standards Board: https://www.rjnet.nl/engelse-pagina/"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6b4f012a-73f4-45cd-9984-e78ce7daf41d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How has the documentation of trains through photography contributed to both industrial development and artistic expression, and what compositional elements make these images significant?","answer":"The documentation of trains through photography has served dual purposes. From an industrial perspective, railroads pioneered industrial photography for practical documentation of locomotives and travel promotion. From an artistic standpoint, photographers employ specific compositional elements to create meaningful images, such as working with odd-numbered groups of elements (3 or 5) for aesthetic appeal, and using implied lines to create tension and symbolism. In historical examples like Kertész's work, trains are composed to appear smaller than surrounding architecture, creating artistic contrast while still conveying their historical significance. This dual role of practical documentation and artistic expression has been maintained through the years by both professionals and skilled amateurs, contributing to our visual heritage and cultural understanding of railroading.","context":["One of the best ways to learn photography is by looking at examples that clearly demonstrate concepts. That is what we have tried to do in selecting these images that clearly deomstrate certain composition principles that you will become familiar with as you progress through your photography journey. The criteria for selecting the images were simple: they all had to illustrate three solid principles of photography, especially in terms composition.\nAndré Kertész, Meudon, 1928 – Retrieved from https://research.bowdoin.edu\nHere we have a moment of juxtaposition of the train in the upper distance, symbolizing progress and the power of machines, contrasted with the vulnerability of human nature, personified by the man walking in the opposite direction of the train while carrying something, probably a painting or a mirror. Trains owe their existence to human beings, and they appear connected here by the similar tone of their coverings (i.e., the black clothes, and the black paint).\nEvery subject in the frame is moving. The two principal characters here are the train itself and the humans, especially the man looking at the camera. All are moving, but the sense of speed is more obvious with the train due to the steam trail left in its wake. The people seem calm, almost static, but moving at a slow pace. The train is a symbol of progress that enabled people to travel faster than ever.\nWe know that trains are huge, but here it appears tiny compared to the architecture surrounding it. The subject appears large due to the distance; in the end, the human appears larger and more like the protagonist. The train is just a beautiful and poetic background object.\nCameras belong to the world of machines, and the man’s serious look towards the camera could imply displeasure from a possible painter towards photography (but this is just a theory of mine). Trains have greatly influenced the arts, and we have spoken previously of\n20 trains that inspired photography.\nGarry Winogrand – New York – 1967 Garry Winogrand, Central Park Zoo, New York, 1967 – Image Retrieved from https://transatlantica.revues.org/\nThe chimpanzees in the photograph dressed like children reflect the other child next to the couple. This is social satire, where Winogrand suggested that there is a sense of bestiality in humans and a sense of humanity in animals. Due to the two-dimensional nature of the picture, the child appears to be looking at one of the chimpanzees, when it is likely he was looking at something else outside the scene.\nIt's pleasing to compose with more than one object inside the frame. When a photographer is doing this, he or she must remember that it is more aesthetic to work with simple groups of odds. Groups of 3 or 5 elements are more interesting in compositional terms than those with groups of 2 or 4 elements. The reason for this is that the human mind rushes to separate things symmetrically.\nImplied lines are hard to capture because they are technically not there – they are not physical lines like vertical, horizontal, and organic lines. The couple is looking in the same direction, and the chimpanzees are peering exactly in the opposite direction. This creates a tension, but also symbolizes that they are different in nature.\nThe couple’s serious expression and the way the chimpanzees hold tight to them allow this image to deliver quite a punch. The image shows something that no doubt during that time caused some sort of revolt – an interracial couple – and an elegant, good-looking interracial couple to boot. New York in 1964 was the scene of several violent protests, and in 1965 Malcolm X was assassinated. In the same year that Winogrand took this picture, the US Supreme Court overturned laws prohibiting interracial marriage. The odd thing about this image is that it managed to offend both those who supported discrimination and those who tried to abolish it.\nSally Mann – Candy Cigarette – 1989 Sally Mann, Candy Cigarette, 1989 – Image Retrieved from http://www.mocp.org/d\nOf the three images I discuss here, this one is my favorite; it has been of my favorites for a long time. It is so intriguing that is still impossible for me to write something slightly hermeneutical, and honestly, I like it this way.\nThis is an extremely vivid example of how the rule of thirds can be broken. Emmett appears diffused in the background, lonely but free. Virginia has a strong pose, like a mother or an older woman, in the right lower corner. And Jessie, holding that “candy cigarette” almost in the center of the frame, breaks all the prejudices of the thirds.\nHere we have three children: Sally Mann's three children. Her children, her whole world as a mother, split into three parts that cannot be separated in her heart and soul.\nThe background is shallow due to the wide lens aperture, and the tri-dimensional nature of the scene is enriched by it. Jessie gets to be the protagonist of the scene, and her strong character is enhanced by her gesture, her pose, and her sharp presence in the picture.\nWe hope you like these images as much as we do. This way of reading images will help you improve your photographic reading habits. Please share your thoughts, and let us know if you would like more of this kind of stuff.","Railroading and photography grew up together. Only a few years separate the beginning of US railroading in 1827 and the first photographic image—and the iron horse soon became a favorite subject.\nA decade after railroading gained a toehold in America, Louis Daguerre invented the first practical photographic process. Samuel F. B. Morse, a painter better known for his telegraph code, brought the daguerreotype to the US in 1839. An undated view of the 1848 locomotive “Tioga” is among the earliest American railroad photographs.\nRailroads pioneered the field of industrial photography, first as a way to record their locomotives and later to promote travel by rail. Beginning in the 1930s, impressive photo books brought new attention to rail photography. Through the years, the tie between railroading and photography has remained strong, maintained by professionals, railroad companies, and skilled amateurs alike.\nThese examples of railroad—inspired creativity only hint at the 150—year legacy of thousands of talented men and women. The outstanding images suggest how deeply railroading has affected our culture, our visual heritage, and our daily lives.\nRailroading was an agent of change and a powerful tool. With it, men and women reshaped the continent and made our modern existence possible. Those same Americans used and enjoyed photography, both for personal creative expression and as a powerful tool for change and development. The camera and the locomotive grew up together.\nTogether, railroading and photography permit us to look back over the last century and a half and realize how far we have come. But some things do not change. It is safe to assume that for as long as trains rumble through the landscape, folks at trackside will capture the moment with an image.\nWe thank the Donnelley and Lee Library, Lake Forest College, Lake Forest, Illinois, for sharing photographs in the Munson Paddock Collection, and photographers who contributed to the exhibition.\nExhibition Photographs, Chronologically by Photographer\n* – denotes winner of the Railway & Locomotive Historical Society national award for photography.\n- Unidentified: Tioga, built in 1848 for the Philadelphia & Columbia, among the earliest known railroad photos (Smithsonian Institution)\n- Andrew J.

{"question":"When using a voltmeter to test a 12-volt RV battery, what voltage readings indicate different charge levels?","answer":"For a 12-volt battery, a reading of 11.9 volts indicates the battery is totally dissipated, 12.06 volts means it is 25% charged, and you need 12.45 volts or 75% charge to be able to start the engine most of the time.","context":["How to Test RV Deep Cycle Battery? Top 3 Methods are Well Explained\nYou don’t want to be stranded on the side of the road because your battery died. Nor do you want to risk a disaster because you tried to charge a dead battery. This means checking the RV battery’s capacity. We’ll discuss how to test RV deep cycle battery levels in detail for each method and how to stay safe while you do so.\nIf you don’t know how to test RV deep cycle battery, then read on.\nHere are the top 3 methods to test an RV battery\nMethod 01) Monitor Panel\nThis is the simplest method available, though it can be prone to errors since the user can make mistakes and the monitor panel doesn't always read right. It isn't uncommon for a battery level indicator to say 100% when it is rounding up from 80%.\nThe method itself is to look at the dashboard monitor panel while the recreational vehicle is not plugged into an electrical outlet. This will tell you the battery's current level. Disconnect the RV battery from any power source\nIf the level is close to where it was without this load, you know the monitor panel is accurate If the level is somewhat lower, use the lower value as the current indicator of the battery's level. And turn off all these loads once you have your answer so you don't drain the battery.\nMethod 02) Digital Voltmeter\nBefore you do this, know what voltage the battery is After all, a 6 volt battery that reads 6 volts is fully charged whereas a 12 volt battery that reads at 6 volts is dangerously low. Avoid testing a battery that has been charged or discharged in the past six hours.\nHow to Test the Battery using a Digital Voltmeter Make sure your test leads are properly plugged into the voltmeter. The red test lead should be plugged into the voltage (ohm) port while the black lead should be plugged into the \"com\" port.\nPut the red lead on the positive terminal of the battery. Put the black test lead on the negative battery terminal. A digital voltmeter will give you the voltage in numbers. An analog voltage meter will point to the approximate value.\nHow to understand the Result? (Good or Bad)\nFor example, a reading of 11.9 volts on a 12 volt battery means it has totally dissipated. A reading of 12.06 volts means the battery is 25% charged, whereas you need 1245 volts or 75% to be able to start the engine most of the time.\nIf you get a generic error message, retest or replace the batteries in your voltmeter before taking another reading. If charging the battery doesn't improve the voltage levels, the RV battery itself probably needs to be replaced.\nMethod 03) Hydrometer/Specific Gravity\nThe hydrometer technique tests the specific gravity of a battery's electrolyte; in short, a hydrometer test is a specific gravity test of your battery. You can find both manual hydrometers and digital hydrometers for this test.\nNote that you can't get an accurate reading via this method if you just added water to the battery; let it sit for at least six hours before you check the battery with the hydrometer technique.\nThis method is an option if you aren't sure how to check the battery level with a voltmeter or just don't have one A benefit of this approach is price — you can find hydrometers for a couple of dollars and get it at almost any auto parts store.\nHow to check RV battery using Hydrometer?\nThis test method requires you to put on protective gear and open up the battery. This isn't possible if you have a sealed maintenance-free battery. Nor should it be done while the battery is hot, since you don't want acid-laced steam escaping from the battery and hitting you in the face.\nSuppose to understand Easily\nSuppose the battery is cool and you're wearing the proper safety gear. The electrolyte will typically be in two different levels, an upper level and a lower level.\nFill the hydrometer and drain it twice before you take a reading. This helps clear out any moisture or residue in the hydrometer that count the results. Now test the specific gravity of the electrolyte in one cell.\nIf you're using American units, 1.225 to 1.250 is suitable, and anything heavier is ideal. Anything lighter than this indicates a problem. Once you have the reading, drain the electrolyte into the cell it came from. Then repeat the process on the other cell.\nThe Final Step of your hydrometer test\nAfter you test all the cells and record the values, replace the vent covers. If the readings of all the cells averages to less than 1277, the battery needs to be charged. If the readings between cells has a difference of more than 0.050 (between the highest and lowest), the lowest cell is either weak or dead. This suggests the battery needs to be replaced.\nYou May Also Like_\n- How to Avoid Deep Cycle Battery Explosion? – Read Expert’s 7 Things\n- Where Can I Park My RV Long Term Near Me? – Read Experts Things\n- How to Maintain an RV Generator Like an Expert?– 10 Cleaning Tips\n- What is An RV?

{"question":"How do Colin Firth's and Anthony Hopkins' Oscar successes in biographical roles compare?","answer":"Colin Firth won an Oscar in 2011 for his biographical portrayal of King George VI in The King's Speech, competing against performances like Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network. In comparison, Anthony Hopkins has won two Best Actor Academy Awards, though only one was for a biographical role - his more recent win came for The Father in 2020, while his earlier win was for The Silence of the Lambs in 1991.","context":["Once again actors appearing in Bio-Pics or films based on a true story have swept the Oscar nominations for the 88th Academy Awards.\n4 of the 8 best pictures fall into this category, and 12 of the 20 actors have been nominated for playing real people.\nRepresentations of famous lives were a popular theatrical staple long before the arrival of cinema. William Shakespeare’s historical output, which included plays on Julius Cesar, Henry IV, Henry V, Richard III and Anthony and Cleopatra did not let the facts get in the way of a good story.\nYet despite accusations from critics that bio-pics are sensationalist, distorted or formulaic, viewers and award voters still embrace them.\nThe first bio-pic to sweep up multiple awards was David Lean’s epic Lawrence of Arabia (1962) starring Peter O’Toole as T.E. Lawrence. Other multiple award-winning films: A Man for All Seasons (1966), Gandhi (1982), Amadeus (1984), Out of Africa (1985), The Last Emperor (1987), Schindler’s List (1993), Braveheart (1995), A Beautiful Mind (2001), The King’s Speech (2010) and 12 Years a Slave (2013). Not only are these all bio-pics, but they are also all bio-pics of heroes and/or those who have triumphed over great adversity.\nFor the actor in question, they are often called to play a range of ages, emotions while directors can capture a range of moods and tones. These facts, coupled with extremes of emotion and issues such as mental illness, has seen a high number of bio-pic related Oscar wins and nominations.\nThe Academy Awards, although not necessarily a marker of a film’s quality, serves as a useful barometer against which one can gauge both public and industry approval of a film. Bio-pics have, understandably, been a consistent presence in the acting categories. This is a tradition that began in 1929 when George Arliss picked up an Oscar for his portrayal of Benjamin Disraeli in Disraeli (1929).\nTracing mere recent nominations and wins it is clear how important this genre has become in mainstream cinema.\nIn 2005 three of the four actors nominated in the Best Actor category were for portrayals of real people. The award went to Jamie Foxx for his portrayal of Ray Charles in Ray, beating off Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes in The Aviator, Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina in Hotel Rwanda, and Johnny Depp as J M Barrie in Finding Neverland.\nIn 2006 Philip Seymour Hoffman swooped up the award for his portrayal of Truman Capote in Capote, beating off two other bio-pic nominees, Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash in Walk the Line and David Strathairn as Ed Morrow in Good Night, and Good Luck. In the Best Actress category Reese Witherspoon won for performance of Cash’s wife June Carter in Walk the Line despite being up against tough bio-pic alumni, Judi Dench as Mrs Henderson in Mrs. Henderson Presents and Charlize Theron for Josey Aimes in the ‘based on a true story’ North Country (both previous bio-pic Oscar winners with Iris and Monster respectively).\nAt award ceremonies across the globe in 2007, Forest Whitaker and Dame Helen Mirren were busy filling their mantelpieces with trophies (including Oscars) for their roles of Idi Amin in The Last King of Scotland and Queen Elizabeth II in The Queen.\nSo popular were bio-pics in 2008 that even foreign language films were being represented. Marion Cotillard won for her portrayal of Edith Piaf in La Vie en Rose, whilst director Julian Schnabel was nominated for The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. Interestingly it was also a year of firsts with Cate Blanchett being nominated in both Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress categories for her roles as Elizabeth I in Elizabeth: The Golden Age and Bob Dylan in I’m Not There. Also the first time a woman was cast and nominated for playing a man.\nTrue to recent form 2009 saw two acting giants going head-to-head with their portrayals of real-life political legends: Sean Penn as Harvey Milk in Milk triumphing over Frank Langella as Richard Nixon in Frost/Nixon.\nIn 2010 Morgan Freeman received a nod for his role of Nelson Mandela in Invictus, and Sandra Bullock won for the semi-autobiographical The Blind Side. Bullock’s competition included Helen Mirren playing Sophia Tolstaya (Mrs Tolstoy) in The Last Station and Meryl Streep for Julia Child in Julie & Julia.\nIn 2011 Colin Firth won for his portrayal of King George VI in The King’s Speech, beating off Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network and James Franco as Aron Ralston in 127 Hours.\nIn 2012 Brad Pitt missed out on winning for his role of Billy Beane in Moneyball, Meryl Streep won for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady and Michelle Williams was nominated for her Marilyn Monroe in My Week with Marilyn. 2013 saw Daniel Day-Lewis pick up his third Oscar for Lincoln, his second for a bio-pic, having won in 1989 for My Left Foot.\nThe 2014 award season featuring films from 2013/14 was once again a who’s who of screen who’s whos with three of the five actors nominated for Bio-Pics Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup in 12 Years a Slave, Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street, with the award going to Matthew McConaughey for his performance as Ron Woodroof in Dallas Buyers Club. All five Best Supporting Actors were nominated for playing real people. Barkhad Abdi in Captain Phillips, Bradley Cooper in American Hustle, Michael Fassbender in 12 Years a Slave, Jonah Hill in The Wolf of Wall Street and Jared Leto in Dallas Buyers Club.\nAnd finally, in 2015 Eddie Redmayne picked up with the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of\nStephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, beating off competition from Steve Carell in Foxcatcher as John Eleuthère du Pont, Bradley Cooper in American Sniper as Chris Kyle and Benedict Cumberbatch in The Imitation Game as Alan Turing.\nThis trend of award wins proves that without doubt films examining the lives of real people whether they are singers, politicians, entrepreneurs, directors or writers are a staple part of the filmic output of the industry.\nExtracts from Bio-Pics: A Life in Pictures by Ellen Cheshire, published by Columbia University Press","The Oscars are considered the most significant and prestigious of all awards in the entertainment industry. The AMPAS presents the awards – Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences – every year and recognizes the achievements of nominees and the winners through an internal assessment of the Academy’s voting members.\nThe golden statuettes were first presented way back in 1929 by Douglas Fairbanks in a dinner that he privately hosted at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. This later became the first Academy Awards. Before the invention of television, station stations broadcasted the event. Today, however, the Oscar Award Ceremony is broadcast live globally. It is among the four oldest major American entertainment awards for television, theatre, and music. The other three would be The Emmys, The Tonys, and The Grammys.\nSince its inception in 1929, over 3,000 Oscars have been handed to winners in various categories. Here are some actors who have won the most Oscars ever!\nShe won her first Oscar for her performance in her first film, Morning Glory, which came out in 1933. Moreover, she won second and third Oscars in the 1960s for Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner and The Lion in Winter.\nShe won her fourth and final Oscar Award in 1981 for the film On Golden Pond at the 54th Academy Awards. Katharine Hepburn received a total of 12 nominations at the Oscars. All awards she received were for the Best Actress category. No other actor or actress has received this honor in the history of the awards.\nIn 1979 Meryl Streep won the ‘Best Supporting Actress’ award for her role in Kramer vs. Kramer. She then in 1982 bagged the ‘Best Actress Award’ for Sophie’s Choice. In 2011 she won again for The Iron Lady. In total, Meryl Streep received 21 nominations and won 3 awards.\nJack’s first win for ‘Best Actor’ was for his film One Flew Ove the Cuckoo’s Nest in 1975. He again received the Oscar for best actor in 1997 for the movie As Good as it Gets. He is also the recipient of best supporting actor for his role in Terms of Endearment in 1983.\nFrances McDormand is an actor as well as a film producer. She received three Academy Awards for acting. One for Fargo in 1996, next for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri in 2017, and the third for her performance in Nomadland in 2020. She also received a fourth Academy Award for ‘Best Picture’ for Nomadland. This makes her the first to win an Academy Award for both producing and performing in the same film.\nThe actor has won two Best Actor Awards. The first was for The Silence of the Lambs in 1991 and the other for The Father in 2020.\nTom Hanks won his first for his outclass performance in Philadelphia in 1993 then for Forrest Gump in 1994. Both his awards were for the ‘Best Actor’ category.\nApart from Tom Hanks and Anthony Hopkins, many other actors have also won two Academy Awards. Some prominent names include Betty Davis, Marlon Brando, Spencer Tracy, Jane Fonda, Dustin Hoffman, Elizabeth Taylor, and Jodie Foster."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ea5d8848-80fc-41d8-9c42-3893b026e1c2>","<urn:uuid:c52b6259-a168-4f65-9921-5d520d4e3ab2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What similarities exist between Venice's historical marketing of spices and Al Tiramisu's modern presentation of Italian cuisine?","answer":"Both demonstrate innovative approaches to presenting and marketing Italian culinary traditions. Venice pioneered marketing strategies by creating demand for spices and invented convenient packaging with their 'Venetian bags' of pre-mixed spices. Similarly, Al Tiramisu offers an elevated approach to authentic Italian cuisine, presenting traditional dishes in modern ways, such as serving Tuscan tomato soup in individual-portion glasses for contemporary presentation. Both entities focus on creating unique culinary experiences - Venice through its spice trade and Al Tiramisu through its warm, cozy atmosphere that makes dining feel like a trip to Italy.","context":["Built on land, isolated from the waters of the lagoon, without being able to cultivate wheat and wheat, nor “anything at all to the human lives”, Venice has nevertheless held a primary position in the art of gastronomy for centuries.\nBy virtue of necessity, the Venetians quickly become skilled merchants, to obtain those primary goods that were not there in the Lagoon, but what was originally meant to be a simple source of subsistence soon turns into a source of income, as they begin to import from distant markets not only wheat and wheat but also spices, sugar and other culinary goods unknown in Europe.\nIn advance of several centuries Venice soon senses the potentiality of these goods and literally invents marketing, realizing that in order to be able to sell a product well, it is necessary to create demand and not to wait for it to form itself. This is why Venice itself “invents” the luxury of spices. But not only that, always ahead of the times, he also invented the packaging, putting on the market the famous “Venetian bags”, that is mixed spices already packaged and ready for use!\nA direct heir to the Byzantine and Roman tradition, lagoon gastronomy is one of the first to confront other cuisines in the world: from Muslim to Austro-Hungarian cuisine, passing through Spanish and French cuisine. These are encounters that arise from the coexistence with the Islamic populations on the markets of the Levant and from the confrontation with the foreign minorities present in the city since the earliest times.\nBetween the fourteenth and sixteenth century new and significant new products add to this basic richness: from the icy waters of the northern seas comes the codfish, alias stockfish, an authentic culinary revolution, in an era when there is no refrigerator.\nIn an already privileged situation, the Renaissance invests Venice with all its innovative energy, and how could it be different in a city that can use all the weapons of seduction, including that of food, refined and luxurious, sending messages of political power to foreign guests gifts by tramortandoli with rivers of spices, sugar and gold leaves on oysters?\nBut the real greatness of Venice was to know how to get out of the kitchens and to get to the libraries, which then means going out of the ephemeral dimensions to stay in the centuries. A unique case in the whole peninsula, here is developed a great gastronomic publishing with the publication of recipes, translations of dietary books from Arabic and Greek, agricultural treatises and travel reports that inform about the discovery of new products.\nThe end of the sixteenth century brought to a close the age of dishes buried by a mountain of spices, and the wind of new modern tastes brought by the French came to Venice. The consumption of luxury takes other roads, and for Venetian merchants it no longer makes sense to fill the holds of ships with those spices that have made their fortune. But the patricians certainly do not lose heart and recycle themselves by taking the mainland road, with major land reclamation, agricultural investments, and the cultivation of those first fruits that revolutionize the Veneto region in the form we still see today.\nBetween inns and finger food, enlightened chocolates and French chefs, we reach the eighteenth century. The Republic is extinguished but not the gastronomy, which is tempered by the Central European tastes imported from Austrians. The first bourgeois recipes of the 19th century are printed and the cuisine is internationalised.\nIn the twentieth century, linked with a concrete and iron bridge to the mainland, Venice lost its insularity. The tourist replaces the traveller, the bacari are transformed into bars all the same, the cicchetto all too often leaves room for pizzas and frozen sandwiches.\nThe invasion of globalized taste does not however cancel the good Venetian cuisine, which remains perched in a few rooms and in the intimate dimension of the house.","Award-Winning Chef and Restaurateur Luigi Diotaiuti, Launches The Al Tiramisu Restaurant Cookbook\nBy Mel Fabrikant Tuesday, January 14 2014 @ 04:35 PM EST\nDining at Al Tiramisu restaurant, located in the heart of Washington, DC, is like taking a trip to Italy without leaving the country. The award-winning restaurant is cozy, warm, and joyful—reflecting the effervescent and playful personality of Chef and owner Luigi Diotaiuti.\nNow Chef Luigi lets home cooks everywhere experience his Italian culinary heritage and favorite recipes with his new book, THE AL TIRAMISU RESTAURANT COOKBOOK: An Elevated Approach to Authentic Italian Cuisine, a collection of 100 of the restaurant’s most popular recipes. The book is also part culinary memoir taking readers from Chef Luigi’s birthplace in Basilicata, Italy, to kitchens in Sardinia, Paris, Venice, Tuscany and ultimately Washington DC.

But as a teacher at heart I also enjoy sharing my knowledge and discoveries with others, whether it’s my staff, guests, students in my cooking classes, or audiences on television and radio programs,” Luigi explains. “In that vein, I also offer culinary tips in these pages that I accumulated over my long career. I share advice on selecting top quality products and where to buy them, and on using authentically Italian cooking techniques.”\n“But the heart and soul of this book are my treasured recipes. Each recipe is special to me and starts with a bite-size memory of an event, person, or emotion that the dish evoked. They are culled from family recipes and from those of friends and colleagues in far-off places. Many appeared on the very first Al Tiramisu menu in 1996 and remain on the menu today. Others I have created more recently and I am very excited to present them in my book.” Some of Chef Luigi’s treasured recipes he shares in the book include:\n- Sausage and Mascarpone Crostini\n- Swordfish Carpaccio\n- Placido Domingo’s Antipasto Platter\n- Tuscan Swiss Chard and Spinach Filled Crepes\n- Cream of Chestnut Soup with Herb-Coated Goat Cheese Quenelles\n- Shrimp and Cranberry Bean Salad\n- Vegetable Terrine with Red Pepper and Leek Coulis\n- Country-Style Morning Vegetable Fritatta\n- Fava Beans with Chicory\n- Lagane Pasta with Beans and Chestnuts\n- Radicchio and Ricotta Gnocchi with Sweet Gorgonzola\n- Grilled Sea Bass with Asparagus and Potatoes\n- Tuna with Onion in Parmigiano-Reggiano Cups\n- Stuffed Swordfish Involtini\n- Classic Tiramisu\n- Bread with Chocolate, Fleur del Sel, and Olive Oil\n- Chocolate Mousse with Candied Orange Peel\n- Yogurt Panna Cotta with Strawberry Coulis\nEach recipe is followed by an Italian Cooking Primer giving home cooks interesting background information and chef tips along with a Sommelier’s Pick of recommended wine to serve with the dish.\n“The food that arrives at your table at Al Tiramisu directly reflects who I am. Food has always been central to my life, starting with my childhood on our family farm, where our lives and livelihood revolved around food. Food, culture, and history are all connected in my view and traditional recipes reflect a people, a place and a time. They mirror historic events —invasions, catastrophes, deprivation, excesses—and even express a community’s manner of celebrating or mourning. Fundamentally, they reflect the rapport between humans and Mother Nature at a given moment in time. I believe we must respect our traditions, and doing so is an important part of my mission at Al Tiramisu and what I hope to share with others who love to cook through my book.”\nTake a culinary journey to countryside of Italy and bring Chef Luigi’s refreshing tastes of his homeland to your dining table.\n“My wife Jean and I have enjoyed Al Tiramisu for more than a decade. Luigi Diotaiuti always makes us feel at home. Now with this book, we have a fuller window into Luigi’s life – and success.”\n-Steve Case, former chief executive officer, AOL; chair of Case Foundation\n“Chef Luigi’s story is a wonderful example of how vision, dedication, and selflessness results in excellence. Blessed with an abundance of passion, culinary skill and great character, he has truly achieved the American dream. Remembering his roots and upbringing in Italy, Chef Luigi has become one of the very best in his profession.”\n-Gen. Raymond T.

So popular is this dish that it inspired a hit song in the 1960s called “Viva la pappa al pomodoro!” sung by Italy’s beloved recording star Rita Pavone. One of the original “green” recipes, pappa al pomodoro was traditionally made by frugal casalinghe, or housewives, to make use of leftovers. Today this homey and satisfying dish is found on the menus of Florence’s trendiest restaurants and is craved by Italian ex-pats around the globe. Its flavors intensify as it sits so it’s a good option for a buffet table. Pour it into individual-portion glasses for an original and modern presentation. Serve it hot or at room temperature.\nNote that you will need good Italian bread that is at least two days old, as well as the end rind of either Parmigiano-Reggiano or Pecorino Romano cheese.\n4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided\n5 garlic cloves, minced\n2 cups tomatoes, peeled and chopped or pureed\n10 basil leaves, shredded\n1 cup good quality Italian bread (at least 2 days old), cut into 1-inch pieces\n3 ounces rind from a wedge of Parmigiano-Reggiano or Pecorino Romano cheese Salt\n4 cups vegetable stock\nHeat 2 tablespoons of oil in a medium saucepan over medium high heat. Add garlic. When it is golden, add the tomatoes and cook for 4 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend.\nAdd basil, bread, cheese rind, and a pinch of salt. Stir well. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer.\nStir every 10 minutes, adding 1 cup of stock at a time. Be sure to stir firmly from the bottom to prevent sticking. Cook until soup is thick and has a uniform consistency, about 40 minutes.\nBefore serving, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a small saucepan over low heat.\nWhen soup is ready, remove the cheese rind, stir, and drizzle hot olive oil over the top. Serve warm or cold.\nItalian Cooking Primer\nLeftover bread and cheese are the basis of many Italian home-style dishes. Bread that is a few days old can be used to make bread crumbs or croutons. You can soak it in milk and add it to ground meat to tenderize meatballs, or mix it with other ingredients to create croquettes or bread puddings. Add cheese rinds to sauces, soups and stews for extra richness, flavor, and complexity.\nEscarole Heart Salad with Ricotta Salata and Anchovies\nCuori di scarola in insalata con ricotta salata\nThis pretty salad gets its unusual flavor and texture from the salted ricotta and anchovies, a combination long enjoyed in southern Italian cuisine. I’m happy to see that these ingredients are now being used and appreciated on a wider scale, as cooks discover their versatility and ability to add zing to many recipes. One of the specialty cheeses of Basilicata, ricotta salata is a variety of ricotta that has been pressed, salted, and dried.\nAs a child, this is one of the first cheeses that I helped my parents Rosina and Biagio make. We used fresh milk from our cows and goats, and to coagulate the milk we mixed in rennet from baby goats that had not yet grazed – the purest form possible. It was not unusual for us to make 20 baskets of tangy, creamy ricotta a day.\n2 medium heads of escarole, cleaned\nJuice of 1 lemon\n1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil\n12 anchovy fillets packed in oil, drained and finely chopped\n1/4 cup toasted pine nuts\n1 roasted red pepper, julienned\n4 ounces (1/2 cup) shredded ricotta salata, crumbled\nRemove the green outer leaves of the escarole and separate the white inner (harder) leaves for use in this recipe. Cut them into 2-inch pieces. (Remaining leaves can be stored and tossed into a soup, if desired.)\nIn a bowl, add lemon juice, oil, and the anchovy fillets, and whisk vigorously to obtain emulsified vinaigrette.\nIn a medium size bowl, combine the escarole and vinaigrette and toss well.\nDistribute salad onto serving plates and top with pine nuts, roasted red pepper slices, and ricotta salata.\nITALIAN COOKING PRIMER\nEscarole is a member of the endive family, yet it has a less bitter flavor. It can be eaten raw or cooked, and is most commonly used in soups, salads, pasta and side dishes. Note that since this recipe has a pronounced lemon base, wine is not recommended.\nTHE AL TIRAMISU RESTAURANT COOKBOOK:\nAn Elevated Approach to Authentic Italian Cuisine\nby Luigi Diotaiuti\nDecember 2013/ www.AlTiramisu.com"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6da0eca0-f5c8-4da2-a01d-2a5826349331>","<urn:uuid:b6e2e979-8903-40b8-9452-3557fb107a26>"],"error":null}
